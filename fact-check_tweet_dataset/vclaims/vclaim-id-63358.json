Since then, politics has taken over the humanitarian crisis. On May 17, Outlook reported that 500 buses were stuck at the state border waiting for UP government\u2019s approval. On May 19, The Print reported that UP government asked for fitness certificates, insurance documents of buses and drivers.\n\nIn the backdrop of the controversy, BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra tweeted, \u201cWhile bringing students from Kota to UP, some buses by UP [government] needed diesel\u2026 forget aid\u2026 Priyanka Vadra\u2019s Rajasthan government made UP government pay Rs 19,76,286 at midnight and then allowed the buses to leave. Wow, what help. #TwoFaced_Congress.\u201dThe tweet included an image of a cheque, dated May 5, for a sum of approximately Rs 19 lakhs. The cheque was placed on an official document.

His tweet was retweeted 300 times (archive link).\n\n\n\nSambit Patra alleged that Rajasthan government made UP government pay Rs 19 lakhs at midnight before allowing buses filled with students from Kota to leave.\n\n\n\nIn April, several media outlets reported the plight of students stranded in Kota, Rajasthan\u2019s education hub. As per Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation (RSRTC) documents, between April 1 and May 14, 16 trains carried over 18,196 students to Jharkhand and Bihar and 1,057 buses carried over 28,761 students from to Kota to other states including districts in Rajasthan. (View PDF)\n\nIn order to understand the logistics involved in sending students from Kota to their respective states, Alt News spoke with Om Kasera, district collector of Kota and Naveen Jain, chairman and managing director of, Jaipur. According to them, over 12,000 students travelled in buses from Kota to UP on April 17, 18, 19. The bus service was a collaborative effort by both the state governments.\n\nThe RTGS/ NEFT cheque of Rs 19,76,286 from Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) posted by Patra was drafted on May 5 \u2014 16 days after buses from Kota left on April 19. Thus, his claim that the Rajasthan government made the UP government pay Rs 19 lakhs at midnight before allowing buses filled with students to depart is false.\n\nJain shared a bank statement of RSRTC that confirmed RTGS transaction of Rs 19,76, 286 by UPSRTC on May 6.\n\nA day after Patra\u2019s tweet, Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma held a press conference and clarified that UPSRTC initiated the payment of Rs 19 lakhs to RSRTC on May 5 for buses sent in April, which clarifies further that the buses weren\u2019t stopped for the Rs 19 lakh dues.\n\nOn May 22, Alt News tried contacting Patra for a statement. Despite multiple calls, a WhatsApp text and an SMS, he is yet to respond. We also tried to speak with Raj Shekar, MD UPSTRC. He too is yet to respond. However, we managed to speak with an official from UPSTRC who visited Kota for a period two days between April 17 and 19. The USRTC official said, \u201cRSRTC offered full cooperation and met the demand by UPSRTC to refuel the buses promptly.\u201d\n\nHow UP and Rajasthan governments worked together to send students from Kota to UP: A chronology\n\nKasera shared a state-wise summary on the number of buses that took over 28,000 students from Kota to their respective states between April 17 and May 14. As per the second page in the document (screenshot attached below), over 12,000 students were from UP and 411 buses were required in total to ensure they reached their native states.\n\n\u201cA majority of state governments sent their buses to pick the students. While some states also opted to hire private buses possibly because there were smaller groups of students from those states. Since there was a disproportionately large share of students from UP, there were some logistical hurdles which were subsequently tackled effectively through prompt decision making by both the governments,\u201d said Kasera who also made it explicitly clear that Rajasthan government didn\u2019t charge any student for the bus service.\n\nJain received three letters from his counterpart Raj Shekar, managing director UPSRTC. In a letter on April 17, UPSRTC requested RSRTC to refuel (diesel) 120 litres/bus in 150 buses travelling from Agra to Kota.\n\nNext day two letters by the UPSRTC requested the RSRTC for three points of action \u2014 refuel 60 litres/bus for 100 buses arriving from Jhansi; additional buses arriving from Agra (50) and Jhansi (20) needed to be refuelled 120 litres/bus and requested 75 buses from Rajasthan government to ensure remaining students from Kota reach UP. The letter requested RSRTC to inform about the cost of diesel so that funds can be transferred via RTGS (real-time gross settlement) as soon as possible.\n\nBoth the governments expedited the process of sending the students from Kota to UP on April 17, April 18 and April 19. Other than the buses arranged as part of the bilateral state government initiative, certain students hired a private bus service and travelled on May 14.\n\n\n\n\u201cOnly the buses that operated from April 17 to 19 were provided by the state governments. Out of this, 309 buses were from UPSRTC and the remaining 94 were from the RSRTC. And the buses were refuelled as per the need of the hour,\u201d said Kasera after referring to the records available with him.\n\nOn April 27, UPSRTC requested RSRTC to share the details of their total expenses.\n\nSubsequently, RSRTC sent two invoices to UPSRTC \u2014 the cost of fuel for the buses which was around Rs 19 lakhs and the operation cost involved in running 94 buses from Kota to UP which was Rs 36 lakhs. The cost of hiring RSRTC buses was in accordance with the tariff fixed in 2017. (View PDF)\n\nJain shared another bank statement of RSRTC which showed that UPSRTC paid Rs 36 lakhs on May 20.\n\nThat same day, Press Trust of India also tweeted, \u201cUP govt clears Rs 36 lakh bill sent by Rajasthan govt for return of students from Kota: Official.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
