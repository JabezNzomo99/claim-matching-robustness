You would expect they did if you saw a news article titled \"Russia And China Roll Out 100% Gold-Backed Currency\" but you would be wrong.\n\nIn fact an article was published by YourNewsWire with just that title on March 25, 2018 (archived here) which opened:\n\nRussia and China have outlined plans to create a 100 percent gold-backed currency system to replace the US dollar as the world's dominant currency. The Central Bank of Russia has been steadily amassing vast gold reserves since 2015 - accumulating 1,828.56 tons by the end of 2017 - making it the fifth largest gold reserve in the world. Goldtelegraph.com reports: Russia has been aggressively increasing its gold reserves for a reason. It has seen the US dollar dominate as a global currency and is working with China to end the US/Western currency supremacy. Their strategy appears to be working. Russia and China are in the midst of rumors of introducing gold-backed futures to circumvent the U.S dollar.\n\nSo right away the article backpedals from the headline. From \"roll out\" it becomes \"outlined plans\". And by the fourth paragraph it is only \"rumors\" about \"gold-backed futures\". Quite the difference from rolling out a new currency. The article doesn't even mention a name for this supposed new currency which would probably be one of the first things potential investors would want to know about in order to ask around about buying it...\n\nInvestors who saw only this summary on social media might have gotten away with the wrong impression:\n\nWe wrote about yournewswire.com and the often inaccurate stories they publish before, here are our most recent articles about them:\n\u2022 Fake News: NOT Busted, Soros Did NOT Pay March For Our Lives Protestors $300 Each\n\u2022 Fake News: Pope Francis Did NOT Forgive 4,444 Pedophile Priests In Australia\n\u2022 Fake News: Obama Did NOT Announce Bid To Become UN Secretary General\n\u2022 Fake News: Judge Did NOT Cut Pedophile's Prison Term Claiming 3-Yr-Old Asked To Be Raped\n\nYourNewsWire has published several other hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt.
