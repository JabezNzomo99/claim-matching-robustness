The post was flagged by Facebook users as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media website\u2019s efforts to curtail fake news.\n\nWhile this post appears on several other websites, ConservativeFlashNews.com indicates that they \"cannot make any warranties about the completeness, reliability and accuracy of this information.\" There is no immediately apparent way to contact the site.\n\nThe story, which is fake, said Starr was flying to Washington when his plane crashed in Wilkershire, Md. \u2014 a town that, as far as we can tell, does not exist. The post said five people were killed in the crash.\n\nThe post also said that Starr was going to testify before \"special investigative committee that has recently found itself investigating crimes from the 1990s,\" led by U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C.\n\nThere is no such committee, but Gowdy\u2019s name likely was invoked because he was chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi. That committee submitted its final report in July 2016.\n\nStarr\u2019s investigation into the Clintons, starting with former deputy White House counsel Vince Foster\u2019s death and the Whitewater land deal, eventually unearthed details of Bill Clinton allegedly lying in a deposition about an affair with intern Monica Lewinsky. The allegations in the Starr Report led to Bill Clinton\u2019s 1998 impeachment.\n\nMore recently, Starr served as president and chancellor of Baylor University, but left amid accusations that he mishandled a sexual assault scandal to protect players on the school\u2019s football team.\n\nAs for the story that he died, its origins have roots in a well-known source of fabricated news. ConservativeFlashNews.com copied the story that appeared on the same date on TheLastLineOfDefense.org. The post featured a photograph of a real fatal plane crash during a 2015 air show in England.\n\nThe site has been the source of several fake news stories that we\u2019ve previously checked. As is the case here, TheLastLineOfDefense.org\u2019s posts end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without attribution about its origin.\n\nTheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn\u2019t indicate that this or any other story is fake, but its About Us link notes that \"all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.\"\n\nThere have been no real reports that Starr has died, and the story came from a known purveyor of contrived news stories.\n\nWe rate this statement Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
