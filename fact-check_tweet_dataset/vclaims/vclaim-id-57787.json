The claim is misleading; a spokesperson for India\u2019s Tiruppur Police told AFP the video was staged for a police drill during the coronavirus pandemic; the video has previously circulated in media reports about a police drill in Tiruppur district.\n\nThe video was published here on Facebook on April 24. 2020. It has been viewed more than 9,200 times and shared more than 270 times.\n\nThe two-minute 18-second video shows police forcefully detaining people before putting them into a vehicle which is carrying a person on a stretcher.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Thai caption translates to English as: \u201cIn India, people who don\u2019t wear masks are put into a van that has COVID-19 patient (Police were pretended to be a patient).\u201d\n\nAs of May 5, 2020, India reported more than 1,500 deaths and almost 33,000 cases of COVID-19, according to Indian Ministry of Health figures. In an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19, the country has also been in a state of nationwide lockdown since Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s announcement on March 25, 2020.\n\nComments from some Facebook users on the misleading post indicated they believed the video shows a real police incident.\n\nOne person wrote: \"This is good, they deserved it\".\n\nAnother said: \"I want Thailand to do something similar to this It's so satisfying!!! LOL.\"\n\nAnd one Facebook user wrote: \"They knew it was dangerous but they didn't realise. There are people like this everywhere in the world.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the some of the comments with names redacted by AFP:\n\nThe video was also shared here, here, here and here on Facebook, alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe video, however, has been shared in a misleading context.\n\nA reverse image search on Google followed by a keyword search found an identical video published here on the YouTube channel for Indian newspaper Hindustan Times on April 24, 2020.\n\nThe video caption states: \u201cTamil Nadu\u2019s Tiruppur police department releases awareness video for lockdown violators. In the promotional video, police can be seen putting lockdown violators with fake Covid-19 patients. This was an enactment video where even the violators were performers. People have been violating lockdown norms amid the coronavirus threat. India is under a nationwide lockdown till May 3 in view of Covid-19.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of keyframes in the video in the misleading post (L) and the Hindustan Times video (R):\n\nDuring a phone conversation on April 27, 2020, Tiruppur Police\u2019s senior officer Jeyachandran said: \"There is no truth that anyone was made to sit with COVID-19 patient. The person in the ambulance was not COVID-19 positive and this whole mock exercise was done only to create awareness that people should sit at home and follow the lockdown rules.\"", "lang": "en"}
