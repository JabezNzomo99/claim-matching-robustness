BOOM has called out the handle several times in the past for sharing misinformation. (Read about it here, here and here )\n\nThe text of the post mocked the Delhi chief minister calling him \n\n'Acharya Arvind Kejriwal' and said, \"He started his journey with fight against corruption & against most corrupt party Congress. But in the end, he is ready to sit in their lap. Poor Anna Hazare got fooled. \"\n\nThe post also claimed Arvind Kejriwal said, \"We are ready to support Congress where they have chances to win.\"\n\nThe video clip has been culled from a speech made by Kejriwal at a gathering of Imams of mosques in Delhi on January 23, 2019. The event was hosted by the Delhi Waqf Board.\n\nContrary to what the post claims, Kejriwal said he did not expect Congress to win a single seat in Delhi and warned against the division of votes in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.\n\nKejriwal's speech was accurately reported by the Press Trust of India on Wednesday in its story - 'Congress Can't Win A Single Seat In Delhi, Says Arvind Kejriwal'.\n\nBelow is an excerpt from PTI's story. Read PTI's story here.\n\n\n\nBOOM was also able to find another video on YouTube of the same speech taken from a different angle. It was uploaded online on the same day the event took place.\n\nWatch the below video from 3 minutes and 11 seconds. Arvind Kejriwal explains the electoral math stating in 2014 Lok Sabha polls the Bharatiya Janata Party got 46% votes, while AAP got 33% votes and Congress 15% votes in Delhi.\n\nAll the pre election surveys are claiming BJP will lose 10% votes, Kejriwal says. And even if these 10% votes go to Congress, BJP will still win seven seats in Delhi but if these seats go to AAP then AAP will win all seven seats, he explains.\n\nThe part about giving Congress seven seats to contest comes at 5 minutes and 20 seconds in the video.\n\nKejriwal says, \"I am willing to go to any extent to defeat Modi and Amit Shah. If I felt that Congress can win seven seats, we would give them seven seats (and tell them) you fight, we will not be contesting. But Congress cannot win, it cannot win a single seat in Delhi.\"\n\nKejriwal's comments about Congress not being able to win a single seat in Delhi has been left out of Shankh Naad's video.\n\nDespite Kejriwal's comments, an alliance between the bitter political rivals has long been speculated and recently got fresh legs after AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan was reported to have said that AAP would support Congress if the next prime minister came from party.", "lang": "en"}
