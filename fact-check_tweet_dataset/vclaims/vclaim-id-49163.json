Let\u2019s check the authenticity of the claim about the video.\n\n\n\nClaim: Video of Italian police taking down a man who has come on to the streets despite lockdown in the country. Fact: The video is from Brazil and it shows Police taking down an alleged knife-wielding-man in Sao Paulo on 19 March. So, the video has nothing to do with Italy and the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were subjected to reverse image search, the same video was found in a tweet put by National Media panelist of BJP urging Police to do the same by announcing lockdown in the country.\n\nBut few users have commented that the video is not of Italy and is that of Brazil. A user in his comment has even enclosed a news report of that incident in the video.\n\nAs per that article on \u2018Hoodsite\u2019 website, on 19 March, Military Police (PM) of Brazil have taken down a miscreant who had allegedly threatened people with a knife at Avenida do Estado in Sao Paulo (Brazil). The Military Police have later arrested him and registered a case on him. So, the video has nothing to do with Italy. The same can also be known from the article of Brazilian news agency \u2018Globo\u2019.\n\nDue to Coronavirus, Italy is in lockdown with restrictions in place since 09 March. Recently, on 22 March, the Italian PM has prohibited any movement in the country as the death toll had exceeded 5000.\n\nTo conclude, a video of Brazilian Police taking down an alleged knife-wielding-man is being shared as \u2018Lockdown in Italy\u2019. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
