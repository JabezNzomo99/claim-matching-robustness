The claim is false; the image shows the lowest-value voucher issued for male students in 2020; the Education Ministry said the values of school uniform vouchers have not changed since 2019.\n\nThis January 8, 2020, post featuring an image of a school uniform voucher issued for the 2020 academic year by the Sri Lankan Education Ministry.\n\nIt has been shared more than 1,200 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post's Sinhala-language caption translates to English as: \u201cHalf of the school uniform voucher has also been dealt with\u2026\u201d\n\nThe Sinhala-language text in the image reads: \u201cOur salute to the herd of sixty nine who got the voucher of 1000 reduced to a 525. Are you comfortable now...\u201d\n\nThe \u201cherd of sixty nine\u201d refers to the 6.9 million votes that were cast for the winning candidate Gotabaya Rajapaksa in the presidential election in November 2019. Here is an AFP report about the election.\n\nThe photo was also shared on Facebook here, here and here, alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; Sri Lankan Education Minister Dullas Alahapperuma said the claim that the values of school uniform vouchers have been reduced \u201cis a complete fabrication\u201d. Another ministry official said the values of the vouchers have not changed in 2020.\n\nIn a media briefing on January 13, 2020, Alahapperuma dismissed the claim that the value of school uniform vouchers had been slashed from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 525. His comments can be viewed here in a video on the YouTube channel for The Independent Television Network, Sri Lanka\u2019s state TV station, from the 13:32 to 14:32 mark.\n\nSpeaking in Sinhala language, the minister says: \u201cThere is a major campaign carried out with a claim that the values of school uniform vouchers given to children have been slashed. This is a complete fabrication.\u201d\n\nSanjeewa Karaliyadda -- spokesman of the Minister of Education, Sports and Youth Affairs -- told AFP via phone on January 17, 2020, that there had not been any reduction of school uniform voucher values in 2020.\n\n\u201cA total of Rs. 1,500 million was allocated to issue school uniform vouchers this year and the vouchers were issued under different value categories depending on the grades, uniform needs as well as for the student monks. Rs. 525 is the value of the voucher issued to boys studying from grades 1 to 5 and the value was set in 2019 under the previous government. The same value has been continued this year for all vouchers,\u201d Kayaliyadda told AFP during the phone conversation.\n\nThe Education Ministry also sent AFP a chart listing the school uniform voucher values from 2016 to 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Sinhala-language chart:\n\nBelow is the translation of the chart in English:", "lang": "en"}
