A Facebook user, Madhav Singh Rajput had pointed out on Namo Again\u2019s post that the video is from Kashmir and is related to the election campaign of BJP candidate Sofi Yousuf.\n\nSofi Yousuf, the candidate from Anantnag, himself had a tweeted a video of the same procession on March 30, 2019. News24 India had also tweeted the video, but the audio is inaudible.\n\nIn conclusion, a video of a BJP candidate\u2019s nomination procession was shared with a false narrative that people of Balochistan openly showed their support for the BJP. According to the MyNeta Database, Sofi Yousuf is contesting the election on a BJP seat for Anantnag Lok Sabha constituency.", "lang": "en"}
