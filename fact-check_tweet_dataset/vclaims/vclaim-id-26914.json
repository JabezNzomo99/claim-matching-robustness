But NHS Digital, which collects the figures, doesn\u2019t know the extent of that double counting and the figure doesn\u2019t factor in how many of these registrations will be from people who only stayed for a short period.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t come from the Lancet, it comes from data collected by NHS Digital and published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nWho is counted in that 6.5 million?\n\nThere were 6.5 million GP registrations between 2007 and 2017 in England and Wales, where the person\u2019s previous address was recorded as being outside of the UK and it was the first time they were registering for a GP here.\n\nBut those records don\u2019t always accurately show whether someone\u2019s previous address was outside the UK.\n\nThe records of these GP registrations have something called a \u201cflag 4\u201d attached. That is intended to mean the person signing up to the GP surgery was previously living overseas. For example they may have been born outside of the UK, entered England or Wales for the first time and then registered at an NHS GP. Similar information is collected in Northern Ireland but data for Scotland is unavailable.\n\nNHS Digital told us that until March 2016, \u201cit was possible for a patient to be registered in one area as flag 4 then move to another area and be registered again as a flag 4\u201d, so migrants who moved around may have been double counted.\n\nNHS Digital also told us that until 2016 if a UK citizen had left the UK for more than three months then came back and registered with a new GP in England and Wales, they would also be counted as a flag 4.\n\nThe ONS says: \u201cA person may register with a GP if they are staying in the UK for at least three months and so flag 4s may include some short-term migrants, which are not included in the population estimates.\u201d Short-term migration is defined as between a three and 12 month stay for work or study.\n\nBecause of that, this measure is not a very good way of finding out how much the population has grown because of immigration.\n\nOther measures suggest fewer than 6.5 million people have migrated here for the long-term between 2007 and 2017\n\nLooking at long-term migration, if you add up the difference between the estimated number of non-British people who arrived in or left the UK in the ten years ending June 2018, it\u2019s about three million. Although because of issues with the data up to 2011, that figure is likely to be an underestimate.\n\nThis is a completely different measure to GP registrations, and looks at a larger area (the UK, rather than England and Wales) and a slightly different time period (the ten years up to June 2018 rather than the ten years up to 2017), than the GP registrations figure did.\n\nWe\u2019ve not counted short-term migration in that, because each year more short-term visits are made from the UK abroad than to England and Wales. That\u2019s been the case since at least 2004.\n\nA different measure also makes the 6.5 million figure look too steep. Looking at the UK population by nationality, the number of non-British residents has grown by an estimated 2.2 million between 2007 and 2017. This figure comes from a survey of UK households, and there\u2019s also reason to think this may be a slight underestimate.\n\nWhere did the link to the Lancet come from?\n\nThe 6.5 million figure has nothing to do with the Lancet medical journal. We think the confusion comes from a misunderstanding about a tweet from Migration Watch last year. The tweet said: \u201cThe decade 2007-17 saw almost 6.5 million new migrant GP registrations. The Lancet medical journal reported (2016) that, \"English primary care as currently delivered could be reaching saturation point.\" The correlation is clear. This level of immigration is unsustainable\u201d.\n\nOther Twitter users later said that the 6.5 million figure came from the Lancet, which is incorrect.\n\nMigration Watch were quoting an article published in the Lancet about the workload of GPs and nurses in England, which doesn\u2019t mention migrants.", "lang": "en"}
