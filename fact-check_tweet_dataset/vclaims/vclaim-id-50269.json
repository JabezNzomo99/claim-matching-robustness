The video has been shared in a misleading context; it has circulated online since at least August 2019 in reports about a typhoon in Shanghai.\n\nThe video was published here on Twitter on July 11, 2020. It has been viewed more than 53,000 times.\n\nThe 12-second video shows a bus filled with water driving through a flooded street. During the video, an announcement in Mandarin can be heard. The words translate to English as: \u201c[We are] about to arrive at Meichuan Road Zhenbei Road, please be prepared to get off the bus\u201d. A passenger is then heard saying: \u201cHow can we get off the bus?\u201d\n\nThe post\u2019s simplified Chinese-language caption translates to English as: \u201cReminder from Shanghai\u2019s bus company: Pay for a bus, enjoy a yacht. A nice trip in Venice with two RMB\u201d.\n\nShanghai, a Chinese municipality located in the country\u2019s southeast, experienced heavy rains in July 2020 as reported by Chinese state media The Paper here and Global Times here.\n\nThe video was also shared here and here on Twitter and here and here on Facebook, alongside a similar claim. Taihang Daily and zynews.cn also shared the video on Douyin, the Chinese version of video-sharing app TikTok.\n\nThe video, however, has been shared in a misleading context.\n\nA keyword search on Weibo found the same video published here on the Weibo account of the Chinese newspaper Shanghai Morning Post, dated August 10, 2019.\n\nPart of the video\u2019s simplified Chinese language caption translates to English as: \u201c#SuperTyphoon\"Lekima\"Landed# Today, a video was widely shared in WeChat Moments, which shows a bus, with a carriage full of water, running on Zhenbei Road-Meichuan Road, as if the bus is \u2018surfing\u2019 in the water.\u201d\n\nMeichuan Road-Zhenbei Road bus station in Shanghai can be found here on Baidu Maps.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading post (L) and the 2019 Weibo video (R):\n\nThe video was also published on the Weibo account of Chinese newspaper Jilin Daily here; as well as here on the Weibo account for the Public Security Bureau of China\u2019s Hedong New District in Suining city.\n\nTyphoon Lekima struck eastern China in the early hours of August 10, 2019, killing at least 44 people, according to this AFP report. In Shanghai alone, more than a quarter of a million people were relocated days beforehand as a precaution.\n\nThe video was also debunked here by Rumor Buster, a fact-checking organisation run by the Shanghai Municipal Internet Information Office and Chinese newspaper Jiefang Daily.", "lang": "en"}
