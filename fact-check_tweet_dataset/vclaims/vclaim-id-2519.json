The use of police cells as a place of safety under mental health legislation more than halved in the last year, from 4,357 in 2014/15 to 2,100 in 2015/16.\n\nThe Mental Health Act 1983 allows the police to detain certain people in \u2018places of safety\u2019 if they show signs of mental health problems and are in immediate need of care or control. There\u2019s been controversy over the extensive use of police cells for this\u2014as opposed to hospitals\u2014in recent years.\n\nThe fall in the last year continues a falling trend over the last five years. Back in 2011 more than a third of all detentions were to a police cell, as opposed to a medical facility. Now 8% are sent to a police cell.\n\nNot all areas follow the trend. In Avon and Somerset, for example, the use of police cells has risen, as has the total number of detentions under the Act.", "lang": "en"}
