He circulated the clip where Khalistan supporters can be heard allegedly saying, \u201cCongress Zindabad, Hindustan Murdabad\u201d. Pradhan questions if Rahul Gandhi and Congress are \u201cPakistanis\u201d.\n\nThat Congress let Khalistan supporters chant anti-India slogans at Rahul Gandhi\u2019s event in London is a piece of misinformation that resurfaces every few months. Alt News has debunked the fake news twice (1, 2) in the past when BJP office bearers also circulated it. Sikh separatists didn\u2019t merely \u201carrive\u201d at Rahul Gandhi\u2019s event but gatecrashed it. The claims on social media misleadingly suggest that the Congress supported the protesters. According to Naomi Canton, who reports for Times of India in the UK, the event was interrupted by four protesters who had \u201cmanaged to evade heavy security to enter Rahul Gandhi\u2019s event\u2026\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to TOI, Shamsher Singh, spokesperson for the National Sikh Youth Federation who had gatecrashed the event with three of his associates said, \u201cWe slipped in through a side door to the venue at 5.30pm as the security was lax. Once inside, security asked us a few questions but we confidently walked through and said we are here for the event. We got a table and sat down.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, television news channels reported that slogans hailing the Congress party were chanted in response to the slogans raised by the Sikh separatists who had gatecrashed the event.\n\nThe clip is viral on both Facebook and Twitter with similar claims.\n\nFrom what it seems, it is also being circulated on WhatsApp.\n\nThe aftermath of the Pulwama attack has witnessed a surge in misinformation where non-BJP parties have been targeted (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) to show them as sympathizers of terrorism.", "lang": "en"}
