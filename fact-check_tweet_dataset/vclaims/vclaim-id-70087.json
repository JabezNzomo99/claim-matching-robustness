In August 2020, 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse walked by police officers after he allegedly shot and killed two people but was not apprehended, even as bystanders tried to alert police. He drove back to his home town and was arrested the next day.\n\nOn Aug. 24, 2020, a white police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was captured on cellphone video shooting Jacob Blake, a Black man, multiple times as he tried to enter his vehicle. Demonstrations against police brutality erupted in Kenosha on Aug. 25, in reaction to Blake\u2019s shooting. These protests spiraled into chaos when white, armed agitators appeared on the streets. Some, like teenager Kyle Rittenhouse, were accused of shootings.\n\nMemes emerged online comparing law enforcement\u2019s treatment of Rittenhouse \u2014 who is white \u2014 to that of Tamir Rice \u2014 a Black boy shot and killed by police in 2014 after his toy gun was mistaken for a real one.\n\nSnopes readers shared versions of these posts with us and asked us to look into their accuracy. While the two scenarios are glaringly different, especially in their outcomes, most of the claims aligned with the facts in each case.\n\nOn Nov. 22, 2014, 12-year-old Rice was fatally shot by a police officer in Cleveland, Ohio. Rice had been playing in a park and posing with a toy gun that fired plastic pellets, according to The New York Times.\n\nPolice received a 911 call that day that there was a \u201cguy in here with a pistol.\u201d But the caller\u2019s complete message that the gun was \u201cprobably fake\u201d and the person holding the gun was \u201cprobably a juvenile\u201d was never conveyed to the officer involved in the shooting.\n\nWithin seconds of arriving at the park, the police officer shot Rice in the abdomen at point-blank range. The officer later said that he warned the boy three times to raise his hands, a claim many have doubted.\n\nOn Aug. 25, 2020, footage showed 17-year-old Rittenhouse firing at protesters with an AR-15-style firearm after being chased in Kenosha. He was not legally old enough to wield an assault rifle in that state.\n\nVideo footage showed police tossing bottles of water to Rittenhouse and other armed white people, telling them: \u201cWe appreciate you guys.\u201d This occurred shortly before the shootings he was later implicated in.\n\nAfter Rittenhouse allegedly shot three people (two fatally), The New York Times reported that \u201cpolice vehicles remained stationary during the gunfire.\u201d Rittenhouse then walked with his hands up towards the police, while bystanders called out to them that he had just shot people. But the police drove by without stopping in order to assist victims.\n\nRittenhouse then drove to his home town of Antioch in Lake County, Illinois, about 20 miles from Kenosha. We can\u2019t confirm if Rittenhouse went home to sleep, but according to reports, he was arrested the next day \u2014 on Aug. 26 \u2014 at his mother\u2019s house.\n\nHe was charged with two counts of reckless intentional homicide and one count of attempted reckless intentional homicide. He was also charged with reckless endangerment and possession of a deadly weapon by a person under the age of 18, according to a criminal complaint. At the time of writing this, Rittenhouse was being held in a juvenile facility in Illinois, while authorities planned to extradite him to Wisconsin.\n\nWhile the majority of the statements presented in the meme are accurate, the contexts are very different. We also could not prove what Rittenhouse did when he returned to his home town before getting arrested. We thus rate this claim as \u201cMostly True.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
