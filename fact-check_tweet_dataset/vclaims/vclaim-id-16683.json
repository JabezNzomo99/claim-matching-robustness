The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nAFWA has found that the claim is misleading. MLA T Raja Singh has no real sister.\n\nThe collage contains a couple of photographs of a woman; in one, she is wearing the hijab.\n\nThere is a watermark of \"Asianet News\" on the image.\n\nOn reverse search, we found that the woman whose picture is being circulated as MLA's sister is Athira, a Hindu woman from Kerala's Kasargod district.\n\nShe had converted to Islam back in 2017 after leaving home. She had changed her name to Ayesha.\n\nThe incident was widely covered by Indian media.\n\nAfter a few months, however, Athira re-converted to Hinduism.\n\nWe found her interview in Malayalam uploaded on the official YouTube channel of \"Asianet news\" back in July 28, 2017.\n\nWe spoke to BJP MLA T Raja Singh, who confirmed that he has no sister named Maya Devi.\n\nThis is not the first time Singh has become the target of such communal mischief.\n\nAccording to an article published in \"The News Minute\", in 2015 he became a victim of a similar propaganda that his niece had converted to Islam.\n\nThen he had filed a complaint with Central Crime Station (CCS) against one Mohammed Aslam Khan and 'The Milli Gazette', an English fortnightly newspaper, for this conspiracy.", "lang": "en"}
