The claim is false -- the original video shows an event at a mosque in Denmark and it has circulated online since at least September 2018.\n\nThe misleading video and claim was posted here on the website of Yeni Safak, a Turkish newspaper, on March 20, 2019.\n\nYeni Safak also shared the video and claim on their official Facebook page here, which has more than nine million followers.\n\nThe caption says in English: \u201cHeartwarming footage shows the touching moment a man from New Zealand converted to Islam, uttering the proclamation of Islamic faith, or Shahadah, during a ceremony at a local mosque, following the Christchurch terror attacks that killed 50 Muslim worshippers.\u201d\n\nMultiple other Facebook pages shared a screenshot of the video and the same claim, for example here on March 20 on a page entitled \u2018Revert to Islam\u2019 which has more than 833,000 followers, and here and here.\n\nThe same video was shared here on March 19 with a caption in Croatian saying: \u201cAnother conversion to Islam in New Zealand\u201d. It has been viewed more than 63,000 times.\n\nThe posts were shared less than one week after 50 worshippers in two mosques were shot dead in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand. An Australian man has been charged over the murders. Here is an AFP report from March 20 about the incident.\n\nBut the original video was actually filmed in the Wakf mosque in Denmark\u2019s capital, Copenhagen.\n\nThe video has circulated online since at least September 30, 2018, when it was posted here on a Facebook page with the caption: \u201cWelcome back our brother from Denmark. Subhanallah AlhamdoAllah for Islam\u201d.\n\nAFP conducted multiple keyword searches on social media in Danish and Arabic for Islamic conversion ceremonies in Danish mosques.\n\nThe searches found multiple videos on the official YouTube channel for the Wakf mosque in Copenhagen which showed the same interior as the video in the misleading Facebook post. The videos can be seen here, here and here.\n\nHere is a screenshot comparison of one of these videos next to the video in the misleading Facebook post:\n\nAn image tagged to the mosque\u2019s location on Google maps also corresponded with the interior of the mosque seen in the video included in the misleading post.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the image:\n\nBilal Assad, press secretary for Islamisk Trossamfund (the Islamic Society in Denmark), which runs the Wakf mosque, said the video was an old clip showing the mosque in Copenhagen.\n\n\u201cWe deeply regret that anyone would use this video out of its context and especially to spread this type of misinformation in the wake of the horrible tragedy in New Zealand.\u201d Assad told AFP in an emailed statement.\n\nUPDATE: On June 11, 2019 Yeni Safak issued a correction on their Facebook page saying: \"It was previously reported that the event took place in New Zealand in the aftermath of the Christchurch mosque terror attack, but has since been corrected to reflect that. Yeni Safak would like to apologize to its readers for this error.\"\n\nThe corrected Yeni Safak post can be seen here on their Facebook page and here on their website.", "lang": "en"}
