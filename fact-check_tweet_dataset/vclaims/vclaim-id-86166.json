Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It\u2019s really a disgrace, what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at what happened in New Hampshire, where thousands of people came up and voted from a very liberal part of Massachusetts, and they came up in buses and they voted. I said, \u2018What\u2019s going on over here?\u2019 My people said, \u2018You won New Hampshire easily, except they have tremendous numbers of buses coming up.\u2019 They\u2019re pouring up by the hundreds, buses of people getting out, voting. Then they\u2019re supposed to go back within 90 days. And of the people that are supposed to go back, almost none of them do. In other words, they go back after the vote is over. They go back \u2014 and I think it\u2019s like 3 percent \u2014 I mean, almost nobody goes back to show that, you know, that they were allowed to vote.\u201d\n\nThis is another fantasy that has been repeatedly debunked. The New Hampshire attorney general\u2019s office investigated this claim after complaints of out-of-state busing in 2014 and found no evidence that out-of-state voters were ever bused into the state to shift the outcome. Instead, some colleges in the state had hired out-of-state buses to help ferry college students to the polls. In other words, the bus company might have been from Vermont, but not the voters on the bus. After the state asked that in-state buses be used, there were no complaints in 2016 \u2014 except from the Trump White House after the president narrowly lost the state to Clinton.\n\nThe president needs to work on his basic math skills. Republicans flipped at least three seats from the Democrats: North Dakota, Indiana and Missouri. But Democrats flipped two: Arizona and Nevada. So that\u2019s a one-seat gain for the Republicans. Assuming Republican Rick Scott holds on to his narrow lead in Florida, the Republicans would have a gain of two. There is a pending runoff in Mississippi, which is already Republican and expected to remain Republican. So the maximum Trump can expect is two seats, not three. (If the Democrat, Mike Espy, manages an unexpected victory in Mississippi, that would be a flip toward the Democrats and Trump would only be plus one seat.)\n\n\u201cAlmost picked up Tester. Almost picked up, you know, if you look \u2014 and that was somebody that wasn\u2019t even in play. \u2026 Tester, nobody wanted even to contest it. Well, look at what happened in North Dakota with Heidi. Heidi, they said don\u2019t contest. One year ago when we were looking, they all said don\u2019t contest Heidi, she can\u2019t be beat. She lost by a lot.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
