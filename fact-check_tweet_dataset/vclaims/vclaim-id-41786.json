In 2015, he was already warning Americans that the country was unprepared for an inevitable infectious virus.\n\nMore recently, he\u2019s become a target for misinformation concerning the pandemic. We\u2019ve debunked several claims, including that he said \"church services can\u2019t resume until we\u2019re all vaccinated,\" that the Gates Foundation paralyzed nearly 500,000 children testing a polio vaccine, and that the foundation has a patent for the coronavirus.\n\nAn image lurking in certain corners of the internet has a similar theme. It shows what looks like the corner of a foundation building, with the words \"Bill & Melinda Gates foundation\" seemingly etched in the facade. Above that? These words: \"Center for Global Human Population Reduction.\"\n\n\"Right out in front for the world to see their plan,\" reads one Facebook post sharing the image.\n\nIt was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe image appears to be a doctored photo of 500 Fifth Ave N., the foundation\u2019s headquarters in Seattle. We searched for that address in Google Maps and found this photo, which shows the foundation\u2019s name and the street number 500, just as it appears in the image on the Facebook post, but without the name of the supposed center.\n\nThe corner of the building is also visible in the Google Maps street view. The \"Center for Global Population Reduction\" marking doesn\u2019t appear on the building.\n\nThe foundation\u2019s 2018 annual report, the most recent available, makes no mention of such a center or even population. We also didn\u2019t find that center searching the foundation\u2019s website.\n\nBut allegations that Bill Gates is wielding vaccines to thin human herds aren\u2019t new. In 2018, for example, we fact-checked a false story that he had a \"plan to depopulate the planet.\" That claim was wrong, and as several other fact-checkers have found, so is this one.", "lang": "en"}
