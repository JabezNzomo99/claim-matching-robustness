He offered this observation in a letter to budget director Mulvaney, insisting that he would continue to request copies of waivers that Trump had granted to former lobbyists appointed to government positions involved in issues they had previously lobbied. Mulvaney later relented and said the Trump administration would not block the inquiry.\n\nWhy is that distinction important? Virtually all federal government employees are hired under \u201cTitle 5\u201d of the U.S. code, but the president is given specific hiring authority for a select group of aides under a different part \u2014 \u201cTitle 3.\u201d So the White House staff logically could be treated differently, which is one reason why the Justice Department decided that the federal anti-nepotism rules for the federal government did not apply to the hiring of Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter.\n\nIf Passantino was actually claiming many rules also did not apply to anyone working in EOP, that would be a sweeping statement. The White House routinely considers itself an agency for OGE\u2019s purposes, such as when it files reports (as Trump has done) on the acceptance of travel expenses from non-Federal sources. But the footnote appears to narrow the issue to the White House office.\n\nBut, for a variety of reasons, dismissing all of those regulations does not make much sense for the White House. Part 2640, for instance, deals with conflicts of interest and Part 2641 concerns post-employment restrictions. And Part 2636 has to do with limitations on outside income. Without those in place, White House officials would not be able to receive waivers for conflicts of interest or possibly obtain jobs after working for an administration, for instance. That might be why the letter did not identify specific regulations that the White House said did not apply to its staff.\n\n\u201cWhen OGE has reason to believe that an employee may have violated the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (Standards of Conduct), OGE is authorized to recommend that the employing agency investigate the matter and consider taking disciplinary action against the employee,\u201d Shaub wrote Feb. 13. \u201cUnder the present circumstances, there is strong reason to believe that Ms. Conway has violated the Standards of Conduct and that disciplinary action is warranted. \u2026 Therefore, I recommend that the White House investigation Ms. Conway\u2019s actions and consider taking disciplinary action against her\u201d and \u201cnotify OGE of the findings of your investigation and any disciplinary or other corrective taken in connection with this matter.\u201d\n\nBut these regulations stemmed from an effort by President George H.W. Bush to harmonize ethical standards across the federal government. (He was reacting to a series of ethical scandals during the Reagan administration.). He issued two executive orders in 1989 and 1990. In 1999, the Executive Office of the President implemented the order by repealing its old standards of conduct and adopted the OGE standards by inserting a cross-reference to the CFR parts 2634 and 2635.\n\nThe notice in the Federal Register said: \u201cBecause the EOP\u2019s Standards of Conduct have been superseded by the new executive branch financial disclosure regulations at 5 CFR part 2634, and by the Standards at 5 CFR part 2635, the EOP is repealing all of its existing 3 CFR part 100. To ensure that employees are on notice of the currently effective ethical standards which apply to them, the EOP is replacing its old standards at 3 CFR part 100 with a residual provision that cross-references 5 CFR parts 2634 and 2635.\u201d\n\nThe plain language of Passantino\u2019s letter is that key ethical standards do apply to the White House staff, as notified by the White House counsel. Passantino is supposed to enforce the ethics rules, and he does not assert directly that the rules did not apply to White House officials. Instead, he said the White House was not \u201can agency\u201d but nonetheless the ethical rules applied to officials working there.", "lang": "en"}
