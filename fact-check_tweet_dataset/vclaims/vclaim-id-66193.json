That I can tell you.\"\n\nTrump downplayed the number of protesters at other points in his 75-minute speech.\n\nBut the president\u2019s narrative was at odds with what TV news viewers had seen for hours leading up to Trump taking the stage. The coverage on national networks showed sizeable crowds out on the streets carrying signs criticizing the president and his response to the Charlottesville, Va., riots ignited by supporters of white supremacist and anti-Semitic groups.\n\nThe Phoenix Police Chief also said there were \"tens of thousands\" of people out on the streets.\n\nHere are the facts.\n\nAs Trump delivered his speech, he sought to spotlight the people inside the convention center, asking cameras to put them on TV \"because it is rather incredible.\" (CNN obliged.)\n\nTrump was also interrupted by a protester inside the convention center as he defended his series of responses to the violence in Charlottesville.\n\n\"Don't bother, it's only a single voice. And not a very powerful voice,\" Trump said. \"How did he get in here? He's supposed to be with the few people outside.\"\n\n\"How about all week they're talking about the massive crowds that are going to be outside. Where are they? Well, it's hot out. It is hot. I think it's too warm,\" Trump said. \"You know, they show up in the helmets and the black masks, and they've got clubs and they've got everything.\"\n\n\"Antifa!\" he shouted, the shorthand term for anti-fascists, which broadly describes far-left-leaning militant groups challenging neo-Nazis and white supremacists.\n\nThe next day, Trump continued boasting about the amount of people who showed up to support him.\n\n\"Phoenix crowd last night was amazing - a packed house. I love the Great State of Arizona. Not a fan of Jeff Flake, weak on crime & border!\" another tweet said.\n\nWe did not get a response from the White House when we requested more information on Trump\u2019s claim of few protesters. We asked the U.S. Secret Service \u2014 which Trump cited as his source of information \u2014 about their estimates of crowd sizes outside the convention center, but did not get a figure.\n\n\"For operational security purposes we do not publicly discuss the methods and means on how we conduct our protective operations,\" said Mason F. Brayman, Assistant Special Agent in Charge for the Secret Service.\n\nLeading up to the rally, Phoenix police chief Jeri Williams said the department would have \"maximum staffing\" and emphasized its experience handling other major events, such as Super Bowls.\n\nIn a press briefing after the events, Williams said there had been \"tens of thousands\" of people downtown. (Trump said he brought 15,000 people into the convention center. The Phoenix Fire Marshal approved capacity up to 19,000 people.)\n\n\"We had tens of thousands of people downtown peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights,\" Williams said. \"What\u2019s unfortunate is that a very small number of individuals chose criminal conduct.\"\n\nAzcentral.com reported that demonstrators outside the convention center \"largely refrained from violence\" throughout the day. That changed after Trump\u2019s speech ended and a few people threw rocks and bottles at police. Police used pepper spray and pepper balls to disperse protesters.\n\nLocal media also said there were thousands of anti-Trump protesters out on the streets. Some photos show protesters held back by barricades outside the convention center where Trump was speaking.\n\nSeveral videos and photo galleries from local media depict the crowds of protesters, which included people advocating for immigrant rights and against hate groups.\n\nFox News \u2014 which Trump singled out as a channel that treats him fairly \u2014 also reported that \"thousands of protesters gathered outside\" the convention center ahead of Trump\u2019s speech. CNN also said thousands of protesters were in attendance.\n\nTrump at a rally in Phoenix said, \"There aren't too many people outside protesting.\"\n\nThousands of people were out on the streets of Phoenix protesting Trump\u2019s speech, according to multiple media accounts and the Phoenix police chief, who said the city\u2019s downtown had \"tens of thousands\" of people exercising their right to free speech.\n\nTrump significantly underestimated crowds in Phoenix.
