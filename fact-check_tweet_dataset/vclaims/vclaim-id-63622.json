The latest addition to this hubbub is the claim that Rajput\u2019s manager Disha Salian was photographed with actor Sooraj Pancholi.\n\nDisha Salian had passed away days before Rajput\u2019s death on June 14. Social media grapevine linked Salian\u2019s death with Pancholi who has been surrounded by controversies ever since his girlfriend and actor Jiah Khan died by suicide in 2013.\n\nOn August 5, Twitter account @KanganaOffical, a parody account with 25,000 followers, had posted an image claiming that Pancholi lied about never meeting Salian. Its tweet said, \u201cPancholi said he doesn\u2019t knew [know] Disha. He Never Met Her In His Entire Life. #SCForSushant\u201d. This has been retweeted over 1000 times (archived link). Other Twitter usersalso posted the image with an identical claim.\n\nScreenshot of this tweet and similar posts were spotted on Facebook.\n\nIn the wee hours of August 5, Pancholi made a post on Instagram refuting social media claims. He wrote, \u201cThat girl in the picture which was clicked in 2016 is not \u201cDisha Salian\u201d that is my friend @agaur21 (Anushri Gaur) who doesn\u2019t even live in India\u2026 I have said this before and I\u2019m saying it again I have never met or spoken to Disha Salian in my life\u201d. Pancholi is the man wearing a cap and the woman next to him is Gaur.\n\nGaur also replied to this post, thanking Pancholi for \u201cposting the truth.\u201d Alt News reached out to Gaur via Instagram and she confirmed that the one next to Pancholi is her. She added that the other woman in the photo is Athiya Shetty, daughter of actor Sunil Shetty. \u201cThe photograph was taken at Athiya\u2019s birthday party in 2016,\u201d she said.\n\nA fan account dedicated to Sooraj Pancholi had tweeted a picture of him with Gaur. Evidently, the woman in the viral image and the one in this photo are the same.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Gaur had blamed the media for misreporting that the woman in the picture is Disha Salian. He shared a screenshot of a Mirror Now broadcast where the picture was aired. However, Mirror Now did not claim that Pancholi was photographed with Salian. On August 5, during its daily show \u2018The Urban Debate\u2019, the channel said that the picture is being shared with the claim that the woman is Salian, which was denied by Sooraj Pancholi\u2019s father Aditya Pancholi. Mirror Now then played Aditya Pancholi\u2019s clarification.\n\nThus a picture of Sooraj Pancholi with a friend was shared with the false claim that he was photographed with Sushant Singh Rajput\u2019s former manager Disha Salian.", "lang": "en"}
