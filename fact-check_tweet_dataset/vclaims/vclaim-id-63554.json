Gen. Don Bolduc. \u201cYou know, we do some things in the law firm around the country to raise money for the foundation. But ultimately we don\u2019t raise that much so it\u2019s essentially my money that goes into it to help these kids.\u201d He said the foundation had been started \u201cmaybe 10 years ago.\u201d\n\nPhilip Hackney, an associate law professor at the University of Pittsburgh who examined the tax filings for The Fact Checker, said the tax law for private foundations requires that 5 percent of the assets be distributed every year. Otherwise, the foundation must pay a fine equal to 30 percent of the amount not distributed. \u201cI\u2019m troubled by the fact that they did nothing for the first four or five years,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t pass muster.\u201d\n\nBy coincidence or not, the revival of the car raffles in 2019 came just as Messner was considering jumping into the Senate race. \u201cHe has spent a great deal of time and his own money working with an army of consultants as he considers his future,\u201d said a May 28, 2019, email seeking financial support for the Messner NH Exploratory Committee from one of his law firm partners, Michelle Harden. The day after sending that email, Harden appeared in a television interview with Villaruel-Mariano to tout the 2019 car raffle.\n\nThe Messner campaign said Villaruel-Mariano has received additional funding from the foundation, not yet shown in public tax filings, so her total scholarship is about $78,000. \u201cArnold Acosta is the latest recipient, who has received $4,886 from 2019-20 and the Foundation intends to provide further support as his studies continue, as we have done for the first recipient,\u201d a campaign statement said. \u201cA third student was selected, but chose not to accept the scholarship.\u201d (The campaign did not supply the tax forms that would verify these statements.)\n\nBesides the initial $100,000 from the law firm, the only other contributions listed in tax filings are from raffle sales that also promote the law firm in the Denver area. But administration expenses (mainly the cost of cars that are raffled) are a significant percentage of revenue. Over its lifetime, it cost the Messner Foundation more than $45 to raise $100, according to the tax records. And just 32 percent of expenses was spent on charitable programs.\n\nBut in the first 10 years of the foundation\u2019s existence, only one student received a scholarship from Messner\u2019s foundation \u2014 and even more money was given to an elite private school that Messner\u2019s sons were attending at the time. The foundation was essentially dormant after being founded, despite Messner\u2019s claim nine years ago that scholarships would start. The law firm is listed as the source of the original $100,000, while tax forms show the only other funds have been raised with car raffles that, incidentally, also promote the law firm. There are no records of personal contributions from Messner, though, to be sure, he is the founding partner of the law firm.", "lang": "en"}
