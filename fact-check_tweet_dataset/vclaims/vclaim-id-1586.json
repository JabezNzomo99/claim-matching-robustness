Trump\u2019s news conference in real time.", "author": "www.nytimes.com", "date": "JAN. 11, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-1586", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/11/us/politics/fact-check-trump-press-conference.html", "vclaim": "The Republican National Committee was not hacked because it had better defenses than the Democrats. The R.N.C. did not suffer the fate of the D.N.C. Based on the fact that Russian hackers broke into the Democratic National Committee and roamed its computer network for months, collecting documents and emails, the D.N.C.'s defenses do appear to have been inadequate. That is not unusual \u2014 many government departments and many companies have been successfully hacked. And the Republican National Committee's own network does not appear to have been successfully hacked, suggesting that its defenses were stronger. What Mr. Trump left out is that a contractor for the R.N.C. that stored older material was successfully hacked, suggesting that its defenses were incomplete.\n\nU.S. drug companies \u201csupply our drugs, but they don\u2019t make them here, to a large extent.\u201d This reflects the reality of a global pharmaceutical industry. The Food and Drug Administration says that \"the amount of foreign-made drug products in the United States is rapidly increasing.\" The F.D.A. has deployed inspectors in China, India, Europe and Latin America in an effort to ensure that imported drugs are safe and effective. Pressure from the United States government can make a difference. Pfizer had been planning to move its headquarters to Ireland, to lower its taxes, but scrapped the plan last year after the Obama administration changed American tax rules.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is \u201cimploding.\u201d Congress should repeal the health law and replace it at about the same time. The health care law does have troubles. But his timetable is wildly optimistic. The individual health insurance market and the public insurance exchanges are unstable. Premiums have shot up in many states. Major insurers have lost money on Affordable Care Act business and have left the marketplaces. But millions of Americans have received coverage and other benefits under the law. Republicans in Congress do not agree on a replacement plan and say it will take weeks or months to devise such a plan \u2014 a hugely complex undertaking.\n\n\u201cThere will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder.\u201d Might be popular with voters, but tough to implement in terms of policy. Congress would have to approve a border tax -- - the president has more latitude when it comes to tariffs on individual countries \u2014 but don't count on smooth sailing for new taxes on Capitol Hill. While Republicans may control the White House, the House and Senate, many G.O.P. members of Congress remain allergic to the \"T word,\" even if the tax is aimed at protecting domestic jobs and is being proposed by a Republican president.\n\nA Trump hotel\u2019s revenue from a foreign government would not violate the Constitution's emoluments clause. This remains very much open to debate. Legal experts disagree over whether payments to hotels or golf courses owned by the Trump Organization would violate a provision of the Constitution that prohibits payments or gifts to a federal employee. Mr. Trump's lawyers asserted today that if it is a \"fair market\" payment, the provision would not apply. To attempt to address the issue, Mr. Trump's lawyers said he would turn over \"profits\" from foreign payments to the hotels he owns -- but not those which are merely marketed under his name -- to the United States Treasury. Some legal experts say this is still not sufficient, and it is likely that lawsuits will test this.\n\nMr. Trump said most Americans don't care that he hasn't released his tax returns. This is false, polls show, though there is a partisan divide on the subject. A Pew Research Center poll this month showed that 60 percent of Americans think Mr. Trump should release his returns; only 33 percent said he doesn't have a responsibility to do so. The poll, consistent with earlier surveys, found a partisan split: Nearly four in five Democrats said Mr. Trump should release his returns, but just 38 percent of Republicans did so. So far, however, Mr. Trump has stuck to his guns, and the longer he delays, the greater the likelihood the public will move on, though all recent presidents have released their tax returns as a matter of course.\n\n\"I think it was Russia. But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people.\" After months of casting doubt on American intelligence agencies' finding that the Russian government had hacked Democratic targets and leaked private emails to influence the election, Mr. Trump now appears to accept the fact that Russia was responsible. But by suggesting \u2014 with justification \u2014 that many other countries and people engage in hacking, he minimized the significance of the Russian attack. He noted that the Chinese are believed to have hacked the Office of Personnel Management and to have obtained records on more on more than 20 million current and former government employees. The difference is that the Chinese did not release the records, making their actions traditional espionage. By releasing thousands of emails and documents, the Russians went beyond conventional spying to deliberately interfere with the democratic process.\n\nThe government will cut the cost of prescription drugs using competitive bidding, Mr. Trump said, and \u201cwe are going to save billions of dollars.\u201d This is a crowd-pleasing promise and may be feasible. Members of both political parties express growing concern about sky-high prices for some prescription drugs. Some government agencies do purchase drugs by inviting competitive bids. More bidding and savings are possible \u2014 where comparable drugs are available. However, some highly effective, expensive drugs have no competition because no equivalent or similar therapies are available. In such cases, it is difficult for the government to command or negotiate discounts. Federal officials have been reluctant to use their ultimate weapon, refusing to cover or purchase an expensive drug. Drug industry lobbyists could resist efforts to require more bidding or negotiation on decisions about drug coverage and purchases.\n\n\"I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created.\" This will be a tough one to fulfill in many ways. Economists have long debated just how much of an impact a president has on the economy and job creation. While Washington can set the tone, other economic forces like the business cycle, demographics and overseas events are just as powerful as who is in the Oval Office. In terms of the United States, Mr. Trump's biggest challenge in terms of job creation is that the economy is close to full employment \u2014 unemployment is less than 5 percent \u2014 and growth remains in the 2 percent range. For Mr. Trump to achieve his target, and create jobs as President Bill Clinton did in the 1990s, the economy would have to grow by 3 to 4 percent annually \u2014 a prospect that is far-fetched, according to most economists.\n\nMr. Trump said \u201ca lot of car companies are going to be moving in\u201d and that other industries will follow. Ford canceled a new factory in Mexico; Fiat Chrysler will expand in the U.S. While auto companies seem to be adjusting plans to placate Mr. Trump, and may be more hesitant to ship production abroad than in the past, less consumer-oriented industries continue to move jobs to cheaper places like Mexico. What is more, when Mr. Trump said moments later that drug makers are \"leaving left and right,\" that's not as clear in terms of manufacturing, at least. Some pharmaceutical makers have incorporated overseas to lower their taxes, but plenty of drug production remains in the United States.", "lang": "en"}
