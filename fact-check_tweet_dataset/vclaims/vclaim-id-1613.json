It is going up.\u201d\n\nThe figures are right, but the rise isn\u2019t as fast as indicated by the claim. It\u2019s also less when the budget is adjusted for inflation, and the claim doesn\u2019t take account of reductions in non-NHS health spending.\n\nThe budget for the English NHS was \u00a398.1 billion in 2014/15, and is due to rise to \u00a3119.9 billion by 2020/21. These are indeed \u201craw figures\u201d, in that the natural rise in prices will erode the real value of that money: adjusted for inflation, we calculate that 2020/21\u2019s budget will be more like \u00a3111 or \u00a3112 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, health spending beyond the NHS is set to fall by \u00a34.9 billion. So the total rise in health spending in real terms will be around \u00a34.7 billion from 2015/16.\n\nWe\u2019ve got more details on the money, and whether it\u2019s sufficient, in our article on spending on the English NHS.", "lang": "en"}
