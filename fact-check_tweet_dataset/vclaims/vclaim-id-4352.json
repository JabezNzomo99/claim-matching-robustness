But she never worked for Clinton.\n\nAnother story circulating on Facebook is attempting to spread a false narrative that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was somehow connected to an alleged sex cult.\n\nThis time, the website Your News Wire suggests that Seagram heiress Clare Bronfman was \u201cone of Hillary Clinton\u2019s closest aides\u201d and that she has been indicted for \u201cchild sex trafficking.\u201d\n\nNeither is true \u2014 a fact that didn\u2019t stop the post from accruing thousands of engagements on Facebook this week. The link was posted June 26, for example, in a group called \u201cTrump Landslide 2016,\u201d where commenters floated Clinton conspiracy theories and more than 5,600 reshared the link. Other websites also republished the story.\n\nBronfman did not work for the Clinton campaign, or for any Clinton entity, a spokesman for the Clinton Foundation confirmed to FactCheck.org (though she did donate to Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign, in addition to the National Republican Senatorial Committee). And we could find no court records indicating she has been charged with anything to date.\n\nThe false story largely borrows from another online story speculating that she may be indicted.\n\nWhat is true is that Bronfman is connected to NXIVM, which bills itself as a self-help organization but was home to a secret society that federal prosecutors say forced women to provide sex and labor. Bronfman\u2019s personal website notes that she \u201csits on NXIVM\u2019s executive board managing much of the day to day business,\u201d among other work with NXIVM founder Keith Raniere.\n\nRaniere \u2014 as well as the former \u201cSmallville\u201d star Allison Mack \u2014 have been indicted on charges of sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy. And in a March court letter, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York said Raniere \u201cis currently financially backed by Clare Bronfman, an heiress to the Seagram\u2019s liquor fortune. She has financed the defendant repeatedly over the years including providing him with millions of dollars and paying for private air travel costing up to approximately $65,000 a flight.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has also paid for numerous lawyers to bring suits against Nxivm critics,\u201d the filing said.\n\nStill, there is no indication that Bronfman has been criminally charged to date. Nor is there evidence that her sister, Sara Bronfman \u2014 also involved with NXIVM \u2014 has been.\n\nIn a December 2017 post on her website, Clare Bronfman defended NXIVM and Raniere.\n\n\u201cThere have been many defamatory accusations made and I have taken them seriously. Determining the truth is extremely important to me, and I can say firmly that neither NXIVM nor Keith have abused or coerced anyone,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI retired from a very successful career as a professional show-jumper because I wanted to do something more meaningful with my life. NXIVM is that.\u201d\n\nWe were not able to reach an attorney believed to represent Bronfman.\n\nYour News Wire has shared plenty of false stories we\u2019ve debunked, including another tale that tried to link NXIVM to the Clintons. That post made the false claim that Mack had \u201csold children to the Rothschilds and Clintons.\u201d The charges against Raniere and Mack do not deal with children.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\nUpdate, July 26: Clare Bronfman was arrested July 24 on charges relating to alleged identity theft, money laundering and \u201cencouraging and inducing\u201d illegal entry into the U.S.\n\n\u201cFounder of \u2018NXIVM,\u2019 a Purported Self-Help Organization, and Actor Indicted for Sex Trafficking and Forced Labor Conspiracy.\u201d Press release, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York. 20 Apr 2018.\n\nIndictment, United States v.
