However, authorities say the video is \u201cfake\u201d and that the emir was buried in a private ceremony.\n\nThe video appears in numerous social media posts in Nigeria, including a tweet shared more than 700 times since May 2, 2020. It has since been deleted, but AFP archived it here.\n\nAFP debunked claims from the same Twitter user in December 2019, when he falsely shared images purporting to show French weapons supplied to Boko Haram.\n\nThe short video clip shows what appears to be a corpse wrapped in white cloth and lifted above a surrounding crowd who attempt to touch the body.\n\n\u201cBurial of Emir of Rano today! Don't you appreciate the social distancing? (sic)\u201d the caption reads. It refers to a disregard for government directives on social distancing aimed at reducing the risk of the spread of coronavirus.\n\nThe footage was also shared here and here on Facebook, here and here on Twitter and here on Instagram, alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe Emir of Kano was traditionally one of Nigeria\u2019s most important Islamic leaders until the kingdom was carved up last May to create four new emirs, including the Emir of Rano, in a bid to curb the influence of the powerful post.\n\nOn May 2, 2020, Nigerian media reported that the Emir of Rano, Alhaji Tafida Abubakar Ila, died after a brief illness. It happened amid a surge in deaths in Kano which local investigators attributed to coronavirus.\n\nAt least 365 people have contracted coronavirus in Kano, making it the second worst-hit city in Nigeria, after Lagos. The two cities account for more than half of the country's 2,802 COVID-19 cases, as of May 4, 2020.\n\nNigerian President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s personal assistant Bashir Ahmed said the video was \u201cfake\u201d. In a tweet, he said that Rano Emirate officials told him that \u201cless than 20 people\u201d buried the late emir in his palace, as opposed to the scenes in the viral clips showing hundreds of people.\n\nAFP\u2019s correspondent in Borno said he recognised the video from the burial prayer for prominent Islamic cleric Goni Modu Goni Kolo in the north-eastern state's capital Maiduguri on May 2, 2020. The cleric died the day before, in the early morning hours.\n\nPhotojournalist Audu Marte attended the ceremony and took photographs that contain similar visual clues to the footage, including a building with arches and barred windows.\n\nHe also confirmed the language in the video is Kanuri, predominantly spoken in Maiduguri, whereas the language most widely spoken in Kano -- where the Emir of Rano\u2019s burial took place -- is Hausa.\n\n\u201cStep back!\u201d someone from the crowd says in Kanuri.\n\nIf you can help us confirm the location of the video, please get in touch here.\n\u2022 AFP replaced a link to one of the misleading Facebook posts", "lang": "en"}
