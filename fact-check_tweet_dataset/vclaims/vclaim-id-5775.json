This quote is untrue and originally stems from a satirical article.\n\nThe full text of the post credits Ocasio-Cortez with the following quote: \u201cPrivate truck drivers are destroying America. They get like 4 miles to the gallon, they think they own the road and they throw bottles of pee out their windows so they can keep driving. It\u2019s a barbaric industry. Trucks should all be government regulated and drivers should be on full-time camera until we can figure out how to automate our shipping and do away with them altogether.\u201d\n\nExamples of the claim are visible here and here .\n\nThe posts show a cropped photo of Ocasio-Cortez alongside the quote, which originates from the satirical news site \u201cBustatroll.org\u201d ( bustatroll.org/ ). The site is clearly marked as containing humorous and satirical content.\n\nAn archived version of the article from which this quote stems, entitled \u201cOcasio-Cortez Calls for Ban on Tractor-Trailers: \u2018Trucks are Killing America\u2019\u201d, is visible archive.vn/hyHtX . The article\u2019s tags include \u201cAOC horror stories\u201d and \u201cFan fiction\u201d.\n\nOn social media, however, the fictitious quote attributed to Ocasio-Cortez is being taken seriously by some users. Comments posted in response include: \u201cYou don\u2019t have a clue what you are talking about\u201d and \u201cCortez, sit down and shut up.\u201d ( here )\n\nLast year, Ocasio-Cortez, along with U.S. Senator Edward Markey, unveiled legislation for the Green New Deal, the first formal attempt by lawmakers to define potential legislation to create government-led investments in clean energy and infrastructure to transition the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels ( here ).\n\nThe Green New Deal outline proposed by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, endorsed by Ocasio-Cortez during the 2020 presidential campaign, included provisions for the replacement of all diesel shipping trucks by \u201cfast-charging and long-range electric trucks.\u201d ( here )\n\nFalse. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez did not say private truck drivers were destroying America. This claim stems from a satirical article.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
