We did not find any replies taking a jibe or any such tweet.\n\nA similar tweet was tweeted by DD News on November 5, 2019, at 1.08 am which did not have any blooper and had 'successful' instead of 'sexfull' as in the viral image.\n\nWe did not find any trace of a deleted tweet, or replies indicating that such a tweet existed.\n\nWe also found a Twitter reply to the original DD News tweet which could have inspired the sarcastic fake tweet.\n\nAdditionally, the tweets with the viral image are tweeted much later after the tweet by DD news at 1 am.\n\nBOOM spoke to a source in DD News who confirmed that no such tweet was tweeted and the image seems photoshopped. \n\n\n\nThe person did not wished to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the press.", "lang": "en"}
