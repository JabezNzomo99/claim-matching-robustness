But now that Trump has raised the issue himself, we thought it would be a valuable service to collect all of the claims in one place \u2014 and assess whether any hold water.\n\nThe letter disclosed that Clinton suffered from deep vein thrombosis in 1998 and in 2009, an elbow fracture in 2009 and most notably, a concussion in 2012. (The elbow injury and concussion, when she was secretary of state, were extensively reported at the time.) The letter says her concussion symptoms, including double vision, were resolved within two months. The letter concluded that Clinton \u201cis in excellent physical condition and fit to serve as president of the United States.\u201d\n\nTrump, who would be 70 on inauguration day, in December 2015 released a four-paragraph letter from Dr. Harold N. Bornstein, a gastroenterologist in New York. Bornstein said he had treated Trump for 36 years. The letter, written with Trumpian rhetoric, proclaimed that \u201cif elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\u201d It provided few specifics \u2014 Trump apparently takes a statin drug and baby aspirin each day \u2014 and some medical professionals have noted it was oddly worded for an official document released by a medical doctor.\n\nClinton demonstrates \u2018seizure-esque\u2019 symptoms\n\n Fox News host Sean Hannity has devoted a number of shows to \u201cconcerns\u201d about Clinton\u2019s health, in particular a June 10 clip of Clinton rapidly shaking her head at a group of reporters who tried to corner her for questions about her selection of a running mate. \u201cIt almost seems seizure-esque to me,\u201d Hannity declared Aug. 10, although the two doctors on his show refused to confirm his diagnosis. \u201cIt looks like violent, out-of-control movements on her part.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 12, the reporter in question, Lisa Lerer of the Associated Press, penned an account of the encounter with Clinton. \u201cFor the record, I wasn\u2019t scared for a moment,\u201d she wrote about the \u201cunfounded speculation.\u201d As she explained, \u201cPerhaps eager to avoid answering or maybe just taken aback by our volume, Clinton responded with an exaggerated motion, shaking her head vigorously for a few seconds.\u201d\n\nClinton needs help getting up stairs\n\n On Aug. 7, photographs circulated on the Web of Clinton needing help getting up a flight of stairs. The conservative and pro-Trump Drudge Report in particular drew attention to the photographs, with the headline \u201cHillary Conquers the Stairs,\u201d as staff aides appear to steady Clinton.\n\nBut the photographs were five months old, taken when she slipped while walking up the stairs at a South Carolina facility for former felons. (The photo caption at the time made that clear.) Everyone slips, every so often \u2014 and plenty of other photographs show that Clinton has no trouble navigating stairs.\n\nSnopes quickly determined the photos came from a video shot in February 2016 \u2014 and that the bulge in her back could not be from a defibrillator. Instead, it appeared she was using a wireless microphone, which requires use of a wireless transmitter. Other photographs of the candidate from the same day, wearing the same clothes, showed no bulge.\n\nClinton is accompanied by a doctor who carries a Diazepam pen\n\n Conservative websites also have fanned speculation that one of Clinton\u2019s Secret Service agents is actually a doctor who carries a Diazepam pen in case she has a seizure. (Some coughing fits by Clinton, also highlighted by conservative media, were said to be reactions to her anti-seizure medicine.) But the \u201cdoctor\u201d was indeed a Secret Service agent, Assistant Special Agent in Charge Todd Madison \u2014 and he was likely carrying a flashlight.\n\nGiven Trump\u2019s poor track record with the facts, it should be little surprise that, through innuendo, he is trying to surface debunked Internet rumors from the fringes of the right. But these are also half-baked, ridiculous and easily disproved, making it especially shocking that he would try to highlight them in prepared speeches.\n\nBoth major-party candidates have issued letters from their doctors attesting to their health. Both could clearly do more, especially given the standard set by McCain eight years ago. But in the absence of additional information, there\u2019s little reason for a major-party nominee such as Trump to traffic in rumors and innuendo.", "lang": "en"}
