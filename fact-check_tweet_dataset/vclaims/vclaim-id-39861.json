(RELATED: Is Climate Change A \u2018Bigger Fiscal Issue\u2019 Than Entitlements?)\n\nThe image, which shows plastic bags and bottles strew across the ground, alleges that climate protestors left trash behind in an attempt to paint them as hypocritical. \u201cAftermath of \u2018Climate Change\u2019 protests today!\u201d reads the caption. \u201cAt Hyde Park, Chicago.\u201d\n\nHowever, the photograph shared on Facebook does not capture the aftermath of a climate change protest, in Chicago or anywhere else. A reverse image search reveals that the picture actually shows the trash left behind by attendees of a marijuana-based celebration at London\u2019s Hyde Park on April 20.\n\nThe Hemp Trading Company, an eco-friendly fashion company based out of London, criticized those who attended the event on Facebook the following day.\n\n\u201cThis is #HydePark after #420,\u201d reads the post. \u201cAshamed is not the word. With #extinctionrebellion not yards away, so many of you couldn\u2019t be bothered to clean up after yourselves.\u201d\n\nThe image was likely first linked to climate change protests after April 21 tweets falsely claimed that it showed the aftermath of a protest by environmental activist group Extinction Rebellion, which was held on the same day as the marijuana celebration.", "lang": "en"}
