But he is not representing the GOP, as one story claims.\n\n\u201cNathan Larson Is A Proud Pedophile \u2014 And Also A GOP Congressional Candidate\u201d reads a June 1 headline that is circulating on Facebook.\n\nBut Larson has filed to run as an independent candidate in the state\u2019s 10th Congressional District, not as a Republican.\n\nLarson\u2019s declaration of candidacy and petition of qualified voter forms show that he elected to run in the general election \u2014 and not in any party\u2019s primary election.\n\nThe story on Blue State Daily proceeds to link Larson\u2019s candidacy with President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement of Republican Roy Moore, the former U.S. Senate candidate in Alabama accused of sexual misconduct and assault of young girls. Moore denied the accusations, which centered on alleged conduct years before he was a candidate.\n\nHuffPost detailed how Larson, a 37-year-old accountant, created websites that served as chat rooms for pedophiles and misogynists. There, according to HuffPost, he \u201cwrote numerous posts endorsing child rape and other forms of sexual abuse.\u201d He also has openly espoused such beliefs in other interviews and said he supports incest.\n\nLarson has a young daughter whom, according to what he told the Washington Post, he met only once during a supervised visit.\n\nLarson has described himself as a \u201cquasi-neoreactionary libertarian.\u201d The Libertarian Party of Virginia disavowed Larson and expelled him from the party in 2017, when he unsuccessfully ran for a seat in Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates (on a campaign platform that included legalizing child pornography). He also ran for Congress as a libertarian in Virginia\u2019s 1st Congressional District in 2008.\n\nThat same year, court documents show, Larson was accused of sending an email to the Secret Service threatening to kill the president. He pleaded guilty in 2009, and was sentenced to 16 months in prison.\n\nHe has not been criminally charged for any acts relating to his stated support for pedophilia, rape or incest.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\nCook, Jesselyn and Campbell, Andy. \u201cCongressional Candidate In Virginia Admits He\u2019s A Pedophile.\u201d HuffPost. 31 May 2018.\n\nGuilty plea.
