His work \u201cRepublic,\u201d which contains the well-known \u201cAllegory of the Cave,\u201d is widely considered a classic of philosophy. The main character in Plato\u2019s literature is typically Socrates.\n\nHowever, nowhere in this work, or any of his others, did the Daily Caller News Foundation find any record of the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. A search of his complete works returned no results matching the alleged quote.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read a good bit of Plato in my time, but never encountered a quote like that from him,\u201d said Michael Russo, author of \u201cPlato\u2019s Republic: A Study Guide,\u201d in an email to the DCNF. Other experts did not recognize the saying either.\n\nThe website Quote Investigator found no instances of the saying prior to the 19th century, with the earliest known appearance in print dating back to 1898. In that year, according to Quote Investigator, two publications attributed the expression to Scottish minister and author John Watson under his pen name Ian Maclaren, though these instances used \u201cpitiful\u201d instead of \u201ckind.\u201d\n\nThe saying has also been attributed to Philo of Alexandria, Socrates and Marjorie Pay Hinckley.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
