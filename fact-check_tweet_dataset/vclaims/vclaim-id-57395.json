The way the company manages its contracts with farmers has changed, but it doesn\u2019t source any wheat from the USA. Warburtons currently uses wheat from the UK and Canada, and this will continue even after the changes to their contracts.\n\nThe company has changed their supply partner from a co-operative called Openfield to a Lincolnshire-based company called Frontier. According to Farmers Weekly, the change will come into effect in July 2022.\n\nBut this won\u2019t change what countries the wheat comes from. Warburtons told Full Fact it has and will continue to get its wheat from growers in the UK and Canada.\n\nIn a statement, Warburtons said: \u201cLike most bakers, we use a blend of wheat because different varieties, grown in different countries, provide different attributes, such as protein levels, needed to make the perfect loaf. We also source wheat from Canada which, when blended together with our British wheat, gives us the perfect combination of qualities we look for in our bread.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
