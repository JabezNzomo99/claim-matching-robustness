No, that's not true: the Twitter account that sent out the message has a parody disclaimer, it is not real.\n\nThis is the tweet in question (archived here):\n\nThe tweet was screenshotted and widely shared on social media as real, for example in this post (archived here):\n\nThe screenshotted version of the tweet omits the \"(parody)\" part of the name of the Twitter account, which reads \"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Press Release (parody)\" in full.\n\nThe bio of the @AOCPress accounts notes it is a satirical parody and points visitors to her real account at @AOC:\n\nOn her real account Ocasio-Cortez only mentioned ISIS twice so far:\n\nThe parody tweet was likely sent to comment on the Hoda Muthana case, an American woman who joined ISIS and now wants to return home:\n\nPresident Trump already expressed his feelings about that matter via Twitter:", "lang": "en"}
