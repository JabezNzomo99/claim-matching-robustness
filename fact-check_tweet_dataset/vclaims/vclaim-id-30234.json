The claim is false; the photo has actually circulated online since 2012 in reports about Khan visiting the BBC office in London for an interview; London\u2019s Metropolitan Police said that they had not arrested Khan.\n\nThe photo was published in this Facebook post on December 28, 2019.\n\nThe post\u2019s Hindi-language caption translates to English as: \u201cBREAKING: Shah Rukh Khan has been arrested today at Heathrow Airport soon after he arrived here to participate in protests against India\u2019s newly introduced citizenship law. India\u2019s main opposition party deemed this as a shame for the country and labeled arrest as the conspiracy and nexus between the UK\u2019s newly elected government and RSS. Hindus, will you still watch his movies? #INDIAWITHCAB, #IndiaSupportsCAB #HinduAsking.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post makes reference to India\u2019s main opposition party, which is the Indian National Congress party, and the UK\u2019s recently elected government, which was formed in December 2019 as reported here by AFP.\n\nThe post also refers to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, an Indian Hindu nationalist organization, by its acronym RSS.\n\nCAB is a reference to India's Citizenship Amendment Bill, which is now referred to as the Citizenship Amendment Act after India's parliament passed the bill on December 11, 2019.\n\nThe new law can grant citizenship to non-Muslim immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, as reported by AFP here on December 12, 2019.\n\nThe same image was also shared here, here and here on Facebook, and here and here on Twitter.\n\nHowever, the claim is false; Shah Rukh Khan, who is one of India\u2019s most famous movie stars, was not arrested at London's Heathrow airport on December 28, 2019.\n\n\u201cThere has been no trace of such arrest on Heathrow airport,\u201d Alan Crockford, a spokesperson from London\u2019s Metropolitan Police, told AFP in an email on January 3, 2020.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found that the photograph used in the misleading posts was published here on Zimbio, an entertainment news website, on June 21, 2012.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo:\n\nThe photo\u2019s caption reads: \u201cBollywood legend Shahrukh Khan is seen arriving at BBC Radio 2 to a crowd of dedicated fans and press.\u201d\n\nMore photos of Khan at BBC Radio 2 studios, which can be seen on Google maps here, were also published here and here.\n\nMeanwhile, photographs were published here of Khan at a birthday party in Mumbai on December 27, 2019, a day before the misleading claim was made. Here is another media report noting that Khan attended the party.\n\nKhan was again photographed December 31, 2019, at a New Year's celebration in Alibag, a town just south of Mumbai. The photo was published here on the Instagram account of India\u2019s national cricket coach Ravi Shastri.\n\nNDTV, an Indian national broadcaster, reported Khan\u2019s attendance at the New Year\u2019s party here.", "lang": "en"}
