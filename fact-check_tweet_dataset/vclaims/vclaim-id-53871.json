The novel coronavirus (nCoV) or COVID-19 is not a new disease.\n\n2. The treatment for the disease has already been found.\n\n3. Coronavirus can be cured with aspirin, antihistamines and nasal spray.\n\nAll three claims raised on social media are false.\n\n1. The novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain of coronavirus.\n\nThe novel coronavirus is a new strain of the coronavirus family. It has unique characteristics and has never been discovered before.\n\nChinese health authorities say that nCoV is likely to have come from a seafood market in Wuhan where wildlife was also traded illegally. Chinese researchers said the virus could have spread from \u201can infected animal species to humans through illegally-trafficked pangolins\u201d, which are prized in Asia for food and medicine. \u201cScientists have pointed to either bats or snakes as the source of the virus,\u201d adds the report.\n\nThe novel coronavirus is a new variety of coronavirus. The World Health Organisation (WHO) states, \u201cCoronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such a MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.\u201d A novel coronavirus (nCoV) and its outbreak COVID-19 has not been previously identified in humans. Its symptoms include fever, tiredness and dry cough. In most severe cases it causes shortness of breath, aches and pains, sore throat or in rare cases \u2013 diarrhoea, nausea or a runny nose.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s. \u201cSometimes coronaviruses that infect animals can evolve and make people sick and become a new human coronavirus. Three recent examples of this are 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV.\u201d\n\nSARS-CoV is Severe Acute respiratory syndrome which was identified in 2002. It is thought to be an animal virus from an \u201cas-yet-uncertain animal reservoir, perhaps bats, that spread to other animals (civet cats) and first infected humans in the Guangdong province of southern China in 2002,\u201d per WHO.\n\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) is a viral respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012.\n\nTherefore, while different strains of coronavirus have been discovered before, the novel coronavirus also knows as nCoV or SARS-CoV-2 is new.\n\n2. There is no cure for novel coronavirus yet.\n\n\u201cThere is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019,\u201d states WHO. In fact, no vaccine has yet been found even for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.\n\nIt usually takes 10 to 15 years to develop a new vaccine however, technological advancement has sped up the process. Recently, US president Donald Trump touted Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine as possible treatments for coronavirus following which the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved clinical trials of Chloroquine. However, an Arizona man with nCoV died in an apparent attempt to self-medicate with Chloroquine. His wife is in critical condition.\n\nAccording to a Forbes Tracker,several drug companies, universities and biotech start-ups are researching treatment and cures for the disease. All medications are either in early stages of development or animal and human testing.\n\n3. Coronavirus cannot be \u2018cured\u2019 with aspirin, antihistamines and nasal spray.\n\nWhen any of the coronaviruses (or rhinoviruses for that matter) cause the common cold, the physicians\u2019 aim is to (a) stop the transmission of the infection to other people and (b) treat the symptoms. This is because the common cold is a self-limited disease \u2013 it cures by itself. It is for this reason, antivirals or antibiotics are not given for a common cold. In the usual clinical picture, it is also not required to find out which organism has caused the common cold since it has no bearing on its treatment. The mainstay of symptomatic treatment for the common cold is anti-inflammatory drugs like NSAIDs (aspirin is one of them), antihistamines, anticholinergic drugs and decongestants (which can be given as nasal spray). All of these can be bought at pharmaceutical stores without a doctor\u2019s prescription.\n\nHowever, when coronaviruses like SARS, MERS and the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cause severe disease with manifestations like pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, the treatment involves intensive care and not over-the-counter medications.\n\nTherefore, it is inappropriate to extrapolate the treatment for the common cold as the treatment of all coronavirus infections.\n\nThe textbook itself mentions inexact and inappropriate treatment. \u201cNasal spray\u201d only implies the route through which the medicine is given \u2013 through the nose. There are many drugs given through the nasal route, decongestants for the common cold are only one of them.\n\nThus an excerpt from a zoology textbook covering the basics of the common cold was taken out of context. The claims made rest on the misconception that there is only one coronavirus and that coronavirus only causes the common cold. In fact, there are many coronaviruses that infect different animals. Of those, from the mid-1960s till date, seven coronaviruses have been shown to infect humans including SARS, MERS and the novel COVID-19. These viruses cause a wide range of illnesses from common cold to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Hence these viral tweets are misleading people on the treatment available for coronavirus and fuel conspiracy theories that the current coronavirus pandemic is not new.\n\nNote: The number of positive cases of the novel coronavirus in India has exceeded 600. This has caused the government to impose a complete restriction on movement apart from essential services. Globally, more than 4 lakh confirmed cases and over 19,000 deaths have been reported. There is a growing sense of panic among citizens, causing them to fall for a variety of online misinformation \u2013 misleading images and videos rousing fear or medical misinformation promoting pseudoscience and invalid treatments. While your intentions may be pure, misinformation, spread especially during a global pandemic, can take lives.
