Amid unrest and demonstrations following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, while in the custody of Minneapolis police, antifa \u2014 according to this white nationalist hoax \u2014 were coming to sow chaos and violence across small towns in America.\n\nDespite reports indicating that antifa has had at most a negligible influence at any of the thousands of anti-police-brutality demonstrations, the movement has been elevated by some on the right, including President Donald Trump, as a symbol of left-wing anarchy and terror, creating a national, if not ill-defined, boogeyman on which to blame the country\u2019s unrest. As a result, panic about marauding bands of \u201cantifa\u201d infiltrating small towns across America to cause terror became an ubiquitous feature of social media rumors and forwarded emails in June 2020.\n\nOne notable panic occurred thanks to a screenshot of a purported Craigslist ad claiming to have been authored by \u201cANTIFA\u201d and offering to pay \u201cup to 1,000 people $25 per hour for protesters in Lincoln, NE and Omaha, NE.\u201d In unusual candor for a supposedly anonymous and shadowy political movement, the ad continued to explain that \u201cbasically we want to cause as much chaos and destruction as possible.\u201d\n\nFirst things first: Yes, the screenshots are of a real ad that was posted, briefly, to Craigslist. By combining multiple screenshots of the ad, each of which included incomplete portions of its URL, we were able to reconstruct its one-time location on the web:\n\nAs of this writing, that URL goes to a live page that indicates a post once existed, but that it had \u201cbeen flagged for removal.\u201d\n\nBased on several pieces of information, we infer that the ad was live for less than a day, having been both posted and removed on June 1, 2020. Our evidence for this assertion stems from the fact that the earliest screenshot of the ad \u2014 according to reverse-image searches \u2014 is found on a post in the message board community Godlike Productions created on June 1. Further, there are no relevant search results for \u201cantifa,\u201d \u201ccraigslist,\u201d and \u201cNebraska\u201d before June 1 on either Google or the social media analytics tool Crowdtangle.\n\nThanks to the message board posting, we also know that the ad had to have been deleted at some point before 5:58 p.m. EDT on June 1. The author states that \u201cMy friend sent me [this Craigslist ad] on Facebook. I searched for the Craigslist ad, and it isn\u2019t there anymore.\u201d\n\nThe timing is crucial. The point of this ad, allegedly, was to recruit people to create \u201cas much chaos and destruction as possible.\u201d It is true that there was some \u201cchaos and destruction\u201d in Lincoln and Omaha in the aftermath of the Floyd killing, but almost all of it occurred before June 1. In both Lincoln and Omaha, demonstrations turned violent and included looting on several nights prior to and including May 31. Since then, however, demonstrations remained largely peaceful in both cities. A majority of the arrests since then were for breaking the curfew, not for property damage or theft.\n\nIf there was a serious effort by persons connected to antifa to recruit agitators to sow chaos in Lincoln and Omaha with this Craigslist ad, their effort bore no fruit. By way of another explanation, fake Craigslist ads are a tragically common form of online manipulation \u2014 anyone can claim they are whoever they want, and this allows them to impersonate people they want to cast in whatever light they choose. The lack of actual chaos and violence following the Craigslist ad, combined with the comically candid assertion that \u201cbasically we [antifa] want to cause as much chaos and destruction as possible,\u201d strongly suggests it was a hoax.\n\nOther evidence in favor of this being an inauthentic posting comes from two demonstrably different sources: the Lincoln Police Department and an organization named \u201cAnti-Fascist Action Nebraska\u201d \u2014 the latter appears to legitimately represent the Nebraska anti-fascist movement based on past reporting of their activism.\n\nOn June 3, according to the Journal Star, \u201cOfficer Erin Spilker said Lincoln Police are aware of the online rumor and are investigating its authenticity \u2014 but have found no indication that it\u2019s real.\u201d As for Anti-Fascist Action Nebraska, they, too, have denied any involvement in its creation, calling it a hoax. In a tweet, they described the Craigslist ad as \u201cbullshit,\u201d adding that \u201cyou\u2019re a gullible mark with questionable motives if you believe everything you see on the internet\u201d\n\nBecause the post existed for less than a day, was created after the most significant unrest and violence in Omaha and Lincoln occurred, and went viral only in screenshot form in predominantly right-wing circles well after its deletion, we conclude that this is just another one of the thousands of viral but wholly inauthentic Craigslist ads floating around on the internet. The denial from Anti-Fascist Action Nebraska and the skepticism of the Lincoln Police Department further support that conclusion.\n\nFor these reasons, we rank the claim that antifa is using Craigslist to recruit violent protests in Nebraska as \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
