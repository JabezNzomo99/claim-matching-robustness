Twitter users \u2014 including late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel \u2014 chimed in on what appeared to be a scene of people, including the president, making light of the deadly crisis. Kimmel posted on Twitter:\n\nPolitical video editor for Washington Post Zach Purser Brown, who appeared to have witnessed the scene, also tweeted about it. Posting photos and videos from inside the Honeywell plant, he wrote:\n\nOriginally a 1973 James Bond theme song by British-American rock band Paul McCartney & Wings, the song \u201cLive and Let Die\u201d resurfaced in the American psyche in the early \u201990s thanks to a cover by rock band Guns N\u2019 Roses. That version received a Grammy Award nomination in 1993. But following the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the U.S., Clear Channel Communications \u2014 the country\u2019s largest chain of radio stations now known as iHeartMedia \u2014 placed the track on its list of \u201clyrically questionable\u201d songs for stations to consider while creating playlists.\n\nAside from the Guns N\u2019 Roses song, Brown reported via Twitter that songs during Trump\u2019s Honeywell visit appeared to match the playlists of campaign rallies by Trump, who is seeking a second presidential term against presumptive Democratic nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nTo aid our investigation into the claim, we researched the circumstances surrounding the apparent factory visit. According to the White House and an online log of the president\u2019s appearances, Trump arrived at the Honeywell plant midday, and he first participated in a roundtable discussion on campus with tribal and local leaders. After that, the president toured a N95 mask assembly line \u2014 where the viral incident took place \u2014 and then gave a speech to congratulate Honeywell workers on their efforts to boost production of N95 masks during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cMinutes ago we saw the brand new production lines where you\u2019re making high-quality N95 respirators, and they are made to perfection,\u201d he said, according to a video posted by the White House on May 5.\n\nAccording to a video clip showing a portion of his assembly-line tour via Reuters, Trump and three men in suits wore protective eyeglasses but no facial gear to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Factory workers and Trump are heard talking about the masks as Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019 rendition of \u201cLive and Let Die\u201d plays on a PA system, and the president is seen giving the thumbs up. One person in the background of the video clip appears to be wearing a mask and so does a worker behind the assembly line.\n\nIn public remarks since the U.S. COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020, Trump has emphasized that recommendations by public health officials to wear masks to limit the spread of infections are voluntary, and that he is \u201cchoosing not to do it.\u201d Yet before making the Honeywell plant visit on May 5, Trump told reporters at the White House he would wear a mask during the factory tour \u201cif it\u2019s a masked facility,\u201d according to CNBC.\n\nAfter the appearance, a White house official told CNBC that Honeywell had said Trump and other visitors did not need to wear masks during the visit.\n\nAccording to recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people should wear some sort of protection over their noses and mouths in public settings where it\u2019s hard to keep distance between others, or where high rates of COVID-19 are spreading from person to person. For most people, that means wearing a simple cloth facial covering and leaving the N95 respirators or surgical masks that are in short supply for health care workers and others on the front lines of combating the pandemic.\n\nTrump\u2019s factory tour made headlines about one week after Vice President Mike Pence toured the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, without wearing a face mask \u2014 a decision he later told Fox News was wrong.\n\nIn sum, given the video footage of Trump\u2019s visit to the Phoenix Honeywell plant, recordings that include audio of Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019 \u201cLive and Let Die\u201d playing during his tour, as well as reports by news media in which the White House commented on the fact that the president did not wear a mask, we rate this claim \u201cTrue.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
