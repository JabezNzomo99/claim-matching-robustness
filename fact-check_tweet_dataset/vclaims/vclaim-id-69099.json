If anyone could almost single-handedly make political newcomer Kevin Nicholson into a viable candidate for the U.S. Senate, it was Uihlein.\n\nNicholson ultimately lost to Vukmir, a longtime state lawmaker, in the Aug. 14, 2018 Republican primary for the right to take on the incumbent, Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin, in the fall. But he took the fight to Vukmir -- in no small part because of spending by Uihlein.\n\nGroups supported by Uihlein spent nearly $11 million in support of Nicholson and against his rival, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported several days before the primary. For example, the Uihlein-backed group Solutions for Wisconsin made a $911,000 television buy in the final days.\n\nWhat Vukmir said about him\n\nNow, to what Vukmir has said about Uihlein \u2014 the contrasting statements having been pointed out in an Associated Press news article.\n\nEight days before the primary, Vukmir was salty toward Uihlein.\n\n\"I think it leaves a bad taste in the mouth of a lot of people that a particular out-of-state donor is spending as much money as he is to, in essence, almost try to buy a Senate seat, and that\u2019s not what Wisconsin politics is about,\" Vukmir told Green Bay conservative radio talk show John Muir, in a clear reference to Uihlein.\n\nThat Vukmir remark echoed criticism from Democrats, who 10 months earlier were complaining that Uihlein was trying to buy the seat for Nicholson.\n\nThe day after her primary win, however, Vukmir was conciliatory.\n\n\"We are already reaching out to Dick Uihlein and I hope that he will want to continue with his commitment,\" Vukmir said to conservative Milwaukee radio talk show host Mark Belling.\n\n\"Let\u2019s face it, he wants to defeat Tammy Baldwin. And so I will look forward to having that conversation with him,\" Vukmir added, noting she would be attending a unity dinner two days later co-hosted by Uihlein.\n\nThe Flip-O-Meter has three ratings:\n\n \n\n No Flip \u2013 No significant change in position.\n\n \n\n Half Flip \u2013 A partial change in position.\n\n \n\n Full Flop \u2013 A complete change in position.\n\nIn this case, Vukmir went from condemning Uihlein\u2019s campaign contributions to essentially soliciting them. It may be understandable, given Uihlein\u2019s resources, that Vukmir would decide to seek his support. But it\u2019s also a Full Flop.", "lang": "en"}
