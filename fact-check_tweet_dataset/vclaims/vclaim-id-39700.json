The second posited that if the House votes to impeach a president, but the Senate doesn\u2019t convict and remove the person from office, the president is barred from running for office again.\n\nWe\u2019ll take a look at each of those theories below. But first, a quick look at how the impeachment process works. People often use the word \u201cimpeachment\u201d when referring to the removal of a president from office. But that\u2019s not exactly how it works. The House of Representatives has the \u201csole Power of Impeachment,\u201d as stated in Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 of the U.S. Constitution. But it is up to the Senate to convict and remove a president from office. In this way, \u201cimpeachment\u201d is roughly akin to bringing formal charges against an individual. It is then up to the Senate to convict the individual on those charges.\n\nThe aforementioned theories both deal with the gray area between impeachment and conviction. In other words, what happens if the president is impeached by the House of Representatives but is not convicted by the Senate?\n\nTheory 1: If a president is impeached by the House but not convicted by the Senate, the first presidential term is nullified and the president may run for election two more times.\n\nFALSE: This theory has been posited by a few social media users, but it reached a larger audience when it was shared by pizzagate conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec:\n\nThe tweet reads: \u201cThese Democrats don\u2019t realize that if they impeach Trump and the Senate doesn\u2019t confirm it then it nullifies Trump\u2019s first term and he gets to run two more times. Read the Constitution, people.\u201d\n\nThis is not how impeachment works.\n\nBefore we get to what the Constitution says about impeachment, we can get a glimpse of the hypothetical scenario posited in this tweet by taking a quick look at our country\u2019s recent history.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives on Dec. 19, 1998. However, Clinton was not convicted by the Senate. We searched news reports from the time and found no serious reporters, historians, or politicians arguing that the Senate\u2019s failure to convict Clinton literally nullified the president\u2019s previous term and gave him the opportunity to run for office again.\n\nThe Associated Press reported on Feb. 12, 1999:\n\nThe process for impeachment is laid out in Article I and Article II of the U.S. Constitution. This text says nothing about a president\u2019s term being \u201cnullified\u201d by an impeachment proceeding. Furthermore, the 22nd amendment of the Constitution explicitly states that \u201cno person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.\u201d\n\nDoug Pennington, director of communication for the Constitutional Accountability Center, told us in an email that Posobiec\u2019s statement was false:\n\nThe 22d Amendment alone unequivocally disproves that ridiculous, dangerous claim. The first words of the Amendment state: \u201cNo person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice \u2026.\u201d Donald Trump has been elected once. Provided he isn\u2019t convicted by the Senate in an impeachment trial and disqualified from holding future office, he can run for a second term, and only a second term. That\u2019s enough to negate that dreadful tweet, but anyone who considered some version of that question in good faith would have looked anywhere \u2014 literally anywhere \u2014 in the Constitution for textual support for the belief that if \u201c[1] they impeach Trump and [2] the Senate doesn\u2019t confirm it then [3] it nullifies Trump\u2019s first term and [4] he gets to run two more times.\u201d Having found absolutely none, instead coming across Article I Section 3 and the 22d Amendment, among other sections, such a good-faith questioner would have concluded that the opposite is true, and would not have made such a claim publicly for fear of spreading disinformation.\n\nTheory 2: A president is barred from seeking a second term once impeached.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE: A number of social media users seem to be under the impression that Trump would not be able to seek reelection if the House of Representatives impeaches him. One Twitter user, for instance, wrote: \u201cIf he gets impeached he won\u2019t be able to run in the next election like he plans to. It would guarantee that we can\u2019t have 4 more years under his leadership.\u201d\n\nBut that isn\u2019t the case. A president who is impeached by the House but is not convicted by the Senate could still run for reelection.\n\nPennington told us: \u201cNothing in the Constitution\u2019s language on impeachment prevents a president impeached but not convicted from running for a second of a two-term maximum.\u201d\n\nIn fact, before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an official impeachment inquiry into Trump in September 2019, political pundits noted that a \u201cfailed\u201d impeachment could help Trump\u2019s reelection efforts.\n\nAn opinion piece in The Hill noted:\n\nHowever, a bit of truth is offered here. The Constitution explains the country has two penalties for impeachment: removal from office and disqualification \u201cto hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.\u201d If a president is impeached by the House of Representatives, the Senate could convict, remove the president from office, and disqualify the person from holding future office.\n\nThis scenario, however, falls into some gray area because it has never been tested at the presidential level. It is possible that the Senate could take two separate votes, one on removal from office and one on disqualification from future office, which could result in a president\u2019s removal from office but provide an opportunity to seek reelection. It\u2019s also theoretically possible that a president who has been impeached, convicted, removed, and disqualified, could seek office at a lower level of government.\n\nWe asked Pennington about the possibility of a president seeking reelection after the House has impeached and the Senate convicted the person. He told us:\n\nA convicted president can be prohibited from again holding office if the Senate so decides, per Article I Section 3, which includes: \u201cJudgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.\u201d Disqualification is not automatic, but up to the Senate\u2019s discretion. While unsettled, a strong argument exists, however, that members of Congress are not encompassed by the language \u201cOffice of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.\u201d If so, then perhaps an impeached president could run for the House or Senate. It\u2019s untested. Additionally, some argue (at fn. 23) that an impeached and convicted official who the Senate decided to disqualify from holding future office, per Article 1 Section 3 above, would not be disqualified from holding a state office. Again, untested. More confident saying that a Senate disqualifying a president from holding office after an impeachment conviction would at least prohibit him/her from holding a federal office in either the executive or judicial branches, and at least possibly congressional or state office.\n\nTo sum up: Although a president is impeached by the House of Representatives, the repercussions of this legal process don\u2019t come to fruition until the Senate votes to convict the president.\n\nIf that happens, the Senate can vote to remove the president from office and disqualify the person from holding future office. If the Senate does not convict, the president will not be removed from office, nor will the person be prevented from seeking reelection (if he/she has not already reached the two-term limit).\n\nNowhere in the Constitution, however, does it state that a failed impeachment process would \u201cnullify\u201d a presidential term and allow a president to seek extra time in office.", "lang": "en"}
