Let\u2019s try to check whether these photos are taken recently in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n\n\nClaim: Photos are taken in Kashmir after the decision by the central government to abolish Article 35A and 370. Fact: The photos in the post are old photos. While three photos belong to Kashmir, one photo belongs to Odisha. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhile the post does not explicitly claim that the posted photos are taken recently, the timing of the post (just after the Home Minister\u2019s announcement in the Rajya Sabha that they are going to abolish Article 35A and 370) is making users on social media to believe that these are recent photos.\n\nWhen the images in the post were run through the Google Reverse Image Search one by one, it was found that three photos in the post were old photos taken in Jammu and Kashmir whereas one photo did not belong to Jammu and Kashmir at all. It was taken in Bhadrak (Odisha) in 2017.\n\nTo sum it up, these are not the latest photos from Kashmir.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
