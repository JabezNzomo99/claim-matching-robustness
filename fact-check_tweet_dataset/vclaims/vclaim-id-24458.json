No, that's not true: a joke tweet from a local fire department was copied by Fox 5 DC and went viral but it was not real.\n\nThe claim went viral via a tweet published by @fox5dc on July 20, 2019 (archived here) which read:\n\nThat tweet in turn was based on this one, from the Montgomery County Fire Department:\n\nThe image itself dates back from at least 2016 as this Imgur posting proves:\n\nIn a later tweet the firemen explained it was just a joke:\n\nFox 5 DC was gracious about being fooled by the firefighters:\n\nCorn turns to popcorn when the tiny bit of water inside a corn kernel turns to steam and makes the kernel \"pop\", typically this happens when the water reaches 212 \u00b0F.
