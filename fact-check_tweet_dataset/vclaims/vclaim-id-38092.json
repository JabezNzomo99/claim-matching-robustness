The message in it is in Hindi and its English translation is- \u2018If some men/women visit your house and say that they are medical students and offer to do free diabetes test, BP check or any blood test, you should immediately call the police. Because, they are not medical students, they are terrorist gangs. On the pretext of taking your blood sample, they inject AIDS virus into your body. Do not allow any stranger to enter your house. Issued in the interests of public- UP Police\u2019. The same screenshot is also being shared on Facebook. Let\u2019s check the authenticity of that advisory. \n\n\n\nClaim: Uttar Pradesh Police have issued an advisory warning people to be careful about terrorists posing as medical students as they try to inject AIDS virus into them on the pretext of free blood tests. Fact: UP Police have clarified that no such advisory was issued by them. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched on Google to find if Uttar Pradesh Police have issued any such advisory warning people to be careful about terrorists posing as medical students, no information was found in search results that corroborates the message. But, when searched on Twitter, a tweet by Ayodhya Police in this regard was found. In that tweet, the Uttar Pradesh Police has said that the viral message is \u2018fake\u2019 and asked people not to share that message.\n\n\n\nIn the official Twitter account of Uttar Pradesh Police, a tweet was also found in which they have denied issuing any such advisory to the public.\n\n\n\nDuring the search process, it was found that the same message was also circulated in 2017.\n\nTo conclude, UP Police haven\u2019t issued an advisory warning people to be careful from terrorists posing as medical students. It is fake. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
