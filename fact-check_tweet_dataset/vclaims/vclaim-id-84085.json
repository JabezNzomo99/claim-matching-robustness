Among those circulating the poll are BJP leaders and supporters, and a few media outlets, notably Zee News, Republic TV and Aaj Tak.\n\nUnion Minister Giriraj Singh shared the result, terming PM Modi the \u201csupreme leader\u201d of the country.\n\nZee News referred to British Herald as a \u201cleading British magazine\u201d. Its story further detailed, \u201cIn yet another proof of his image of a global leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been declared as the winner of a reader\u2019s poll for world\u2019s most powerful person 2019 conducted by a leading British magazine.\u201d\n\nAlt News decided to find out more about the poll that is being pushed so enthusiastically by sections of the media as a \u201cmatter of pride\u201d for all Indians.\n\nThe \u2018cover\u2019 of the magazine featured the Indian Prime Minister was revived during the COVID-19 pandemic to suggest that British Herald declared him the most powerful man based on his handling of the pandemic.\n\nThe website www.britishherald.com describes itself as \u201camong the world\u2019s leaders in online news and information delivery.\u201d It mentions \u201cvia Reuters\u201d in its logo banner and carries a wide variety of world news stories.\n\nAlt News found that the website is owned by Herald Media Network Limited, a company registered in the UK.\n\nThe company was incorporated in April 2018 by an Indian national, Ansif Ashraf. Ashraf owns 85% of the shares and the rest is owned by four other shareholders. Apart from Ashraf, the company has another director, Ahamed Shamseer Koliyad Shamsuddeen. Ansif Ashraf\u2019s Wikipedia page describes him as an Indian businessman from Kerala who is the editor-in-chief of the Cochin Herald and owns British Herald.\n\nSo, how popular is British Herald which is being projected by Indian media as a leading British magazine?\n\n1. British Herald has a global Alexa web traffic rank of 28,518, which grew from 95,979 three months ago. To give a perspective, indiatimes.com has a global Alexa ranking of 190, NDTV has an Alexa ranking of 395. In terms of traffic, British Herald is nowhere close to \u2018leading\u2019.\n\n2. British Herald Twitter account has less than 4,000 followers. Contrastingly, Alt News\u2019 Twitter account has more than 120,000 followers. Leading British media houses such as BBC and The Guardian have millions of followers.\n\n3. British Herald Facebook page has 57,000 followers. In comparison, BBC\u2019s Facebook page has 48 million followers and The Guardian\u2019s has 8 million.\n\n4. British Herald, at the time of writing, doesn\u2019t have a Wikipedia page of its own. Every leading media organisation has one.\n\n5. Not a single reputed international publication has carried the news of PM Modi having won a global leader poll by a \u2018leading\u2019 British website, only Indian publications did.\n\n6. In fact, even the results of the poll announced on British Herald\u2019s Twitter account has only been shared around 150 times at the time of writing.\n\n7. Incidentally, British Herald had tweeted an image of the magazine declaring PM Modi the \u201cworld\u2019s most powerful person\u201d nearly a month before the voting ended. This tweet was made on May 23 and barely had 30 retweets at the time of writing.\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that British Herald is not a \u2018leading\u2019 British Magazine. The company that owns British Herald and carried out the poll is incorporated in the UK. No details of methodology or the sample size of the poll are available, even though the website said that it experienced a sudden surge in traffic during the voting period.\n\nUnion Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Dr Harsh Vardhan, called PM Modi\u2019s \u2018victory\u2019 a \u201cmatter of pride and honour\u201d for 130 crore Indians.\n\nThe sentiment was echoed by a plethora of BJP leaders.\n\nThe same was reported as \u201ca big development\u201d and a moment of pride for the nation by Republic TV.\n\nSeveral other media outlets also caught with the theatrics.\n\nWhile chest-thumping about the results by BJP leaders and supporters is par for the course, the role of the media in projecting the results of an unheard website raises eyebrows. Not one of the outlets that reported the news as a \u201cmatter of pride for all Indians\u201d bothered to check the details of the organisation behind the poll.", "lang": "en"}
