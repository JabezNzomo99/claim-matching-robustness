The U.K. Department of Health and Social Care debunked the claim on Twitter, and so did Granato.\n\nThe U.K. microbiologist became one of the first people to be injected with a potential coronavirus vaccine as part of a clinical trial at Oxford University last week, according to The Guardian.\n\nSocial media users started sharing on Sunday an article, titled \u201cFirst volunteer in UK coronavirus vaccine trial has died,\u201d claiming Granato had died following complications from taking the vaccine. The Facebook post lifts its text nearly word-for-word from that article and makes the same claim.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care debunked the claim that she had died from the vaccine in an April 26 tweet.\n\n\u201cNews circulating on social media that the first volunteer in a UK #coronavirus vaccine trial has died is completely untrue,\u201d reads part of the tweet. (RELATED: Did A Man Die \u2018After Taking Malaria Medication Touted By Trump As Possible Cure For Coronavirus?\u2019)\n\nFollowing the rumors about her \u201cdeath,\u201d Granato tweeted about her good health before making her Twitter account private, according to The Guardian. Fergus Walsh, the medical correspondent for BBC News, tweeted a video from an interview with her the same day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very much alive, thank you,\u201d she says in the video. \u201cI\u2019m having a cup of tea, it\u2019s Sunday, 26th of April. Three days after my birthday. Three days after I got the vaccine or the control, we don\u2019t know. And I\u2019m having a nice Sunday, and I hope everyone else in the world has too.\u201d\n\nAs of press time, the new coronavirus has sickened more than 3.1 million people and killed some 218,000 others worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.", "lang": "en"}
