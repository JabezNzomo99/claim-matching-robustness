This post was sent to the Rappler Fact Check team for verification.\n\nDone improperly, without adequate supervision, proning could cause harm. The graphic was posted with a caption in Filipino which translates to: \"Facts: Putting patients in a prone position should be done only upon doctors' recommendations. The patient could be put in danger if this is done without the guidance of a doctor. If one is experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, self-isolate immediately and call your BHERT!\"\n\nBecause it is being seen as a way to improve oxygenation among COVID-19 patients, medical institutions have published guides on proning for COVID-19 patients in hospital settings, providing detailed procedures. This United Kingdom Intensive Care Society guide includes decision tools for determining eligible patients and specifications such as timed position changes and prescribed angles.\n\nDianne de Castro, a COVID-19 intensive care unit nurse from the Philippine General Hospital (PGH), told Rappler that prone positioning is administered to patients with certain respiratory conditions, and should only be done with supervision from a healthcare professional.\n\n\u201cIt is not advised as a home treatment for COVID-19. Yes, there are protocols, and there is a technique that only healthcare professionals should [administer]. Usually if a patient who is in moderate to severe COVID pneumonia and has acute respiratory distress syndrome and is in critical care, [doon] namin siya ginagawa (that is when we do it),\u201d De Castro said.\n\nThere are also no cures for COVID-19 as of writing. In the past, Rappler has previously debunked claims on released vaccines, false cures, and home remedies such as tuob, brown sugar, and malunggay and kamias tea. \u2013 Aleijn Reintegrado/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
