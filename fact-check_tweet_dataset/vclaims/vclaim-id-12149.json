Ralph Northam worked as a doctor before he was elected to helm the Commonwealth, and it\u2019s not hard to find photos of him online wearing a stethoscope around his neck.\n\nOne such picture shared on social media features text on top criticizing the state.\n\n\"Thanks Virginia,\" it says. \"OK to kill babies once born.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nOne account that posted the image also links to a Jan. 30, 2019, National Review article with this headline: \"Virginia governor defends letting infants die.\"\n\nIt is not legal to kill babies once born in Virginia. That is a felony.\n\nBut here\u2019s what you need to know about the late-term abortion debate in the state.\n\nThat story cites a radio interview Northam did with the station WTOP, after a Jan. 29, 2019, committee hearing on proposed legislation that would loosen restrictions on late-term abortions. The bill was introduced by Kathy Tran, a Democatic delegate to the state House, and during the hearing she fielded questions from Todd Gilbert, a Republican delegate.\n\n\"How late in the third trimester could a physician perform an abortion if he indicated it would impair the mental health of the woman?\" Gilbert asked.\n\n\"Through the third trimester,\" Tran said. \"The third trimester goes all the way up to 40 weeks.\"\n\n\"Where it\u2019s obvious that the woman is about to give birth, would that still be a point at which she could request an abortion if she was so certified? She\u2019s dilating,\" he said.\n\n\"My bill would allow that,\" Tran said.\n\nThe next day, Northam appeared on the radio show. Reporter Julie Carey asked him this question:\n\n\"There was a very contentious committee hearing yesterday, when Fairfax County delegate Kathy Tran made her case for lifting restrictions on third-trimester abortions as well as other restrictions now in place, and she was pressed by a Republican delegate about whether her bill would permit an abortion even as a woman is essentially dilating, ready to give birth, and she answered that it would permit an abortion at that stage of labor. Do you support her measure? And explain her answer.\"\n\nNortham said he couldn\u2019t speak for Tran but that the situation illustrates why such decisions should be made by physicians and parents.\n\n\"When we talk about third-trimester abortions, these are done with the consent of obviously the mother, with the consent of the physician \u2014 more than one physician, by the way \u2014 and it\u2019s done in cases where there are severe deformities, there may be a fetus that is nonviable,\" he said.\n\n\"So in this particular example, if a mother\u2019s in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that\u2019s what the mother and family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother,\" he said. \"So I think this was really blown out of proportion but again, we want the government not to be involved in these types of decisions. We want the decisions to be made by the mothers and the providers, and this is why legislators \u2026 most of whom are men, shouldn\u2019t be telling a woman what she should and shouldn\u2019t be doing with her body.\"\n\nVirginia law already allowed abortions after the second trimester but required three doctors to certify that the mother would die or her mental and physical health would be \"substantially and irremediably\" impaired without the procedure.\n\nTran\u2019s bill, which died in committee, would have eliminated the requirement that two other physicians certify that a late-term abortion is necessary to prevent the mother\u2019s death or harm or mental or physical health. It also eliminated the words \"substantially and irremediably\" from the law, among other changes.\n\nIn the interview, Northam said he supported keeping the state\u2019s requirement that multiple physicians certify the abortion is necessary because \"these decisions shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly.\"\n\nThe Democratic governor\u2019s comments drew criticism from conservatives, including U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.\n\n\"I never thought I would see the day America had government officials who openly support legal infanticide,\" he tweeted on Jan. 30.\n\n\"In just a few years pro-abortion zealots went from \u2018safe, legal, and rare\u2019 to \u2018keep newborns comfortable while the doctor debates infanticide,\u2019\" Sasse said. \"I don\u2019t care what party you\u2019re from \u2014 if you can\u2019t say that it\u2019s wrong to leave babies to die after birth, get the hell out of public office.\"\n\nTran later said she misspoke when she was asked whether her bill would let an abortion happen when the mother was in labor and about to give birth.\n\n\"I should have said, \u2018Clearly, no, because infanticide is not allowed in Virginia, and what would have happened in that moment would be a live birth.\u2019\" In Virginia, killing a newborn is a felony punishable by death.\n\nA Northam spokesperson told Vox that his comments were \"absolutely not\" a reference to infanticide. Rather, they \"focused on the tragic and extremely rare case in which a woman with a nonviable pregnancy or severe fetal abnormalities went into labor.\" He called the idea that he approved of killing infants \"disgusting,\" according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe Facebook post says it\u2019s \"OK to kill babies once born\" in Virginia.\n\nLate-term abortions are allowed under the state\u2019s laws through the third trimester if doctors certify the procedure is necessary for the mother\u2019s health \u2014 the proposed law discussed by Northam would not have changed the time period during which an abortion is allowed.\n\nAs we\u2019ve previously reported, Northam\u2019s comments were confusing and he didn\u2019t clarify what he meant by saying \"resuscitated.\" But he was speaking in the context of pregnancies in which the fetus has severe deformities or is nonviable. The Facebook post overreaches by claiming it\u2019s OK to kill newborns. In Virginia, that\u2019s a felony.", "lang": "en"}
