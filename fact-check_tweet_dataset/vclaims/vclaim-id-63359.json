However, Ndeitunga presented no evidence at the time for the decline in crime and it has to be questioned whether any reduction in crime, or traffic accidents, is due to the ban on alcohol sales or purchases or because of the restrictions on movement that were in place under the lockdown that stretched from 28 March 2020 to 4 May 2020.\n\nAn increase in reported domestic violence cases during the COVID-19 lockdown period undercuts the police chief\u2019s claim of a reduction in crime during the ongoing state of emergency and the notion that a ban on alcohol sales has decreased levels of violence. For more on this topic, read here and see the following:\n\nAccording to an online dictionary, a drunkard is \u201ca person who is habitually drunk\u201d. A habitual drunkard is defined as: \u201cA person given to ebriety or the excessive use of intoxicating drink, who has lost the power or the will, by frequent indulgence, to control his appetite for it.\u201d\n\nSo, is this an accurate description of the average Namibian or the society as a whole? Not so, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\nA 2018 report by the WHO on \u201cAlcohol Consumption: Levels and Patterns\u201d for Namibia provides the following insights on Namibians\u2019 alcohol use and abuse:\n\u2022 Only 18% of Namibians over 15 showed a \u201cPrevalence of heavy episodic drinking\u201d;\n\u2022 Only 6.3% of Namibians over 15 had \u201cAlcohol use disorders\u201d; and\n\u2022 Only 2.2% of Namibians over 15 had \u201cAlcohol dependence\u201d.\n\nWhile these percentages are above the continental averages, they certainly do not paint a picture of a \u201cdrunkard society\u201d.\n\nFor a more nuanced take on the political issue of alcohol and Namibian society, see this recent opinion-editorial in The Namibian newspaper.\n\nBased on the available evidence, the labeling of Namibia as a \u201cdrunkard society\u201d by inspector-general Sebastian Ndeitunga is an exaggeration.", "lang": "en"}
