Sign by President Duterte According to His Statement Last Friday.\u201d\n\nThe post has over 15,000 reactions and 40,000 shares, as of writing. Searching for the text of Parilla\u2019s post on Facebook returns several posts by other users using the exact same copy.\n\nRepublic Act 11480 allows the president to start the school year later than the last day of August in the event of an emergency or calamity.\n\nThis law amends Section 3 of Republic Act 7797, which requires classes to start no later than the last day of August.\n\nRepublic Act 11480 adds to this, saying, \"Provided, that in the event of a declaration of a state of emergency or state of calamity, the President, upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Education, may set a different date for the start of the school year in the country or parts thereof.\"\n\nThis law covers grade schools and high schools, including foreign or international schools. The start of classes may be set nationwide or specific to parts of the country.\n\nBased on the post\u2019s edit history, Parilla changed her original post to reflect this new claim. Her original post was another false claim wherein she said that no classes will be held in all levels for the school year 2020-2021. Rappler debunked her original post.", "lang": "en"}
