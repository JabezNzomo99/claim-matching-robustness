The findings of the Brazilian team are published online ( here ) and the 11 deaths (out of 81 participants) are shown in table 3 on page 28. The study was indeed halted after deaths were recorded.\n\nSome patients were administered a higher dosage of Chloroquine, while others a lower dosage. Seven deaths were recorded among the patients given a higher dose and four in the lower dosage group. The higher dosage study was halted earlier because it \u201cseemed to be more toxic\u201d, a doctor involved in the study told Reuters.\n\n\u201cPreliminary findings suggest that the higher CQ (chloroquine) dosage (10-day regimen) should not be recommended for COVID-19 treatment because of its potential safety hazards,\u201d their report said.\n\nWhen asked to elaborate on the study\u2019s findings, the doctor involved said, \u201cAll fatalities were on the average of the overall fatality in critically-ill patients, not higher. Patients died because of COVID-19. This disease is very lethal. However, due a trend in higher fatality in the higher dose group, the DSMB decided to stop this group.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe still have no data on the efficacy of chloroquine for severe patients with COVID-19\u201d, he added.\n\nAs of April 17, the number of patients who had died as part of this study had not changed.\n\nThe experiment was reported by publications including USA Today and the New York Times ( here ),( here ).\n\nThe claim on social media comes after hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, was recommended by President Donald Trump to treat the new coronavirus though the treatment is still in testing phases. In an April 4 exclusive, Reuters reported that in mid-March, Trump personally pressed federal health officials to make malaria drugs available to treat the novel coronavirus, though they had been untested against COVID-19, ( here ).\n\nGuidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of April 16 states that \u201cHydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are under investigation in clinical trials for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and treatment of patients with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19\u201d, ( here ).\n\nA safe, effective vaccine for the new coronavirus is still more than a year away ( here ). More than 70 vaccine candidates are in development around the world, with at least five in preliminary testing in people.\n\nTrue: Brazilian chloroquine study on COVID-19 patients was halted after 11 deaths among participants\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
