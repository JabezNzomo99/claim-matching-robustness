No, that's not true: a Russian fake news website specializing in death hoaxes about French celebrities struck again. The news is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by chanteur-news-fr.info on October 24, 2018 titled \"Accident grave \u00e0 Paris - Le c\u00e9l\u00e8bre chanteur Ma\u00eetre Gims est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 aujourd'hui \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 33 ans, des suites d'un accident de la route.\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nSerious accident in Paris - The famous singer Ma\u00eetre Gims died today at the age of 33, following a road accident. Master Gims, whose real name is Gandhi Djuna, is a Congolese rapper, singer and composer born on May 6, 1986 in Kinshasa2. He comes from a family of musicians, his father was a singer of the group Viva La Musica of Papa Wemba3,4 and he has brothers rappers. Member of the group Sexion d'Assaut, he released his first solo album Subliminal in 2013. The album has a commercial success with more than 1,000,000 copies sold5. In 2017, Master Gims has sold more than 5 million albums since the beginning of his career6.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so they might have mistaken it for real news:\n\nHowever, chanteur-news-fr.info was involved with a viral death hoax before only a few days ago, we reported on that here:\n\nYou'll notice the exact same cause of death and the style of the article was identical too: most of it was taken up by a biography copy-pasted from elsewhere. And the photo that went with the story seems to have been taken from a story in the Romanian media about an accident there:\n\nThat would explain why the firemen in the picture have the Romanian word \"Pompieri\" on their uniforms instead of \"Pompiers\" which one would expect in Paris, France.\n\nNo other news outlets reported on the news, and the site itself seems to have been registered in Russia about two months ago.", "lang": "en"}
