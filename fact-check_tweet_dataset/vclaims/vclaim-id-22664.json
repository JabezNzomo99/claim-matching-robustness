It is being claimed that these images are the visual evidence of TMC workers who are supposedly seen vandalizing Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar\u2019s statue.\n\nFew more individuals have shared the images with an identical narrative on Facebook and Twitter. A message tweeted with the images also claims that Muslims of the TMC had vandalised the statue.\n\nUpon reverse searching the image on Google, Alt News found that the images pertain to an incident when artefacts in Iraq were destroyed by ISIS terrorists. \u201cISIS has again destroyed cultural treasures, this time bulldozing the site of the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq, the nation\u2019s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said.\u201d, stated a report published by American news network CNN on March 5, 2015. The Guardian had also published the images in an op-ed related to the incident on February 27, 2015.\n\nIn conclusion, old photographs of 2015, showing ISIS terrorists destroying artefacts in northern Iraq were shared as TMC workers vandalizing the statue of Vidyasagar in West Bengal.", "lang": "en"}
