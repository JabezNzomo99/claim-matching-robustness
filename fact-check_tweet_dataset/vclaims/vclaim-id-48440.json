But what did Trump actually say?", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2019-10-17T12:04:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-48440", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-italy-mozzarella-president/", "vclaim": "In October 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump called Italy's president 'Mozzarella' and claimed the U.S. and Italy had been allies for thousands of years.\n\nIn October 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s public appearances with his Italian counterpart, Sergio Mattarella, gave rise to a veritable explosion of viral claims that Trump had butchered his guest\u2019s name, referring to him as \u201cPresident Mozzarella.\u201d Widely shared memes also claimed that Trump had said the United States and Italy had been allies since the era of ancient Rome.\n\nNotably absent from the many social media posts that expressed a mixture of glee and horror at Trump\u2019s supposed \u201cMozzarella\u201d gaffe was any video footage. The reason for that absence was that the president never actually referred to his Italian counterpart as \u201cMozzarella.\u201d\n\nTrump and Mattarella held three public events together on Oct. 16: They spoke to the press before their bilateral meeting at the Oval Office; held a press conference; and spoke at a reception in the evening. Video footage is available of all three events.\n\nWe watched those three events in full and found no instance in which Trump referred to Mattarella as \u201cPresident Mozzarella.\u201d By contrast, Trump uttered the Italian president\u2019s last name correctly on four occasions:\n\nFurthermore, Trump never actually claimed that the United States and Italy had been allies since the era of ancient Rome, something that would clearly be wrong because the U.S. was only founded as an independent nation in 1776, and Italy was only unified in the 19th century, becoming a republic in the 1940s.\n\nWhat Trump actually said, in his opening remarks during the press conference, was as follows:\n\n\u201cThe United States and Italy are bound together by a shared cultural and political heritage dating back thousands of years, to ancient Rome \u2026\u201d\n\nTrump said the two countries share a political and cultural heritage, and that that heritage dates back thousands of years. He did not claim that the two countries have shared an alliance for thousands of years \u2014 something that would have required both nations to exist as polities during the era of the Roman Empire, which clearly neither did.\n\nThe phrase \u201cdating back thousands of years\u201d evidently caused many commentators to misunderstand the meaning of Trump\u2019s remarks. But it\u2019s the heritage that goes back that far, not the binding of the two nations.\n\nThe influence of the Roman Republic on the formation and principles of the American Republic is well-documented, and Trump\u2019s point was historically sound.", "lang": "en"}
