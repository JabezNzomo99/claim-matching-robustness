Several social media users shared the video on Facebook and Twitter with the same claim. The Quint also received a query on the claim being made in the video on its WhatsApp tipline number.\n\nWe scanned the replies on Paras Gupta\u2019s tweet and found that users pointed out that the people in the video are not speaking in Malayalam, but Telugu. Using relevant keyword search, we came across a video uploaded by TV9 Telugu in 2017 with the caption: \u201cRape attempt on girl filmed and uploaded on Social Media.\u201d The video identified the location as Kanigiri in Andhra Pradesh\u2019s Prakasam district. TV9 Telugu had the visuals in 2017 and mentioned that it is from Kanigiri. Pic Shows Three IPS Officers From Same Family? It\u2019s a False Claim We also found an article published by NDTV in September 2017 mentioning the details of the case. The article stated that a 19-year-old college student was groped and assaulted by her boyfriend and the video was shared by the accused and two of his friends on social media. The three men, in question, were then arrested in Prakasam district. \u201cThe police say the girl and her friend had gone to a temple to meet the accused man, B Sai, whom she had reportedly known for over a year,\u201d the report added. Regarding the video being circulated with communal claims, K Venkateswara Rao, circle inspector, Kanigiri confirmed to The Quint that there is no communal angle to the incident.\n\nEvidently, an old incident has been revived with the false claim that it took place in Kerala, when in reality, the video is from Andhra Pradesh.
