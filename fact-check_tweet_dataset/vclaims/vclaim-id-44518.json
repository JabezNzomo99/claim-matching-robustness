This is fake and disinformation in the spirit of previous American administrations,\" said Andrey Krasov, deputy chair of Russian Duma Defense Committee.\n\nReports about Russia air assets going to Libya appeared a week before the AFRICOM\u2019s statement. On May 21, Fathi Bashagha, the GNA\u2019s security chief in Tripoli, told Bloomberg News that \u201cat least six MiG 29s and two Sukhoi 24s had flown into the east from the Russian-controlled Hmeimim Air Base in Syria, escorted by two Su-35 Russian air force jets.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the reported deployment of Russian military aircraft to Libya in his blog, The Aviationist, Rome-based freelance journalist David Cenciotti wrote that he was \"not sure this actually happened, at least not the way it has been reported.\"\n\nHowever, in an update to his May 21 blog entry, Cenciotti reported that a satellite image showing one MiG-29 being towed at al-Jufra air base had confirmed the presence of at least one such Russian fighter jet in Libya. On May 26, The Aviationist discussed the impact of this development on the power balance in Libya.\n\nOn May 21, another confirmation came from Jeffrey Bardin, a U.S. Air Force veteran and a cyber intelligence analyst, who posted on LinkedIn a satellite image of al-Jufra air base, showing \u201cthe presence of a MiG-29 fighter and a number of other fighters.\u201d\n\nThe Drive, a website that covers military affairs and cars, reported on May 21, 26 and 27 the presence of multiple Russian fighter jets on the airbase in the LNA-controlled territory. The site said the jets \u201cwere indeed at Russia's air base in western Syria just days before the MiG-29 was spotted in Libya.\u201d\n\nAirwars.org, a U.K.-based military aviation watchdog, has been monitoring this situation since May 20, Chris Woods, the website\u2019s director, told Polygraph.info.\n\n\u201cIt's reasonable to conclude that fighter aircraft have recently been supplied to the LNA by Russia,\u201d Woods said. \u201cWhat remains unclear is whether those aircraft will be flown by mercenaries or by pilots with the Russian air force.\u201d\n\nOn May 26, the LNA's Army Twitter account also retweeted the AFRICOM's report about the deployment of the Russian aircraft, without denying it.\n\nAccording to the Russian state-owned news agency Sputnik, an LNA representative speaking on Al Arabiya TV called AFRICOM\u2019s statements about the arrival of Russian military aircraft in Libya \u201cstrange.\u201d However, there was no indication the LNA representative denied it had happened.\n\nThe United Nations imposed Arms embargo on Libya in 2011.\n\nThe civil war in Libya is becoming \u201cincreasingly internationalized,\u201d Airwars.org\u2019s Chris Woods said. On one side, Turkey is providing military support to the Tripoli-based GNA; on the other, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia are backing the LNA forces lead by Khalifa Haftar.\n\nRussia has denied involvement in Libya, but a recently leaked U.N. report said Moscow has deployed about 1,200 mercenaries from Russia\u2019s Wagner Group to strengthen Haftar\u2019s forces.\n\nCentral Asian sources report that Wagner has been actively recruiting mercenaries in war-impoverished Syria \u201cusing the same tactics as ISIS\u201d \u2013 promising big rewards but instead using the new recruits as cannon fodder.\n\nLibya has been in turmoil for the last nine years. The UN estimates that hundreds of civilians have been killed and thousands injured, while millions have reportedly been forcibly displaced and are in dire need of humanitarian aid.", "lang": "en"}
