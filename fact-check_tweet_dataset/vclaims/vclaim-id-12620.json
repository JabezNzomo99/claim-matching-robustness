We looked at the country\u2019s books.\n\nObi is yet to respond to Africa Check\u2019s questions about the source of his claim and whether he was referring to local or foreign debt, or both. (\n\ndomestic, external and subnational debt, as well as bonds, treasury bills and other tools the government can use to raise money.\n\nThe subnational debt \u2013 owed by lower levels of the government \u2013 includes loans taken out by Abuja\u2019s federal capital territory and the country\u2019s 36 states..\n\nNaira debt has almost doubled since Buhari took over\n\nThe debt office reports on Nigeria's debt every three months. Its\n\nthat at the end of March 2015 - two months before Buhari took office on 29 May - the country owed a total of N12 trillion.\n\nAt the end of June 2015, this debt\n\nto N12.1 trillion. This was US$63.8 billion at the official exchange rate of the time,\n\nBy the end of June 2018, total public debt had\n\nto N22.4 trillion. The debt office said the latest increase comprised of a US$2.5 billion Eurobond\n\nThis took Nigeria\u2019s total debt to US$73.2 billion, using the\n\ns 2018 exchange rate of N305 to the dollar.\n\nWhat is the government borrowing for?\n\nin its 2017 report on Nigeria\u2019s national debt.\n\n\u201cWhile Nigeria\u2019s total public debt stock is relatively low vis-\u00e0-vis the country\u2019s GDP, the increased funding requirements needed to sustain the economic recovery, address the huge infrastructural deficit, as well as meet budget financing requirements, would entail enormous funding resources, including borrowing,\u201d\n\nof the economics department at the\n\nfocuses on development macroeconomics and public finance. He told Africa Check the debt might be worrying, but would be justified if it were used for development projects and not just for regular spending on, for example, salaries and overheads.\n\n\u201cThe debt profile is high but it's not in the red lines yet,\u201d Saibu said. \u201cThe problem is that the debt cannot continue to increase; there must be a check on it. And the question is, what are they using the debt for? The quality of projects, productivity and impact of the projects are what matters.\u201d\n\nDoes Nigeria\u2019s government owe even more?\n\nWhile Obi\u2019s claim is largely true, the real picture of Nigeria\u2019s debt is larger than what\u2019s reported by the debt office, according to\n\n. He is the head of research at\n\n, a civil society organisation that works to make public spending transparent and accountable.\n\n\u201cWhat you see at the Debt Management Office is just a fraction of Nigeria's debt,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are special accounts that are dedicated by law, but unfortunately the federal government has been taking funds from [them] to meet its budgetary obligations.\u201d\n\nSamuel said the government had been drawing from \u201cfunds like the ecological fund, even borrowing\n\nand the overdrafts it takes from the Central Bank - which is now about N4 trillion - and there are also judgment debts.\u201d\n\nThese would add to the debt \u201cif you look at debt from the globally accepted definition, as these are still obligations to the government\u201d.\n\nConclusion: Nigeria\u2019s debt rose from N12.1 trillion ($63.8 billion) in 2015 to N22.4 trillion ($73.2 billion) in 2018\n\nIn campaigning for Nigeria\u2019s 2019 elections, politician Peter Obi said President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government had increased the country\u2019s debt to $80 billion.\n\nDebt Management Office records show Nigeria owed N12.1 trillion in June 2015, a month after Buhari took office. This was US$63.8 billion at the exchange rate of the time. By June 2018 total public debt had risen to N22.4 trillion, or $73.2 billion.\n\nAn expert said the debt could be even higher as the government took money from funds set aside for other purposes.\n\nWe therefore rate the claim as mostly correct.", "lang": "en"}
