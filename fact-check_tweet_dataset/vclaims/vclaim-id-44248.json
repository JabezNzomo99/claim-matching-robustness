The circumstances around Issachar\u2019s arrest are more complex, and the Russians had offered her up in an earlier prison swap.\n\nIssachar, now 27, was taken into custody last April in the Moscow Sheremetyevo airport. She was in transit from India to Israel when the Russian police said they found about 9.6 grams of marijuana in luggage she checked when registering for her flight in New Delhi.\n\nAuthorities charged Issachar with carrying contraband narcotics. Issachar denied the charges, saying she had no access to her luggage and had no idea how cannabis got into her bag. She also argued that she had no intention of entering Russia during her brief layover at the Moscow airport. Nonetheless, a Moscow court in October sentenced her to 7.5 years in prison; in December an appeals court upheld the sentence.\n\nAs it turns out, Putin\u2019s assertion that it was \u201cvery good\u201d Issachar didn\u2019t cross the Russian border echoed the very arguments used by her defense.\n\nA Sheremetyevo customs officer testified in the court in October as a defense witness and said Issachar\u2019s luggage \u201cdid not cross the customs border and her actions did not constitute the crime of contraband.\u201d Airport authorities also sent a written statement to the court saying transit luggage is not a subject of a customs security search. In October and again in December, however, the court rejected those arguments as an \u201cattempt to escape justice\u201d by Issachar.\n\nIssachar\u2019s family said then the sentencing was \u201cludicrous.\u201d\n\nA public campaign was launched to free the New Jersey-born woman from Russian confinement. Netanyahu rallied to her cause.\n\nLast October, the Russian and Israeli news agencies reported that Russia offered to exchange Issachar for the Russian hacker Alexei Burkov, who at the time was being held in Israel and was wanted for extradition by the U.S.\n\nTel-Aviv refused the deal, and Burkov was extradited to the U.S.\n\nOn Jan. 23 in Virginia, Burkov pleaded guilty to \u201caccess device fraud and conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, identity theft, wire and access device fraud, and money laundering, and faces a maximum sentence of fifteen years in prison when sentenced on May 8.\u201d\n\nThe cyber security news site Krebsonsecurity.com said, Burkov was \u201can asset of supreme importance\u201d to Moscow and had run highly sophisticated secretive forums for \u201celite\u201d hackers.\n\nBut failure of the prisoner swap did not discourage Russia. Instead, the focus shifted to transfer of ownership of a building, the Alexander Courtyard in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, to the Russian Orthodox Church. Russia had been seeking the property for more than a decade, The Times of Israel reported.\n\nFor Netanyahu, currently facing corruption charges and elections in March, freeing an Israeli woman whose predicament had moved millions is politically beneficial, the paper said.\n\nIssachar was released as Netanyahu headed to Moscow for a meeting with Putin about a U.S. peace plan for the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThe announcement Tuesday by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office of the trip to Russia came less than an hour after Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit filed an indictment against Netanyahu for charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust with the Jerusalem District Court,\u201d The Times of Israel report on Issachar said.", "lang": "en"}
