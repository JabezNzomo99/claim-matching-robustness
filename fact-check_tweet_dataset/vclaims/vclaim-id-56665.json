The claim is misleading; screenshots from the video were published Taiwanese news reports in late April 2020 about a deadly assault in Taiwan over a financial dispute; Hong Kong\u2019s representative office in Taiwan said it had not been notified about any deaths of Hong Kong residents following an assault between April and May 2020.\n\nThe video was uploaded here to a Facebook group with more than 8,000 members on May 9, 2020.\n\nThe five-minute, 23-second footage shows a man beaten by several men wielding baseball bats in a room. Conversations in Mandarin about money issues can be heard throughout the video.\n\nTranslated to English, a warning banner, written in traditional Chinese characters, at the bottom of the video explains due to its graphic nature, \u201cthis footage has been covered so you can decide if you want to see it.\u201d\n\nThe caption, written in colloquial Cantonese, translates to English as: \u201cAren\u2019t our sau zuks who escaped to Taiwan taken care of by like-minded people? Why even\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSau zuk\u201d, literally translates as \u201chands and feet\u201d, is a Cantonese slang term widely used to describe pro-democracy protesters who participated in the 2019 Hong Kong protests, as reported by local newspaper South China Morning Post here, and here by online news site Quartz.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s political unrest has prompted more of its residents to consider moving to nearby democractic Taiwan since 2019, according to this AFP report.\n\nThe video was also shared alongside a similar claim here and here on Facebook.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading.\n\nA reverse image search using keyframes from the video in the misleading post found this May 5, 2020, report published by the Taiwanese branch of Hong Kong newspaper Apple Daily.\n\nThe report, which is titled \u201c[Torture footage leaked] Man stole $200,000 from collected debt / beaten to death by seven gang members,\u201d states that on April 29, 2020, a 21-year-old man was beaten to death in a flat in Taipei, Taiwan, over an alleged accusation that he had stolen $200,000.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Apple Daily article:\n\nThe article also contains several screenshots that correspond with the video in the misleading posts.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading post (L) and one of the images published by Apple Daily (R):\n\nSimilar screenshots from the assault footage were also published in other Taiwanese news reports, including here by broadcaster TVBS News and here by news website ETtoday.\n\nHong Kong Economic, Trade and Cultural Office, the city\u2019s representative office in Taiwan, told AFP in an email on May 12, 2020, that it had not received any reports of a recent incident in which a Hong Kong resident was beaten to death.\n\n\u201cFrom 1 April to today (12 May), the Hong Kong Economic, Trade and Cultural Office has not been informed by the local authorities of any death cases concerning Hong Kong residents due to assault,\u201d the email reads.", "lang": "en"}
