The image gives a breakdown of income, VAT, and gasoline taxes in Germany, England, Italy and Greece, as examples of countries with what they call socialist policies.\n\nThe image makes the claim that in Germany, income and VAT taxes, as well as gasoline (per gallon) with tax are respectively 47.4%, 19%, and $6.04. In England, these same measures are respectively 47%, 20%, and $6.10. In Italy, 45.8%, 22%, and $6.84. And in Greece, 65%, 24%, and $6.83.\n\nAccording to the European Union, income taxes follow a progressive model in Germany, here. The income tax bands are as follows:\n\nIncomes between \u20ac9,000 and \u20ac54,949: 14 to 42%\n\nThe highest incomes (those above \u20ac260,533) have an income tax rate of 45%. The part of the claim about Germany\u2019s income tax rate is therefore false. Only incomes over \u20ac260,533 come close at 45%.\n\nThe standard VAT rate in Germany is 19%, while the reduced VAT rate (applicable on specific goods and services and exempting most electronically supplied services) is 7% (here). The part of the claim about Germany's VAT tax rate is therefore true.\n\nBloomberg placed the average price of a gallon of gas in the fourth quarter of 2019 at $5.85, here. Given market fluctuations, it is not unreasonable to consider the part of the claim about gasoline prices in Germany to be true.\n\nRegarding the claims about England, Reuters was able to check according to the information hosted on the United Kingdom's government website. On the website www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates, the income tax bands are as follows:\n\nThe part of the claim about England\u2019s income tax rate is therefore false. Only incomes over \u00a3150,000 come close at 45%.\n\nIn the country, www.gov.uk/vat-rates the standard VAT rate (for most goods and services) is 20%. The reduced rate (applicable to some goods and services like children\u2019s car seats and home energy) is 5%, while food and children\u2019s clothes have a 0% VAT. The part of the claim about England's VAT rate is mostly true, with some exceptions.\n\nBloomberg placed the average price of a gallon of gas in the fourth quarter of 2019 at $6.17, here. Given market fluctuations, it is not unreasonable to consider the part of the claim about England's gasoline prices to be true.\n\nAccording to the European Union here, in Italy the progressive income tax bands are as follows:\n\nThe highest incomes (those above \u20ac75,001) have a capped income tax rate of 43%. The part of the claim about Italy\u2019s income tax rate is therefore false. Only incomes over \u20ac75,001 come close at 43%.\n\nIn Italy, the standard VAT rate is 22%, while the reduced VAT rate is between 5 and 10% (see here).\u200b The part of the claim about Italy's VAT tax rate is therefore mostly true.\n\nBloomberg placed the average price of a gallon of gas in the fourth quarter of 2019 at $6.69, here\u200b Given market fluctuations, it is not unreasonable to consider the part of the claim about Italy's gasoline prices to be true.\n\nAccording to the European Union here, in Greece there are different tax rates for different kinds of incomes. The income tax schedule for income from paid employment, entrepreneurial activities, and pensions is as follows:\n\nIncomes over \u20ac40,000 are subject to 45% in taxes. The part of the claim about Greece\u2019s income tax rate is therefore false. The highest bracket, 45% for incomes over \u20ac40,000 do not come close to 65% as claimed.\n\nIn Greece, the standard VAT rate is 24%, while the reduced VAT rate is between 6 and 13% (see here).\u200b The part of the claim about Greece's VAT tax rate is therefore mostly true.\n\nBloomberg placed the average price of a gallon of gas in the fourth quarter of 2019 at $6.82 here\u200b Given market fluctuations, it is not unreasonable to consider the part of the claim about Greece's gasoline prices to be true.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that while many countries in Europe have smaller socialist or communist parties within their multiparty systems, they are not countries living under \u201csocialism\u201d. European countries all embrace a capitalist economic system balanced with varying degrees of state welfare programs. Generally, only the Nordic/Scandinavian countries (none present in this claim) are considered \u201cSocial Democratic\u201d (not \u201csocialist\u201d), and are the most left-leaning on this scale (read more here and here).\n\nPartly false: the VAT and gasoline prices listed are accurate but the income tax figures are not. The percentages are incorrect, certainly not reflective of tax rates on average incomes and are above even the rates applied to the highest incomes in these countries.", "lang": "en"}
