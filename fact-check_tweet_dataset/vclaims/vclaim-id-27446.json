It actually comes from a 2011 communication campaign featuring photoshopped images of various world leaders kissing.\n\nObama and Chavez interacted a number of times in their capacities as the leaders of their respective nations. The Facebook post, shared more than 12,000 times, allegedly depicts Obama sharing a kiss with the late Venezuelan president.\n\nHowever, a quick reverse image search revealed that the image has been digitally manipulated. Italian fashion company Benetton\u2019s UNHATE Foundation created the photoshopped picture for its 2011 \u201cUnhate\u201d communication campaign to promote \u201creconciliation and tolerance,\u201d according to CNBC.\n\nOther campaign images showed German Chancellor Angela Merkel kissing former French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Pope Benedict XVI kissing Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb. The ad featuring the pope was later withdrawn after the Vatican took legal action against Benetton, according to Reuters.\n\nThe White House expressed disapproval of the campaign, which also included a photoshopped image of Obama lip-locked with former Chinese President Hu Jintao, in November 2011.

It deceptively portrays the image of Obama kissing Chavez as real.\n\nObama has been the subject of manipulated pictures in the past. In July, the former president appeared in a doctored image on Facebook that depicted him awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to former President Bill Clinton, comedian Bill Cosby, movie producer Harvey Weinstein and former congressman Anthony Weiner.", "lang": "en"}
