Such assertions are false, offensive.\u201d\n\nA search of the Foundations \u2019 database detailing the grants it has awarded in 2020 does not show support for protest actions.\n\n\u201cWe do not pay protesters. Neither does our founder George Soros. Claims that we do serve to delegitimize those who are exercising their Constitutionally-protected right to protest peacefully and petition their government for redress of grievances,\u201d the Foundations said on Facebook.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked several examples of false information circulating about the demonstrations over Floyd's death, including a fake Antifa tweet, false claims of a communications blackout during protests in Washington, DC, and a doctored image of Adolf Hitler used to criticize President Donald Trump's actions during the protests.", "lang": "en"}
