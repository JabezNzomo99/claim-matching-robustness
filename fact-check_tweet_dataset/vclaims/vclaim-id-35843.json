Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: In Delhi Assembly Elections 2020, BJP lost 27 seats by a margin of less than 1000 votes. Fact: In Delhi Elections, only two seats were won by a margin of fewer than 1000 votes. In those two seats, one seat was won by AAP and the other by BJP. So, BJP lost only one seat by a margin of fewer than 1000 votes. Also, no seat was won by a margin of less than 100 votes. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn the Election Commission of India\u2019s website, all the details regarding the winning margins can be found. On analyzing the available data, it was found that the candidates won by a margin of fewer than 1000 votes in only two seats. In those two seats, one seat was won by AAP (in Bijwasan) and the other by BJP (in Laxmi Nagar). So, the claim that BJP lost 27 seats just by a margin of fewer than 1000 votes is false.\n\nAlso, it can be seen that, in 55 seats out of 70 seats, the candidates won by a margin of greater than 10,000 votes. While six seats were won by a margin of 5000-10000 votes, 7 seats were won by a margin of 1000-5000 votes. Only two seats were won by the candidates by a margin of fewer than 1000 votes. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, BJP lost only one seat by a margin of fewer than 1000 votes in Delhi Elections.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
