Turner painted many of his classics.\n\nTurner\u2019s image is featured on the other side of the note, along with one of his masterpieces, The Fighting Temeraire.\n\nTo the right, on a purple foil patch designed to prevent forgeries, the circular symbol some claim is the shape of the COVID-19 virus is actually based on the design of a staircase at the Tate Britain art gallery.\n\n\"Our banknotes celebrate the UK's extraordinarily rich and diverse heritage and highlight the contributions of its greatest citizens. Turner's art was transformative,\" Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said in February (here).\n\nMultiple social media posts, and even some media reports, have made unfounded connections between the installation of 5G infrastructure and the health crisis, either by making people sick or helping to spread COVID-19.\n\nThe Reuters Fact Check team debunked a claim that the launch of 5G is making people sick, rather than the coronavirus ( here ). The WHO says no research has linked exposure to wireless technology with negative health effects ( here ).\n\nFalse: claims that Britain\u2019s new 20 pound note contains imagery of the coronavirus and a 5G mast are false. The design includes Turner-based imagery and was produced shortly before the coronavirus pandemic began to significantly impact the country.", "lang": "en"}
