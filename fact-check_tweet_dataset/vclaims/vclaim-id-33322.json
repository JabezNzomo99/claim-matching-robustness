That, according to her math, comes out to more than 68,000 people a day.\n\nThe ILO report, published in 2017, is an estimate for the number of people on a given day \u201cengaged in forced labor \u2014 being forced to work under threat or coercion as domestic workers, on construction sites, in clandestine factories, on farms and fishing boats, in other sectors, and in the sex industry.\u201d It\u2019s important to remember that although forced labor is being used as a proxy for \u201chuman trafficking,\u201d people could be trafficked for other reasons, such as sham marriages. So \u201cforced labor\u201d is an imperfect substitute.\n\nThe biggest problem with AAI\u2019s methodology is that 24.9 million is a number for how many people are in forced labor now; it does not say 24.9 million people a year are engaged in forced labor. By dividing 24.9 million by 365 days, the organization is assuming that it\u2019s a new 24.9 million every year. That\u2019s wrong.\n\nAlso, AAI appears to assume that virtually all of these people cross borders \u2014 and that commercial airliners are often used to transport people. But the ILO report says the figure for forced labor outside a country of residence is only 23 percent of the total, mostly because the people who are mainly trafficked outside their countries are involved in the sex trade. Women and children trafficked for sexual exploitation \u2014 which is what most people think of when they hear \u201chuman trafficking\u201d \u2014 are a relatively small part of the overall trafficking problem. It is mostly labor exploitation, including state-imposed labor.\n\nBut that may be too generous. The report also says that 4.3 percent are coerced by withholding of a passport or other documents, which certainly sounds like people transported by airplanes. That gets us to about 700,000, or less than 2,000 a day.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to vouch for that number, because it is an estimate of an estimate, and possibly a lowball figure. But it\u2019s an example of how these statistics are often fuzzy, especially when you dig into the details. Advocacy groups should not try to twist them into talking points.\n\nFifty-seven percent is higher than 23 percent. But you cannot easily use the 57 percent figure from UNODC in conjunction with the ILO report. They have different methodologies. The ILO report was based on a survey of almost 72,000 people in 48 countries, which asked about experiences in their own family networks, and then it was adjusted to produce a global figure \u2014 essentially an extrapolated estimate. The UNODC number is based on data from 63,251 victims detected in 106 countries between 2012 and 2014. That is a large data set, but it may not be representative of all victims of human trafficking.\n\nBoth facts can\u2019t be true. Either there are 25 million victims of global slavery and 23 percent are living outside their country of residence or 63,000 victims of trafficking were interviewed and 57 percent were trafficked across at least one international border. (An article on the Forbes website makes a similar error to come up with a number of 28,500 trafficking victims a day traveling on commercial airlines.)\n\nAs we often warn, advocacy groups that seek to combat human trafficking do a disservice to their cause by inflating the numbers or using figures that simply aren\u2019t credible. No one really knows how many people a day are trafficked on commercial airlines, and we should not pretend that there is a solid figure.", "lang": "en"}
