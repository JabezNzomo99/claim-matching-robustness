The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council have conducted 99.99 percent of the total nuclear tests.\"\n\nAs a matter of policy, PolitiFact does not take totalitarian dictatorships at their word. Beyond that, we were simply curious which countries have done nuclear weapons testing, and how much. So we decided to check this claim.\n\nAccording to a report from the Natural Resources Defense Council, there have been 2,051 nuclear tests worldwide since 1945 done by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council:\n\nThere have been only a handful of other tests, although there are doubts about the exact number.\n\nIn 1974, India tested a nuclear device, although it produced a relatively small explosive yield. India claimed to have detonated five more nuclear devices in May 1998. In response to the Indian tests, Pakistan announced that it had exploded five nuclear devices a couple weeks later.\n\nIt has been widely speculated that India and Pakistan exaggerated the number and size of the explosions for political reasons. Nonetheless, that's the number of announced nuclear tests.\n\nSince then, North Korea is the only country to perform an announced test. Its first came in 2006. And then on May 26, 2009, North Korea announced that it had successfully conducted its second underground nuclear test, in defiance of international warnings.\n\nSo arguably, there have been as many as 13 nuclear tests conducted by countries other than the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, said Carey Sublette, creator of the Nuclear Weapon Archive, which tracks nuclear testing via public records. By Sublette's count, there have been a total of 2,054 nuclear tests. That means 99.37 percent of all the tests were done by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, he said.\n\n\"It's about right,\" Sublette said of the figures cited by North Korea. \"If it's off, it's only off by a few (tests).\"\n\nWe aren't inclined to quibble with fractions of one percent. We find North Korea's claim to be True.", "lang": "en"}
