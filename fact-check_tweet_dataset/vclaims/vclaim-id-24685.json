She told reporters in 2015 that she had been a U.S. citizen for more than a decade.\n\nOn Oct. 8, 2015, Witcher joined then-candidate Donald Trump on stage at a rally in Las Vegas where she declared her support for him, holding up an issue of People magazine that featured Trump and his family on the cover.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Hispanic and I vote for Mr. Trump. We vote for Mr. Trump!\u201d Witcher said on stage. \u201cMr. Trump, we love you. We love you all the way to the White House.\u201d\n\nThe claim that Witcher, who was born in Colombia, has since been deported is false. The claim appears to have originated on a website that describes itself as satire.\n\nShe told reporters at the time of the rally that she had become a U.S. citizen about 14 years earlier. As rumors of her deportation spread, she confirmed to a local news outlet in December 2016 that she had not been deported and continues to support Trump.\n\nWitcher authored the book \u201cDonald Trump: America First and Great Again\u201d in 2016. In that book, she writes, \u201cAfter immigrating to the United States, I became a U.S. citizen. I am married to a wonderful man, a native-born American from Texas.\u201d\n\nThroughout the book, she explains why she supports Trump\u2019s policies, including his stances on immigration.", "lang": "en"}
