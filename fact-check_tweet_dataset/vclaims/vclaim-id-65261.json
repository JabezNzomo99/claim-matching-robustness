The fact that Senator Feingold attacked me, saying I\u2019ve done nothing on this -- completely false. And quite honestly, a very disgusting false attack.\"\n\nFeingold: \"I didn\u2019t say he did nothing.\"\n\nGousha: \"There was a radio ad that said that Senator Johnson essentially did nothing.\"\n\nGousha was correct. A Feingold campaign radio ad released Sept. 6, 2016 says:\n\n\"Heroin addiction and opioid abuse are killing Wisconsin, and yet after six years in Washington, Sen. Ron Johnson has essentially done nothing.\"\n\nJohnson pushed back by posting the video clip of the debate exchange on Twitter and with a digital ad responding to Feingold\u2019s attack.\n\nSo, let\u2019s check the claim in the radio ad: In the six years since Johnson took Feingold\u2019s seat in the 2010 election, has he \"essentially done nothing\" to fight heroin addiction and opioid abuse?\n\nThe lethal power of heroin and opioids (prescription painkillers such as oxycodone) has increasingly drawn the attention of politicians.\n\nPrince\u2019s death in April 2016 from fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, led Republican Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel to claim that more people die in Wisconsin from all types of drug overdoses than car crashes. We rated that claim True.\n\nA couple of months later, when Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said \"we\u2019re losing as many people to heroin and opioid overdoses as we lost to the AIDS epidemic at its peak,\" PolitiFact New York\u2019s rating was Mostly False. Deaths directly caused by AIDS (43,115) were higher at their peak in 1995. Nevertheless, the latest data show 28,647 people across the country died from heroin and opioid overdoses in 2014, a figure that has been steadily climbing.\n\nJohnson pushed back on Feingold\u2019s claim partly because a nephew of Johnson\u2019s died from a fentanyl overdose. (Initially, when Johnson revealed the death in March 2016, it was reported as a heroin overdose, but Johnson has since said it was fentanyl.)\n\nHere\u2019s what Johnson\u2019s campaign cited to us in terms of actions Johnson has taken:\n\n1. Voted for the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which was approved almost unanimously in Congress before being signed into law by President Barack Obama in July 2016.\n\nObama described the law as modest and complained that Republicans blocked an additional $920 million in funding supported by Democrats.\n\nBut the law does authorize $181 million in new federal money for opioid and heroin abuse efforts. Moreover, the bill also makes policy changes in what the nonpartisan Pew Charitable Trusts described as the first \"multifaceted federal response to the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic.\"\n\n2. Introduced in April 2016 the Promoting Responsible Opioid Prescribing Act, which is aimed at reducing financial incentives for doctors who over-prescribe pain medications. The bill has been referred to a committee.\n\n3. The same month, as chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, held field hearings about the opioid problem in Pewaukee, Wis., and Cleveland, Ohio. He also held a hearing in Phoenix in November 2015 on \"America\u2019s heroin epidemic at the border.\"\n\n4. Johnson also takes credit for a bipartisan investigation done by his committee. A report by the committee, which was disclosed in May 2016, found oversight problems at the Veterans Affairs facility in Tomah, Wis., where the prescription of painkillers to veterans has been under scrutiny.\n\nFeingold's campaign has pointed to Johnson's votes against two amendments \u2014 the first for $1.1 billion to combat heroin addiction, the second for $600 million in emergency funding to fight the opioid crisis.\n\nMore specifically, his campaign criticized Johnson for a no vote in June 2016 on a cloture motion (to limit debate). That motion was in regard to an amendment to a defense authorization bill that would have authorized $18 billion for various purposes, including $1.1 billion to fight heroin and opioid addiction. Johnson also voted no in March 2016 on a motion to \"waive all applicable budgetary discipline\" in order to make appropriations to fight the heroin and opioid problem, which the Feingold said would have provided $600 million.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to criticize Johnson for what he didn\u2019t do -- but that wasn\u2019t Feingold\u2019s claim.\n\nQualifying his claim only slightly, Feingold says Johnson \"has essentially done nothing\" to fight heroin addiction and opioid abuse.\n\nJohnson has voted for a major bill aimed at confronting the heroin-opioids problem, introduced a bill aimed at curbing overprescription of opioids and held Senate committee hearings on the problem. That\u2019s more than nothing.", "lang": "en"}
