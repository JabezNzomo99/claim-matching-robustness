Above the photos, a caption states: \"Illegal blockades causing shelf shortages in the Maritimes,\" in reference to Canada's Atlantic provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince-Edward-Island.\n\nScreenshot of a Facebook post taken on February 24, 2020\n\nThe post was published on February 21 by Nova Scotia Proud, a conservative-leaning Facebook page, and subsequently shared by New Brunswick Proud and Proud To Be A Canadian, two affiliated pages.\n\nALSO READ: Delhi CAA Riots: Fake News Of DCP Amit Sharma's Death Goes Viral\n\nHowever, the post is misleading because the photo of the store was not taken in Canada, but in a supermarket in Atlanta, in the US state of Georgia, in February 2014.

I didn't see any shelves like that when I was in the grocery store this weekend picking up my groceries,\" Sullivan said.\n\nMike Hammoud, president of the Atlantic Convenience Store Association, also told AFP that \"there are some empty spaces on shelves but they're not all completely empty like that picture.\"\n\nALSO READ: Medal Of Honor Game Footage Shared As Canadian Sniper's World Record\n\nCTV News' local affiliate also reported some shortages of non-perishable items.\n\nFederal government officials told reporters that the blockades were having a negative impact on Canada's economy, with freight traffic suspended and 1,000 rail workers temporarily laid off. \"It could even affect our GDP if it continues,\" transportation minister Marc Garneau said Sunday.\n\nOne of the main blockades, in Tyendinaga, a township east of Toronto, was dismantled on Monday by the Ontario Provincial Police.", "lang": "en"}
