Instead, we will set the record straight and recap what was reported in the initial story, the Clinton campaign\u2019s criticism of the coverage and the AP\u2019s defense.\n\nBut there was much more to the actual story, and that becomes clear once you get past the headline. The AP analyzed State Department records and looked specifically at Clinton\u2019s meetings on the phone or in person with 154 people who were not federal employees or foreign government representatives. This narrowed down the denominator to a small subcategory of people Clinton met with as secretary of state, since the majority of her diplomatic work would involve representatives of foreign governments.\n\nThe AP found that 85 of those 154 people, or \u201cmore than half,\u201d had donated to the Clinton Foundation or \u201cpledged commitments to its international programs.\u201d The 85 donors collectively contributed as much as $156 million, the AP reported. There were representatives from at least 16 foreign governments, who donated as much as $170 million to the charity, but those representatives were not included in the 154 number, the AP reported.\n\nThe AP explained in the story that it had first requested State Department calendars and schedules in 2010, then in 2013. After delays, the outlet sued the State Department for the records. This analysis was based on the first batch of records released to the AP, covering about half of Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary.\n\nThe AP story doesn\u2019t allege any pay-for-play, though Trump suggested it in his speech. The AP quoted State Department spokesman Mark Toner saying there are no prohibitions against the agency having contact with \u201cpolitical campaigns, nonprofits or foundations \u2014 including the Clinton Foundation.\u201d Toner told the AP that \u201cmeeting requests, recommendations and proposals come to the department through a variety of channels, both formal and informal.\u201d\n\nFallon said the data omitted more than 1,700 meetings Clinton had with world leaders as secretary of state. If 1,700 becomes the denominator, then 85 people comprise 5 percent of 1,700 meetings \u2013 rather than representing \u201cmore than half\u201d of 154. Fallon told The Washington Post\u2019s Erik Wemple Blog that the campaign requested that the AP remove or amend the tweet.\n\nPaul Colford, the AP\u2019s vice president and director of media relations, defended the AP\u2019s reporting. He said in a statement that the AP has been transparent in how it reported the story and further explained why the AP focused on the 154 people.\n\nThe AP \u201cfocused on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s meetings and calls involving people outside government who were not federal employees or foreign diplomats, because meeting with U.S. or foreign government officials would inherently have been part of her job as secretary of state,\u201d Colford\u2019s statement read. \u201cWe focused on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s meetings and calls involving those people outside her duties as secretary of state whom she chose to include in her busy schedule.\u201d\n\nIn her Aug. 24 interview on CNN, Clinton said the AP report excluded nearly 2,000 meetings and looked at a small portion of her time as secretary of state. Drawing a conclusion that she met with people like Wiesel, Gates and Yunus because of their foundation connections, rather than their status as global leaders, \u201cis absurd,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nBy the time Trump repeated the story\u2019s findings at his rally nearly 24 hours after the promotional tweet, he relayed the AP\u2019s reporting inaccurately. Trump said that \u201c50 percent of people who saw her had to make a contribution to the Clinton Foundation.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not what the AP found, at all. The AP focused on 85 out of 154 people who met with Clinton but were not foreign government representatives or federal employees. It is based on partial records released by the State Department so far and does not reflect the full scope of people with whom Clinton met as secretary of state.\n\nWe know Trump doesn\u2019t read much, so perhaps he didn\u2019t go beyond the headline on this story. In fact, 60 percent of people share stories on social media without even reading the material. (By the way, #SavedYouAClick Twitter users, you\u2019re not helping.) But there are many more nuanced and important details in the story that are being misrepresented \u2014 by the AP\u2019s own promotional tweet, and by Trump.\n\n[Update: After our fact-check published, Trump changed his wording and accurately summarized the AP story at a rally on Aug. 25:\"As the Associated Press documented, more than half of the meetings Hillary Clinton took as Secretary of State with people outside government were Clinton Foundation donors.\" Kudos to Trump for making the change. ]", "lang": "en"}
