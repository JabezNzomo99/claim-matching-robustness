A spokesperson for Culkin said the quote is fabricated.\n\nCulkin rose to fame with his lead childhood role in the film \u201cHome Alone,\u201d which premiered in 1990. As the star of the \u201cHome Alone\u201d franchise and other films, Culkin became one of the highest-paid child actors in history, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe statement attributed to Culkin starts with the phrase \u201cYou learn to recognize early on which of them want to abuse you.\u201d It quotes Culkin as describing the alleged abuse of child stars in Hollywood, including an incident in which a man dressed in a suit purportedly showed him shoes made from another child actor\u2019s flesh on the set of the second \u201cHome Alone\u201d movie in New York.\n\nThere is no evidence Culkin made the statement, despite articles from the websites YourNewsWire and NeonNettles reporting he did. Both websites allege the French news outlet Les Echos covered the story. However, Les Echos confirmed to the French fact-checking website Hoax Buster that it never published such a report.\n\nYourNewsWire, which now goes by NewsPunch, is known for sharing misinformation online, having been fact-checked at least 80 times, according to Poynter. The article is not available on NewsPunch\u2019s domain.
