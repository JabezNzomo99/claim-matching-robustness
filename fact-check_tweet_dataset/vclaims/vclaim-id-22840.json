First, a report issued by a Republican-led House committee \u2014 often touted by Trump \u2014 disclosed in 2018 that there had been an ongoing counterintelligence investigation of Flynn. So that\u2019s not new information. Second, Trump was warned by President Barack Obama not to hire Flynn \u2014 and the report by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III says that warning actually soured Trump on Flynn.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about the warnings Trump received about Flynn. In a narrow, technical sense, Trump was not warned that Flynn was being investigated as a possible Russian agent. But there were plenty of other flashing lights that Flynn was trouble \u2014 warnings that Trump chose to ignore.\n\nFlynn was fired on Feb. 13, 2017, in the opening weeks of the Trump administration, after he supposedly misled Vice President Pence about a conversation with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn had claimed he had not requested the Russian government decline to respond to sanctions imposed by Obama, when, in fact, he had delivered that message and Russia had agreed. (The whole story can be seen in our compelling video above.)\n\nMueller secured Flynn\u2019s guilty plea to lying to FBI agents, who, on Jan. 24, had interviewed him about his conversations with Kislyak. U.S. officials had become aware of the Flynn-Kislyak conversations because of intelligence monitoring of Kislyak, as they tried to determine why Russia had decided not to retaliate in response to the sanctions.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee report detailed that Flynn had already been the subject of a counterintelligence investigation. It was possibly sparked by his 2015 attendance at the 10th anniversary gala in Moscow for the state-sponsored Russian television network RT, for which he earned $45,000 and was seated next to President Vladimir Putin. The Mueller report indicates a key focus was Flynn\u2019s relationship with Kislyak: \u201cPreviously, the FBI had opened an investigation of Flynn based on his relationship with the Russian government. Flynn\u2019s contacts with Kislyak became a key component of that investigation.\u201d\n\nThen-FBI Director James B. Comey \u201ctestified that he authorized the closure of the CI [counterintelligence] investigation into General Flynn by late December 2016; however, the investigation was kept open due to the public discrepancy surrounding General Flynn\u2019s communications with Ambassador Kislyak,\u201d the House report said. \u201cDeputy Director [Andrew] McCabe stated that, \u2018We really had not substantiated anything particularly significant against General Flynn,\u2019 but did not recall that a closure of the CI investigation was imminent.\u201d\n\nBut who accompanied Trump to those briefings? Flynn \u2014 who presumably did not know he was the subject of a counterintelligence investigation. Trump responded to his first classified briefing by politicizing it, declaring he could tell that government officials were unhappy with Obama for not following expert advice.\n\n\u201cSeveral witnesses said that the President was unhappy with Flynn for other reasons at this time. [Senior adviser Stephen] Bannon said that Flynn\u2019s standing with the President was not good by December 2016. The President-Elect had concerns because President Obama had warned him about Flynn shortly after the election. (President Obama\u2019s comment sat with President-Elect Trump more than [press aide Hope] Hicks expected). [White House chief of staff Reince] Priebus said that the President had become unhappy with Flynn even before the story of his calls with Kislyak broke and had become so upset with Flynn that he would not look at him during intelligence briefings. Hicks said that the President thought Flynn had bad judgment and was angered by tweets sent by Flynn and his son, and she described Flynn as \u201cbeing on thin ice\u201d by early February 2017.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post reported in May 2017 that Obama raised his concern about Flynn on Nov. 10, two days after the election, when Trump visited the White House and met with Obama in the Oval Office. One official told The Post that Obama had not planned to raise concerns about Flynn, but \u201cas the two men discussed personnel, Obama expressed caution about putting Flynn in a high-level position. There were multiple reasons, the former official said, including Flynn\u2019s performance leading the DIA, his attendance at the RT event in Moscow, and his controversial statements on Islam.\u201d\n\nThe White House at the time claimed Trump dismissed Obama\u2019s advice because Obama had fired Flynn as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and Flynn had turned critical of Obama. But we now know Obama\u2019s warning had actually troubled Trump, though he chose not to act on it.\n\nThe president rarely takes responsibility for his actions. In this instance, he tries to pin on the FBI his own failure to heed warnings and vet carefully his personnel. Whether the FBI would have been comfortable telling a presidential candidate that the aide sitting by his side was the subject of a counterintelligence inquiry is an interesting question. The House Republican report suggested that it should have been considered.\n\nWhether Trump would have accepted such an explicit warning is open to question. He has been deeply skeptical of intelligence that did not conform to his views. In any case, it\u2019s misleading to frame the lack of a warning about Flynn in such a narrow fashion. There were many warning signs.", "lang": "en"}
