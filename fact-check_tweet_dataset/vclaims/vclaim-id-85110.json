His average Pinocchio rating is 3.4, which is extraordinary; the highest average rating in the 2012 campaign was Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), who earned 3.08. Clinton has an average Pinocchio rating of 2.2, which is slightly higher than President Obama and slightly lower than Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nThis is a fable. Trump benefited from millions of dollars in loans from his father, as well as his father\u2019s connections in New York real state and local government. His father also saved him from almost certain financial ruin in 1990.", "lang": "en"}
