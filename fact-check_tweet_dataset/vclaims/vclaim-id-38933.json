The report was shared repeatedly on Facebook in February 2020. The report is a hoax; the BBC told AFP that the report had been fabricated; and Quaden Bayles has not died, as shown by media interviews with his family in March 2020.\n\nThe hoax report was published here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading report:\n\nThe headline states: \u201cQUADEN BAYLES' the BuIIied KlD REC0RDED HlS SUlClDE. HE KILLED HlMSELF after after Bullying Worsens at School- BBC NEWS\u201d\n\nQuaden Bayles is an Australian boy with dwarfism. The nine-year-old received global media attention in late February 2020 after his mum recorded a now-viral video of him in which he complains about being bullied at school. Bayles\u2019 family received an outpouring of support and donations from around the world, as reported here by AFP.\n\nThe link was published in this Facebook post on February 29 with the hashtag #PleaseShareToStopBullying.\n\nOther users shared the same link in Facebook posts here, here, here and here, with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; Bayles has not died and a BBC spokesperson told AFP that the report is a hoax.\n\nA BBC spokesperson told AFP via email on March 2, 2020: \u201cWe are aware of a fake video with BBC News branding circulating, incorrectly reporting the death of Quaden Bayles. When the BBC brand is infringed we will take appropriate action. We urge people to check the veracity of stories on the BBC News website.\u201d\n\nWhen users click the video in the hoax report, they can view part of a video taken from this 2014 CBS News report about an unrelated death of a nine-year-old boy in New York.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the video in the hoax report:\n\nViewers can only watch a portion of the report before receiving an \u201cUncover Video\u201d prompt, which asks them to share the link on Facebook. The prompt has the hallmarks of a phishing scam.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the video before the prompt appears:\n\nSince the hoax report was circulated, Quaden, his mother Yarraka and sister Guyala, were interviewed here in a March 4, 2020 episode of Australian television programme The Point. They spoke about the global attention Quaden had received, and the misinformation surrounding his age and his death.\n\n\u201cThat just goes to show how stupid people are,\u201d Yarraka told the program. \u201cThey obviously haven\u2019t done their homework. A simple Google [search] would save a lot of drama.\u201d\n\nYarraka's quote, in part, appears at 1:15:00 in the below video:\n\nA video of Bayles\u2019 interview was also published here on the SBS News Facebook page on March 4, 2020.\n\nThe hoax is similar in nature to one that falsely claimed the widow of the late basketball star Kobe Bryant had committed suicide, as reported here by AFP Fact Check.\n\nBayles has also been subject of a false conspiracy theory surrounding his age, which AFP Fact Check debunked here.", "lang": "en"}
