There is no record of Sanders making the statement.\n\nThe tweet, which was screen grabbed and posted on Facebook, comments on the allegedly \u201codd\u201d timing of various events. At first glance, it appears to come from Sanders, who formerly served as the White House press secretary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018odd\u2019 that the ANTIFA insurgency happened just as COVID-19 loses steam. It\u2019s \u2018odd\u2019 that COVID-19 happened the moment impeachment failed,\u201d reads the tweet. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018odd\u2019 that impeachment happened the moment Russian hoax failed. The Russian hoax happened because Hillary lost. Notice the pattern?\u201d\n\nHowever, a closer inspection of the Twitter account reveals that it does not actually belong to Sanders. It has the wrong Twitter handle \u2013 @hucklebee_sarah rather than @SarahHuckabee \u2013 and misspells part of her name. The bio disclaims, \u201cI\u2019m not who you think I am.\u201d\n\nThere is no record of Sanders ever making the comment. It doesn\u2019t appear on her Twitter timeline. The Daily Caller also didn\u2019t find any media outlets attributing the statement to her online.
