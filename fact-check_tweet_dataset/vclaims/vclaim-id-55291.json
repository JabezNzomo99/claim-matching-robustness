Not necessarily. Some of the information in the meme appears to be on point, but not all, according to medical experts.\n\nThe meme talking about how the virus works and ways of staying healthy appeared in a post (archived here) where it was published by Tracie Clayton on Facebook on March 12, 2020. It opened:\n\nUsers on social media saw this:\n\nThis laundry list contains a mix of recommendations - some supported by public health authorities, and others not. Let's go through each:\n\nIndeed, COVID-19 is a virus that can affect the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and it is spread through droplets generated from coughs and sneezes, or through saliva or nasal discharge, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nHere is what WHO says about whether the coronavirus is transmitted via air: Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.\n\nHere is what WHO says about how long the virus survives on surfaces: \"It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).\"\n\n\"If you think a surface may be infected,\" the organization says, \"clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.\"\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cautions against close contact with anyone who is infected with the coronavirus. The federal agency defines close contact as \"being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time,\" and adds that \"close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case.\"\n\nWHO cuts that safety zone in half in some cases: \"Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing,\" it says.\n\nAll health officials agree with the recommendation that people wash their hands frequently - and for at least 20 seconds - with soap.\n\nHere is what CDC has to say about using disinfectants: \"For disinfection, diluted household bleach solutions, alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, and most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective.\"\n\nNeither CDC nor WHO appear to have offered any recommendations on whether to drink hot water, or to gargle with warm water and salt. Nor have they issued any recommendations about staying away from cold items.\n\nWhile it's long been accepted that sunlight can be a great disinfectant, neither organization has suggested that taking a walk in the sunlight will protect anyone from becoming infected with coronavirus - or cure anyone who is already infected.\n\nCDC recommends that anyone who is already sick with coronavirus wear a face mask to limit exposing others to the coronavirus, but it notes that masks do not protect uninfected people from contracting the virus. And the CDC notes further that use of a mask by someone who would not be helped by it limits the supply of masks available for people who need them, such as caregivers and other health professionals.\n\nYes, everyone agrees that a person should cough or sneeze into a tissue. Yet they add that, once the tissue is placed inside the bin, the bin should be covered. Absent a tissue, the crook of the arm will suffice.\n\nCDC's guidance about washing clothes is as follows:\n\u2022 Wear disposable gloves when handling dirty laundry from an ill person and then discard after each use. If using reusable gloves, those gloves should be dedicated for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces for COVID-19 and should not be used for other household purposes. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed.\n\u2022 If no gloves are used when handling dirty laundry, be sure to wash hands afterwards.\n\u2022 If possible, do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the possibility of dispersing virus.\n\nGiven that the disease is flourishing in areas where temperatures regularly reach 26-27C (78.8-80.6F), this seems improbable.", "lang": "en"}
