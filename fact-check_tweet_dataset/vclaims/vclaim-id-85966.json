The United States was a leader in imposing sanctions on the junta, but in order to encourage more openness, many sanctions have been lifted, and business investment now is flowing into the country. Under a constitution written by the military, at least 25 percent of the seats in parliament are reserved for the military; Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s political party is greatly limited in the number of seats it is permitted to contest. A provision in the constitution currently prevents her from running for president.\n\nThe challenge of ongoing ethnic and sectarian violence \u2014 including in Shan State, Kachin State, and Rakhine State \u2014 remains an area of deep and on-going concern. If left unaddressed, it will undermine progress toward national reconciliation, stability, and lasting peace. Serious human rights abuses against civilians in several regions continue, including against women and children. Humanitarian access to hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons remains a serious challenge and on-going crisis. The government and the ethnic nationalities need to work together urgently to find a path to lasting peace that addresses minority rights, deals with differences through dialogue not violence, heals the wounds of the past, and carries reforms forward. The situation in Rakhine State and the recent violence against the Rohingya and other Muslims last week only underscores the critical urgency of ensuring the safety and security of all individuals in the area, investigating all reports of violence and bringing those responsible to justice, according citizenship and full rights to the Rohingya, and bringing about economic opportunity for all local populations.\n\n\u201cThe best prevention against future violence is accountability, and our focus thus far has been on pressing the Burmese government to do more on this front,\u201d the official said in explaining why the United States has not supported an independent inquiry. \u201cThe government has taken some steps to investigate and prosecute individuals for the violence, but there is much more the government can and should do. At this time, our assessment has been that supporting a call for such an international investigation would not advance this goal. We will continue to evaluate the situation and adjust our policy accordingly.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
