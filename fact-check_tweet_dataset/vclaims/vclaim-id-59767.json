He graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in 2004 and served eight years in the Army, including in Iraq.\n\nWe looked into this issue a few weeks ago when we examined the case of Bryant \u201cCorky\u201d Messner, a lawyer who is seeking the GOP nomination in the U.S. Senate race in New Hampshire. In his ads and on his website, Messner described himself as an Army Ranger. That\u2019s an elite unit within the military. But Messner and James can\u2019t call themselves Army Rangers.\n\nSimply put, there\u2019s the Ranger School, and there\u2019s the Ranger Regiment, a Special Operations unit. Anyone in the military can attend the Ranger School, regardless of whether they served in the Ranger Regiment. The Ranger School is an intense 62-day small-unit tactics course for dismounted infantry that only about 40 percent manage to complete. If a soldier makes it through the course, he or she earns the right to wear a uniform \u201ctab\u201d \u2014 a small cloth arch \u2014 that reads \u201cRanger.\u201d\n\nWe posed the question to the Army, starting with the Ranger School at Fort Benning, Ga. Our query was passed up the line until we received this statement from a U.S. Army Special Operations Command spokesperson:\n\nThe U.S. Army Ranger Course is the Army's premier leadership school, and falls under Training and Doctrine Command, Fort Eustis, Virginia, and is open to all members of the military, regardless of whether they have served in the 75th Ranger Regiment or completed the Ranger Assessment and Selection Program. A graduate of the U.S. Army Ranger Course is Ranger qualified. The 75th Ranger Regiment is a special operations unit with the mission to plan and conduct joint special military operations in support of national policies and objectives. The Regiment\u2019s higher headquarters is the U.S. Army Special Operations Command located at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The Regiment is the Army\u2019s largest, joint special operations force. All members of the 75th Ranger Regiment have passed the Ranger Assessment Selection Program 1, 2, or both. Anyone who is serving or has served within the 75th Ranger Regiment is a U.S. Army Ranger.\n\nIndeed, presumably, James knows this because the biography on his campaign website says: \u201cAfter graduating from West Point in 2004, he became a Ranger-qualified aviation officer.\u201d\n\nYet despite that precise description on the website, the James campaign has used the Army Ranger label in other contexts, as well.\n\nWhen we called out Messner, the Fact Checker certainly received lots of email messages \u2014 from Army veterans who argued that Ranger-qualified indeed means Ranger and from many other Army vets who were appalled at Messner\u2019s claim. We have no stake in the matter but trust that the Army knows what it is talking about.\n\nGiven that James\u2019s website bio makes clear that he understands the distinction between \u201cRanger\u201d and \u201cRanger-qualified,\u201d there\u2019s little excuse for the phrasing in this ad or his continual social media references. He earns Two Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
