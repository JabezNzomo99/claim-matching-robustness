At some point it became common to attribute the quote to Mrs Thatcher.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph reported in the duchess\u2019s obituary that she once said: \u201cAnybody seen in a bus over the age of 30 has been a failure in life.\u201d\n\nIn 2006, writer Hugo Vickers wrote to the Telegraph saying that the duchess had told him that the phrase was originally coined by a poet called Brian Howard and that she had repeated it and passed it off as her own aphorism.\n\nIf the duchess\u2019s memoirs are anything to go by, she certainly echoed the sentiment, mentioning the indignity of going from being driven by chauffeurs to having to \u201cqueue in the downpour for the over-populated bus\u201d following her separation from the Duke of Westminster.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure why and when people started to attribute the quote to Mrs Thatcher, but the Economist says she reportedly said it in 1986.\n\nThe Guardian reported in 2005 that Mrs Thatcher may have quoted the line to the founder and chairman of Stagecoach transport group Sir Brian Souter at an awards ceremony. Sir Brian told us this was untrue.\n\nSince 2003 numerous MPs have attributed the quote to Mrs Thatcher in parliament (and one has apologised on behalf of another for the misattribution.)\n\nMPs seem unable to agree on exactly which age the quote refers to: some say 30, while others say 26 or 25.", "lang": "en"}
