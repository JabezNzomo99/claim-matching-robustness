This young lady is being sold into sexual slavery as a child bride. She is a Christian. She watched her father beheaded and her mother raped. Where is her safe place?\"\n\nThe photo was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

A reverse-image search led us to a 2014 report on the contest by Morocco World News, which explains that the girl began to cry during the event after she made mistakes during her recitation:\n\n\"The video shows the ISIS member, who was misleadingly presented as the young girl\u2019s groom, having a small chat with her before she recites verses of the Quran.\n\nFeeling embarrassed for making several mistakes during her recitation, Ghada, the young girl, starts crying before the man returns. He then clearly tries to comfort her and boost her spirits.\"\n\nAFP Canada (along with other fact-checking websites) also evaluated the miscaptioned photo, and an Arabic-speaking AFP journalist confirmed from the video that the girl is reciting chapter 112 of the Quran.\n\n\"She made some errors so the man helps her, and he says, \u2018Ma sha Allah (Bravo), can you give me two other chapters?\u2019\" the AFP journalist is quoted saying in the story. \"She recites the chapter 113 and the man asks the crowd, \u2018Who is the winner?\u2019 Apparently the girl wasn\u2019t happy after the crowd's answer, so she started to cry.\"\n\nWe could find no other account in which the girl was reported to be a child bride or a Christian who just witnessed her father being \"beheaded and her mother raped.\"\n\nWe know that child marriage is a serious global issue affecting the lives of one in every five girls who is married or in a union before age 19, according to the United Nations Population Fund.\n\n\"In the least developed countries,\" UNFPA reports, \"that number doubles \u2013 40 percent of girls are married before age 18, and 12 percent of girls are married before age 15.\"\n\nBut instead of raising awareness about the practice, some social media posts are spreading misinformation.\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
