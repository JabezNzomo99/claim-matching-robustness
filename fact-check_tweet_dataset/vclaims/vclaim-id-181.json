It is supposedly signed by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nThe letter claims that a seven-day school week will be made compulsory in order to compensate for time lost during the lockdown.\n\n\u201cWe will quickly make up for lost time by not only teaching your children from Monday to Friday, but also making it compulsory for your child to attend school on Saturdays and Sundays for the first 6 months,\u201d it reads.\n\nThis is not true. The UK Department of Education told Reuters that the letter had not been written by the government, and that there are no plans to make seven-day school weeks compulsory. Pupils will also not be expected to attend school over the summer holidays.\n\nBritain ordered schools to shut on March 20 to help stop the spread of the coronavirus, though some have remained open to support the children of essential workers like health care employees (here) .\n\nBritish education minister Gavin Williamson said on April 19 that no decision had yet been taken on when to reopen schools. He said five tests would need to be met before this could happen, including a fall in daily death rates and assurance that the National Health Service could continue to provide critical care across the UK (here) (here) .\n\nIn the meantime, remote learning would be supported through initiatives like free online classes and offering laptops to disadvantaged young people who are sitting exams next year (here) .\n\nFalse: it will not be compulsory for UK students to go to school seven days a week when schools reopen.", "lang": "en"}
