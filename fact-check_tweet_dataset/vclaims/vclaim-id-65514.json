The only reference to mail-in voting came during a criticism of what he described as efforts to deter people from voting.\n\n\"We may no longer have to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar in order to cast a ballot,\" he said. \"But even as we sit here, there are those in power who are doing their darndest to discourage people from voting \u2014 by closing polling locations, and targeting minorities and students with restrictive ID laws, and attacking our voting rights with surgical precision, even undermining the Postal Service in the run-up to an election that is going to be dependent on mailed-in ballots so people don\u2019t get sick.\"\n\nObama also used the eulogy to encourage people to vote. \"Just everybody\u2019s just got to come out and vote,\" he said.\n\nAnd he offered ideas for how to make it easier for people to vote.\n\n\"Once we pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act,\" he said, \"we should keep marching to make it even better by making sure every American is automatically registered to vote, including former inmates who\u2019ve earned their second chance; by adding polling places, and expanding early voting, and making Election Day a national holiday, so if you are someone who is working in a factory, or you are a single mom who has got to go to her job and doesn't get time off, you can still cast your ballot.\"\n\nA few days before Lewis died, Obama tweeted that \"voting by mail shouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue \u2014 especially during a pandemic.\" He said \"everybody should be able to request an absentee ballot and make their voice heard in every election.\" But he didn\u2019t raise that issue during his eulogy.", "lang": "en"}
