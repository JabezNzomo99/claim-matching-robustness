The Russian pilot masterfully put his machine into afterburner mode and escaped its pursuers, leaving just a glimpse of the giant bomber on the Americans\u2019 flight radars. This despite the fact that the 110-ton Russian Tu-160 is nearly three times heavier than the 13-ton U.S. F-35s. The Russian media reports also described the Tu-160 as an outdated veteran of the Soviet air force, while the fifth generation F-35 Lightening II is the most modern and highly praised U.S. fighter aircraft.\n\nThe Russian media reports used strikingly similar language and appeared to be copy-pasted from a single source -- the Chinese news agency Sina.\n\nYet, the Sina report cited Russia\u2019s Sputnik state-owned media outlet, which in turn cited Sina as its source. Thus, it is impossible to determine the precise origins of the story.\n\nWhatever its origins, the story seems to be fake.\n\nThe Russian media reports suggest that the U.S. fighters forced the Russian bomber to divert from its scheduled course. But there was no record of any such incident over the Sea of Japan on Nov. 3 in several aviation incident tracking databases, which include \u201cforced diversion-military\u201d type incidents globally.\n\nThe Russian media reports also compared the weights of the Tu-160 and F-35 at the time of the \u201cincident,\u201d providing figures that cannot be accurate \u2013 110 tons vs 13 tons. These numbers only reflect the weight of the aircraft without fuel. The maximum takeoff weight is 275 tons for a Tu-160 and 35 tons for an F-35.\n\nThe description of the Tu-160 as an outdated veteran of the Soviet era is also false.\n\nNicknamed the White Swan by the Soviets and the Blackjack by NATO, the supersonic, nuclear-capable Tu-160 is currently the world largest bomber in service. The Tu-160 has a maximum speed of 1,379 miles per hour (the F-35\u2019s top speed is around 1,200 miles per hour).\n\nThe Tu-160 entered operational service in 1987 and production of the original version was halted in 1992. In 2015, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced that production of new Tu-160s would resume, and the modernized version of the bomber was debuted in January 2018. President Vladimir Putin and Shoigu observed the maiden flight of the new model, praising it as \u201cRussia\u2019s pride\u201d and superior to all existing world military aircraft of its class.\n\nThe modernized Tu-160 has been since deployed all over the world, from South Africa to Venezuela and Cuba, and to the Mediterranean and Syria.\n\nThe defense committee of the State Duma (the lower house of Russia\u2019s parliament) told the weekly newspaper Voenno-Promyshlenny Kurier (Military-Industrial Courier) that there were no Tu-160 flights over the Sea of Japan in November or any other time during 2019.\n\nThe committee also said that such flights over neutral waters are regular, are scheduled in accordance with a presidential order and are coordinated with NATO. During such flights, Russian strategic bombers are escorted by the NATO fighters, which is the norm, the newspaper said, citing a Duma defense committee source.", "lang": "en"}
