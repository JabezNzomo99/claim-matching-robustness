It is being claimed that the woman in the viral video is Abhinandan's wife.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the woman in the video is not the wife of IAF pilot Abhinandan.\n\nIndian Youth Congress\u2019 online magazine 'Yuva Desh' has tweeted this one minute-eight seconds video with the claim in Hindi which says, \"Wing Commander Abhinandan ji ki patni ka sandesh ki sainiko ke balidaan par BJP na kare rajniti (The message from Wing Commander Abhinandan ji's wife states that the BJP should not politicise the sacrifice of soldiers.)\"\n\nThe archived version of the tweet can be seen here\n\nFacebook user Dinesh Singta, who claims to be a National Students Union of India (NSUI) member, also posted the same video which has been shared more than 14,000 times at the last count. The post is being shared from other Facebook accounts as well.\n\nBesides Sidhu, SP MLA Rajesh Yadav and Congress Seva Dal member Harvinder Singh tweeted the video with the same claim.\n\nWe first listened to the video carefully. The video starts with the woman saying: I am the wife of an army officer. At the 21st second of the video, she can be heard saying: Just imagine the kind of tension, the kind of pain the family of Abhinandan is going through right now. It is to be noted that the woman is making a reference to Abhinandan\u2019s family, clearly indicating that she is not a member of his family.\n\nNews portal inkhabar.com has also published the photographs of Abhinandan with his wife. Comparing the photo of Abhinandan\u2019s wife and the woman in the viral video, it is clear that both are different people.\n\nThe verified Twitter account of Bharatiya Janata Party has expressed the disappointment on the post by tweeting: Just when you think Rahul Gandhi\u2019s Congress can\u2019t stoop lower, they breach their own record. Faking a video by the name of braveheart Abhinandan\u2019s wife for political propaganda is beyond even shameful.\n\nSirisha Rao tweeted to Aaj Tak saying that she is not the wife of Abhinandan Varthaman but she is a wife of an army officer and a responsible citizen of the country. Her tweet has been given below.", "lang": "en"}
