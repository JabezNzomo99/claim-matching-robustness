Listening to the video posted below, it becomes clear that the claim about the students raising anti-Hindu slogans is false. They were actually raising slogans against Hindutva, Savarkar, BJP, Brahminism and casteism.\n\nHere, the students can be heard saying, \u201c\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0935 \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u092c\u094d\u0930 \u0916\u0941\u0926\u0947\u0917\u0940, AMU \u0915\u0940 \u091b\u093e\u0924\u0940 \u092a\u0930, \u0938\u093e\u0935\u0930\u0915\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u092c\u094d\u0930 \u0916\u0941\u0926\u0947\u0917\u0940, AMU \u0915\u0940 \u091b\u093e\u0924\u0940 \u092a\u0930, \u092f\u0947 \u092c\u0940\u091c\u0947\u092a\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u092c\u094d\u0930 \u0916\u0941\u0926\u0947\u0917\u0940, AMU \u0915\u0940 \u091b\u093e\u0924\u0940 \u092a\u0930, \u092c\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0923\u0935\u093e\u0926 \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u092c\u094d\u0930 \u0916\u0941\u0926\u0947\u0917\u0940, AMU \u0915\u0940 \u091b\u093e\u0924\u0940 \u092a\u0930, \u092f\u0947 \u091c\u093e\u0924\u0940\u0935\u093e\u0926 \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u092c\u094d\u0930.

It may be noted that this video was uploaded on December 12, 2019.\n\nMoreover, we matched the above video with the viral version and found that the video has been zoomed-in in the version that is presently viral as compared to the clearer version above.

The tweet has garnered close to 900 retweets so far. BJP member Richa Pandey Mishra tweeted the video with a similar claim.\n\nFormer Shiv Sena member Ramesh Solanki also tweeted the same video with the false claim, \u201c\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0941\u0913\u0902 \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u092c\u094d\u0930 \u0916\u0941\u0926\u0947\u0917\u0940, AMU \u0915\u0940 \u091b\u093e\u0924\u0940 \u092a\u0930..Yeh aasteen ke \ud83d\udc0dhamare hi tax pe palte hai aur hamari hi \u0915\u092c\u094d\u0930 khodege\u201d. It was retweeted more than 900 times at the time of writing this article.\n\nBJP Delhi spokesperson Tajinder Bagga posted the same clip (left) along with another video that is viral on social media. He asserted that the students raised \u201ca clarion call for ethnic cleansing of Hindus.\u201d\n\nBJP social media head Amit Malviya tweeted the same clip (left) as Bagga\u2019s with the message, \u201cAMU students are chanting \u2018\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0941\u0913 \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u092c\u094d\u0930 \u0916\u0941\u0926\u0947\u0917\u0940, AMU \u0915\u0940 \u0927\u0930\u0924\u0940 \u092a\u0930\u201d.\n\nMany other social media users have shared the video on Twitter and Facebook with the identical false claim.\n\nIt is evident from the video that the students were raising slogans against Hindutva, not Hindus.
