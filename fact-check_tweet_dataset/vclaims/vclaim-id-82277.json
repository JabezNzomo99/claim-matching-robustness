Various outlets, including CNN, reported that 307,000 sick veterans had died while waiting for the VA to approve their health-care benefits. (The Washington Post\u2019s report on this study did not use this figure.)\n\nIn response to a request by the House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs over whistleblower allegations that there was a backlog of health care applications, investigators reviewed alleged mismanagement at the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s Health Eligibility Center. The center is the VA\u2019s \u201ccentral authority for eligibility and enrollment processing activities.\u201d There are about 22.3 million records in this system.\n\nThere were about 867,000 records in a \u201cpending\u201d status as of Sept. 30, many of them inactive for more than five years. \u201cPending\u201d means a veteran had applied for enrollment, but the VA needed additional information (often financial) before the veteran is found to be eligible for benefits. Of the pending records, 307,173 were for people who were reported as deceased by the Social Security Administration.\n\nThe VA began its health care enrollment process in 1998, but the system includes records of veterans who died before then. (In one example, a veteran had a blank enrollment status that changed to \u201cpending\u201d in November 2014. But the person had died in 1988.)\n\nPre-1998 records are in the system because millions of records from a different VA data source were entered into it in December 2013. This also caused records of veterans who never sought care from the VA to be entered into the system.\n\nBecause of a software glitch, the application dates do not show in the system. That makes it impossible to know which records are associated with someone applying for health care benefits, the report said.\n\nFurther complication: The enrollment system is like a customer list of people who had any encounter with the VA. It receives automatic data feeds from VA medical centers and other systems that are not related to health care, like disability benefits and home loans. The system also keeps records of veterans\u2019 family members who qualify to receive health care, employees participating in the employee health program, patients receiving humanitarian care and patients whose military service was not confirmed.\n\nScott Davis, the whistleblower and program specialist at the VA Health Eligibility Center in Atlanta, flagged the issue to the House committee and testified about the backlog in pending records. In an interview with The Fact Checker, he said the primary purpose of the Health Enrollment Center is to maintain health care enrollment data, and that non-health care data comprise a small portion of records in the system.\n\nThe VA has disputed claims like Fiorina\u2019s, saying they wrongly \u201clink these pending records with access-to-care issues for fully enrolled veterans that have chosen to use, and who are receiving, VA health care. They are separate issues,\u201d according to Janet P. Murphy, the Veterans Health Administration Operations and Management\u2019s acting deputy undersecretary for health.\n\nThe OIG\u2019s report points out many serious problems with the VA\u2019s enrollment records system. But its finding about the 307,000 figure is much more nuanced than the way Fiorina made it sound during the debate. She said that 307,000 veterans died \u201cwhile waiting for health care.\u201d That figure represents the number of veterans whose records were marked as \u201cpending\u201d in the enrollment system, but who were marked deceased in the Social Security Administration\u2019s records.\n\nIt is possible that all 307,173 veterans applied for health care. But that\u2019s an absolute worst-case scenario, and the OIG said it could not confirm how many veterans with \u201cpending\u201d statuses had applied for health care.\n\nThe VA system\u2019s weaknesses limit us in the public from knowing exactly what the pending records mean and what they reflect about veterans\u2019 access to health care. But we do know that the database includes records of people who had applied for other, non-health care benefits with the VA. It includes records of qualified family members and VA employees who are enrolled in employee health care. It also includes records of people who sought health care or who died before 1998, when the VA actually started its health-care enrollment system.\n\nWe wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios. But Fiorina\u2019s claim is rooted in misconstrued reports by reputable news outlets that her campaign cited as sources for her claim. We will give her the benefit of the doubt on this figure, but this is warning to politicians who repeat this figure \u2014 especially in such a high-profile setting as a GOP debate. As we often say, don\u2019t believe everything you read in the media.", "lang": "en"}
