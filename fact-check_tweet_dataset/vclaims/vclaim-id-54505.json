There is no evidence Trump tweeted such a remark.\n\nThe image appears to show a screen grab of a tweet, purportedly from Trump, that criticizes Puerto Rico and its governor, Wanda V\u00e1zquez, claiming the U.S. territory is \u201cfilled with savages.\u201d Trump has previously said that he is an \u201cabsolute no\u201d on statehood for Puerto Rico, according to the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cHow incompetent can @WandaVazquez be?\u201d the purported tweet reads. \u201cShe has no control on a small island filled with savages that have no respect for authority and the law. You can have as many plebiscites as you want. There are more chances of me moving to North Korea than Puerto Rico becoming a state.\u201d\n\nYet, while Trump has called Puerto Rican officials \u201cincompetent\u201d in the past, this particular tweet has been fabricated. A search of Trump\u2019s verified Twitter accounts \u2014 @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS \u2014 turned up no such remark. Nor does the alleged comment appear in ProPublica\u2019s archive of his deleted tweets.

The Facebook page contains several screen grabs of tweets, mainly from former Puerto Rican Gov. Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, with the same watermark. Those tweets appear to be fabricated as well.\n\nTrump is often the target of fake tweets, which can be easily created using websites such as FakeTrumpTweet.com and FakeTweetGenerator.com. Check Your Fact has debunked a number of fabricated tweets attributed to Trump, including one that falsely claimed he tweeted, \u201cAnyone who ordered a ticket to my rally and didn\u2019t attend should be arrested.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
