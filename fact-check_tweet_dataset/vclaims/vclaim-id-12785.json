{"title": "Trump\u2019s Misleading Claim That He Warned About Osama bin Laden (Published 2018)", "subtitle": "The warning amounted to a fleeting mention in his 2000 book, which was published after Osama bin Laden was already one of the world\u2019s most wanted terrorists.", "author": "www.nytimes.com", "date": "2018-11-20T00:14:28.609Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-12785", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/us/politics/fact-check-trump-bin-laden-pakistan-mcraven.html", "vclaim": "President Trump\u2019s tweet on Monday continued his weekend verbal assaults on Pakistan and William H. McRaven, a retired Navy admiral who oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011.\n\nMr. McRaven had in 2017 described the president\u2019s attacks on the news media as \u201cthe greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime.\u201d This weekend, when asked about the comment during an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Mr. Trump called Mr. McRaven a \u201cHillary Clinton backer.\u201d He also lamented that the former Special Operations commander did not take down Bin Laden sooner, adding that \u201ceverybody in Pakistan knew he was there.\u201d\n\nHours later, Mr. McRaven said he did not back Mrs. Clinton or anyone else in the 2016 election and reiterated his earlier comment about Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the press. And on Monday, Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan described Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks as an inaccurate \u201ctirade\u201d and noted Pakistan\u2019s participation in the war on terrorism \u2014 and the economic and human losses it had incurred.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s claim that he delivered a prescient warning about Bin Laden is hyperbolic. His book, \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d which was published in January 2000, contains one reference to Bin Laden in 304 pages:\n\n\u201cOne day we\u2019re all assured that Iraq is under control, the U.N. inspectors have done their work, everything\u2019s fine, not to worry. The next day the bombing begins. One day we\u2019re told that a shadowy figure with no fixed address named Osama bin Laden is public enemy number one, and U.S. jet fighters lay waste to his camp in Afghanistan. He escapes back under some rock, and a few news cycles later it\u2019s on to a new enemy and new crisis.\n\nDealing with many different countries at once may require many different strategies. But there isn\u2019t any excuse for the haphazard nature of our foreign policy. We don\u2019t have to reinvent the wheel for every new conflict.\u201d\n\nThis fleeting mention of Bin Laden was not exactly ahead of its time.\n\nThe Qaeda leader had for years been linked to numerous terrorist plots and was regarded as one of the most wanted terrorists in the world; as Mr. Trump noted in his tweet and his book, Bin Laden was the target of an unsuccessful missile strike in 1998. CNN reported in 1999 that American officials feared Bin Laden would plan an attack against the United States ; he was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the bombing of the American destroyer Cole in Yemen that killed 17 American troops a year later.", "lang": "en"}
