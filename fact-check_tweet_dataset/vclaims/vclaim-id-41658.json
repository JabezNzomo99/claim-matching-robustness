According to the accompanying claim, this is how members of the Muslim community involved in relief work during the lockdown are trying to spread coronavirus infection by spitting on the food. A post by Facebook page by Namo Always has amassed over 8,200 shares.\n\nMany other users on Facebook and Twitter shared the video with the same claim.\n\nWith the help of digital verification tool InVid, Alt News broke the video into multiple key-frames. We then reverse searched one of the key-frames on Google and found the same video posted on YouTube on December 15, 2018. The caption of the video says, \u201cThose who understand Barkat in Islam shouldn\u2019t eat the food they have spat on.\u201d\n\nThus, it is clear that the video is unrelated to the recent coronavirus outbreak.\n\nWe contacted an Islamic scholar to know what exactly is happening in the video. The scholar said, \u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018Fatiha Jalana\u2019. It\u2019s done after the food is cooked. Some Quranic verses are read over the food to either pray to Allah to cure diseases or make a wish to Him. Some blow air and some don\u2019t. It\u2019s Fatiha where you take out some food and ask for Barkat (good fortune).\u201d He further added that we see a lot of people gathering outside mosques with sick children after the prayers are said. Worshippers who step out of the mosque after reading namaz are asked to blow air over these children as it is believed that it has Barkat bestowed by Allah. It may be noted that this is an archaic practice followed by very few people.\n\nThis video explains how a person can recite Surah Al-Fatihah: \u201cYou can recite certain Ayat, Ayat Al-Kursi or Surat Al-Fatihah or whatever you can read of the Quran on the water then drink it. Make wudu or shower.\u201d\n\nWhile Alt News couldn\u2019t independently verify the origin and context of this video, suffice to say that the video is unrelated to the recent nationwide lockdown.", "lang": "en"}
