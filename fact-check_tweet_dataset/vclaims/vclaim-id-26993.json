No, that's not true: Pence will just sit next to Speaker Pelosi, the entire story was made up by the satire section of a popular publication.\n\nThe story originated from an article published in The New Yorker on February 5, 2019 titled \"Pence Begs Trump Not to Make Him Sit Next to Woman at State of the Union\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)--Vice-President Mike Pence has begged Donald J. Trump not to make him sit next to a woman during Tuesday night's State of the Union address, sources confirmed on Monday. According to those sources, an emotional Pence came close to breaking down in tears as he explained that being seated next to a woman other than his wife was a violation of his personal code of behavior.

To them it would look somewhat like this, with an easy to miss \"Not the news\" being the only indication it is not real:\n\nIn part to combat this the main page of The Borowitz Report comes with a clear heading that simply states:\n\nTo be safe, whenever you see a link that goes to any article on the \"newyorker.com\" website, always check if the rest of the link says \"/humor/borowitz-report/\" somewhere. If it does, don't believe a thing you read...\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes newyorker.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site can generally be trusted to maintain journalistic standards.
