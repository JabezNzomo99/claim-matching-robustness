There are several layers of misinformation in her statement, which was published on the ministry Web site. First, she falsely claims that the American embassy declined to organize visa interviews for the Russian freestyle wrestling team planning to visit the U.S. to participate in the World Cup in Iowa City, in the U.S., on April 7-8.\n\nThe head of Russia\u2019s Freestyle Wrestling Federation, Valery Feldsherov contradicted her claim. He told the TASS government news agency, that the U.S. Embassy actually advised team members go the U.S. Embassy in Armenia for visa interviews to expedite the processing, due to the shortness of the consular staff in Russia.\n\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t schedule us for visa interviews, instead recommending that we go for the visa interviews to the consulate in Armenia,\u201d Feldsherov said, adding there was not enough time to do so.\n\nZakharova also claimed, that \u201cWashington, not us\u201d made a decision, about which of the staff members to reduce, so she called it \u201cyet another excuse\u201d by the U.S. diplomats, and to argue that they are short-staffed is \u201cextremely outrageous.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cstaff reduction\u201d Zakharova mentions, was Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s executive order in July 2017 demanding that the United States reduce their diplomatic staff in Russia from 1,210 people to 455, cutting 755 staffers from the embassy in Moscow and the three consulates in other Russian cities.\n\nCommenting at the time about the measure, Zakharova said that, \u201cno one expelled the Americans\u201d \u2013 a claim Polygraph.info checked and proved false.\n\nIn fact, the issue with visa interview waiting time is widely discussed in the Russian social media. For instance the Russian travel Website gofortravel.ru has posted a screenshot of the U.S. embassy Webpage, to prove to its clients that the consulate is booked and no interview scheduling is available.\n\nZakharova also accused the Americans\u2019 of \u201cdirect and overt discrimination\u201d against the Russian team \u2013 a possibility given what appears to be deteriorating relations between the two countries. However, another Russian sports authority also appeared to contradict the press secretary\u2019s words.\n\nThe President of Federation of Freestyle Wrestling of Russia, Mikhail Mamiashvili said in an interview that, the American Wrestling Federation \u201cdid everything they could to support us.\u201d He also added that apart from the Russian team, the Kazakhstan team is also experiencing issues with the U.S. entry visas.\n\n\u201cThey [Americans] are our brothers, and this misunderstanding will in no way affect our brotherly relations in the future,\u201d Mikhail Mamiashvili said.\n\nThe U.S. State Department told VOA, \u201cVisa records are confidential under Section 222(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Therefore, we may not comment on the details of individual visa cases.\u201d\n\nAt the time of this publication, the U.S. embassy in Moscow has not responded to Polygraph.info\u2019s request for comment.", "lang": "en"}
