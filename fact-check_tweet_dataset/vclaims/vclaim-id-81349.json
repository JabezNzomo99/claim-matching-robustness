That\u2019s where Warren comes up with the \u201c99.6 percent\u201d statistic.\n\nBut the data is a bit out of date. Digging into 2013 Census\u2019s American Community Survey \u2014 which we should note was released early in 2015 \u2014 we now find nine categories of jobs in which women make more than men. That\u2019s a bit of improvement, though it is still shows about 97 percent of the (342) job categories give higher pay to men. But there is another wrinkle: There are more than 200 categories in which there is not enough data to draw a conclusion, so it\u2019s not quite accurate for Warren to claim that this data set represents \u201call job categories.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Warren is relying on a data set that measures median annual wages. (This is the same data that results in the 78 cents stat.) Annual wage figures do not take into account the fact that women are more likely to take time off, such as for the birth of a child.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics measures weekly median wages (see Table 18). While there are limitations with the BLS data as well, one can find a number of categories in which the gender gap all but disappears when measured in weekly wages. For instance, female pharmacists are at 92.6 percent of male wages in the Census annual wage data but 99.6 percent in the BLS weekly wage data. And health practitioner support technicians are at 87.8 percent in the annual data and 103.7 percent in the weekly data, meaning they actually make more than men.\n\nStill, it is clear that in most types of jobs, men appear to earn more than women. So what about Warren\u2019s second point\u2014that this is a result of discrimination?\n\nThis may fall more in the realm of opinion, which lies beyond The Fact Checker\u2019s brief. Still, there is also evidence that discrimination may play an important role in the gender pay gap. The White House Council of Economic Advisers issued a report on the gender pay gap on April 14, in which it cited research that 49 percent of the pay gap could be explained by differences in educational attainment, experience, demographic characteristics, job type, or union status. But 41 percent of the gap is unexplained, and thus might be attributed to discrimination in areas such as hiring, pay, and advancement, the report said.\n\nStill, that suggests that even if discrimination would be entirely eliminated, there would still be some sort of gap across many job categories. No discrimination against women would only get you halfway to the finish line of completely eliminating the gap \u2014 though that still would be an improvement.\n\nWarren\u2019s reframing of the gender gap highlights an important aspect of the debate\u2014 that across the vast majority of job categories, men earn more than women. Her statistic was a little out of date, and so the number was not quite as stark as she portrayed it. But perhaps it\u2019s close enough for government work.\n\nAs for her suggestion that discrimination is the key cause of the gap, there is evidence that about half of the gap could be attributed to discrimination. But there are other factors at play as well. Eliminating discrimination still might leave men making more money in most job categories, so she cannot entirely attribute the problem to discrimination (though, as we noted, she could argue that this is simply an opinion).", "lang": "en"}
