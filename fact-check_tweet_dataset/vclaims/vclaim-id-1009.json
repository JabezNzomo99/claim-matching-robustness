French company Sanofi, which produces Plaquenil, said quinine was not a component of their drug.\n\n\u201cHydroxychloroquine is a synthetically manufactured drug, developed based on the chemical structure of quinine. Quinine is not a component of our drug Plaquenil, the active ingredient is hydroxychloroquine,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and others have pushed hydroxychloroquine in recent months but the World Health Organization (WHO) said on May 25, 2020 it was pausing a large trial of the malaria drug due to safety concerns (here) .\n\nSuggestions, such as in the post, that quinine used in tonic water is the same as hydroxychloroquine prompted British tonic water manufacturer Fever Tree, to issue guidance on its website (here) .\n\n\u201cWhilst hydroxychloroquine and quinine are both used in anti-malarial drugs, the quinine we use is naturally derived from the bark of the Cinchona tree,\u201d Fever Tree says. \u201cThere is no proven scientific evidence that quinine or hydroxychloroquine can protect against or treat COVID-19.\u201d\n\nFalse. Hydroxychloroquine is a synthetic drug developed in the 1950 from chloroquine. It is not the same as quinine, which is a naturally-occurring compound.", "lang": "en"}
