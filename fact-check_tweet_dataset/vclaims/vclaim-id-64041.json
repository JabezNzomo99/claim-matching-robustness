No, there are no reliable reports that she is deathly ill. Turner did struggle with intestinal cancer and she underwent a kidney transplant in the past decade, but there is no evidence she is currently suffering from those issues.\n\nThe claim appeared in a Facebook post of a photo of Turner (archived here) published on August 11, 2020, with the caption:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nTurner, singer-songwriter and 12-time Grammy award-winner, revealed in her 2018 memoir, \"Tina Turner: My Love Story,\" that she suffered a stroke, fought intestinal cancer, and underwent a kidney transplant during the past decade.\n\nBut there is no evidence that Turner is currently suffering from stomach cancer or rejection of a kidney, and neither she nor her representatives have made any statements to that effect.\n\nOn her 80th birthday in November, 2019, Turner tweeted a video celebrating her health and she said:\n\nIn July, 2020, Turner came out of retirement to collaborate with Kygo on a remix of her megahit, \"What's Love Got To Do With It.\"\n\nFalse claims about Turner's health have cropped up previoiusly -- Snopes wrote a fact-check debunking similar claims in May 2019.", "lang": "en"}
