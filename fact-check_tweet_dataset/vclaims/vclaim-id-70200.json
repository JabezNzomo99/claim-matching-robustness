Scott Walker\u2019s health care policy.\n\nHealth insurance has been a key issue throughout the campaign \u2014 Walker wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and Wisconsin is suing in federal court in Texas to try to make that happen.\n\nMeanwhile, Walker offered a last-minute proposal on pre-existing conditions, saying he would codify into state law the same protections offered by the ACA.\n\nSpeaking Nov. 1, 2018, in Eau Claire, Evers reiterated that he would protect Wisconsinites with pre-existing conditions, then pivoted to new anti-Walker claim.\n\n\"How many students here are still under their parents' health care (insurance)? There\u2019s more than a handful,\" Evers said, then added: \"He wants to get rid of that, too.\"\n\nDoes Walker really want to force students off their parents\u2019 health insurance?\n\nAsked for back up for the claim, Evers spokesman Sam Lau pointed only to Walker\u2019s opposition to the ACA, commonly called Obamacare.\n\n\"The Affordable Care Act allows you to stay on your parents\u2019 health care until you are 26, and Walker is suing to get rid of the Affordable Care Act,\" Lau said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act does require that insurers offering dependent child coverage make that coverage available until the child turns 26.\n\nBut Wisconsin law also has a similar \u2013 though less comprehensive \u2013 requirement that would remain in place even if the ACA is repealed. The provision was put into place as part of the 2011-\u201913 budget, based on wording added by the Joint Finance Committee to comply with ACA requirements.\n\nThe Wisconsin language would not apply to employer-sponsored insurance that is self-funded \u2014 about half the employer plans in the state. That exemption, which is part of federal law, means half the employer plans wouldn\u2019t be required to cover children up to age 26, said Jon Peacock, research director for Kids Forward, a Madison-based advocacy group.\n\nNevertheless, Walker has already signed a provision that does what Evers says Walker opposes -- provides the ability for \"kids\" to be on the health plans of their parents.\n\nWhat's more, past statements from Walker have gone further. And Walker campaign spokesman Ben Voelkel said the governor continues to support leaving the provision as it is in the ACA.\n\nHe cited several articles, including an Aug. 18, 2015 one from the website Becker\u2019s Hospital Review. That article, in the midst of Walker\u2019s brief presidential campaign, looked at key points from Walker\u2019s plan to replace the ACA.\n\nAmong the points noted: \"Under his proposal, Americans would not be fined for not having health insurance and those under 26 years old can stay on their parents' plans.\"\n\nHe also noted a 2017 Washington Post interview, in which Walker identified coverage \"for young people\" as among the things he\u2019d keep from the Affordable Care Act if he were creating new policy after a repeal.\n\nEvers says Walker \"wants to get rid of\" students\u2019 ability to stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance.\n\nBut Evers offers no direct evidence of that claim.\n\nThe only evidence offered \u2014 that Walker opposes the ACA, which also includes coverage through age 26 \u2014 does not logically connect. It\u2019s not reasonable to extrapolate from Walker\u2019s opposition of the ACA that he opposes each and every individual policy position within it.\n\nAnd the claim ignores the fact that Walker has already signed into law a requirement that health insurers in Wisconsin allow young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance until age 26.\n\nEditor's note: This item was updated on Nov. 5, 2018 to reflect information from Joe Peacock of the Kids Forward about how the provision in state law compares to the ACA.
