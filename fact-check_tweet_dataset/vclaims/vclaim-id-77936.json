The broadcast journalist also shared her story in a Twitter post on July 23, 2020, that read:\n\nAs a journalist, it\u2019s been full throttle since the pandemic began. Never-ending shifts in a never-ending news cycle. Adjusting to remote workflows and in my case, taking on a new investigative role. We were covering the most important health story in a century, but my own health was the farthest thing from my mind. Until a viewer emailed me last month. She saw a lump on my neck. Said it reminded her of her own. Hers was cancer. Turns out, mine is too.\n\nPrice went on to say that COVID-19 responses created some \u201cdiagnostic delays,\u201d but that she will have undergone surgery by mid-July 2020 to remove the tumor, thyroid, and a couple of nearby lymph nodes. Price\u2019s doctor told her that the cancer is spreading, but \u201cnot too much,\u201d and they are both hopeful that this will be the journalist\u2019s \u201cfirst and last procedure.\u201d\n\n\u201cHad I never received that email, I never would have called my doctor. The cancer would have continued to spread. It\u2019s a scary and humbling thought,\u201d wrote Price.\n\nThe situation began when Price received an email from a concerned viewer, who asked the reporter to have her thyroid checked:\n\nWhen asked by another reader to point out the lump, Price shared an image of herself during a broadcast, pointing out a \u201csubtle protrusion\u201d that showed the tumor in the middle of her thyroid, pushing her thyroid gland \u201cup and out.\u201d\n\nSnopes is awaiting a response from Price regarding what type of cancer she was diagnosed with, so we will update the story once we hear back. WFLA shared Price\u2019s post on its Twitter account, wishing the broadcast journalist a \u201cspeedy recovery.\u201d\n\nPrice is not the first television personality to have been diagnosed with cancer after receiving a viewer comment. In 2019, \u201cInside Edition\u201d host Deborah Norville underwent surgery to remove a cancerous thyroid nodule after a viewer spotted a lump on her neck during a broadcast, reported Today at the time. Tarek El Moussa, host of HGTV\u2019s \u201cFlip or Flop,\u201d was also diagnosed with Stage 2 thyroid cancer after a nurse spotted a lump on his neck and contacted the show\u2019s producers.\n\nIn an Aug. 4 interview, Price told TODAY that she was feeling \u201c90% back to normal,\u201d and planned to launch a foundation to spread awareness of thyroid cancer in women.", "lang": "en"}
