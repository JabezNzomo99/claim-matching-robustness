Once you\u2019ve had the infection, they don\u2019t treat it. They have no definite proven role in the treatment of coronavirus,\u201d Dr Chatterjee said.\n\nDr Sumit Ray, a critical care specialist in Delhi NCR also told The Quint that there was no evidence that these kind of cures can help in either stopping or recovering from coronavirus.\n\n\u201cEarlier, in pandemics when there was not much medical management, solutions like these were like a solace to people. But at present, there is fairly good medical management which can improve outcomes, so trying to do these and not actually approaching healthcare facilities for the disease could be counter-productive,\u201d Dr Ray said.", "lang": "en"}
