Let\u2019s try to analyze the extent of truth in this post.\n\n\n\nWhen the video in the post was uploaded in \u2018invid\u2019 plugin, many keyframes were obtained. When they were reverse image searched using Google, articles and videos related to it were found. From the article published by \u2018Telangana Today\u2019 newspaper and a YouTube video from \u2018ETV Telangana\u2019 news channel, it is understood that a crocodile was washed ashore and was found on a flyover beside National Highway-44 at Doodgaon village of Mendora mandal in Nizamabad district of Telangana. So, the claim that the video was taken when a crocodile was found near the Tukaram gate in Secunderabad is not true.\n\n\n\n\u2018The Hans India\u2019 news organization has also tweeted this video as a crocodile found near the Tukaram gate in Secunderabad. However, when they were alerted about the fact that it was an old video, they tweeted again saying it was false news.\n\n\n\nFinally, the video shared as a crocodile was found near the Tukaram gate in Secunderabad was actually that of a crocodile found near National Highway-44 at Doodgaon village of Mendora mandal in Nizamabad district of Telangana.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
