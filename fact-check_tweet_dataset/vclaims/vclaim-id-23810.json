She has called the idea of a border wall \u201cimmoral,\u201d but did not say it would \u201cviolate the rights\u201d of illegal immigrants.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has made immigration a centerpiece of his presidency, leading to partisan fights in Washington, D.C. Only months ago, his insistence on $5.7 billion in border wall funding resulted in a partial government shutdown that lasted 35 days.\n\nIn a post that has been shared over 31,000 times since it was posted in May 2018, the Facebook page claims that Pelosi said a wall would \u201cviolate the rights of millions of illegals.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, she actually said that,\u201d the image reiterates.\n\nEven though Pelosi has been vocal about her opposition to the wall \u2013 in April 2017, she called it \u201cimmoral, expensive, unwise\u201d \u2013 there is no evidence she ever said this. The Daily Caller could not find the statement in news coverage or elsewhere, and as a prominent figure in politics, such a comment would likely have been widely covered.\n\nThe meme inspired some Facebook users to comment that illegal immigrants \u201chave no rights,\u201d though this too is not accurate. People in the U.S. illegally are not eligible to vote, but they are afforded basic constitutional rights such as due process.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court held in the 1800\u2019s that aliens who have entered the United States have due process rights, even if they entered the United States illegally,\u201d Professor Sarah Cleveland of Columbia Law School told the Caller in an email. \u201cAnd yes, undocumented aliens are protected by other constitutional rights.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
