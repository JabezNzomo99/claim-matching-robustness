Al Franken is leaving his Senate seat to avoid some unspecified scandal is so fake, it\u2019s stolen from another fake news story about a different senator.\n\n\"Libtard hero Al Franken forced to resign in disgrace,\" read the headline on a June 15, 2017, post on Breakingtop.world, which has hidden its registration information.\n\nFacebook users flagged the post as possible being fabricated, as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to fight fake news.\n\n\"Libtard Democrat Al Franken will resign his seat as U.S. Senator and Minority Leader this morning after learning that the White House has enough on him to ruin his marriage and send him to jail,\" the post read. \"Rather than face the backlash and vindictive response from the Trump administration to his requests to play ball, Franken will resign, deny all of the allegations and spend the next 7 1/2 years under investigation by Trey Gowdy.\"\n\nThe post is definitely fake. There has been no announcement that the former comedian Franken, D-Minn., is quitting after winning re-election in 2014. Otherwise he probably would have mentioned it during his recent NPR interview.\n\nBreakingtop.world doesn\u2019t have any contact information, but it does have a Facebook page titled \"Fake News Report.\" That\u2019s quite a clue that this is made up.\n\nThe site referred to the source of its post as a June 14 version of the article on OurLandOfTheFree.com, another parody website with hidden registration information. OurLandOfTheFree.com says in its footer note that the site makes \"no guarantee that what you read here is true. In fact, it's probably not.\" It echoes the warning on its About Us page.\n\nBut if you noticed, the post referred to Franken as the Senate minority leader, which he isn\u2019t. That role belongs to Democrat Chuck Schumer. The Breakingtop.world post even mentions ousting Schumer later in the text.\n\nThat detail is wrong because the entire article has essentially copied a May 23 post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org that really was about Schumer.\n\nTheLastLineOfDefense.org is a parody website run by liberal troll Christopher Blair. Blair\u2019s goal is to publish fake stories with absurd narratives in an attempt to fool conservatives.\n\nHow this story ended up getting copied and passed on as a dig at Franken is anyone\u2019s guess, but it\u2019s not true.\n\nWe rate this statement Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
