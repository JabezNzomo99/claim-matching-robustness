I think we can do better than that.\" That prompted Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, to come to the microphone and call it a breach of the traditional bipartisan decorum for such events.\n\nJindal, a potential Republican presidential candidate, hit the airwaves again two days later when he was interviewed on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe.\n\nPanelist Mike Barnicle asked Jindal to defend his own economic record: \"The last time the Census Bureau checked the per capita income of Louisiana, you were 47th lowest in the United States, not all under your watch. What have you done, as governor, to bring in all these better paying jobs and boost your people's per capita income?\"\n\nJindal responded, \"Well, the great thing is, we're doing exactly what the president has not. Cut taxes, reform debt, make some investment in workforce training, make it easier for businesses to create jobs. And here's the record. In Louisiana, we now have more people working, highest incomes in our state's history. Larger population than ever before. And the president can't say all those things about the country. Our economy has grown 50 percent faster than the national GDP, even since the national recession.\"\n\nWe wondered whether it\u2019s correct that Louisiana has \"grown 50 percent faster than the national GDP, even since the national recession.\"\n\nWhen we asked Jindal\u2019s office for more detail, they said he had been comparing the growth in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product for his state and the nation since 2007 -- a year he chose because it was the \"baseline\" year before he began his first term as governor.\n\nWe looked at the numbers and found that Jindal actually understated the comparison. Between 2007 and 2012 (the last year for which data is available), inflation-adjusted GDP grew by 2.5 percent nationally, but by 6.4 percent in Louisiana.\n\nThis definitely supports Jindal\u2019s claim. However, we\u2019ll note a caveat: While the timespan Jindal used certainly makes sense given his tenure as governor, it\u2019s not the only way to define \"since the national recession\" -- the words he used in the MSNBC interview.\n\nThe recession in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. So if you want to look at the period \"since the recession,\" one could just as easily use the range 2008-12, 2009-12 or 2010-12. So let\u2019s look at how these date ranges stack up.\n\nFor 2008-12, Jindal would also be correct. During that period, Louisiana growth (7.9 percent) easily outpaced United States growth (3.2 percent).\n\nBut he\u2019d be wrong for 2009-12, when United States growth (6.7 percent) exceeded Louisiana growth (4.6 percent).\n\nAnd he\u2019d also be wrong for 2010-12, when the United States economy grew (4.1 percent) and the Louisiana economy actually shrank (by 1.2 percent).\n\nUnited States growth also exceeded Louisiana growth between 2011 and 2012 -- 2.5 percent to 1.5 percent.\n\nPerhaps an easier way to look at it is to compare the year-over-year growth in GDP for Louisiana and the United States. The more robust statistic for each year is listed in bold.\n\nIf you look at it this way, the United States economy has grown faster (or shrunk less) in three of these years, compared to two years when the Louisiana economy did better, which undercuts Jindal\u2019s claim.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t surprise John Francis, an economist at Louisiana Tech.\n\n\"Louisiana's economy is highly dependent on the energy sector which, no matter where in the business cycle we lie, is always in demand,\" he said. \"So, when the economy is in a recession, we tend to do better than average. When the economy is doing better, energy demand is somewhat higher, but not dramatically so. So when the economy is doing well, we lag behind the U.S. average. I suspect that we were doing better when the economy was in the heart of the Great Recession, but we have fallen behind as the overall economy has rebounded.\"\n\nHowever, Jindal\u2019s camp draws the following analogy: In a football game between the \"United States team\" and the \"Louisiana team,\" the winner would be the one who ended up with more points, not the one who won more quarters.\n\n\"By any objective analysis, Louisiana has outperformed the national economy since January 2008,\" said Michael Reed, a spokesman for Jindal.\n\nJindal said, \"Our economy (in Louisiana) has grown 50 percent faster than the national GDP, even since the national recession.\"\n\nThe time frame Jindal\u2019s office said he used -- from 2007 to 2012 -- is a reasonable one, and using that period does make his claim accurate. However, it\u2019s worth remembering that taking one crack at the numbers can tell an incomplete story.\n\nThe statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
