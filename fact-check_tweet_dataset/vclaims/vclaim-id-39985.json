It almost certainly weighed less than 3kg, rather than 12kg as claimed.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-39985", "url": "https://fullfact.org/online/not-so-big-rat/", "vclaim": "There was not a 12kg rat in London\n\nA Facebook post which has been shared over 10,000 times purports to show a picture of a 12kg rat in London.\n\nThe Facebook group posting the image (called Surrealistic Reality) specialises in posting optical illusions: which is a clue not to take this post seriously. The rat does not weigh 12 kg.\n\nA number of websites have already debunked the image, which is real but which makes the rat look deceptively big.\n\nThe reason for this is an effect known as \u201cforced perspective\u201d where objects closer to the camera appear much bigger than those further away.\n\nA classic example of the forced perspective effect is people pretending to prop up the leaning tower of Pisa with a single hand. The image first appeared in 2016, after the rat was found by engineers working at a block of flats in Hackney in London. Reports claimed the rat was four feet long (about 120cm) and weighed 25 pounds (about 11kg).\n\nHowever Oliver O\u2019Brien, a spatial data scientist at University College London, analysed the image and estimates that the rat was roughly two feet long (60cm).\n\nProfessor Jane Hurst, who specialises in mammalian behaviour and evolution at Liverpool University, said that it was most likely a Gambian pouched rat which was someone\u2019s pet.\n\nGambian pouched rats (also known as African giant pouched rats) can reach around three foot (90cm) in length (body and tail combined) and weigh no more than 3kg.\n\nThis article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook.

For the purposes of that scheme, we\u2019ve rated this claim as satire because, while it\u2019s incorrect to claim the rat weighed 12kg, we don\u2019t think the post was meant to be taken seriously. (Facebook does not currently have a label for irreverent or light-hearted content other than satire, so we sometimes use \u201csatire\u201d for things that may not strictly be satirical. We\u2019ve previously called on Facebook to introduce a more appropriate label for such humorous posts.)", "lang": "en"}
