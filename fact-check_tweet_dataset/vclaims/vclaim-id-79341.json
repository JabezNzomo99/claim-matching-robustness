Snopes readers asked our team to verify whether RNC attendees ignored social-distancing and mask-wearing recommendations put out by leading health officials earlier in the year.\n\nThis claim is true. Hundreds of people were indeed recorded sitting within close proximity of each other \u2014 certainly closer than the recommended 6-foot guideline \u2014 while very few individuals were seen wearing a mask.\n\nThe source for the image shared to Twitter was not immediately clear. A reverse-image search found 15 results, most of which linked back to Reddit and Imgur. While it is not immediately clear when the image in question was captured or who took it, Snopes corroborated elements from the photo with CSPAN live footage of the event and confirmed that attendees at the RNC convention did not appear to be practicing social distancing. Many were seen sitting side by side on the White House lawn, and few were wearing masks. A wide shot of the audience can be seen beginning at the 1-hour and 36-minute mark onward.\n\nThe event followed three days of convention activities in Charlotte, North Carolina, in which delegates officially selected incumbent Republican President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nIn light of COVID-19 coronavirus regulations in the southern state, RNC representatives stated that organizers had \u201cmodified\u201d convention rules to better align with the North Carolina governor\u2019s executive order and limited the number of people allowed to gather. However, a look at COVID-19 restrictions in place at the time in North Carolina, and three days later in D.C., suggests that the convention committee did not adhere to regulations put in place by local government leaders.\n\nIn August 2020, North Carolina\u2019s \u201cSafer at Home\u201d Phase Two restrictions required people to wear face masks while out in public when physical distancing of 6 feet was not possible, as well as limited gatherings to 10 people indoors and 25 people when outside. A government release shared by North Carolina officials confirmed that nearly 800 tests were conducted among those attending or providing support to the Charlotte meeting, and at least four people involved with the convention tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nOn June 22, the District of Columbia also issued Phase Two regulations that prohibited mass gatherings of more than 50 people and similarly required people to wear masks outdoors when they were likely to come \u201cwithin six feet of another person for more than a fleeting time.\u201d\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Trump did not mention mask-wearing or social-distancing but did promise a \u201csafe and effective\u201d vaccine by the end of the year \u2014 \u201cor maybe even sooner\u201d \u2014 adding that America will \u201ccrush the virus.\u201d\n\nConfusion in the early days of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic resulted from mixed messages shared by the White House and federal officials and soon became a point of political partisanship during the presidential election.\n\nStudies conducted by infectious disease experts confirmed that masks slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes the respiratory infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) flip-flopped on its mask-wearing stance at the onset of the pandemic, but in August 2020 reiterated that people in public settings should wear masks that completely cover the nose and mouth.", "lang": "en"}
