A headline on another post says that another Seahawk, \u201cNFL Player Richard Sherman, Who Burned U.S Flag, Has Been Thrown Out From The Team.\u201d\n\nThe Bennett story was based on a photo that was altered to show him holding a burning U.S. flag in a locker room as his teammates, including Sherman, looked on.\n\nSherman has not been released from the team. In fact, he was recently featured in an Oct. 13 post on the Seahawks\u2019 website about him visiting a young fan in the hospital.\n\nThe fake image of Bennett was first shared on the Facebook page of Vets for Trump in late September. The post, which the group took down, was up for two days and was shared 10,000 times, Vladimir Lemets, the social media director for Vets for Trump, told FactCheck.org.\n\nThe group later shared a link to an article admitting that the picture wasn\u2019t real, but arguing that it \u201cwas an accurate metaphor for what the NFL is doing to America.\u201d\n\nWeeks after the bogus photo went viral, our readers are still asking about it.\n\nFor the record, the Seahawks posted the original, unedited picture on the team\u2019s official Twitter account on Jan. 3, 2016. It shows Sherman (No. 25) and other Seattle players and coaches watching as Bennett does \u201ca now-traditional post-victory dance\u201d after a win against the Arizona Cardinals. There was no flag involved in the celebration.\n\nBennett is among several players who has silently demonstrated at games during the national anthem. He said at the start of the current NFL season that he would sit for the anthem in order to raise awareness about racism and intolerance.\n\nSherman, on the other hand, has said that he doesn\u2019t agree with Bennett and other players who don\u2019t stand during the anthem. Sherman said their message is important, but it is getting lost in the controversy over the anthem.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nWashington Post. \u201cTrump\u2019s full speech in support of Luther Strange in Alabama.\u201d YouTube video. 26 Sep 2017.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: SEATTLE SEAHAWKS MAY BE KICKED OUT OF NFL FOR WHAT THEY DID IN LOCKER ROOM.\u201d Defendrace.co. 10 Oct 2017.\n\nDillingham, Thomas. \u201cThe Image Is Photo-shopped, But Veterans Agree, It Is An Accurate Metaphor For What The NFL Is Doing To America.\u201d NationOneNews.com. 10 Oct 2017.\n\nWyche, Steve. \u201cMichael Bennett on why he will continue to sit during anthem.\u201d NFL.com. 14 Aug 2017.\n\nWisniewski, Lindsey. \u201cAll Seahawks players stand during the national anthem against Rams.\u201d USA Today. 8 Oct 2017.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: NFL Player Richard Sherman, Who Burned U.S. Flag, Has Been Thrown Out From The Team.
