Ashok Gehlot indeed served tea to Congress party workers and guests while celebrating Rajasthan Assembly election results.\n\nThe caption of the picture read: Former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot serves tea to the Congress party workers and guests while celebrating Rajasthan Assembly election results, at his residence in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India, Tuesday, Dec 11, 2018.(Photo By Vishal Bhatnagar/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (Photo by Vishal Bhatnagar/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nHowever, based on the above facts, it is clear that the picture is not recent and has no connection with the ongoing political rift between Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot.
