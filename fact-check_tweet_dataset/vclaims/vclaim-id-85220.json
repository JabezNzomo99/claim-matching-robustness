NARAL Pro-Choice America, an organization that supports abortion rights and opposes the policy, tweeted that the policy \u201ckills funding for ANY health center that even *mentions* abortion.\u201d The organization did not respond to our requests for clarification.\n\nThe Mexico City policy took effect in 1985 under President Ronald Reagan, and it has been rescinded (by Democratic presidents) and restored (by Republican ones) ever since. President Trump\u2019s memorandum revokes President Barack Obama\u2019s January 2009 memo rescinding the policy. It reinstates President George W. Bush\u2019s January 2001 memorandum, which restored the policy after President Bill Clinton revoked it in January 1993.\n\nUnder this policy, foreign nongovernmental organizations that receive family planning assistance from the United States cannot \u201cperform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning\u201d even with money that does not come from the United States. The use of U.S. aid to pay for abortions overseas is prohibited, under several laws that were in place even before the Mexico City policy.\n\nYet those who oppose abortion rights often characterize this policy as a protection against taxpayer funds being used to pay for or actively promote abortion overseas. (Similar language is included in the memos from Trump and Bush.) That is why NARAL Pro-Choice America and other advocates of abortion rights call it a \u201cmyth\u201d that Trump\u2019s policy \u201cbans taxpayer $ for abortion overseas.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerforming\u201d abortions is self-explanatory, but what constitutes \u201cactively promoting\u201d abortion as a family planning method? Per USAID\u2019s 2007 handbook, an organization is \u201cactively promoting\u201d abortion when it commits resources \u201cto increase the availability or use of abortion\u201d as a method of family planning. Abortion-rights advocates call it a \u201cglobal gag rule,\u201d since it limits the discussion of abortion in counseling sessions, with some exceptions.\n\nThat means organizations can discuss abortion if it is in the context of those three exceptions \u2014 despite NARAL Pro-Choice America\u2019s claim that it kills funding for any group that \u201ceven mentions abortions.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has indicated it will expand the scope of the prior policy, which previously applied to family planning assistance funds through USAID and the U.S. Department of State. Trump\u2019s memo extended the policy to all U.S. global health assistance (not just family planning), by all departments or agencies.\n\nMoreover, Trump plans to reduce global aid overall. Draft executive orders obtained by the New York Times showed a termination of funding \u201cfor any United Nations agency or other international body that meets any one of several criteria\u201d \u2014 including organizations that support programs that fund abortions.\n\nIn general, the executive branch has broad discretion over foreign affairs and foreign aid. So in theory, Trump could decide to expand the policy to strip the previous exclusions (i.e., the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother) or even ban an organization that \u201ceven mentions abortion.\u201d\n\nBut until the regulation is written and entered into the Federal Register, it would be pure conjecture to say how the policy will change under Trump.\n\nPrevious iterations of the policy did not ban funding to any organization that \u201ceven mentions\u201d abortion. The provisions made some exceptions to discussions of abortions \u2014 for example, organizations can treat women who have post-abortion illnesses or injuries, and can make referrals for women seeking abortions for pregnancies that resulted from rape or incest, or that threaten the life of the mother. So if the policy under Trump contains the same exceptions, NARAL Pro-Choice America\u2019s claim would deserve at least two Pinocchios.\n\nHowever, the memo calling for a restoration of this policy is just a few days old, and there is no draft regulation available for the public yet. Trump\u2019s administration has broad authority to set the terms of foreign assistance \u2014 and has already indicated it will be restricting foreign aid. So we will issue a Verdict Pending for this rating, until further information becomes available. At that point, we will update this fact check with a ruling.", "lang": "en"}
