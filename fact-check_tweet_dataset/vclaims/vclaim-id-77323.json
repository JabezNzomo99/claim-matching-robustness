This isn\u2019t one of them. The story is fake.\n\n\"Tampa man loses testicles after trying to 'fill scuba tank with weed smoke',\" read the headline on an April 13, 2017, article on FloridaSunPost.com. The story was flagged by Facebook users who suspected the story may be fake, as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to curtail fake news.\n\nThe story said a Tampa man named Darren Winters \"had consumed a copious amount of alcohol\" when he decided to invite friends over to witness him use a contraption he dubbed a \"scuba bong.\"\n\nThe recreational diver had planned to blow smoke into a scuba tank with a compressor, then inhale it through a regulator, the story read. Winters reportedly knocked the tank off a workbench and it exploded, with shrapnel severing his genitals.\n\nWhile those details are graphic, they\u2019re also completely fabricated. FloridaSunPost.com is a fake news website designed to look like a traditional news outlet.\n\nThe exact same story appeared on BostonLeader.com on Sept. 16, 2016, with the location changed to Boston. The name of the victim was changed to Michael Fitzpatrick \u2014 although the surname Palmer was cited once, too.\n\nWhere did Palmer come from? Another version of the same story was posted on Sept. 3 at IsThatLegit.com, but this time in Calgary, Canada. The victim in that story was named Robert Palmer.\n\nThese sites and others, such as the MississippiHerald.com, AlabamaObserver.com and DenverInquirer.com, certainly appear related. The sites we found all were privately registered through a domain service in Toronto.\n\nThe privacy terms of FloridaSunPost.com and the related websites said they don\u2019t guarantee \"the information on this website is complete, true, accurate or non-misleading.\" We attempted to contact the sites\u2019 owner through an online contact form, but did not receive a reply.\n\nIt\u2019s clear the story of a drunken diver who suffered from explosive emasculation is made up, and has been shared among several websites.\n\nWe rate the statement Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
