If you look closely, you can see the individual rubbish bags are identical in both pictures.\n\nThe original photo was taken on Roding Road, in Hackney, in the constituency neighbouring Miss Abbott\u2019s (Hackney South and Shoreditch) rather than her own (Hackney North and Stoke Newington).\n\nUsing Google Street view, you can see that the billboard was removed sometime between 2008 and 2012. From what we\u2019ve seen, the mocked up poster started appearing online before the 2015 election.\n\nMiss Abbott has also confirmed the poster is not real.\n\nYou can read more about how to tell whether images are what they say they are in our blog post here.", "lang": "en"}
