A Twitter user Janmajit Shankar Sinha (@janmajit007) shared the pictures and wrote a heartwarming story.\n\nThe story shared with the images claims that the cow and the leopard cuddle at night. This was recently found out in Assam. The complete story reads, \u201cIn Assam a person bought a cow. During night he heard the dogs barking, it happened for successive nights; so he got CCTV installed. He was surprised to see that a leopard visited every night and sat near the cow. On inquiring from the previous owner, he got to know that the mother of this leopard was killed when the cub was only 20 days old. The cow fed him her milk and saved his life. The cub was left off in the jungle as it grew up. But, the fully grown leopard comes every night and still spends time with the cow, whom it considers as his mother.\u201d\n\nHis tweet was quote-tweeted by former J&K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah.\n\nThe post has been shared by several individual users on Facebook.\n\nThe pictures were also shared on the occasion of Mothers\u2019s Day in May.

The story does not match social media claims. Viral messages allege that the cow used to nurse the leopard when it was young, which is why it came to meet her. However, The Times of India quoted Conservator of forests, Vadodara, H S Singh saying, \u201cSometimes animal behaviour can get modified. In this case, probably because the leopard which has passed the sub-adult stage, lives in a rural area and not strictly a wild environment.\u201d\n\n Speaking with Alt News, Shyam Parekh informed that several people had expressed disbelief when they heard the story at the time. \u201cWe asked a wildlife photographer to click pictures of the animals to corroborate the story. The incident did happen 18 years ago in Gujarat,\u201d he said.
