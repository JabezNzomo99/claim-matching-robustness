Some of the quotes are motivational, but others serve a political agenda. And not all of them were actually said by the person they\u2019re attributed to.\n\nBecause of this, Facebook users need to take care before sharing these memes.\n\nA fake attribution may just use the image of a celebrated figure to give the quote credibility.\n\ncontains a quote attributed to George Washington, the first president of the United States.\n\nIt reads: \u201cA free people ought not only be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.\u201d\n\nTwo questions will help us sort fact from fiction here. Did Washington really say this? And if he did, in what context?\n\nOnly first 11 words are real\n\nand rated the quote as false.\n\nIt includes only a portion of\n\nto the members of Senate and House of Representatives in 1790.\n\nHere\u2019s what he actually said: \u201cA free people ought not only to be armed but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well digested plan is requisite: And their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactories, as tend to render them independent on others, for essential, particularly for military supplies.\u201d\n\nWashington only spoke the first 11 words of the quote in the meme. The rest is false.\n\nBut where does this kind of misinformation come from?\n\n, the quote started to make the rounds on the internet in January 2016 when former president Barack Obama\n\nnew measures for gun control in the US.\n\nSo it\u2019s an attempt to set an agenda, to help support the argument for gun ownership and for taking up arms against a government. It\u2019s not just a quote. It has an extra purpose.\n\nThe context of Washington\u2019s quote\n\nBut what was the context of the words Washington actually spoke?\n\nthat Washington was talking about national defence policy, not individuals arming themselves.\n\nWhen quotes are exaggerated and taken out of context, they can become a form of misinformation.\n\nChecking if a quote is accurate before sharing it can help slow the spread of harmful information, the aim of Facebook\u2019s third-party", "lang": "en"}
