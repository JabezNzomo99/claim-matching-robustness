We\u2019re still helping Puerto Rico. The governor is an excellent guy and he\u2019s very happy with the job we\u2019ve done. We have put billions and billions of dollars into Puerto Rico. \n\n\n\nAnd it was a very tough one. Don\u2019t forget, their electric plant was dead before the hurricane. If you look back on your records, you\u2019ll see that plant was dead, it was shut, it was bankrupt, it was out of business. They owed tremendous amounts of money. They had it closed up. And then when the hurricane came, people said, \u2018What do are we going to do about electricity?\u2019 That wasn\u2019t really the hurricane. That was gone before the hurricane.\u201d\n\n\u2014 President Trump, in remarks on Wednesday at the White House\n\nMr. Trump is right that Puerto Rico\u2019s electric utility had declared bankruptcy and that the power grid was plagued with issues before Hurricane Maria ravaged the island last September. But it is not accurate to suggest that people had no electricity before the hurricane.\n\nThe Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or Prepa, was widely criticized in September 2016, when a fire knocked a power plant offline and left 1.5 million people without electricity for three days.\n\nAfter the cutoff, a Puerto Rico Energy Commission report noted that Prepa had failed to safely and reliably supply electricity. It concluded that customers experienced interruption rates four to five times higher than other American utilities and that its \u201ctransmission and distribution systems are falling apart quite literally.\u201d\n\nOn top of the litany of management and infrastructure issues outlined in the report, Prepa has also been in financial distress for years and, straddled with $9 billion of bond debt, effectively filed for bankruptcy in July 2017.", "lang": "en"}
