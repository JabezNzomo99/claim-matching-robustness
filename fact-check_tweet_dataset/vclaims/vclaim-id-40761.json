London's figure is one of four created of the statesman, with the other three taking up residence at Madame Tussauds attractions in Singapore, Hong Kong and Bangkok. Each figure took a team of talented artists four months and cost \u00a3150,000 to create,\" Merlin Entertainments PLC, the company that operates the Madame Tussauds franchise, said in a press release in April 2016.\n\nThe viral post was also debunked by Hindi website The Lallantop earlier on Wednesday.", "lang": "en"}
