According to scuttlebutt, the meat used by that chain in its sandwiches isn\u2019t actually beef but is instead an imitation foodstuff arrived at by reconstituting a powder, gel, paste, or liquid, then shaping the resultant mass into something approaching the appearance of a cut of meat before roasting, cooling, and slicing it. How long this rumor has been out there is hard to say, but it first came to us in 1997.\n\nWe asked Arby\u2019s about the meat they use, and here is their response:\n\nThank you for doing your part to curb the urban legend about Arby\u2019s Roast Beef. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the first to express frustration about this type of story.The answer to your question is no. Our product does not arrive as a paste, gel or liquid. Arby\u2019s Roast Beef consists entirely of Beef and a Self-Basting solution, which contains just enough water to keep the product juicy throughout our restaurants\u2019 3-hour roasting process and during slicing \u2014 this ensures that we will deliver the quality that our customers have come to expect from our famous roast beef sandwiches.\n\nA number of sources of our acquaintance who have worked in the kitchens and at the counters of various Arby\u2019s bear out what the corporation has to say. They told us that the beef arrives pre-packaged at each restaurant, leaving employees of each franchise only to cut open the plastic, place the roasts on cooking sheets, and cook them for three hours before cooling, slicing, and serving.\n\nAs one of those employees who had been in charge of the meat slicer at an Arby\u2019s restaurant explained to us, most packaged bulk meat arrives packed in a gelatinous broth inside plastic airtight bags. Someone who is less than familiar with what the product looks like upon arrival might mistake the gelatinous broth for the beef itself, then from there jump to the conclusion that the contents of the package is a gel or paste.\n\nGranted, what\u2019s inside those airtight bags may not resemble actual roast beef in color or texture (the meat is kind of grayish and rather soft and squishy, enough so that one could easily poke a finger through it), but it\u2019s still not a liquid, gel or paste.\n\nRumors about the meat being served by other fast food outlets has been the subject of whispers too. In the 1970s McDonald\u2019s was deviled by the rumor that its hamburgers were made with worm meat. Wendy\u2019s has apparently also picked up a meat adulteration rumor:\n\nI have heard from several friends that the Wendy\u2019s fast food chain uses meat with an edible styrofoam compound as to save money on cost. I\u2019m very skeptical about this, but I\u2019ve been surprised at the number of people that have heard this rumor. This arose from an outing to Wendy\u2019s with friends. I bit in to a burger and was welcomed with something hard and tough, but couldn\u2019t manage to find anything after that. I dismissed it as a piece of cartilage or grisle that made it into the meat, but everyone else at the table had heard this rumor from various sources.\n\nArby\u2019s derived its name, by the way, from the phonetic sound of the initials R.B. However, the \u201cR.B.\u201d does not, as many folks conclude, represent \u201croast beef\u201d but rather \u201cRaffel Brothers,\u201d the restaurant equipment business owned and operated by Forrest and Leroy Raffel that was the forerunner to the successful sandwich chain. In its history, Arby\u2019s quotes Forrest Raffel as saying, \u201cWe came up with Arby\u2019s, which stands for R.B., the initials of Raffel Brothers, although I guess customers might think the initials stand for roast beef.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
