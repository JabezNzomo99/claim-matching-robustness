This claim is incorrect and displays a fundamental misunderstanding of basic science principles.\n\nFirst, viruses do not have their own pH. Sarah Stanley, an associate professor of infectious diseases and vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley, explained to The Associated Press that \u201cpH is something that applies to a water-based solution, which a virus is not.\u201d\n\nSecond, the pH of the body\u2019s different tissues, blood, and cells are all very tightly controlled, as is the extracellular environment where the virus first binds to cells. \u201cThe body maintains a very narrow pH (7-7.4), which is the range at which the chemical reactions that keep us alive are optimal\u201d, writes Steven Novella, a clinical neurologist at the Yale University School of Medicine. \u201cIf the pH strays outside this range, you will indeed become acutely ill. For this reason animals have evolved a host of powerful mechanisms to keep the blood and tissues within this very narrow pH. \u2026.These mechanisms for maintaining a narrow range of pH (in a healthy person) overwhelm the effect of whatever you eat or drink.\u201d\n\nThe pH of saliva can indeed vary depending on overall health, the presence of periodontal disease, or food intake[1], but the mouth is not the only route of entry for SARS-CoV-2 and so far it doesn\u2019t appear to contain the same density of cells containing the ACE2 receptors that the virus targets as do other tissues. Currently, the tissues that are thought to be more vulnerable to infection include the lungs, esophagus, heart, kidney, bladder, and intestines, which again are tightly controlled in terms of pH[2,3].\n\nFinally, and perhaps most glaringly, the post lists the wrong pH values for all of the foods that it recommends eating to combat SARS-CoV-2. In fact, every food item on the list has an acidic pH\u2014that is, below 7\u2014rather than an alkaline pH as the post suggests. Further, two of the food items, avocado and dandelion, are labeled with pH values that are rarely if ever found in nature, let alone in foods that people could safely consume.\n\nIn summary, food at any pH will not alter the very tightly controlled pH of tissues targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, an alkaline diet will neither prevent nor treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nOther fact checkers also covered this claim: Lead Stories rated it \u201cFalse\u201d and Africa Check labeled it \u201cIncorrect\u201d.\n\nHealth Feedback is working with the CoronaVirusFacts, a coalition of more than 100 fact-checkers who are fighting misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
