The graphic used for the false claim was manipulated.\n\nOn June 30, it debunked the false claim, saying, \"Walang nilalabas na balita ang Proud Cavite\u00f1o tungkol sa liquor ban sa Cavite na sisimulan sa July 1.\" (Proud Cavite\u00f1o has not released any news on a liquor ban in Cavite that will start on July 1.)\n\nOn May 29, Cavite Governor Jonvic Remulla said in a Facebook post that the liquor ban would be officially lifted effective June 1. He also gave guidelines as to the amount of alcohol that may be bought, and said that public intoxication is not allowed.\n\nThen on June 24, Remulla said on Facebook that the provincial council has a new \"Public Intoxication Ordinance.\" In his post, he said that police will be equipped with alcohol breath analyzers, drivers caught with excessive alcohol in their blood will automatically be arrested, and suspected drunk persons on the streets who fail the breath analyzer test will be fined.\n\nHowever, he did not say that a new liquor ban will be imposed. \"Hindi po namin pinagbabawal ang uminom. Pag nasa loob ng bahay ay kayo ang masusunod. Pero sa lansangan, ang batas na ang iiral,\" Remulla said. (We are not prohibiting drinking. If you are inside your house, you will be in charge. But on the streets, the law will prevail.)\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
