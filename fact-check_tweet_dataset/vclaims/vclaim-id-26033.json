The sharp decline in oil prices has negatively affected growth, while sanctions have impaired access to international markets. These developments have exacerbated the pre-existing structural slowdown in growth and taken a toll on the banking system. The key risks include a weaker medium-term path for oil prices, the intensification of geopolitical tensions and sanctions, and a further slowdown in growth.\u201d\n\nThe report notes that, \u201cThe authorities\u2019 policies have helped to keep the banking system stable\u201d however, \u201cthe banking system is weak and likely to need additional capital, and the governance continued to be weak and concentration of moral hazard increased.\u201d\n\nThe Financial Stability Board \u2013 an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system, said in a 2018 report, that Russia\u2019s financial system \u201ccontinued to suffer from weak governance, including sometimes non-transparent ownership structures and deficiencies in reporting. Despite progress achieved in previous years, the regulatory and supervisory framework still had gaps and weaknesses.\u201d\n\nReuters reports the new sanctions come in two tranches. The first, which targets U.S. exports of sensitive national-security related goods, comes with deep exemptions and many of the items it covers have already been banned by previous restrictions.\n\nThe second tranche, according to Reuters, can be selectively activated after 90 days if Moscow fails to provide \u201creliable assurances\u201d it will no longer use chemical weapons and blocks on-site inspections, is potentially more serious.\n\nAlmost 700 Russian people and companies currently are under U.S. sanctions. Individuals face limits on their travel and freezes on at least some of their assets, while some top Russian state banks and companies, including oil and gas giants, are effectively barred from getting financing through U.S. banks and markets.", "lang": "en"}
