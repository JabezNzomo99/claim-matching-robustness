At best, an antiviral drug might be ready for production in June.\n\nThe novel coronavirus, which emerged at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, has now infected more than 125,000 people across the globe, and led to more than 4,700 deaths. In the U.S., there have been at least 39 deaths and 1,500 cases. The pneumonia-like disease caused by the virus is known as COVID-19.\n\nTrump\u2019s speech from the Oval Office began shortly after 9 p.m. Eastern on March 11 and lasted just 10 minutes.\n\nTrump\u2019s biggest announcement of the evening was a set of new travel restrictions on people coming from Europe. But in his delivery, he bungled numerous facets of the policy.\n\nThe policy does not restrict \u201call travel\u201d from Europe, as Trump claimed, and does not only exempt the U.K.\n\nInstead, as other administration officials later clarified or corrected \u2014 and as the president\u2019s proclamation makes clear \u2014 the policy restricts travel for most foreign nationals who have been in one or more of 26 European countries that make up the Schengen Area in the past 14 days. The Schengen Area includes most, but not all, of continental Europe, and excludes countries such as Ireland, Croatia, Romania and Bulgaria.\n\nTrump alluded vaguely to \u201cexemptions for Americans,\u201d leaving it to others in his administration to explain. According to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security, the travel restrictions do not apply to \u201clegal permanent residents, (generally) immediate family members of U.S. citizens, and other individuals who are identified in the proclamation.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet that quickly followed the president\u2019s address, the White House said that U.S. citizens and others who are exempt \u201cwill be directed to limited airports where screening can take place.\u201d\n\nTrump is also wrong to say that the policy will bar the transfer of goods between Europe and America. The White House noted in a fact sheet released the same day that the policy \u201conly applies to the movement of human beings, not goods or cargo.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s own proclamation specifically states that the \u201cfree flow of commerce between the United States and the Schengen Area countries remains an economic priority for the United States,\u201d and that Trump remains \u201ccommitted to facilitating trade between our nations.\u201d\n\nThe president corrected himself after the speech, clarifying on Twitter that \u201ctrade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe.\u201d\n\nIn his national address, Trump also inaccurately summarized the results of a March 10 coronavirus briefing with insurance companies at the White House.\n\n\u201cEarlier this week, I met with the leaders of [the] health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all copayments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments, and to prevent surprise medical billing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe insurance companies present agreed to no copays for coronavirus tests, but they did not say there would be no copays for coronavirus treatment.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, for example, said in the meeting, \u201call the insurance companies here \u2014 either today or before today \u2014 have agreed to waive all copays on coronavirus testing and extend coverage for coronavirus treatment in all of their benefit plans.\u201d Extending coverage for treatment does not mean that there will be no copayment for treatment.\n\nKristine Grow of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for insurers, told us that because there are no specific treatments for COVID-19, symptoms are treated as for other infectious diseases. \u201cTreatment of symptoms for infectious diseases is covered, according to an individual\u2019s benefit plan,\u201d she said.\n\nGrow said the groups that committed to no copays for COVID-19 testing include the \u201cmajority of health insurance providers nationally, which cover the vast majority of Americans.\u201d\n\nAccording to an AHIP website, some \u2014 but not all \u2014 insurers are also providing COVID-19 treatment without a copayment.\n\nA White House fact sheet notes that \u201chealth plans with health savings accounts will be able to cover coronavirus testing and treatment without co-payments.\u201d Not everyone, however, has an HSA plan, which typically provides skimpier coverage or a higher-deductible plan, and allows individuals to make tax-free contributions for their health expenses. An AHIP survey suggests that as of January 2017, about 22 million Americans have HSA plans.\n\nTrump repeated the disputed claim that \u201cwe made a life-saving move with early action on China,\u201d referring to his Jan. 31 decision to impose restrictions on travel to and from China for certain individuals.\n\nA day later, the president estimated \u2013 without any evidence \u2013 that this \u201cboldest step of all\u201d had \u201chelped save thousands of lives.\u201d\n\nAs we wrote earlier this week, Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told us there\u2019s no evidence that the travel restrictions have saved lives or reduced the number of cases in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe have not seen any evidence that shows the travel restrictions stopped or slowed down transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19,\u201d Nuzzo told us in an email. \u201cIt is possible that it did, but there is no evidence to show this. Rather there are a number of reasons to believe that this may very well not be the case.\u201d\n\nIn addition, on March 6, the journal Science published a modeling study that concluded, according to the press release, \u201cIn areas affected by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), travel restrictions will only modestly impact the spread of the outbreak.\u201d The study\u2019s authors wrote that \u201ctransmission-reduction interventions will provide the greatest benefit to mitigate the epidemic.\u201d\n\nThere are no FDA-approved antiviral drugs for COVID-19. However, there are clinical trials underway, as the president suggested in his remarks.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health announced on Feb. 25 that it had begun a \u201crandomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalized adults diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\u201d at the University of Nebraska.\n\n\u201cRemdesivir, developed by Gilead Sciences Inc., is an investigational broad-spectrum antiviral treatment,\u201d NIH said in a press release. \u201cIt was previously tested in humans with Ebola virus disease and has shown promise in animal models for treating Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which are caused by other coronaviruses.\u201d\n\nPhase three of the U.S. trial began on March 6 and is expected to be completed in May, the NIH says. The company has said it is also conducting clinical trials in China.\n\nAt a White House meeting on March 2, Daniel O\u2019Day, CEO and president of Gilead Sciences, said the company hopes to know by April if the drug is safe and effective. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that \u2014 if all goes well \u2014 manufacturing could begin in June.\n\nLeonard Schleifer, president and CEO of Regeneron, said at the White House meeting that his company is working on a different type of treatment \u2014 a passive vaccine and therapeutic \u2014 that is in the pre-clinical stage. This treatment involves injecting an antibody that would provide temporary protection from COVID-19 (what Schleifer referred to as the \u201cpassive vaccine\u201d) while providing a treatment to help clear the virus. Schleifer said his company could be \u201cproducing 20,000 doses by the end of the summer of a course of treatment,\u201d he said.\n\nThe science news site STAT says the company has used this process successfully before.\n\n\u201cThe last time Regeneron embarked on this process, during the Ebola outbreak of 2015, it came up with an antibody cocktail that roughly doubled survival rates for treated patients,\u201d STAT said in a story on investigational treatments and vaccines for COVID-19.", "lang": "en"}
