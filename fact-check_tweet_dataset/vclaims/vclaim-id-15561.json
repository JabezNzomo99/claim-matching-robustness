Irani is quoted saying, \u201c\u0905\u0917\u0930 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0927\u093e\u0928\u092e\u0902\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u091c\u0940 \u0939\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0924\u094b \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0906\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0939\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0915\u0930 \u0932\u0941\u0902\u0917\u0940 (If PM Modiji loses I will commit suicide -translated)\u201d. The viral post attempts to inject credibility to the claim by providing a corresponding screenshot of a news report purportedly telecasted by the said channel.\n\nJournalist turned filmmaker Avinash Das also posted the image urging social media users to confirm the authenticity of the screenshot.\n\nA keyword search on Google with respect to the statement ascribed to Irani yields no results. The remotest reference to such a statement made by Irani states, \u201cThe day \u2018pradhan sevak\u2019 Narendra Modi ji decides to retire, I will also leave Indian politics\u201d.\n\nMoreover, we found a video of the press conference telecasted by ABP News from where the screengrab was possibly taken. Addressing a presser, Irani raised allegation against Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and Robert Vadra, accusing them of being involved in a land scam.\n\nOn several occasion in the past, (1, 2, 3) screenshots of leading news channels have been morphed to mislead social media users. These morphed screenshots attempt to give a sense of make-believe that a said statement was also reported by the media.", "lang": "en"}
