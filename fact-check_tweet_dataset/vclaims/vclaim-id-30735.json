The article originated on a satire website.\n\nThe House voted Dec. 18 to impeach President Donald Trump on counts of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Nearly a month later, Pelosi transmitted the articles to the Senate, where the trial has since gotten underway, according to CBS News.\n\nMaga2020 News alleged in a Jan. 20 article, titled \u201cPelosi: \u2018If Impeachment Fails, I Will Resign Immediately,'\u201d that the House speaker announced she intends to resign from Congress if the articles of impeachment don\u2019t receive enough votes to pass. She made the announcement during an interview with Belgian magazine Le Mensonge, it claims.\n\n\u201cIf this impeachment fails, my time is probably up,\u201d Pelosi is also quoted as saying in the interview. \u201cI won\u2019t wait around. If it doesn\u2019t go through, I\u2019ll resign.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no evidence Pelosi ever made such a statement. It appears on neither her House speaker nor her congressional website. The Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any similar announcements on any of her social media accounts either.\n\nFurther adding to the post\u2019s dubiousness. Le Mensonge magazine doesn\u2019t appear to exist. \u201cLe Mensonge\u201d roughly translates from French to \u201cThe Lie.\u201d (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show Nancy Pelosi\u2019s House And Her Congressional District)\n\nThe article originated on Bustatroll.org, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d\n\nYet, while Bustatroll.org clearly disclaims the satirical nature of its content, other websites that picked up the story failed to do the same. They portray it as a real news story.", "lang": "en"}
