As of Aug. 3, there have been six locally acquired cases of Zika in Florida, in addition to 322 travel-associated cases of the virus, according to the CDC.\n\nFlorida is the only state with locally acquired cases of Zika. But throughout the U.S., there have been more than 1,800 travel-associated cases.\n\nThe Zika epidemic, which first began in Brazil in May 2015, was declared a global public health emergency by the World Health Organization in February 2016. The virus can lead to birth defects, including an abnormally small head and often incomplete brain development, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently confirmed.\n\nClinton expressed disappointment with Congress\u2019 failure to pass legislation for emergency funding to combat the Zika epidemic before going on recess in mid-July. Congress is not slated to return until early September, but she urged \u201cRepublican leaders\u201d in Congress \u201cto call people back for a special session and get \u2026 a bill that is focused on combating Zika passed.\u201d\n\nShe then criticized Trump and his campaign\u2019s position on Zika.\n\nClinton, Aug. 9: I disagree with those who say that Zika is an insignificant issue. My opponent in this race, his campaign officials have said that, and I think that does a grave disservice because when you come here to a health clinic that is working so hard to get people to come in, to get tested, working with the health departments, working with sanitation departments, working with people to try to go after and prevent a population of mosquitoes from growing, this is something we need to take seriously, and I certainly do.\n\nWe contacted Clinton\u2019s campaign to ask whom specifically Clinton was speaking about when she referred to Trump\u2019s \u201ccampaign officials.\u201d Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin pointed us to a comment made by an individual named Juan Fiol in June.\n\nFiol told the Boston Globe, \u201cWe have bigger mosquitoes to squash than Zika \u2014 like ISIS, the national debt, Iraq, and Afghanistan. \u2026We have a wall to build to keep the illegals out. We have so many other issues that are more important than this.\u201d He also called Clinton \u201csophomoric\u201d for \u201ctaking on such an insignificant issue.\u201d\n\nFirst off, Fiol is one person, but Clinton referred to the plural, \u201ccampaign officials.\u201d\n\nSecond, and more important, Fiol is not a Trump \u201ccampaign official.\u201d\n\nThe Globe referred to Fiol as \u201cTrump\u2019s vice chairman of Miami-Dade County.\u201d But Karen Giorno, Trump\u2019s Florida chief strategist and senior political adviser, told us by email, \u201cMr. Fiol is not the vice chair of Miami-Dade County.\u201d She said he is \u201can unpaid supporter.\u201d\n\nWe checked and Fiol doesn\u2019t appear on the payroll in Trump\u2019s July 2016 campaign finance report, and he was not reimbursed for any campaign expenses. His name is not mentioned at all in the report\u2019s 9,274 pages. He\u2019s also not included on a list of the Trump campaign\u2019s staffers and advisers, nor on a similar list specific to Florida.\n\nIn fact, on Aug. 10, Fiol posted to his Facebook page, \u201cNo rain, volunteering,\u201d along with a picture of himself and two people wearing Trump hats. He tagged the photo as being taken at the BB&T Center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which hosted a Trump rally on Aug. 10.\n\nWe contacted Fiol himself through Facebook and email, but he has yet to respond. We also reached out to Trump\u2019s national press secretary, Hope Hicks, to ask about Fiol\u2019s position and responsibilities with regard to Trump\u2019s campaign, but she did not respond.\n\nSchwerin at Clinton\u2019s campaign also referred us to Miami Herald and CNN articles from Aug. 3 regarding Trump\u2019s comments about Florida Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s handling of the state\u2019s Zika problem. Both news organizations quoted Trump as saying, \u201cFirst of all, you have a great governor who\u2019s doing a fantastic job, Rick Scott, on the Zika. And it\u2019s a problem, it\u2019s a big problem.\u201d\n\nWhen the local CBS reporter asked Trump if Congress should return for an emergency session to approve Zika funding, Trump said, \u201cI would say that it\u2019s up to Rick Scott. \u2026 It depends on what he\u2019s looking to do, because [he] really seems to have it under control in Florida.\u201d\n\nGiorno also told us by email, \u201cMr. Trump has joined Governor Scott in calling for immediate funding to fight the spread of Zika in Florida including the 10,000 Zika preparedness kits already requested. This remains an issue not isolated to Florida but one that is of concern nationally warranting a more robust response by the federal government.\u201d\n\nIn other words, she added, \u201cMr. Fiol\u2019s remarks do not represent the views of Mr. Trump on Zika.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s comments on Zika are limited, he has called it a \u201cbig problem,\u201d not an \u201cinsignificant issue.\u201d And Fiol, who did say the epidemic was insignificant, isn\u2019t a Trump campaign official, but a volunteer.\n\nSo Clinton was wrong when she claimed that \u201cmy opponent in this race, his campaign officials\u201d have called Zika \u201can insignificant issue.\u201d\n\nUpdate, Aug. 15: Fiol returned our email and told us, \u201cI am an unpaid supporter, I speak for myself and not Trump.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: SciCheck is made possible by a grant from the Stanton Foundation.", "lang": "en"}
