No, that's not true: The doctor overseeing the testing lab at the pandemic's ground zero says so-called 'positivity' data is not an indicator of herd immunity.\n\nIncreasing numbers of COVID cases in Florida and Arizona at the time the claim was made show the disease still spreading, which would not happen if herd immunity had been accomplished, said a University of Arizona College of Medicine public health professor.\n\nThe claim appeared in a Facebook post (archived here) on August 4, 2020 under the title 'POSITIVITY RATE SHOWS HERD IMMUNTIY(sic) HAS BEEN REACHED'. It opened:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nDr. Geoffery Baird, of the University of Washington in Seattle, site of the first major U.S. outbreak said in an August 7, 2020 phone interview with Lead Stories:\n\nBaird said the labs he supervises are processing up to 8,000 tests per day and working with other labs across the country, studying the spread of COVID-19 and the effect of various efforts to stop the spread.\n\nIs there herd immunity in the U.S.?\n\n'Absolutely not,' said Dr. Farshad Marvasti, Director of the Public Health, Prevention and Health Promotion curriculum University of Arizona College of Medicine. 'If we had, there would not be hosts for this virus,' yet the number of cases was rising in several U.S. states, he said in an August 7, 2020 phone interview with Lead Stories. Marvasti said the growing number of infections in Arizona, for example, showed there is 'no validity' to the claim that enough Americans are now immune that the disease can no longer spread.\n\nContradicting board-certified epidemiologists with medical degrees and PhDs operating independently of one another at multiple universities and public health agencies across the U.S., self-described \"Health Policy Expert\" Matthew McBride declared 'herd immunity has been reached and the virus is dying out.\" He said politicians are lying about the disease in order to extend government shutdowns and mask-wearing requirements for political reasons.\n\nThough no profile photo confirms it's the same person, James McBride on LinkedIn(tm), lists his expertise as 'Payment and Reimbursement Expert. Lead Stories reached out to McBride to confirm his credentials and will update this report, if appropriate, when he replies.\n\nIn an email exchange with Lead Stories on August 7, 2020, Walden University, an online school, confirmed that between 2007 and 2015, Walden granted a diploma to a Matthew McBride for a Masters of Science in Health Informatics, which is the management of computer systems for storage and retrieval of health records. The school also confirmed it granted him a diploma for a Masters in Public Health. McBride's resume lists his current job as consultant on payment and reimbursement systems for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Lead Stories reached out to the V.A. to confirm that and will update this report, if appropriate, when the agency replies.\n\nThe Seattle testing expert, Dr. Baird, earned his M.D. and Ph.D. from University of California/ San Diego and is board-certified in Anatomic Pathology, Clinical Pathology and Clinical Chemistry. He said there are multiple sets of serology tests - which show if a person has been exposed - and that even in New York City, which had a major outbreak, only about 20 percent of those tested had been exposed to the disease. 'We're nowhere near the 70-90% that is required for herd immunity,' Baird said in an August 7, 2020 phone interview with Lead Stories.\n\nWhen a large enough portion of a community becomes immune to a disease through vaccination or by surviving infection, the disease is less able to jump from person to person, which is what epidemiology and public health experts call herd immunity.\n\nMayo Clinic public education materials say the more contagious a disease is, the greater the proportion of the population that needs to be immune to break the chain of transmission. If most of the people exposed to a disease are immune, it dies out.\n\nDepending how contagious an infection is, between 70% to 90% of a population must be immune to prevent community spread of the disease, say COVID-19 information sheets provided by the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health. Based on early estimates of the degree of infectiousness of this disease, herd immunity will require an immunity rate of about 70%, the Johns Hopkins materials say.\n\nThe only way the U.S. will achieve herd immunity in 2020 is if there is a catastrophic failure of the public health system, say two epidemiology experts at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nAmong the other claims made on McBride's posting:\n\nDr. Marvasti said that assumption is incorrect. 'It really hasn't shifted the way he is claiming. That's not really true, because the people being tested in a situation where you don't have enough tests are still the people who are sick.\" Marvasti formerly worked for a county public health agency, was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Stanford University Prevention Research Center and serves on the Public Health Committee of the Arizona Medical Association. He said McBride has assumed the first wave of infection was suppressed. Marvasti said the U.S. has not depressed infection rates enough to be in the second wave of infection that is a common feature of epidemics.\n\nMcBride, who is not a biostatistician, said the following about the data chart he wrote notes on and posted with his claim about herd immunity. The chart is from the COVID-19 information site operated by Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health. Illogically, McBride both claims the test are inaccurate and uses the data from those tests as the basis for his declaration the COVID-19 pandemic has passed through the U.S. population.\n\nMarvasti said the data McBride points to show the opposite. 'We don't have a consistently lowering positive rate,' he said, describing the rate of positive tests as fluctuating up and down. Marvasti said those changes in the curve are the result of the changes in mask-wearing rules and business closures from state to state,which result in new outbreaks such as those in Arizona and Florida.The curve McBride points to, Marvasti said, proves that lockdowns and mask-wearing work.\n\nLead Stories has debunked multiple false or misleading claims about the meaning of COVID-19 test data, including the following:", "lang": "en"}
