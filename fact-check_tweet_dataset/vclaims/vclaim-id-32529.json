It reads:\n\n\"Our 1st Lady posted this yesterday FB took it down make it go viral [sic].\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nNeither the first lady nor her team posted this photo on the social media platform. Facebook did not (and would not) take it down.\n\nFacebook told us that its tools confirmed the photo was not found or shared on any of Melania Trump\u2019s accounts, which comprises \"Melania Trump,\" \"First Lady Melania Trump,\" and her personal Facebook profile, which appears to be private.\n\nThe company says it only removes a post if it goes against its Community Standards, which includes gun and drug sales, hate speech, nudity, and terrorist activity.\n\n\"We take something down from Facebook if it goes against our Community Standards, which are designed to encourage expression and create a safe environment,\" a post on Facebook\u2019s help center says. \"The number of times something is reported doesn't determine whether or not it's removed from Facebook. We use the same guidelines each time we review whether a profile goes against our Community Standards.\"\n\nA simple close-up photo of Melania Trump from 2007 does not violate any of Facebook standards.\n\nThis is Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
