I don\u2019t understand the point of this, but it is undoubtedly an unfriendly act, which is harmful to the development of our relationship as a whole.\u201d\n\nBusiness leaders on the list seem to represent a who\u2019s who of the wealthiest Russians.\n\nIgor Sechin, one of Russia\u2019s richest men, is the CEO of the Russian government-owned oil company Rosneft, with a monthly salary of about $350,000 according to a report on top-management compensation Rosneft published in 2015.\n\nRussia\u2019s richest oligarch and aluminum tycoon, Oleg Deripaska, who is worth an estimated $7 billion, also made the list.\n\nVladimir Putin, did not make the list, despite speculation that his personal wealth reaches as high as $200 billion.\n\nIn December 2016, the European investment company CEIC, listed Russia\u2019s annual per capita household income at around $5,500, while retirement payments are only about $240 per month.\n\nAn average senior citizen in Russia averaged $234 per month in 2017.\n\nThe sanctions against Russia and the \u201coligarchs list\u201d are controversial among U. S. politicians. President Donald Trump criticized the congressionally-mandated list when he reluctantly signed the \u201cCountering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.\" He said it \"improperly encroaches on executive power, disadvantages American companies and hurts the interests of our European allies.\"\n\nJournalists and analysts have noted that the \u201coligarchs list\u201d put out by U.S. Treasury Department \u201cbears a striking resemblance\u201d to Forbes Magazine\u2019s 2017 rundown of Russia\u2019s richest citizens.\n\nSwedish economist Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center, accuses \u201csomebody high up\u201d in Treasury of throwing out the work of experts and simply copying the Forbes list.\n\n\u201cIn doing so, this senior official ridiculed the government experts who had prepared another report \u2026 mocking U.S. sanctions on Russia overall,\u201d wrote Aslund on his Atlantic Council blog. \u201cBy signing this list, the secretary of the treasury took responsibility for it.\u201d\n\n\"Congress passed sanctions on Russia overwhelmingly to send a message on Russian interference in our democracy. The president doesn't appear to want to send that message,\" U.S. Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"We\u2019ve always known that corruption is key to Vladimir Putin\u2019s continued power and the funding for his dangerous and destabilizing foreign policies,\" said Rep. Edward Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, following release of the list.\n\nOpposition leader Alexei Navalny hailed the publication of the list, tweeting Tuesday that he was \u201cglad to see these [people] have been officially recognized as crooks and thieves at the international level.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. domestic dispute over sanctions on Russia aside, the gulf between the wealth of average Russians earnings and Russia\u2019s \u201coligarchs\u201d is immense.", "lang": "en"}
