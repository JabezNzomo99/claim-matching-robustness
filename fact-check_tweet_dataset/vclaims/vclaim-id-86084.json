{"title": "Analysis | President Trump\u2019s flip-flop on coverage for preexisting health conditions", "subtitle": "Over and over, President Trump said he supports coverage for preexisting conditions. Now, he does not. Flip-flop!", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-06-14T07:00:48Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-86084", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/06/14/president-trumps-flip-flop-on-coverage-for-pre-existing-conditions/", "vclaim": "Sessions, in an unusual step, sided with plaintiffs who had argued the ACA was now unconstitutional because Congress, in the tax bill, eliminated the penalty for not buying insurance, known as the individual mandate. Sessions said the Justice Department would no longer defend the law in a lawsuit brought by Republican-led states, a surprise stance that led to the resignation of a senior career lawyer at the Justice Department.\n\nThat means we can judge whether the president, whom we\u2019ve dubbed the \u201cking of flip-flops,\u201d is making yet another flip-flop on an important policy issue. Let\u2019s explore what the president has said about the preexisting conditions section in Obamacare, which public-opinion polling shows is one of the most popular features of the law.\n\nTechnically, by the way, it\u2019s two provisions: Guaranteed issue, which means insurance companies must sell insurance to anyone who wants to buy it, and community rating, which means that people who buy similar insurance and are the same age pay similar prices. The two together made insurance affordable for people with, say, cancer, though before passage of the ACA, even minor health problems could have led an insurance company to deny coverage.\n\nFeb. 25. During a GOP presidential primary debate, Trump declared: \u201cI would absolutely get rid of Obamacare. We\u2019re going to have something much better, but preexisting conditions, when I\u2019m referring to that, and I was referring to that very strongly on the show with Anderson Cooper, I want to keep preexisting conditions. I think we need it. I think it\u2019s a modern age. And I think we have to have it. \u2026 Get rid of Obamacare, we\u2019ll come up with new plans. But, we should keep preexisting conditions.\u201d\n\nOct. 9. During the second presidential debate, Trump said he would ensure that coverage for preexisting conditions was retained: \u201cWhen we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep preexisting, we\u2019ll also be able to help people that \u2026 don\u2019t have money because we are going to have people protected. But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep preexisting.\u201d\n\nFeb. 28, 2017. During an address to a joint session of Congress, Trump listed preexisting conditions as the first principle for creating a better health-care system. \u201cFirst, we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the health-care exchanges.\u201d\n\nApril 30. Trump, in an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d says he insisted that coverage for preexisting conditions needed to be in the replacement bill: \u201cPreexisting conditions are in the bill. And I just watched another network than yours, and they were saying, preexisting is not covered.\u2019 Preexisting conditions are in the bill. And I mandate it. I said, \u2018Has to be.\u2019 \u201d\n\nJuly 19. In an interview with the New York Times, Trump says he has to be sure coverage for preexisting conditions is included: \u201cNothing changes. Nothing changes. Once you get something for preexisting conditions, etc., etc. Once you get something, it\u2019s awfully tough to take it away. \u2026 Politically, you can\u2019t give it away. So preexisting conditions are a tough deal.\u201d\n\nJuly 24. In a campaign-style event, Trump defends the Senate version of repeal: \u201cThe Senate bill protects coverage for preexisting conditions, and you don\u2019t hear this from the Democrats. They like to tell you just the opposite, and they didn\u2019t even know the bill. They run out, they say: death, death, death.\u201d\n\nWith no explanation or warning, the president now supports an effort to nullify the provisions that make it possible for millions of people to purchase affordable insurance. Thus this new position, directly contradicting his repeated stance as a candidate and as president, qualifies as a flip-flop.", "lang": "en"}
