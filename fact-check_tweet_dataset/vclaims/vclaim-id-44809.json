A search of the BBC News website turned up no coverage of Vanessa Bryant\u2019s alleged suicide.\n\nFurther adding to the video\u2019s dubiousness, it plays a short clip of Fox News anchor Neil Cavuto reporting on some \u201cvery sad news.\u201d The video then stops to warn that the clip contains \u201cgraphic content\u201d and prompts viewers to share it on their Facebook timelines in order to continue watching.\n\nIts claim that Vanessa Bryant committed suicide doesn\u2019t hold up either. The Caller didn\u2019t find any media reports about Vanessa Bryant killing herself, only outlets debunking the claim.\n\nVanessa Bryant posted a photo of her family on Instagram Jan. 29, thanking \u201cmillions of people who\u2019ve shown support and love during this horrific time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what our lives hold beyond today, and it\u2019s impossible to imagine life without them,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut we wake up each day, trying to keep pushing because Kobe, and our baby girl, Gigi, are shining on us to light the way.\u201d\n\nShe has a \u201cgood support system\u201d and is \u201csurrounded by people who love her and love Kobe,\u201d a source told People magazine.", "lang": "en"}
