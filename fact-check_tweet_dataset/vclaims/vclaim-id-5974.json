Furthermore, information about James Andersson\u2019s supposed past feats of aviation prowess and his long involvement in stunt flying and air races was virtually non-existent outside of his own web site, which (aside from a short biography) included little content other than this \u201cone-wing landing\u201d clip and another interview clip of him discussing the incident.\n\nThe killathrill brand of clothing was all over the place, though: Its name appeared prominently on the fuselage and wings of the airplane shown in the \u201cone-wing\u201d clip, on the jacket Andersson wore during in interview clip, and on Andersson\u2019s web site. Moreover, the domain name for Andersson\u2019s web site (jamesandersson.com) had been registered just a few weeks before this video hit the Internet, and the registration listed Sandra Thielecke as the domain name same Sandra Thielecke who just happened to be a managing director at killathrill. Coincidence? We think not.\n\nThe clip was produced by JOTZ! Film through editing techniques and digital manipulation that used video of a smaller, remote-controlled aircraft melded with footage of a real airplane, as shown in the following \u201cmaking of\u201d video:\n\nThe Dutch travel company used a similar \u201cremarkable airplane landing\u201d gimmick in an earlier promotion:", "lang": "en"}
