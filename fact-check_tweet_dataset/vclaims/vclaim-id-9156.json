The accepted process for leaving the EU\u2014triggering Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union\u2014is about the terms of divorce.\n\nAn initial withdrawal agreement under Article 50 would cover things like the phasing out of EU funding in the UK and the fate of British staff working in Brussels. It would also be likely to cover the status of British citizens already living in mainland Europe, and other EU citizens currently living here.\n\nBut that\u2019s separate to working out, for instance, rules on trade between the UK and the rest of the EU in future.\n\nArticle 50 just says that the EU should negotiate the withdrawal agreement \u201ctaking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union\u201d.\n\nSo there would be another set of negotiations on that future relationship, quite possibly running parallel to the withdrawal agreement talks, as Article 50 seems to recommend.\n\nWhile it may be unlikely that a straight Leave/Remain referendum would be re-run, some commentators think that a vote on the terms of the new relationship would be possible, with the option of remaining in the EU if that was seen to be better.\n\nAlternatively, there could be a general election, with the Labour Party and various others running on a platform of remaining or having another referendum, and the Conservatives promising to take the new EU deal if elected.\n\nA new vote would be pointless if Article 50 can\u2019t be aborted\n\nArticle 50 says that if no withdrawal agreement is reached two years after it has been triggered, the existing member automatically leaves the EU. That said, this negotiation period can be extended if all countries agree.\n\nBut the text doesn\u2019t say anything about whether the country that wanted to leave can change its mind once the process has been triggered.\n\nThat matters if the UK wants to hold another vote. If there\u2019s no turning back from an EU exit once Article 50 is triggered, there would be no point in voting on the terms of a new agreement versus continued membership.\n\nThe choice would instead be to take the deal on offer, or reject it and exit with no long-term deal at all.\n\nSo what do lawyers and EU experts think?\n\nThe article we quoted at the top takes its information from a House of Lords report. Two leading experts told the Lords EU Committee that the UK can change its mind on Article 50.\n\nSir David Edward, who used to be a judge at the EU court, said that:\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely clear that you cannot be forced to go through with it if you do not want to: for example, if there is a change of Government.\u201d\n\nDerrick Wyatt, an EU lawyer and former Oxford professor, took a similar view and told the committee that:\n\n\u201cThere is nothing in the wording to say that you cannot. It is in accord with the general aims of the Treaties that people stay in rather than rush out of the exit door.\u201d\n\nThat view is backed up by Professor Kenneth Armstrong of Cambridge, as well as an analysis of international law by the barrister Charles Streeten.\n\nAndrew Duff, a British former Member of the European Parliament, agrees:\n\n\u201cIt would be perfectly possible for the UK to revoke its decision to quit. That Article 50 is silent on the matter of revocation does not mean that a change of direction would be illegal under EU law\u201d.\n\nKate Gibbons, a commercial lawyer at Clifford Chance, wrote in June that \u201cThe prevalent view is, perhaps, that notice can be withdrawn prior to actual withdrawal from the EU but the position is not clear\u201d.\n\nProfessor Michael Dougan agrees that this is the view of \u201cmost lawyers\u201d, adding that \u201cthe French government legal service has told the French government the same answer\u201d.\n\nBut Reuters reports that \u201cin Brussels, another view prevails. EU lawyers say Britain could only revoke an Article 50 notification if all the other 27 members of the EU agreed\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s also the advice given to the European Parliament by its Members\u2019 Research Service, reflected in a draft resolution of MEPs reportedly leaked on 29 March.\n\nAnd a trio of academics at University College London, in their influential article on whether MPs have to approve the use of Article 50 in the first place, say that \u201cthere is no turning back once Article 50 has been invoked\u201d, and that arguments to the contrary depend on \u201creading such a right into a text from which it is conspicuously absent.\u201d\n\nProfessor Keith Ewing of King\u2019s College London agrees, as does the think tank Open Europe.\n\nThat\u2019s why Professor Steve Peers wrote for us in June 2016 that \u201cthe point is arguable either way\u201d.\n\nThe place the point might be argued, and ultimately resolved, is the EU court in Luxembourg. It\u2019s possible that our own courts will refer the question to EU judges as part of the ongoing litigation over the role of Parliament in triggering Article 50.\n\nIn the meantime, be wary of opinions\u2014however eminent\u2014offered as definitive answers.", "lang": "en"}
