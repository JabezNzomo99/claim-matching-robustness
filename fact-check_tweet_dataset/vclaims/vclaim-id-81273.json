The writers of the report, which included Parsi, relied especially on research done by Gary Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nFirst of all, note that the report carefully refers to \u201cjob opportunities,\u201d not jobs. (Parsi\u2019s quote in the news release is less careful.) That\u2019s because one cannot assume that that people remain unemployed, year after year. You certainly cannot add up the job numbers over time, though that\u2019s what some reporters did \u2014 perhaps misled by Table 4, which lists \u201cjob losses\u201d year by year, though it correctly does not offer a total.\n\nParsi said the report very carefully referred to \u201cjob opportunities\u201d but The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, missed that nuance. \u201cLosing out on selling to Iran has cost the U.S. an average of between 51,043 and 66,436 jobs for every year between 1995 and 2012,\u201d its article said.\n\nThere\u2019s also a problem with the headline number of $175 billion in lost exports. Hufbauer says that this really should be expressed as an annual figure, or at the least make clear that it is over an 18-year period. (The report instead says \u201cfrom 1995 to 2012.\u201d)\n\nNIAC here is playing a game with \u201cbig numbers.\u201d While $175 billion sounds like a lot, it is only 5/1,000th of the total U.S. exports over that 18-year period. In other words, it\u2019s barely a rounding error in the trillions of dollars of U.S. trade over nearly two decades. Yet the report asserts that \u201cthe negative impact of sanctions to the U.S. economy has been staggering\u2026the human cost has been even greater.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the number assumes that American businesses simply sat on their hands when they lost access to the Iranian market\u2014rather than search for other markets for their products. \u201cWhat do companies do when a market is cut off?\u201d said Hufbauer. \u201cThey look for new markets.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe never claimed that it [sanctions on Iran] will collapse the U.S. economy,\u201d Parsi said. He said the purpose of the report is to highlight an impact of sanctions that is often neglected, since the focus is usually on the country being sanctioned. \u201cIt would be unfair to say we have taken anything out of context,\u201d he added.\n\nThe impact of U.S-led sanctions on the United States might be worthy subject for inquiry, but NIAC is gilding the lily here. The report does not do enough to make clear that there is a difference between \u201clost jobs\u201d and \u201clost job opportunities\u201d \u2013 and should have expressed the export number on an annual basis, with a clear explanation of what that number means in the overall U.S. economy.", "lang": "en"}
