Dhankhar questioned the figures of death and positive COVID-19 cases in West Bengal. The state has reported around 800 COVID-19 cases and 33 deaths so far. Mamata Banerjee refuted with a letter stating that it was unnecessary of the governor to interfere in federal rights of the elected government.\n\nAlso Read: Ramdev's Claims Of Self-Testing, Mustard Oil Not Backed By Research Upon doing a reverse image search BOOM found that the image has been morphed and Bhagwat was not accompanied by Dhankhar in the original image.

The article published on November 5, 2015, featured the same image and credited it to international news agency Reuters. The photograph was taken at an RSS event in Agra, in 2014. The original image could be traced to Reuters image archive. The caption of the image reads, \"Mohan Bhagwat (3rd L), chief of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), India's Hindu nationalist organisation, walks after addressing the RSS volunteers during a training camp in the northern Indian city of Agra November 3, 2014.\" The image was clicked by photojournalist Brijesh Singh in Agra, Uttar Pradesh on November 3, 2014. \n\n You can see the original mage here.\n\nBanerjee in the past has accused Dhankhar of being an 'RSS man'. In an interview to News 18 last year, Dhankhar cleared the air about his stand on the Hindu nationalist organisation and his 'regret for not enrolling in the organisation in the past.' He was quoted as saying, \"I am not an RSS man. But I have no hesitation in saying I would be happy to be one. Because they [RSS] believe in nationalism. It is one of the greatest organisations the world has ever seen. And I think there is a void in my life that I am not an RSS man. But her accusation of this fact is wrong. That should not have happened.\"", "lang": "en"}
