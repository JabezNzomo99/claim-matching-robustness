(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe article says that, on May 31, \"John Harrington, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, announced that Chauvin committed suicide after his arrest in his Minnesota jail cell.\" It attributed the report to WCCO Minneapolis, a local CBS affiliate news station.\n\nWe could find no such announcement by the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, nor any report by WCCO that said Chauvin died in jail under any circumstances.\n\nThe claim only exists on W24n, a junk news website that has published several hoax stories including one that said President Barack Obama tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nChauvin was arrested on charges of third-degree murder and manslaughter on May 29 and was originally held at Ramsey County Jail in St. Paul. He was moved on May 31, first to Hennepin County Jail and then to Oak Park Heights prison.\n\nIn a press conference that night, Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnells said the transfer wasn\u2019t \"uncommon\" among high-profile inmates and was made, in part, due to COVID-19 transmission concerns and the anticipation that a large number of people could be booked into the county jail amid the ongoing protests.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
