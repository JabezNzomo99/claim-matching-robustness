The figures come from a report by the Institute for Public Policy Research which showed a declining trend in deaths linked to \u201cpreventable risk factors\u201d between 1990 and 2012. But between 2012 and 2017, the rate of decline slowed down. Had it kept pace with the previous trend, the report estimates there would have been 130,000 fewer deaths overall since 2012.\n\nIPPR told us at the time that measures related to austerity were a possible reason behind the change in trend, but this was by no means the only potential factor.\n\nThere is no clear way of knowing how much austerity contributed to this slow in decline. You can read a more in-depth look at the issue in our previous post from June.", "lang": "en"}
