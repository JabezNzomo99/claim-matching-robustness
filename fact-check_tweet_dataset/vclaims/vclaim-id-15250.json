The two photographs, juxtaposed together, are being shared with the caption \u2013 \u201cthe party with a difference\u201d. By looking at the juxtaposition, it would seem as if Amit Shah stood up while handing over his nomination papers with the EC official sitting on the chair, while Rahul Gandhi was seated while handing over his nomination papers with the EC official having to stand-up to receive them.\n\nSeveral BJP party members and leaders have circulated the collage on Twitter. Their bio lists their positions within the party as \u2013 BJP Karnataka general secretary N Ravi Kumar, BJP Maharashtra youth secretary Raj Dixit, BJP Gandhinagar mahila wing secretary Anita Jayesh Patel and BJP Mumbai north general secretary Umesh Motwani.\n\nThe photograph of Rahul Gandhi viral on social media represents the Congress president filing his Lok Sabha nomination papers from Amethi. A quick glance at the image gives the impression that the Congress president was seated while handing his nomination papers, with the EC official having to stand-up and reach out to accept the papers. However, available videos of the event throw a completely different light.\n\nGandhi filed his papers at the district collector\u2019s office in Amethi. He seems to be seated while doing so due to the height of the collector\u2019s table. The surface of the desk reached up to Gandhi\u2019s chest, making it appear as if he was seated, when, in fact, he was standing. Upon viewing the act from a different angle, it is clear that Gandhi was not sitting.\n\nA misleading visual perception was widely circulated to portray Rahul Gandhi as disrespectful and Amit Shah\u2019s as courteous. Since the start of the elections, Rahul Gandhi has also been targeted with photoshopped images and manufactured newspaper clipping.", "lang": "en"}
