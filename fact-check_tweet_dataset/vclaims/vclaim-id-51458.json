Alt News searched for his Facebook profile where we learned that he identifies as \u2018The Cheetah Whisperer\u2019.\n\nAs per the video description, the cheetahs in the video were bred and born at Cheetah Experience, a South Africa based at cheetah breeding centre. According to the description, one of the cheetahs was supposed to be released into a protected wild area. Volker concluded that cheetahs are like house cats when it comes to their preference to sleep. They prefer a warm bed as opposed to a cold floor.\n\nIn 2015, NDTV wrote an article on Volker according to which he has been volunteering at Cheetah Experience at least since 2014.\n\nThus the social media claim that video is from Pipleshwar Mahadev Temple, Rajasthan, is false. It was uploaded by popular South African animal advocate Dolph C. Volker in 2019 on his YouTube channel.", "lang": "en"}
