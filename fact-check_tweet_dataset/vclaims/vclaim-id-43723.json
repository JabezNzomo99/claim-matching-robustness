{"title": "PARTLY FALSE: Mayon Volcano status 'raised' to Alert Level 2", "subtitle": "Mayon Volcano has been under Alert Level 2 since March 2018", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Jan 13, 2020 6:11 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-43723", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/mayon-volcano-status-raised-alert-level-2", "vclaim": "One Facebook page, Choose Quezon, posted a graphic with Mayon's alert status on Monday, January 13, accompanied by the text caption, \"Yesterday, it was Taal Volcano. Today, Mayon Volcano. Alert Level 2 now raised over Mayon Volcano due to its persisting unrest. Nakakaloka na talaga! (It's getting crazy!)\"\n\nSome Facebook pages like Ang Tubong Meycauayan also linked to or copy-pasted an Abante TNT article with the headline, \"Alert level 2 tinaas na sa Mayon Volcano\" (Alert Level 2 already raised for Mayon Volcano). However, the article and Abante TNT's homepage are inaccessible as of this writing.\n\n\"We were actually going to propose to lower it down kasi medyo matagal na (because it's been a while),\" she added.\n\nThe last significant change in alert status for Mayon was on January 22, 2018, when it was raised to Alert Level 4 after it spewed a giant ash column. Alert Level 4 means that hazardous eruption was imminent or possible \"within days\" at that time.\n\nHowever, the status was soon lowered to Alert Level 3 on March 6, then to Alert Level 2 on March 29 after a \"general decline in unrest.\" It has stayed at that level since then, despite some flare-ups like in December 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, as of this writing, Taal Volcano is under Alert Level 4, which also means it is showing signs that hazardous eruption is possible within days. \u2013 Michael Bueza/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
