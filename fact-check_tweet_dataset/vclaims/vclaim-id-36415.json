That story originated on a self-described satirical website.\n\nSocial media users have shared a story on Facebook falsely claiming that one of former President Barack Obama\u2019s daughters was \u201cbusted\u201d for selling items she \u201cstole\u201d during her family\u2019s time in the White House.\n\nThat story was fabricated in April 2019 by America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, a publication with multiple websites that bills its content as \u201csatire\u201d but whose headlines often misinform and confuse social media users despite website disclaimers.\n\nSince it was first published, the story has been picked up elsewhere and without those disclaimers \u2014 most recently on gnfnews.com, whose Feb. 16 post was shared by multiple Facebook groups supportive of President Donald Trump.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
