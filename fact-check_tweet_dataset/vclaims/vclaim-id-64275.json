As the Republican presidential candidate explained his approach to wooing independent voters, he reeled off a series of statistics about the disappointing economy.\n\nWe\u2019re checking several statements from Romney\u2019s remarks on May 17, 2012, but here we\u2019re asking whether, \"Fifty percent of kids coming out of school can't get a job.\"\n\n \n\n Fifty percent of kids\n\n \n\n Romney has made similar remarks on the campaign trail before, and his campaign has pointed us to articles by the Associated Press and Time.com that each address the bleak job market for 2012 college graduates.\n\n \n\n The key piece of evidence is from the Associated Press article, \"In Weak Job Market, One In Two College Graduates Are Jobless Or Underemployed.\" It\u2019s based on research by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, which in turn is based on data from the federal Current Population Survey, as well as Labor Department measures of what level of education is required to perform each of some 900 jobs.\n\n \n\n Here\u2019s how the AP summarized the findings:\n\n \n\n \"A weak labor market already has left half of young college graduates either jobless or underemployed in positions that don't fully use their skills and knowledge. Young adults with bachelor's degrees are increasingly scraping by in lower-wage jobs \u2013 waiter or waitress, bartender, retail clerk or receptionist, for example \u2013 and that's confounding their hopes a degree would pay off despite higher tuition and mounting student loans. ...\n\n \n\n \"About 1.5 million, or 53.6 percent, of bachelor's degree-holders under the age of 25 last year were jobless or underemployed. \u2026 Out of the 1.5 million who languished in the job market, about half were underemployed, an increase from the previous year.\"\n\n \n\n Rather than roughly half of recent college grads not being able to find a job, the reality is that about 50 percent of recent college graduates are either unemployed or employed in jobs that aren\u2019t commensurate with their degree. Of this 50 percent figure, about half are unemployed, and about half are in jobs that don\u2019t require a college degree.\n\n \n\n In August, PolitiFact checked with Andrew Sum, the Northeastern professor who did the research. Sum agreed with our analysis.\n\n \n\n Romney would have been more accurate if he had phrased his claim the way he did on other occasions, when he said \"half the kids coming out of college this year \u2026 can't find a job, or a job that's consistent with a college degree.\"\n\n \n\n We also think there\u2019s an additional piece of context worth mentioning. Viewers shouldn\u2019t compare this 50 percent rate to the more familiar unemployment rate, which is currently at 8.5 percent. The reality is that even in strong economic times, a sizable percentage of recent college grads is either unemployed or employed in jobs below their abilities.\n\n \n\n According to the AP, the record low was still pretty high at 41 percent, in 2000 -- \"before the dot-com bust erased job gains for college graduates in the telecommunications and (information technology) fields.\" That\u2019s far higher than the more familiar unemployment statistic for the overall population ever gets.\n\n \n\n While Romney glossed over details when he spoke with donors, painting a darker picture than supported by the research, he did get the tone right: At 53.6 percent, the number of college graduates unemployed or underemployed is the highest it\u2019s been in at least 11 years.\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n Romney told campaign donors that \"50 percent of kids coming out of school can't get a job.\" He missed a key qualifier -- according to the research, about a quarter of recent college grads literally can\u2019t find a job, while another quarter have found a job, but one that doesn\u2019t require a college degree. Still, the research shows the employment picture for college grads is grimmer than at any time in more than a decade. We rate the claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
