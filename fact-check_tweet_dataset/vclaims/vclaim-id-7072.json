But the threat of prosecution has not become a reality, contrary to what a headline shared on Facebook would have readers believe.\n\n\u201cTRUMP SENDS IN THE FEDS \u2013 Sanctuary City Leaders Arrested,\u201d reads the May 13 headline on trumpdeplorableschannel.blogspot.com. It has appeared on multiple websites this year, and Facebook users rightfully flagged the story as potentially false.\n\nThere is no accepted definition of a \u201csanctuary city,\u201d but the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service describes it as any jurisdiction that \u201cthrough resolutions, executive orders, or city ordinances expressly defined or limited their role and the activities of their employees regarding immigration enforcement.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere is no evidence to support the headline\u2019s claim, and the story on the Trump Deplorables Channel blog doesn\u2019t even mention an arrest. Instead, the post focuses on an incident in Oakland, California, where the Democratic mayor, Libby Schaaf, warned residents of impending raids by federal immigration agents in February.\n\nWe could find no record of criminal charges being brought against Schaaf or any other city official because of their refusal to cooperate with federal immigration policies \u2014 as the headline suggests. If such arrests had occurred, it would mark a huge development.\n\nIn a Fox News interview in early January, Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s top official, Thomas Homan, said that he had asked the Department of Justice to consider whether \u201csanctuary cities\u201d could be held accountable for violating the law if they do not provide immigration officials access to jailed residents who illegally immigrated to the U.S. Homan said he believed that charges should be filed against such cities and that the federal government should \u201chold these politicians personally accountable.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later, during a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen confirmed that her department, which oversees ICE, requested that the Justice Department \u201clook into it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Department of Justice is reviewing what avenues might be available,\u201d she said. \u201cThe context of this is of course not only putting my ICE officers at risk but also finding an efficient and effective way to enforce our immigration laws.\u201d\n\nA DHS spokesman declined our request for comment, and a Department of Justice spokesman would not provide any information on the status of its review.\n\nCiting department policy, Justice spokesman Devin O\u2019Malley said in an email that \u201cDOJ cannot confirm or deny the existence of investigations.\u201d When asked about the claim of arrests of \u201csanctuary city leaders\u201d and whether such charges were filed or even anticipated, O\u2019Malley referred FactCheck.org to press releases on the department\u2019s website \u2014 none of which support the false headline.\n\nThe fact that no federal action has been taken against Oakland officials has frustrated the president. At a May 16 meeting of California officials, Trump once again called for a federal investigation of Schaaf. In remarks directed at Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Trump said, \u201cI would recommend that you look into obstruction of justice for the mayor of Oakland, California, Jeff.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nSeghetti, Lisa M., et al. \u201cEnforcing Immigration Law: The Role of State and Local Law Enforcement.\u201d Congressional Research Service. 11 Mar 2009.\n\nO\u2019Malley, Devin.
