The administration also lacks directors for the Secret Service, Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), it claims.\n\nThe positions of interior secretary, defense secretary and U.N. ambassador are filled in a permanent capacity. Only three positions \u2013 ICE director, Homeland Security secretary and White House chief of staff \u2013 are helmed by individuals on an acting basis.\n\nThe Facebook post, which has been shared more than 600 times, uses a list of alleged vacancies in the Trump administration to question President Donald Trump\u2019s ability to serve as president.\n\n\u201cTRUMP CURRENTLY HAS: No Secret Service Director, no Homeland Security Director, no ICE Director, no Secretary of Defense, no Secretary of the Interior, no UN Ambassador, no White House Chief of Staff AND NO CLUE HOW TO RUN AMERICA,\u201d reads the caption.\n\nComedy writer Nick Pappas tweeted out the same claim in April, calling Trump an \u201cisolationist within his own administration.\u201d\n\nWhile the administration was experiencing turnover around that time, it\u2019s inaccurate to describe the positions mentioned the meme, posted Nov. 1, as currently vacant. Four of these positions are permanently filled, and three are held on an acting basis.

Mark Esper was sworn in as defense secretary late July, having previously served as the deputy assistant secretary of defense.\n\nKelly Craft, the current ambassador to the U.N., has held the position since being confirmed by the Senate on July 31, according to the U.S. Mission to the U.N. website.\n\nICE is currently helmed by acting director Matthew Albence, according to the ICE website. Kevin McAleenan was still serving as the acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary on Nov. 1, the date the meme was posted, but has since been replaced by Chad Wolf in an acting capacity.\n\nJames Murray, a veteran agent with more than 20 years of experience, was sworn in as the director of the Secret Service in May, according to the Baltimore Sun.\n\nSince January, the White House chief of staff position has been held by Mick Mulvaney on an acting basis.
