The claim is false; the video predates the footballer\u2019s injury in November 2019 by at least three months.\n\nThe video was published in this Facebook post on November 4, 2019, alongside the caption: \u201cMust watch video, the real situation concerning Andre Gomes injury\u201d. It has since been viewed 2.4 million times and shared nearly 40,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe Arabic script superimposed on the video translates to English as: \u201cResetting foot joint without surgery.\u201d\n\nAndr\u00e9 Gomes is a footballer for the English Premier League team Everton. He is also a midfielder for the Portuguese national side.\n\nOn November 4, 2019, the midfielder fractured his right ankle during a Premier League when he collided with Tottenham\u2019s Son Heung-min, as this AFP article reports.\n\nThe footage has since been shared on Facebook here, here, here, here and here; on Twitter here and here; and on YouTube here alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the footage predates the footballer\u2019s injury by at least three months. It also shows a left foot rather than a right foot.\n\nA reverse image search on Yandex found an earlier version of the footage published on Instagram here on July 18, 2019.\n\nThe Portuguese-language caption translates to English as: \u201cANKLE LUXATION \u2013 The luxation is the dislocation of one or more bones of a joint and it occurs when a force acts directly or indirectly over our body. In medical terms, it is defined as a loss of joint contact, in other words, the separation of two bones that are usually interconnected by cartilage. When the dislocation between the bones is partial and a part of each surface is in contact with the other, it is called a subluxation. The luxation can, sometimes, be related to a bone fracture, which can make it be mistaken for a sprain or a contusion. Luxation: dislocation of a bone. Sprain: injury caused by excessive movement of a joint. Contusion: injury in a part of the body (e.g., muscles).\u201d\n\nThe Instagram account belongs to Diego Magalh\u00e3es, who according to the bio is a 26-year-old physiotherapy student in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\u201cYes, the video is mine,\u201d he told AFP via Instagram\u2019s direct message on Friday, November 8, 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s not Andr\u00e9 Gomes, someone made a fake news. I didn\u2019t know the video was being shared as if it showed Andr\u00e9 Gomes\u2019 injury\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
