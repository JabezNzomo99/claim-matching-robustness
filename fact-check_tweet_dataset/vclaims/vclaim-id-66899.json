This additional information, pointed out by a reader, didn't change our rating of the claim we checked.\n\nSorry. We got carried away by a claim at a forum for Austin City Council candidates thrown by the League of Women Voters and the City of Austin.\n\nAccording to an Austin American-Statesman posted online Sept. 16, 2014, a council candidate, lawyer Jay Wiley, said the day before there\u2019s room in the city budget to staff offices in each of the 10 newly created single-member districts.\n\nWiley, running in District 6 in Northwest Austin, also said at the forum: \"We\u2019ve got, actually, over 1,000 city employees that make six-figure salaries.\"\n\nDoes that add up?\n\nWe failed to reach Wiley to learn the origin of his figure.\n\nMeantime, city spokeswoman Melissa Alvarado emailed a indicating that as of Sept. 1, 2014, 879 workers earned from $100,089 to $304,657. To follow-up queries, Alvarado sent a chart listing 24 vacancies at that time for positions paying $100,000 or more.\n\nSo, you could say the city had 903 positions paying six figures at the time Wiley spoke. Alvarado said the city then had 11,852 workers, which means its $100,000-plus earners accounted for 7 percent of its workers.\n\nPlus, more workers were heading into the six-figure class shortly. To our inquiry, Alvarado said 3.5 percent raises taking effect Sept. 21, 2014, (before the start of the new fiscal year in October) would result in 1,162 employees earning $100,000 or more. At that time, she said, the city expected there to be another 36 open positions paying more than $100,000 each.\n\nSo at that time, the city projects, 1,198 positions will pay six figures. Alvarado said the city had 12,780 positions budgeted for fiscal 2015.\n\nWe also looked at which city workers make the most. Peruse that sampling below.\n\nSource: Information provided by City of Austin, September 2014. The full .\n\nAfter we initially posted this fact check, a reader pointed out thar Wiley said at a Sept. 23, 2014, forum the city has \"almost 1,000\" workers earning six-figure salaries.\n\nWiley said more than 1,000 city workers make six-figure salaries.\n\nWhen he spoke, 879 workers earned more than $100,000, meaning he overshot. Then again, raises were about to take effect lifting workers in this pay category to 1,162.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
