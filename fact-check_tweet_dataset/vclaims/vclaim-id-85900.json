Such claims are often based on studies that rely on a variety of assumptions, any of which can be called into question. So we were interested when we received a call from a reader who wondered how the administration calculated that a proposed international trade agreement, known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, would support some 650,000 jobs.\n\nThe Obama administration is on a full-court press to complete negotiations on the trade pact, involving 12 Pacific Rim nations, and also win from Congress the authority for an up-or-down vote from lawmakers, which officials say is necessary to close the deal. The TPP is one of the few areas in which the White House can expect strong support from Republicans, though many Democrats remain skeptical or hostile.\n\nThe Peterson Institute in 2012 published a book titled \u201cThe Trans-Pacific Partnership and Asia-Pacific Integration: A Quantitative Assessment,\u201d by Peter A. Petri, Michael G. Plummer and Fan Zhai. The book does include an estimate that, by 2025, the United States would experience a gain of $77.5 billion in income from TPP, as well as a $124 billion increase in exports. (More on those numbers, which are expressed in 2007 dollars, below.) But nowhere in the book does it says 650,000 jobs would be created.\n\nThe same dynamic exists with the claim that the trade bill would increase exports by $124 billion by 2025. The Commerce Department estimates that about 5,500 jobs are supported by every $1 billion in exports, so in theory that also would yield about 650,000 jobs. But that calculation would ignore the fact that the Petri book found that imports would increase by virtually the same amount as exports, meaning the net number of new jobs is zero.\n\nThe mix of jobs would change, however. \u201cEmployment could be negatively affected by the adjustment implications of a trade agreement,\u201d Petri said. \u201cWe estimate \u2018job shifts\u2019\u2014employment moving from one sector to another\u2014and in difficult labor markets such shifts can lead to transitional unemployment, retirement or wage cuts.\u201d But, he added, \u201cin the case of the TPP such shifts will be small and slow, dwarfed by routine job separations and new hires in the economy. So adjustments and costs should be covered many times by gains. This makes possible strong transitional assistance for workers and communities that are adversely affected.\u201d\n\nIndeed, a gain of 650,000 jobs would also be just 0.4 percent of projected employment of 168 million people, Petri said. \u201cThe percentage change is small,\u201d Petri acknowledged, which he said is what one would expect from a large and efficient economy such as the United States. (Vietnam, by contrast, would see a gain of nearly 14 percent in income according to Petri\u2019s model.)\n\nThere is, of course, a long history of presidential administrations touting imaginary job gains from trade deals. \u201cI believe that NAFTA will create 200,000 American jobs in the first two years of its effect,\u201d then-President Bill Clinton said in 1993, when he signed supplemental agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement. \u201cI believe that NAFTA will create a million jobs in the first 5 years of its impact.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, C. Fred Bergsten, the founder of the Peterson Institute, conceded the Institute had \u201cbig internal debates\u201d over whether to calculate job numbers. \u201cCongress always wants to know how many jobs they\u2019re going to create,\u201d Bergsten said. \u201cAs good economists, we all take the view I think that trade agreement does not unbalance, create, or destroy jobs, it alters the composition of the workforce.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Peterson Institute study provides a variety of different analytical pathways to estimate the job supporting potential of TPP. Peterson provides estimates of both the increase to U.S. income and to U.S. exports as a result of TPP. The methodology laid out in the Peterson study for calculating potential employment gains based on their projected increase in income suggests a jobs number just below 650,000. A different approach is to use the sectoral value added estimates from the Peterson study. This approach was used by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to estimate approximately 700,000 jobs. Another approach is to map the incremental increase in national economic output to a proportional increase in employment. The Peterson study estimates an increase of 0.4 percent of GDP attributable to TPP. Based on a 2025 working population of 168 million cited by Peterson, a 0.4 percent increase would be approximately 672,000 jobs. It is also possible to estimate jobs supported by new exports by multiplying estimates of jobs per billion exports by the 124 billion dollars of increased exports projected in the Peterson study.\u201d\n\nClearly, with the Peterson Institute refusing to play the game this time and cough up a jobs number, the administration decided to concoct its own. But, as we have shown, one cannot at the same time claim both a gain of $77 billion in income and a gain of 650,000 jobs; the same effects simply cannot happen at once.", "lang": "en"}
