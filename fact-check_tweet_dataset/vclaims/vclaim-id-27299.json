Andrew Cuomo wants businesses in New York state to hire more applicants with a criminal record. They become loyal employees and bring tax benefits, he said. And, they make up a huge pool of prospective employees.\n\n\"70 million Americans have a criminal record \u2014 that\u2019s one in three adults,\" Cuomo wrote in an article on career website LinkedIn.\n\nPeople with a criminal record number too many for employers to pass over because of unsubstantiated fears of workplace violence, theft or incompetence, he said.\n\nBut is the number as high as he said? Does one in every three adults have a criminal record?\n\nThe FBI considers anyone who has been arrested on a felony charge to have a criminal record, even if the arrest did not lead to a conviction. The FBI only counts those with a misdemeanor if a state agency asks the bureau to keep it on file.\n\nSo by the FBI\u2019s standard, 73.5 million people in the United States had a criminal record as of June 30.\n\nThe Census Bureau lists the adult population in the United States at 249.4 million. That means the FBI considers about 29.5 percent of adults to have a criminal record.\n\nCuomo did not make any distinction between convictions and arrests in his article. He just used the term 'criminal record' without defining it.\n\nThe meaning of criminal record can be ambiguous. A search on the internet will tell you a criminal record is a history of someone\u2019s convictions, a step beyond the FBI\u2019s definition.\n\n\"When I teach my classes and I talk to my students about this, I tell them the term criminal record is almost useless,\" said Robert Brame, a professor in the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of South Carolina.\n\n\"It could mean so many different things,\" Brame said. \"Are you talking about conviction record, arrest record, juvenile record?\"\n\nIn most cases, arrests shouldn't show up on pre-employment checks, said Michelle Rodriguez, a senior staff attorney at the National Employment Law Project.\n\n\"But there's still mistakes that happen in background check reports so there is a possibility that something could show up,\" Rodriguez said.\n\nThere is no federal data on the number of people with a criminal conviction living in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics does have an estimate for how many people were under correctional supervision in 2015. The bureau reported 6.7 million adults either incarcerated or on parole or probation. That\u2019s close to three out of every 100 adults.\n\nCuomo said \"70 million Americans have a criminal record \u2014 that\u2019s one in three adults.\"\n\nBy the FBI definition, that is correct. But the term \u2018criminal record\u2019 is ambiguous, and the FBI definition is different from the common-sense definition. His claim may have been interpreted by some to mean one-third of adults have a criminal conviction. That\u2019s not true.\n\nHis statement leaves out how he defines criminal record, an important detail. We rate it Half True.", "lang": "en"}
