It garnered 4,500 retweets and 9,500 likes in one day. The text on the image claims that in 1975, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi entered Jawaharlal Nehru Univerity (JNU) along with Delhi police and forced then-President of Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union (JNUSU), Sitaram Yechury, to resign. It further alleges that Yechury had to read an apology letter for protesting against the emergency.\n\nSeveral others shared the image claiming Gandhi forced Yechury to resign as JNUSU President during the emergency. \u201cCan the Congress and Communists deny what Indiraji did to Sitaram Yechuri, the President of Student Union in JNU, in 1975 during emergency? The current govt hasn\u2019t done anything remotely close to this,\u201d wrote a user.\n\nAnother user @GuleriaPramod claimed that Yechury was beaten \u201cred and blue\u201d in 1975 before he was made to step down.\n\nAlt News has received fact-check requests regarding the image on its mobile application.\n\nAccording to the website of CPI (M), Yechury joined the party in 1975 and was also arrested that same year. However, he was not elected as the President of JNU Students\u2019 Union until two years later in 1977. \u201cHe joined Students Federation of India (SFI) in 1974, while at JNU. He joined the CPI(M) in 1975. He was underground for sometime, organising resistance to Emergency, before his arrest in 1975. After Emergency, he was elected as President of JNU Students\u2019 Union thrice during one year (1977-78),\u201d reads Yechury\u2019s bio on the party website.\n\nA reverse search of the viral image revealed that it was shot in 1977 and not 1975. A file photo was published by Hindustan Times described as, \u201cSitaram Yechury as a student leader in JNU reading the memorandum presented by students on Sept 5, 1977, to Indira Gandhi demanding her resignation as chancellor of the university.\u201d The emergency was lifted in January 1977 and Gandhi was not reelected as Prime Minister in the next general elections.\n\nAlt News contacted journalist and author Manoj Joshi who had witnessed the historic scene. Joshi was then pursuing a PhD from JNU and was an office-bearer in JNUSU. He was present in the massive rally led by Sitaram Yechury and confirmed that Yechury read out the memorandum presented by students to PM Indira Gandhi on September 5, 1977.\n\n\u201cIn 1975 she was in power and we would have not been allowed to stand near her. This picture was clicked in 1977 when she was not in power,\u201d said Joshi.\n\n\u201cIndira Gandhi was no longer in power and we wanted her to resign from the position of Chancellor of the University. We went to her house in a procession. At first, we were asked to drop her a message and leave but we persisted to meet her,\u201d Joshi (70) further informed.\n\n\u201cWhen she found students were outside her doors, she stepped out to listen to our demands. In this picture, Indira Gandhi is not standing in JNU premises,\u201d he added.\n\nYechury neither apologised nor was he beaten up\n\n\u201cSitaram read out a memorandum and on that basis, we requested her to resign. She asked if we wanted her to react immediately. The picture shows the reading of the memorandum and not an apology letter,\u201d Joshi confirmed.\n\nSpeaking with India Today, Yechury stated the same and added that he wasn\u2019t beaten up in the rally.\n\nAll three claims made using the viral photograph are false. The image does not depict former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi forcing CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechury, to resign as the JNUSU President during the emergency, The image was shot in September 1977, after the emergency was lifted months ago in January. Furthermore, neither does it show Gandhi inside JNU premises not was Yechury beaten up in the rally.", "lang": "en"}
