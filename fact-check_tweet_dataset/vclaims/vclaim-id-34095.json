The picture appeared to show a menorah, which plays a central role in Hanukkah rituals, displayed in the window of a home with a Nazi swastika flag flew ominously across the street. The picture was shared several times on social media in the final week of December, during which the eight-day festival of lights fell in 2019:\n\nThe photograph is indeed authentic, and social media posts about it in December 2019 did not substantially misrepresent its origins and context, even if some incorrectly dated it to 1931 or 1933.\n\nAccording to the most authoritative source available, Israel\u2019s official holocaust museum Yad Vashem, the photograph was taken in the northern German city of Kiel in 1932. The museum website describes the image as follows:\n\nOn Hanukkah 1932, just one month before Hitler came to power, Rachel Posner, wife of Rabbi Dr. Akiva Posner, took this photo of the family Hanukkah menorah from the window ledge of the family home looking out on to the building across the road decorated with Nazi flags. On the back of the photograph, Rachel Posner wrote in German (translated here): Chanukah 5692 (1932).\n\n \u201cDeath to Judah,\u201d so the flag says.\n\n \u201cJudah will live forever,\u201d so the light answers.\n\nThe Yad Vashem website provides the following context and further details about the history of the Posner family:\n\nRabbi Dr. Akiva Posner, Doctor of Philosophy from Halle-Wittenberg University, served from 1924\u20131933 as the last Rabbi of the community of Kiel, Germany. After Rabbi Posner publicized a protest letter in the local press expressing indignation at the posters that had appeared in the city, \u201cEntrance to Jews Forbidden\u201d, he was summoned by the chairman of the local branch of the Nazi party to participate in a public debate. The event took place under heavy police guard and was reported by the local press. When the tension and violence in the city intensified, the Rabbi responded to the pleas of his community to flee with his wife Rachel and their three children and make their way to Eretz Israel [the land of Israel]. Before their departure, Rabbi Posner was able to convince many of his congregants to leave as well and indeed most managed to leave for Eretz Israel or the United States. The Posner family left Germany in 1933 and arrived in Eretz Israel in 1934.\n\nIn 2017, the New York Times spoke with members of the Posner family, who explained that Yad Vashem exhibited the original menorah throughout the year, with the exception of Hanukkah, when it is displayed in the home of the Posners\u2019 great-grandson, Akiva Baruch Mansbach, in Beit Shemesh near Jerusalem. Mansbach explained to the Times the continued symbolic significance of lighting the very same menorah shown in the now-famous photograph:\n\nThe significance of lighting it in his home in Beit Shemesh, Israel, so many decades after his ancestors lit it as an act of resistance, did not escape him. \u201cThe same light that my great-grandparents lit in exile in Germany is the light that so many light today in Israel,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt demonstrates the continuity of Jewish history. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the Greeks on Hanukkah or the Nazis in Germany, they want the same thing \u2014 to destroy the nation of Israel,\u201d he added. The menorah symbolizes the strength and continuity of our nation, the idea that it is strong and will conquer all its enemies.\u201d On where that strength resides, Mr. Mansbach was unambiguous. \u201cUntil 70 years ago, we were in exile,\u201d he said. \u201cThat exile ended with the establishment of the state.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
