The photograph on the left is that of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, whereas the one on the right is of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nAs can be seen from the picture, both Adolf Hitler and Narendra Modi are seen posing with a child, in a strikingly similar manner. Both can be seen playfully pulling the ears of the child. Spandana\u2019s tweet has been retweeted over 420 times and \u2018liked\u2019 over 1400 times since it was posted on April 29.\n\nThe same image had been circulated by detractors of Narendra Modi in 2018 as well. It was debunked by Alt News.\n\nA reverse image search on Google revealed that Hitler\u2019s image used in the post is photoshopped. In the original image, he is not holding the child\u2019s ears but resting his hands on her shoulders. An article in The Sun has published the original image which was apparently clicked to portray the Nazi leader as a \u201cpersonal friend and guardian of the German youth\u201d.\n\nMoreover, if one looks closely, PM Modi\u2019s left hand has been photoshopped as Hitler\u2019s right and his right hand as Hitler\u2019s left.\n\nThe image tweeted by Divya Spandana is photoshopped. In order to draw a false comparison between PM Modi and Adolf Hitler, the latter\u2019s photograph was tweaked to portray uncanny similarity between the two leaders. Spandana later acknowledged her error.", "lang": "en"}
