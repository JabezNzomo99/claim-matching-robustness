I\u2019ve been looking forward to meeting President Trump for a while. That might offend some people, but oh well.\u201d\n\nThere is no record of Mahomes ever making the statement attributed to him in the Instagram post.\n\nMahomes led the Kansas City Chiefs to victory over the San Francisco 49ers in the 54th Super Bowl earlier this year. As of April 9, no official date has been set for the Chiefs to visit the White House, though some members of the team and coaching staff have said they would be willing to make the trip, per Fox News.\n\nThe tradition of Super Bowl champions visiting the White House dates back to 1980, according to ESPN. A recent Instagram post attributes to Mahomes a statement about wanting to make such a visit, quoting him as saying, \u201cI really hope it\u2019s not changed. I\u2019ve been looking forward to meeting President Trump for a while. That might offend some people, but oh well.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no record of Mahomes ever making the remark. The Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any credible media reports attributing the comment to Mahomes, and it appears nowhere on his verified social media accounts.

Julia Faron, the vice president of media and public relations at the firm, confirmed in an email to the Caller that Mahomes never made the comment.", "lang": "en"}
