Manny Pacquiao. \"Yellow\" is a colloquial term for members and supporters of the Liberal Party.\n\nThe owner of the photo himself, Bagong Alyansang Makabayan secretary-general Renato Reyes, disproved the photo in a tweet the day after and attached a much clearer copy of his photo.\n\nThe anti-Duterte protest action called \u201cUnited People's SONA,\" was actually organized by Reyes\u2019 group. The unedited banner read: \"Itakwil Ang Duterte Cha Cha! Labanan Ang Diktadura! (Get rid of Duterte Cha Cha! Fight the dictatorship!).\"\n\nSocialmedia.ph's fake online post could have reached over a million people on Facebook alone, having been shared by both pro- and anti-Duterte pages. Its top traffic generators were the oppositional Silent No More PH, President RodyDuterte Facebook Army and Rodrigo Duterte Supporters (#CBU4DU30) - Cebu Chapter.\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
