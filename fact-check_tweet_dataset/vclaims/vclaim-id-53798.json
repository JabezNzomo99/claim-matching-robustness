The Lopez-owned First Philippine Holdings Corporation now has only a minority share of 3.94 percent in Meralco.\n\nBeacon Electric Asset Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of a corporation owned by tycoon and Meralco Chairman Manuel V. Pangilinan, holds the largest chunk -- or 34.96 percent -- of the electricity company\u2019s shares.\n\nBeacon\u2019s parent company, Metro Pacific Investments Corporation, owns an additional 10.5 percent and is Meralco\u2019s third largest shareholder. Second with 29.56 percent of shares is JG Summit Holdings, Inc. of the late billionaire businessman John Gokongwei Jr.\n\nIn 1961, Eugenio Lopez Sr. led a group of Filipino entrepreneurs and bought Meralco, making it \u201cthe first major American enterprise to be so 'Filipinized\u2019,\u201d according to the company\u2019s website.\n\nHowever in 2009, in what Oscar Lopez -- son of Lopez Sr. -- described as a \u201cnecessary business decision,\u201d the family sold 20 percent of their shares in Meralco to the Pangilinan-led Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (PLDT) Group.\n\nThis diminished the Lopezes\u2019 shares in the electric company to a mere 13 percent, making Pangilinan\u2019s Group the single largest shareholder of Meralco, with an estimated 30 percent of shares during that time.\n\nThree years later, former Ambassador to Japan Manuel Lopez, then Meralco chairman, transferred his chairmanship of the company to Pangilinan, finally marking the end of the Lopez leadership in the country\u2019s major power distributor.\n\nIn her article on kinship politics in the Philippines after World War II, historian Mina Roces wrote that Macapagal, in a supposed attempt to dismantle deep-rooted influence of elite families in politics that use their \u201cpolitical power to build business empires,\u201d launched a \u201cmajor attack\u201d on the Lopezes and their business allies during his four-year term.\n\nThe president\u2019s \u201cassaults\u201d and \u201ctirades\u201d put the Lopezes \u201con the defensive and blunted their efforts to succeed in business,\u201d even pushing them to sell two of their corporations and two sugar mills, according to Roces\u2019 article titled \u201cKinship Politics in Post-War Philippines: The Lopez Family,\u201d published in 2000 in the Modern Asian Studies journal of Cambridge University in the United Kingdom.\n\nDuring the campaign period leading to the 1965 national elections, the Lopez-owned newspaper, The Manila Chronicle, published daily reports on the Marcos-Lopez campaign while \u201ccontinuously and ruthlessly attack[ing]\u201d Macapagal, who was then seeking reelection, the article said. The Nacionalista Party tandem eventually won the elections.\n\nThere is no clear evidence that the Lopezes engaged in \u201cblack propaganda\u201d to defeat Macapagal.\n\nBlack propaganda, as defined by American sociologist Howard Becker in his 1949 article titled \u201cThe Nature and Consequences of Black Propaganda,\u201d deals with propaganda disguised by the propagandizer -- in this case the Marcos-Lopez duo -- as coming from \u201ca source inside the propagandized,\u201d who is Macapagal.\n\nWhile the accounts of Roces and Richard Butwell, a scholar on politics in Southeast Asian countries, show there was mudslinging from both camps during the campaign, there was no indication that the Marcos-Lopez tandem launched its attacks from inside Macapagal's camp.\n\nOn the conflict between the Lopezes and Marcos due to tax issues\n\nThe conflict between the Lopezes and Marcos was due to the ownership of a lubricating oil facility \u2014 not taxes \u2014 from which the president demanded a 40 percent share, a proposition the Lopezes rejected by offering 15 percent to the president instead.\n\nHistorian Joseph Paul Scalice, in his 2017 dissertation on Marcos\u2019 military rule, discussed the tension between the two parties during the 1970 economic crisis:\n\nThis rejection resulted in an \u201copen political conflict\u201d between Marcos and the Lopezes during the first quarter of that year, Scalice said. The president later raised the import tax on crude oil, significantly increasing the operating costs of then Lopez-owned Meralco.\n\nThe lubricating oil factory mentioned in the dissertation, the Philippine Petroleum Corporation, was \u201cthe country\u2019s first lubricating oil base stock refiner,\u201d set up in September 1969 by the Lopezes. It was bought by Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation in the mid-1980s.\n\nOn the Lopezes\u2019 \u2018black propaganda\u2019 against Marcos and the shutting down of ABS-CBN\n\nThe Marcos-Lopez tandem had a \u201cfalling out\u201d following the 1969 elections, according to Scalice\u2019s dissertation.\n\nA 1975 New York Times report said the president then felt he would \u201cnever be able to consolidate his power\u201d due to the Lopezes\u2019 influence, while the latter \u201cbelieved...their wealth and power would be threatened\u201d if Marcos was able to keep his position.\n\nThen Vice President Fernando Lopez, along with other \u201cruling elites,\u201d financed protest movements, which sought Marcos\u2019 ouster \u201cthrough a variety of means,\u201d Scalice said.\n\nHistorian and activist Renato Constantino, a columnist of the Lopez-owned Manila Chronicle, wrote anti-Marcos pieces. However, Scalice said Constantino\u2019s columns were \u201cnot a political expos\u00e9,\u201d since a number of the Philippine news media at the time already sang an anti-Marcos tune.\n\nSince the charges leveled by the Lopez camp against Marcos did not come from inside the then president's camp, these do not fit the definition of black propaganda.\n\nThe shutdown of ABS-CBN during the military rule was also not an isolated case. Marcos\u2019 Letter of Instruction No. 1, issued after he declared martial law in 1972, ordered state forces to \u201ctake over and control\u201d all privately-owned media entities, including ABS-CBN, to prevent them from being used \u201cfor propaganda purposes against the government.\u201d\n\nOn Marcos saving the Lopezes and Meralco\n\nThe increase in import tax on crude oil imposed by Marcos in December 1970 led to the significant rise in operating costs for Meralco, which again escalated the conflict between the president and the Lopezes.\n\nWriter and historian Raul Rodrigo, as cited by Scalice in his research, said by 1971, the company acquired a \u201clarge dollar-denominated debt\u201d too difficult to pay that the \u201conly way\u201d for the company to survive is by \u201csecur[ing] a rate increase\u201d from the government \u2014 especially since an additional P1 billion was also needed for a planned expansion of Meralco in the next seven years.\n\nIn May 1972, the Public Service Commission granted Meralco a rate increase of 36.5 percent, which led the two camps to reconcile temporarily \u2014 with Marcos even meeting with the Lopezes to shake their hands, Scalice wrote.\n\nHowever, Marcos declared martial law four months later and put Eugenio \u201cGeny\u201d Lopez Jr., another son of Lopez Sr., behind bars for his alleged hand in a plot to assassinate the president.\n\nOn the Lopezes conspiring with Ninoy and Cory Aquino to topple the Marcos administration\n\nFormer President Cory Aquino, whom Marcos himself described as a \u201cmere housewife,\u201d entered the political arena only during the snap presidential elections, three years after her husband Ninoy -- Marcos\u2019 archnemesis -- was assassinated upon his return to the country from exile in August 1983.\n\nCory ran as the opposition\u2019s standard bearer but lost in the 1986 elections, marred with \u201cmassive poll fraud and rampant cheating.\u201d Her defeat eventually led to the country\u2019s first People Power that saw the downfall of the Marcos dictatorship.\n\nPolitical science expert Mark Thompson, as cited by Scalice, said \u201cfive major factions\u201d \u2014 the Aquino, Laurel, Osme\u00f1a, Roxas, and Lopez families \u2014 \u201ccame into alignment\u201d to oppose Marcos between 1970 and 1972.\n\nThe \u201callied elite opposition\u201d funded protests to \u201cdestabilize Marcos\u201d and helped \u201cplan, pay for, and give favorable press coverage to the rallies,\u201d among others, the account said.\n\nAfter the president put the country under martial rule in September 1972, the anti-Marcos rallies were stopped. However, select members of different political groups -- including the Liberal Party, National Union for Liberation, and Nacionalista Party -- made their own alliance to oppose the dictatorship, according to a 1981 article published in the Asian Survey journal of the University of California.\n\nOn President Aquino returning ABS-CBN and Meralco to the Lopezes \u2018for free\u2019\n\nAccording to Roces, columnist Hilarion Henares Jr. of the Philippine Daily Inquirer \u201cexposed\u201d in a July 1988 article the underpriced transfer of Meralco shares to the Lopezes, with some of the shares returned \u201cwith absolutely no cash outlay\u201d from the Lopez family.\n\nThe expos\u00e9 pushed the Aquino administration to call the transaction off, causing the Lopezes \u201cto share a good portion of their profits with the government,\u201d Roces said.\n\nColumnist Federico D. Pascual Jr. of The Philippine Star, in a 2002 article, similarly said the Lopezes got back \u201csome -- not all\u201d of their assets in Meralco post-martial law, after having sold it for a mere P10,000 to a dummy foundation of the Marcoses in 1973.\n\nIn a 2008 ABS-CBN report, former Finance secretary and then ambassador to the United Kingdom Edgardo Espiritu said a review committee was formed by the Aquino government to deliberate on how Meralco would be returned to the Lopezes. Espiritu, who served as chair of the review committee, said the family paid \u201can extra P2 billion on top of its earlier payments\u201d to reclaim some shares in Meralco.\n\nAs for ABS-CBN, the Lopez camp insisted that the family never lost its ownership of the media organization.\n\nIn January 1987, ABS-CBN entered into an \u201cAgreement to Arbitrate\u201d with the Aquino administration after the media company asked the government, through former Sen. Lorenzo Ta\u00f1ada, for the return of its television and radio stations.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld the validity of the agreement two years later, in a decision that dismissed a petition requesting its annulment.\n\nThese accounts were reiterated during the June 15 House committee hearing on the renewal of the media giant\u2019s legislative franchise, where ABS-CBN\u2019s counsel Arecio Rendor Jr. said the network \u201cwas never sold nor was [its ownership] ever transferred,\u201d even during Marcos\u2019 martial rule. (See VERA FILES FACT SHEET: What\u2019s next for ABS-CBN after losing franchise bid?)\n\nThis claim was supported by Justice Assistant Secretary Nicholas Ty and Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) Commissioner John Agbayani, who were both invited as resource persons in the same hearing.\n\nRendor said ABS-CBN\u2019s return to the Lopezes after the military rule was approved by the Office of the President, the PCGG, and the Board of Arbitrators, and was upheld by the Regional Trial Court and the Supreme Court.\n\nFirst Philippine Holdings Corporation, Press Statement of Oscar M.
