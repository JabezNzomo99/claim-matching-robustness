They\u2019re more and more likely to be occupied overnight, leaving less slack in the system to cope with surges in demand.\n\nThe significance of the fall isn\u2019t clear-cut. Per person, we probably don\u2019t need quite as many beds we used to: the NHS is getting more efficient at seeing patients in hospital; more of us are being seen on the same day rather than staying overnight; and when we do stay overnight, on average we\u2019re spending slightly less time in hospital.\n\nFinally, these figures don\u2019t tell us everything. For example, they don\u2019t tell us about beds in private hospitals, paid for by the NHS.\n\nOfficial figures show at least 12,000 fewer overnight hospital beds over six years\n\nWhatever periods you compare between now and six years ago, the number of overnight beds on the NHS has fallen.\n\nOn an average night from July to September in 2010, there were about 141,500 beds across the English NHS. During the same period last year \u2013 the latest figures \u2013 there were 129,500.\n\nSo that\u2019s a fall of about 12,000.\n\nYou can get slightly different figures by comparing different points in the year. For example, if you compared April to June of both years you\u2019d see a fall of 14,000.\n\nThe headlines get 15,000 by comparing the spring months in 2010 with the summer months in 2016. This isn\u2019t a fair comparison because the number of beds varies depending on the time of year. Typically the number of beds increases at the start of the year, during winter, before falling back in the later months.\n\nThis was the government\u2019s line of argument in response to the headlines this week.\n\nBefore 2010, the NHS\u2019 figures included more types of bed. It counted beds for residential care or what\u2019s called \u2018non-consultant-led\u2019 treatment (beds for care managed by a nurse or GP).\n\nSince 2010, only beds managed by consultant doctors in hospitals are part of the figures.\n\nThat was seen as a \u201cmajor factor\u201d behind the sharp fall in the number of overnight beds counted in these figures.\n\nThat means claims that simply compare the number of beds before and after 2010 will overstate the fall.\n\nWe asked the BMA \u2013 which made claims about the change over the past decade \u2013 about these concerns. They pointed us to part of their report which warned that \u201ccare should be taken \u2026 when comparing figures from before and after 2009/10\u201d due to the change in methodology.\n\nWhatever rough estimates you care to make, it\u2019s still clear the number of overnight beds has been falling. The difficulty is knowing by how much.\n\nWe don\u2019t necessarily need as many beds per patient as we used to\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to conclude that any number of fewer beds is bad news for the NHS, especially considering hospitals are busier than ever.\n\nIt\u2019s not quite as simple as that.\n\nOn one hand, the number of overnight beds has been falling for years \u2013 it fell by about 9% over the last six.\n\nBut on the other, the proportion of beds which are occupied has been rising slowly by comparison. Six years ago about 85% of overnight beds were occupied. Last year it was more like 87%.\n\nA few other trends help to explain why this might have happened.\n\nFirst, a growing proportion of hospital visits involving a consultant have been day-only over the last decade, as opposed to patients staying overnight. 29% of cases were day-only in 2005/6 while 36% were in 2015/16. This is also reflected in a slight rise in the number of day-only beds over the same period.\n\nThe average length of stay in hospital is also falling consistently over time. This is because patients who are in hospital for longer periods are leaving sooner. It\u2019s been the case since 2007 that half of overnight patients only stay a day.\n\nBut there are still fewer than the recommended number of beds available\n\nHospitals across England are getting more and more likely to reach capacity. A rise in occupancy from 85% to 87% might not sound like much, but the upward trend has been consistent for the last six years\n\nFrom July to September last year, bed occupancy hit 87.5% - the highest recorded level for that time of year. Across hospital trusts, almost two thirds were using over 85% of their overnight beds on average. 10% of trusts had 95% occupancy rates or higher.\n\nThis is dangerous for patients, according to the trade association, NHS Providers. It and the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP) say 85% is the standard rate. The RCP goes on:\n\n\u201c[85%] means that patients can be admitted in a timely fashion to a local bed, retain the connections with their social support network and take leave without the risk that they cannot return to their ward should they need a longer period of in-patient care. It allows functioning space to accommodate those newly admitted and to provide proper treatments to current patients.\u201d\n\nThe problem is particularly acute over winter, when \u2018unplanned\u2019 care demand is highest so the system needs slack. Health think tank the King\u2019s Fund warned last month that bed occupancy rates had routinely exceeded 85% over the past winter and on some days often passed even 95%.", "lang": "en"}
