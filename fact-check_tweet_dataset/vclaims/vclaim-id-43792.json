Kashi is officially called Varanasi and is a significant Hindu pilgrimage site.\n\nThe same image has been viral on Facebook with a similar narrative. One such Facebook post has been archived here .\n\nBOOM was able to ascertain that the photo is not from Uttar Pradesh. A logo of Bangladesh Police can be seen on the vehicle parked beside the pavement. Police (\u09aa\u09c1\u09b2\u09bf\u09b6) is written in Bangla on the body of the vehicle. BOOM also compared the logo of the Bangladesh police with the logo on the vehicle, and found both to be the same.\n\nThe image is present on the internet from as early as 2018 . It has been used in 2019 in a blogpost as well.", "lang": "en"}
