When Vishvas News scanned the official website of Jio, there was no application mentioned by the name of \u201cPrime\u201d under the \u201cAPPS\u201d tab. However, the other listed apps include: MyJio, JioSaavn, JioBrowser, JioChat and others.\n\nWhen we clicked on the \u201cDownload App\u201d button, it shows an apk \u201cAndroid application package) file. This is the file format used by the Android operating system for the distribution and installation of mobile apps. The alert we received while downloading stated: \u201cThis type of file could harm your phone. Only download the file if you trust its source.\u201d\n\nWhereas, the apps listed on Jio\u2019s website displays the Play Store link and App Store for iOS users. Clearly, the app is a phishing link and not a trusted application.\n\nSince the message is directed towards Jio users, we spoke to Pooja Deb, Customer Care Department of Jio.
