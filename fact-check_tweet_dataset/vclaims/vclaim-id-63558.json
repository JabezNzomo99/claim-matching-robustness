We're at 29.\"\n\nThe next day, the two told viewers that they had made amends, with Sorkin saying they were \"having the conversation that\u2019s happening at everybody\u2019s dinner table.\"\n\nIn case you\u2019re having the same argument over dinner tonight, we wanted to arm you with the facts: Kernen\u2019s claim on deaths per capita isn\u2019t completely accurate.\n\nWhile the U.S. is close to 29 deaths per 100,000 people, it is not \"near the low end of per capita deaths,\" we found. Only a handful of countries have had more deaths per capita.\n\nRELATED: Trump\u2019s comparison of COVID-19 deaths in Germany, US is wrong\n\nA CNBC spokesperson cited data from Johns Hopkins University tracking deaths per 100,000 people, a metric that public health experts generally consider useful.\n\nAs of May 26, the day before Kernen\u2019s claim, the U.S. had recorded 30.23 deaths per 100,000 people, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nThat was better than 10 countries. It was worse than more than 130 others, including many nations of similar size.\n\nSpecifically, the U.S. had more deaths per 100,000 people at the time of Kernen\u2019s comment than all but a handful of European countries: San Marino, Belgium, Andorra, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Sweden, the Netherlands and Ireland.\n\nOnly San Marino (pop. 34,000), Belgium (pop. 11.6 million) and Andorra (pop. 77,000) had more than 60 deaths per 100,000 people. Spain, the United Kingdom and Italy had over 50 deaths per 100,000.\n\nThose figures have hardly changed as of May 27. The U.S. is at 30.69 deaths per 100,000 people, behind the same 10 European nations but ahead of the rest.\n\nThree other sources public health experts told us are reliable \u2014 the Kaiser Family Foundation, Our World in Data and Worldometer \u2014 show similar numbers.\n\nEach source shows the U.S. performing worse than the vast majority of countries.\n\n\"We have a very high death rate here compared to most countries in the world, and some of our states have among the highest death rates in the world,\" said Brooke Nichols, assistant professor of global health at Boston University.\n\nThe U.S., in particular, is \"a patchwork epidemic\" because of its \"expansive, diverse geography and populations,\" Nichols said.\n\nDifferent geographic areas experience varying outbreaks and death tolls due to a number of factors, such as the age of the population, how far along the epidemic curve the area is and how well the local health care systems have been able to manage, she said.\n\nIf you compare individual U.S. states to other countries, Nichols said, the situation looks worse. Eleven states plus Washington, D.C have more deaths per million people than the U.S. as a whole, according to Worldometer data for May 28.\n\nSome states are comparable to the worst countries.\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted, another way to compare countries is to consider recent \u2014 rather than total \u2014 death counts per capita. But as of May 28, numerous countries have also had fewer daily deaths per capita based on a seven-day average than the U.S., per Our World in Data.\n\nKernen said: \"We\u2019re down near the low end of per capita deaths \u2026 Most places are at 60 deaths per 100,000. We're at 29.\"\n\nThe U.S. has hovered slightly above 29 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people in recent days, but it is far from being \"down near the low end of per capita deaths.\"\n\nOnly a handful of countries are performing worse by that metric, and just three have recorded more than 60 deaths per 100,000.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
