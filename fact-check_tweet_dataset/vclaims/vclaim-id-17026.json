We\u2019ve been through this before, but it bears repeating as more information becomes available:\n\u2022 Federal regulations allowed Clinton to send and receive emails outside the government system, but those emails had to be preserved before she left office. Clinton did not provide the department with emails from her private server until 21 months after she left office.\n\u2022 Her decision to conduct government business exclusively on a private server was, as one federal records expert put it, \u201cinconsistent with long-established policies and practices \u2026 governing all federal agencies.\u201d A federal judge in a lawsuit involving Clinton\u2019s emails said she failed to follow \u201cgovernment policy.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s email saga became public on March 2, 2015, with a report in the New York Times that she exclusively used a private email account to conduct State Department business during her time in office, from January 2009 to February 2013. Shortly after, the Associated Press reported that Clinton\u2019s email account was hosted on a server at her home in New York.\n\nShe said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that she thought it was more \u201cconvenient\u201d to use a single personal email account to conduct both private affairs and government business, and she regrets having made that decision. Host John Dickerson asked her what voters can take from her opting for convenience when faced with such a decision.\n\nDickerson, May 8: A general election voter will know, when Hillary Clinton is the president in the office, and a convenient option arrives, maybe she will think twice about it? Clinton: Well, as I have said many times, there was \u2014 I was absolutely permitted, and I did it. And it turned out to be a mistake. It wasn\u2019t the best choice.\n\nThe Clinton campaign makes that claim based on a National Archives and Records Administration regulation in place since 2009 that said federal agencies may allow their employees to send and receive work-related emails \u201cusing a system not operated by the agency,\u201d but an agency \u201cmust ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system.\u201d\n\nBut NARA also requires federal agencies to maintain an NARA-approved schedule for preserving work-related records. The State Department Records Disposition Schedule says \u201cincoming and outgoing correspondence and memorandums on substantive U.S. foreign policy issues\u201d should be permanently retained \u201cat the end of the Secretary\u2019s tenure or sooner if necessary.\u201d Clinton, who left office Feb. 1, 2013, did not provide the State Department with her emails until Dec. 5, 2014. She did so after the department in October of that year requested her emails in response to congressional requests for documents related to the Benghazi attacks on Sept. 11, 2012.\n\n\u201cIn the process of responding to congressional document requests pertaining to Benghazi, State Department officials recognized that it had access to relatively few email records from former Secretary Clinton,\u201d State Department spokesman John Kirby told the Washington Post. \u201cState Department officials contacted her representatives during the summer of 2014 to learn more about her email use and the status of emails in that account.\u201d\n\nSimply put, Clinton did not follow the NARA regulations on preserving email records.\n\nIn addition, Clinton\u2019s decision to conduct government business exclusively through a private email network caught the experts at NARA by surprise. It was unprecedented. Clinton has said that other \u201csecretaries of state\u201d did the \u201csame thing,\u201d but Colin Powell \u2014 who was secretary of state from 2001 to 2005 \u2014 was the only other secretary of state to use an email account outside of the government email system and he did not set up a private server. Powell used America Online, where he once served on the board of directors.\n\nThe day after the New York Times broke its story, NARA Chief Records Officer Paul M. Wester Jr. sent a letter to the State Department saying he was \u201cconcerned that Federal records may have been alienated from the Department of State\u2019s official recordkeeping systems.\u201d Wester wanted to know what the department was doing to retrieve \u201crecords created using personal email accounts.\u201d (See the first exhibit in Attachment B of NARA\u2019s response to GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley.)\n\nThe State Department responded to that letter on April 2, 2015, by informing NARA that, among other things, it had sent a letter to \u201call employees reminding them of their responsibilities vis-a-vis records, emails, and personal accounts.\u201d In its letter to employees, the State Department said, \u201cAs a general matter, to ensure a complete record of their activities, senior officials should not use their private e-mail accounts (e.g., Gmail) for official business.\u201d\n\nThe reminder was nothing new. In fact, as the Washington Post Fact Checker wrote, Clinton herself in June 2011 sent a cable \u201cunder her signature warning employees to \u2018avoid conducting official Department business from your personal e-mail accounts.\u2019 \u201d\n\nJason R. Baron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle and a former director of litigation at the National Archives, expressed surprise at Clinton\u2019s exclusive use of a private email network at a Senate Judiciary Committee a year ago. He told the committee that \u201cany employee\u2019s decision to conduct all e-mail correspondence through a private e-mail network, using a non-.gov address, is inconsistent with long-established policies and practices under the Federal Records Act and NARA regulations governing all federal agencies.\u201d\n\nBaron also made the point that an employee who does not use a government email account \u201ccompromises the ability of an agency to adequately respond to FOIA requests,\u201d referring to the Freedom of Information Act. In fact, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan expressed frustration with Clinton at a hearing last summer involving a FOIA lawsuit filed against the department over her records. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be here today if this employee had followed government policy,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nClinton can say her private email network was permitted because there wasn\u2019t anything in federal law that expressly prohibited it. But such extensive use of private emails was unusual and clearly discouraged, and she failed to comply with the regulations for maintaining government records.\n\nOur file on Clinton\u2019s claims about her emails can be found here.", "lang": "en"}
