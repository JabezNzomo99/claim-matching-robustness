But is it right about the size of the UK government\u2019s foreign aid budget?", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-33368", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/uk-foreign-aid-budget-what-did-government-spend-2017/", "vclaim": "The UK foreign aid budget: what did the government spend in 2017?\n\nThis image about the UK\u2019s foreign aid budget has been shared over 59,000 times at the time of writing.\n\nIn 2016, the UK provided \u00a313.4 billion in foreign aid to developing countries. For 2017, the provisional figure is \u00a313.9 billion.\n\nIn January 2018, a woman reported that her father had been \u201cstuck\u201d on a trolley at the Royal Stoke University Hospital for 36 hours. The accompanying photo was reportedly taken at the same hospital in 2015 by a different patient\u2019s mother. We\u2019re not able check whether this photograph is representative of the situation in hospitals across the country. But we can look into the statistics behind how long these types of waits tend to be both nationally and for individual hospital trusts.\n\nTotal health spending in England was around \u00a3125 billion in 2017/18, almost ten times higher than the foreign aid budget.\n\nThe foreign aid budget covers a different geographical area, a slightly different time period, comes from a different departmental budget, and poses very different challenges and scales.\n\nThe UK government spent \u00a313.9 billion on \u201cofficial development assistance\u201d, what it calls foreign aid, in 2017. That\u2019s up 4% from just under \u00a313.4 billion in 2016.\n\nFor both years, that was in line with the government\u2019s target of spending 0.7% of the country\u2019s Gross National Income (the annual income received by residents here plus income from overseas). That means for every \u00a3100 made here, 70p is spent by the government on foreign aid.\n\nYou can read more about where the target comes from in our explainer on foreign aid here.\n\nThis target seems unlikely to change any time soon\u2014it\u2019s currently enshrined in law, and although this can\u2019t be enforced through the courts, the International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt would have to explain herself to parliament if it wasn\u2019t met. She recently said: \u201cwe remain committed to 0.7%\u201d.\n\nHowever, during the same speech, Ms Mordaunt proposed changing the rules on the 0.7% target so reinvested profits from private investments (she mentioned the public\u2019s savings and pensions) could count towards it.\n\nAt the moment, only public funds are counted. She expanded on this in response to an urgent question from the Shadow International Development Secretary Kate Osamor MP, who argued that the department\u2019s vision would \u201cleave the most vulnerable people at the mercy of global markets\u201d.\n\nA trolley wait, as defined by NHS England, is the time from when the decision was made to admit someone to hospital, until their actual admission. Admitting them might mean they go to a bed in a ward, or an operating theatre.\n\nIn January 2018, a media outlet spoke to a member of the public who said their father had been \u201cstuck on a trolley for 36 hours waiting to be treated\u201d.\n\nThe NHS doesn\u2019t break down data for trolley waits by hospital, only by NHS trust, and it only publishes data on whether waits were longer than four and 12 hours.\n\nThe Royal Stoke University Hospital is part of the University Hospitals of North Midlands (UHNM) Trust. In the three months to June 2018, there were two cases of patients having trolley waits of 12 or more hours. There were around 3,270 trolley waits of over four hours.\n\nIn the quarter before, in the three months to March 2018 (the colder season which usually has the longest A&E waits and sees most targets missed), 393 patients waited longer than 12 hours across the whole trust.\n\nIn the UK in general, around 3,500 patients waited for over 12 hours in 2017/18.", "lang": "en"}
