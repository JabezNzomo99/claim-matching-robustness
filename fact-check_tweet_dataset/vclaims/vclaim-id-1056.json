REUTERS/Larry Downing (UNITED STATES - Tags: SOCIETY)\n\nAn image on social media makes the claim that the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. was vandalized during protests triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck on May 25 in Minneapolis. This claim is false.\n\nExamples of the image can be seen here and here .\n\nThe image shows green paint splattered on top of the statue of Abraham Lincoln, while overlaid text reads: \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me it\u2019s about racial injustice when you\u2019re willing to deface the statue of the man who ended slavery.\u201d\n\nThis photo, however, is seven years old and is unrelated to the George Floyd protests.\n\nIn 2013, the memorial was temporarily closed after someone defaced it with a can of green paint, according to the New York Post ( here ).\n\nReuters recently debunked a similar claim that alleged that the Lincoln Memorial had been covered in graffiti and defaced ( here ).\n\nFalse. The image of the vandalized Lincoln Memorial stems from 2013 and is unrelated to the recent George Floyd protests.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
