He is a prime example of true courage and honesty. May all his supporters pray for his success.\u201d It was placed below a photo of Ohira grabbed from the official website of the Office of the Prime Minister of Japan.\n\nThe fake graphic was published after Duterte made the headlines early April for instructing the military and police to \u201cshoot\u201d violators of the community quarantine imposed on Luzon amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nA huge spike of reshares on May 5 by netizens on public FB groups, many of which bear the name \u201cDuterte\", was detected by social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle. This came after the Duterte administration came under fire following the National Telecommunications Commission\u2019s issuance of a cease and desist order against ABS-CBN that day, which shut down operations of the broadcasting giant due to the expiry of its legislative franchise.\n\nThe fake post, which is still circulating online, has received over 1,100 interactions and 6,200 shares. Traffic largely came from public FB groups PROTECT THE PRESIDENT DUTERTE, RAFFY TULFO IN ACTION ADMINS GROUP S MEMBER, and Filipino Tambayan. Several other netizens have also republished the fabricated graphic as their own.", "lang": "en"}
