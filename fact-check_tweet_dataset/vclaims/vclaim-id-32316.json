Since then, north-east Delhi has witnessed widespread communal riots which have so far taken the lives of at least 10 persons, including a cop. Amidst the violence, a 28-second video has gone viral where one can see a bus driver being attacked by a mob. One of the attackers, sporting a skull cap, is attacking the driver with a wooden log.\n\nTwitter user @sharmaAvl posted the viral video and tweeted (archive link), \u201cThis is the horror being played on the streets of Delhi right now. Did you see the skull cap? They have turned this country into Syria, where Hindus are shit scared. My relatives living in Maujpur haven\u2019t stepped out of their home since 3 days.\u201d So far, the video has garnered over 1 lakh views.\n\nThe video was also shared by Shilpa Nair, Kerala BJP State Communications member (archive link), Shashank Singh (@pokershash) founder of Fact Hunt (archive link) and @oyevivekk (archive link) amid ongoing violence in Delhi.\n\n\n\nAlt News performed a keyword search on YouTube and found that ABP Mahja uploaded a bulletin which reported about the incident on February 18.\n\nAccording to ABP Mahja, the incident took place in Kannad, Aurangabad, Maharashtra, Using this as a clue, Alt News performed another keyword search and found a February 21 report by Times of India. According to the report, 18 people were booked for allegedly assaulting Sudhakar Shamrao Shirsath (bus driver) and the bus conductor of a state transport bus near Hotel Amrapali, Aurangabad-Nashik road on February 18.\n\nAlt News reached out to Kannad police sub-inspector, BP Rout. He said, \u201cThe accused attacked the bus driver because he bumped into their car. There is no communal angle is this incident.\u201d The cop also informed that reports of 18 persons booked by the police are incorrect. They were taken in for questioning, not arrested.\n\nWe also found Shirsath\u2019s FIR on Maharasthra police\u2019s official website. Even his statement doesn\u2019t state that the attack on him was communal in nature. He said that the attackers took his phone and about Rs 6,000 in cash from the conductor.\n\nThe viral video is not related to CAA protests. Instead, it shows an altercation that followed after the bus driver bumped into a car on February 18 in Maharashtra\u2019s Aurangabad.", "lang": "en"}
