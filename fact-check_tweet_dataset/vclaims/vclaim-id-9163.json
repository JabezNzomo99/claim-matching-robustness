In fact, this quote wasn\u2019t attached to the photograph at all until 30 July 2016, long after Reagan\u2019s death, when it was posted to the \u201cTrump Train\u201d Facebook page. A previous investigation into \u201cTrump Train\u201d found that the social media site frequently shares hoax stories and fake quotes.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t know exactly how President Reagan felt about Donald Trump, the Washington Post combed through Reagan\u2019s archives and concluded that Trump and the former president weren\u2019t very close. Reagan\u2019s son Michael Reagan said that his father would likely be \u201cconfused\u201d by Trump\u2019s candidacy: \u201cAt best, he would be confused by Donald Trump and the way he\u2019s running the campaign. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be appreciative of the demeaning style of Donald Trump \u2014 the way he\u2019s treated the other candidates \u2014 because my father knew that at the end of the day he had to bring everyone together to win an election.\u201d\n\nIn July 2019, President Trump himself tweeted this meme:", "lang": "en"}
