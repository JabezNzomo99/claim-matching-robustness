All along from Columbus school, to Shankar road on either side of the road 2 lines of Buses from various villages of UP, Haryana are parked...

The post reads, \"Aaj delhi k talkatora stadium me, Jamiyate ulamaye hind ne, Aman ekta sammelan organize kiya, Jiska mtlb, Desh me moblinching, Dharam ne naam pr maar peet, Tirple talaaq jaise muddo pr srkaar k saamne apni baat rkhi.\"\n\nAlso Read: Old Video Of Children in Jammu Singing \u2018Hindustan Hamara Hai\u2019 Shared As Celebrations In Kashmir\n\nOn Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind Facebook page we founds photos from the event that matched the viral video as the flags of Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind are present in both.", "lang": "en"}
