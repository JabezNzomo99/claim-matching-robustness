The claim is false and the image is doctored.\n\nThe image was shared on November 28 by Kata Kita, a Facebook page that posts content in support of Indonesian president Joko Widodo, who is also running in Indonesia\u2019s presidential election next year.\n\nThe image shows retired general Subianto reaching out to shake hands as he receives a framed board which says: \u201cMURI Record for the most apologies in 2018\u201d and his name.\n\nThe post has a caption that mentions four occasions when Subianto made controversial comments in campaign speeches and his apologies for two of the four statements.\n\nAnother post shared the picture with a caption saying: \u201cCongratulations, Mr. Prabowo.. You need to be appreciated.\u201d\n\nA reverse image search found the photo was a cropped, edited version of an image showing Subianto receiving a board displaying words of support from the Egypt Alumni Communication Forum (FSAM).\n\nThe photograph was taken during a November 19 meeting between Subianto and representatives from the group and was published by radarcirebon.com and suara-islam.com in articles about the meeting.\n\nThe doctored photograph and original photograph are identical except for the words on the frame being presented to Subianto.\n\nOther Indonesian news organisations, including CNN Indonesia and state-owned Antara, also reported the event, although they did not use the same picture.\n\nIn the Antara photo accompanying their article on the Prabowo-FSAM meeting, the man holding the microphone in both the original and doctored images can be seen (front row, third from left) wearing the same clothes, speaking to the press.", "lang": "en"}
