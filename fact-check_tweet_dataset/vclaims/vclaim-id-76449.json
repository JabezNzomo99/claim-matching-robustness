PolitiFact rated this claim Mostly True.\n\nBut what about wages from the recession to now?\n\nWe decided to look into Bill Clinton\u2019s claim.\n\nBill Clinton\u2019s spokesman, Angel Urena, provided us with multiple studies done by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute on the issue.\n\nWe reached out to the D.C. think tank directly, which analyzes the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n\"The statement is largely correct. Real, inflation-adjusted wages were stagnant for the bottom 80 percent of the wage distribution between 2007 and 2014,\" said Economic Policy Institute spokesman Dan Crawford.\n\nReal wages did increase 1.7 percent in 2015, but Crawford noted that was because of a one-time dip in inflation. Wage inequality still increased across the board in 2015.\n\nBill Lester, an economic development professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, analyzed the Economic Policy Institute\u2019s income data from 1973 to 2012. From 2008 to 2012, wages for the bottom 80 percent either declined or did not change at all.\n\nBill Clinton said, \"80 percent of the American people haven\u2019t gotten a pay raise since the crash.\"\n\nThe former president is accurate. While there were modest increases in real wages and median weekly earnings in 2015, they come with asterisks.\n\nInflation\u2019s one-time decline in 2015 is an outlier. And, weekly wages leaves out other sources of income. Some households rely on sources outside of wages and salaries as part of their income.\n\nWe rate Bill Clinton\u2019s claim as Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
