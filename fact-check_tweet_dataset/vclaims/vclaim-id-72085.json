Lloyd Doggett\u2019s smiling face appears on a mailer sent out by a group advocating voter approval of a City of Austin rail proposition on the November 2014 ballot.\n\n\"Don\u2019t let the Tea Party fool you,\" says a headline below the photo of the Democratic congressman from Austin on the placard mailed to voters by , a group that favors the proposal to spend $1 billion on a light rail line and roads.\n\nDoggett goes on to say: \"Proposition 1 is a smart investment in Austin\u2019s future.\" Below, he extolls the spending plan and then says: \"The Austin Tea Party and an ultra-conservative millionaire are behind the misleading campaign against Prop. 1, but don\u2019t you buy it.\"\n\nThe mailer doesn\u2019t say how opponents have been \"misleading.\" Setting aside that characterization, we wondered if Doggett was right about the Austin Tea Party and a conservative millionaire leading the \"no\" campaign.\n\nAn Oct. 8, 2014, Austin American-Statesman on spending by forces for or against the proposal didn\u2019t mention tea-party groups while identifying Citizens Against Rail Taxes as the major group working against approval and briefly mentioning Our Rail, which the story described as opposing the proposal and preferring a different rail route. According to the story, Citizens Against Rail Taxes had raised nearly $279,000 through late September 2014 from 13 donors including the retired high-tech executive serving as the group\u2019s treasurer, Jim Skaggs, who the story personally credited with giving $50,000. Our Rail had raised $760, the story said\n\nDoggett, asked the basis of his claim, told us via spokeswoman Leslie Tisdale that Skaggs has supported \"ultra-conservatives\" like Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and state Sen. Donna Campbell of New Braunfels. \"Surely,\" Doggett also said by email, \"the Austin Tea Party doesn\u2019t deny its active opposition to Prop. 1.\"\n\nLynda Rife, campaign manager for Let\u2019s Go Austin, separately confirmed by email Doggett was referring to the Austin Tea Party, which recommended voters oppose the proposition in an Oct. 19, 2014, , she pointed out. That post said in part: \"This is just another boondoggle thought up by our current corrupt and mismanaged city council.\"\n\nBefore that, Rife noted, Americans for Prosperity, a national group supportive of tea-party efforts, promoted by the Austin Tea Party. Also, Rife pointed out, the group has posted multiple messages opposing the proposal on its .\n\nRife said the millionaire in the ad is Skaggs, the retired CEO and board chair of Tracor Inc.\n\n\"Skaggs,\" Rife asserted, \"has an extensive history of giving to Republican candidates and organizations in both state and federal elections.\"\n\nCampaign finance filings with the City of Austin don\u2019t show any Austin Tea Party expenditures in the run-up to balloting.\n\nBy phone, Dean Wright, the group\u2019s organizer, told us the group hasn\u2019t spent money opposing Prop. 1. Otherwise, Wright said, it\u2019s referred what he estimated to be close to 3,000 individuals in its network to Citizens Against Rail Taxes, which he said has taken \"the leadership position.\" Wright said the Austin Tea Party supports CART\u2019s messaging.\n\nWe saw several anti-rail-proposition messages in the Austin Tea Party\u2019s Twitter posts including a message written Oct. 24, 2014 referring that was linked to its criticisms of Doggett\u2019s pro-proposition message.\n\nBy email, Skaggs confirmed he\u2019s a millionaire. He didn\u2019t commit to membership in any party. \"I frankly do not frequent the political world and do not really know the definition of \u2018conservative,\u2019\" Skaggs wrote. \"I am a common-sense person and dislike some of what all parties do. I was born a Central Texas Democrat.\"\n\nSkaggs said Rife was incorrect about Americans for Prosperity bringing O\u2019Toole to Austin. We reached O\u2019Toole by phone who told us that out of interest in the rail vote, he decided to visit, going on to acquire his own plane ticket. O\u2019Toole, who said he stayed with Skaggs, said Americans for Prosperity sponsored one of his Austin events by reserving the room.\n\nOur search of campaign finance reports filed with the showed totaling over $100,000 to state-level Republican candidates or political groups from 2002 to September 2014; the biggest one was $10,000 given in 2008 to the political arm of the Texas Republican Advisory Council.\n\nSkaggs also has contributed to multiple Republican candidates or groups involved in federal races. In 2013, Skaggs gave donations of $2,600 to U.S. Reps. Michael McCaul and Roger Williams, both R-Austin, according to information drawn from federal campaign finance filings by the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Responsive Politics . In May 2014, the center indicates, Skaggs gave $300 to the Republican National Committee.\n\nOver earlier years, of the center\u2019s database indicates, Skaggs (who lives a few miles from the Texas Capitol in a part of Travis County not in Austin) gave money to Republicans including Cruz ($1,250); Texas U.S. Sen. John Cornyn (more than $4,000); President George W. Bush ($4,000); 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney ($4,000); Sen. John McCain, the party\u2019s 2008 nominee ($2,300); and presidential hopefuls Ron Paul ($1,000) and Herman Cain ($300).\n\nIn the early 1990s, Skaggs contributed to two Democrats, the center's database suggests, then-U.S. Rep. Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma ($500) and then-U.S. Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico ($250).\n\nDoggett said: \"The Austin Tea Party and an ultra-conservative millionaire are behind the\" campaign against the city\u2019s light-rail proposition.\n\nSkaggs seems wealthy, has supported Republican candidates and is treasurer for the major group battling Prop. 1.\n\nThe Austin Tea Party opposes the proposal too. However, the group hasn\u2019t spent a dime on the cause and doesn\u2019t appear to be a major mover in the anti-Prop. 1 campaign.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n\nUPDATED, 2:45 p.m., Oct. 31, 2014: This story was amended to specify that Americans for Prosperity didn't bring O'Toole to Austin, contrary to what a pro-proposition activist said. This change didn't affect our rating of the claim.", "lang": "en"}
