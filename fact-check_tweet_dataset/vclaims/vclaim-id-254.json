However, the earliest Tweet Reuters was able to find with this precise quote, stems from 2009 ( here ). It is unrelated to Trump or Biden and attributes the quote to Ernest Hemingway.\n\nIn two biographies of Ernest Hemingway, his use of this phrase is indeed mentioned, although it is not clear whether Hemingway himself coined the phrase ( here ; here ).\n\nReuters could find no evidence that former vice president Biden has ever used this phrase. On April 15, Politico reported here that Biden said during a virtual town hall on the coronavirus pandemic, \u201c\u2026people are dying, your friends and coworkers are dying, our family members and friends and neighbors are dying, while Trump is having temper tantrums about his authority.\u201d\n\nReuters could not find any evidence that Ocasio-Cortez ever said, \u201cThere are homeless people out there who can\u2019t pay their mortgage.\u201d No record of those words could be found on either of her Twitter accounts ( twitter.com/AOC and twitter.com/RepAOC ) or on ProPublica\u2019s archive of her deleted tweets ( here ).\n\nIn July 2018 she published a tweet reading, \u201cNew York City is experiencing the highest rate of homelessness since the Great Depression. For every 1 person experiencing homelessness here, there are ~3 vacant apartments. Inequality is a crisis, and a bold, 21st-century effort on poverty must advance\u201d ( here ).\n\nIn March, the Reuters Fact Check team reviewed other fabricated quotes from both Cortez and Biden, along with Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas ( here ).\n\nFalse. There is no evidence Joe Biden or Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez ever said either of these quotes.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
