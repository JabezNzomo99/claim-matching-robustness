No, that's not true: the story was made up by a Canadian entertainment website that makes a living by publishing fictional stories often involving weird crimes, bizarre sex acts or strange accidents. It is not real. Despite this the story was copied by several other sites that ignored the fact that the source was a humor/fiction website.\n\nThe story originated from an article (archived here) where it was published by World News Daily Report on July 11, 2017 under the title \"Saudi Prince offers 200 camels to spend a night with Ivanka Trump\". It opened:\n\nPresident Trump's daughter Ivanka continues to attract attention around the world, and a Saudi prince publicly offered her 200 camels to spend one night with him. 31-year old Mohammed bin Salman, whom King Salman has entrusted with the key defense and economic policy portfolios, made his shocking offer during a press conference in Riyadh. Discussing the country's relations with the new American administration, the prince claimed that he had already offered Ivanka Trump 100 camels when she visited the country with her father earlier this year and had decided to double his offer.\n\nIn reality Mohammed bin Salman has been widely reported on as being in favor of modernization when it comes to women's rights in Saudi Arabia:\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a humor website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories.

Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes worldnewsdailyreport.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
