Elizabeth Warren takes it to another level.\n\nAn image of the Massachusetts senator recently appeared on Facebook, and attributes her to the following quote: \"If women need to be raped by Muslims to prove our tolerance, so be it. Then thank goodness for Planned Parenthood.\"\n\nThe words, \"this is why we cannot allow lawmakers like this to be re-elected,\" is also written across the image.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThis quote is flat out fake.\n\nQuote pulled out of thin air\n\nThe faux quote appears to have first surfaced on social media in January 2017.\n\nThere is no source provided with the meme, and we found no record of statements made by the senator that matched or paraphrased the comment.\n\nWe were also unable to locate a single media report on what would have been an extremely newsworthy quote by a U.S. senator.\n\nWarren has been an outspoken advocate for Planned Parenthood and has voiced her support of Syrian refugees resettlement in the United States. The meme appears to have been fabricated to solely spread misinformation and diminish Warren\u2019s credibility.\n\nA meme attempts to link Warren to an offensive quote that said \"If women need to be raped by muslims to prove our tolerance, so be it. Then thank goodness for Planned Parenthood.\"\n\nWarren did not say that and the quote appears to be entirely fabricated. We found no instances of Warren (or anyone else) saying those words.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
