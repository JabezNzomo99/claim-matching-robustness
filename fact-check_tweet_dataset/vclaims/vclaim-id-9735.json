Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s closest friends and aides, on charges of soliciting and accepting more than $300,000 in bribes, the governor was asked whether he felt the federal trial might reflect badly on him. The governor discounted such an assertion as \u201cpolitical garbage,\u201d noting he had not been implicated in any of Mr. Percoco\u2019s schemes, and suggesting that his name \u201cwas never mentioned\u201d during the arduous eight-week trial. That is incorrect. Mr. Cuomo was mentioned: 136 times, to be precise. A search of the trial transcripts shows that the governor\u2019s full name \u2014 Andrew Cuomo \u2014 was spoken repeatedly during testimony, questioning, openings and cross-examination, including 29 times on a single day in February. His family name, including a smattering of mentions of his father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, appear almost 500 times. And mentions of the governor \u2014 his office, his staff, his campaign, his reputation \u2014 were even more common, topping 1,500 occasions. In his first public remarks after the verdict, Mr. Cuomo responded on Wednesday to a question about how it affects his political fortunes, which may include presidential ambitions, by saying reporters who covered the trial could attest that \u201cthe governor\u2019s involvement was never mentioned, his name was never mentioned.\u201d\n\nBut as Mr. Cuomo returns to Albany this week for budget negotiations, he will nonetheless face lingering questions about his former aide as well as the omnipresent issue of ethics in the State Capitol. That scrutiny will only intensify as two former top legislative leaders, Sheldon N. Silver and Dean G. Skelos, are retried in the coming months on corruption charges, and another former state official and friend of the governor\u2019s, Alain E. Kaloyeros, is tried in June in a different bribery scheme.\n\nLike myriad graft cases before it, the Percoco verdict has led to calls for reforms from government watchdogs. Shortly after Tuesday\u2019s verdict, nine such groups called for a state constitutional amendment to create an independent ethics enforcement agency to fight Albany\u2019s \u201cpay-to-play culture.\u201d (Both companies accused of bribing Mr. Percoco had donated legally to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaigns.) Republican opponents of the governor have also piled on, calling on the state attorney general and the Manhattan district attorney to investigate. For all of that clamor, it seems that there is little legislative ardor to pass new ethics laws in Albany. A budget plan unveiled last week by the Republicans who rule the Senate, for instance, makes no mention of ethics. In the Assembly, where the Democratic majority typically has more appetite for such legislation, even the chamber\u2019s speaker seemed wary of conflating Mr. Percoco\u2019s behavior with others. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of people who take on the job of being in public service do the right thing,\u201d said Carl E. Heastie, a Bronx Democrat who is the Assembly\u2019s speaker. He questioned what state laws might be drafted to prevent corruption. \u201cWhat\u2019s the legislative remedy for something that a jury has decided is against the law?\u201d he said. Mr. Cuomo said on Wednesday that he believed the Legislature was to blame for not banning outside income for lawmakers, a thorny and much-debated issue that was not part of the Percoco trial. \u201cThat\u2019s the reform that I\u2019ve been pushing and I\u2019m going to continue to push,\u201d he said, adding he would make it a campaign issue in the fall. (Republicans in the State Senate, whom Mr. Cuomo has worked with in the past, have opposed such limits on income.) While Mr. Cuomo dismissed the actions of Mr. Percoco as a \u201ctotal aberration,\u201d editorial boards around the state have said that more must be done, including the governor\u2019s response.\n\n \u201cGov. Andrew Cuomo takes personal credit for every action of state government, projecting an image of a man in charge and burnishing his credentials to be president,\u201d The Post-Standard of Syracuse wrote. \u201cHe ought to take personal responsibility for the corruption in his own executive chamber.\u201d\n\nMr. Cuomo has not faced the Capitol press corps since the verdict \u2014 he left an event in Albany without taking questions on Tuesday, just before the verdict was announced. But questions persist, including why Mr. Percoco was allowed to come and go from the governor\u2019s executive offices in 2014 while serving as his campaign manager, a possible violation of laws against use of taxpayer-funded resources on campaigns. (Records show that Mr. Cuomo was often there at the same time.)", "lang": "en"}
