All the players used to kneel for the National Anthem. Now do you understand the ignorance of the current administration and his minions?\"\n\nThe Facebook page\u2019s caption for the post, \"White History 101,\" seems to suggest that the practice only became a problem when Kaepernick, a black player, started to do it.\n\nThe image has been shared over 10,000 times and was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe photo is authentic, but it has nothing to do with protesting and was taken long after the national anthem played. We also checked a number of stories about the national anthem protests and couldn\u2019t find evidence that it was common for players to kneel prior to Kaepernick introducing the practice in 2016.\n\nA reverse-image search led us to the \"Lively Morgue\" Tumblr page, a blog set up by the New York Times to showcase photographs from the newspaper\u2019s archives.\n\nThe picture of Namath was taken by sports photographer Barton Silverman when the New York Jets played the New England Patriots on Nov. 11, 1973. Here\u2019s the caption:\n\nNov. 11, 1973: \"Joe Namath, in furs, and Al Woodall, who came out of yesterday\u2019s game with an injured elbow.\" Namath stood on the sidelines as his team played, a shoulder injury keeping him out of uniform. The Jets won the game without him.\n\nA recap published the next day said that Woodall came out of the game after straining a tendon in his right elbow early in the second quarter.\n\nThe Lively Morgue also provided a shot of the back of the photo, which was covered in clippings, stamps and notes. Though partially concealed, the original caption says the photo was taken in the third quarter, long after the national anthem would have played.\n\nNamath did appear on multiple Fox News shows in recent years and showed support for players\u2019 decision to protest, but has also said the flag needs to be respected, too.\n\nA post sharing a photo of Joe Namath claims he was kneeling during the national anthem and it was something \"all players\" used to do.\n\nThe photo is legitimate, but it was taken sometime during the third quarter after Namath\u2019s teammate, Al Woodall, left the game due to an injury. We also found no evidence that it was regular practice for players to take a knee during the anthem.\n\nIt was not a form of protest and was not during the national anthem.", "lang": "en"}
