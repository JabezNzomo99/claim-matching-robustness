The website is managed by the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Responsive Politics.\n\n \n\n The latest data on the Securities & Investment industry includes figures released by the Federal Election Commission on June 4 -- two days before Kyrillos\u2019 interview. The donations tallied on the website represent contributions of $200 or more from employees and political action committees within the industry.\n\n \n\n According to that data, Menendez has received nearly $1.4 million from the industry between 1989 and 2012. Menendez served as a congressman for 13 years before joining the Senate in 2006.\n\n \n\n That amount puts Menendez in 15th place among the nation\u2019s 100 Senators for such donations, according to data on OpenSecrets.org. The 14 Senators with greater donations than Menendez include six Democrats, seven Republicans and one Independent.\n\n \n\n The leading recipient is former presidential candidate and U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona), who has received about $11.2 million from the Securities & Investment industry.\n\n \n\n In a statement, Menendez\u2019s campaign manager, Michael Soliman, pointed to the senator\u2019s \"long-standing record of championing common sense reforms that have sided with consumers over banks.\"\n\n \n\n \"This silly partisan gotcha attack is absurd - by Joe Kyrlllos\u2019s own standard John McCain, Mark Kirk, Scott Brown and Mitch McConnell - four Republican senator's - are the real Kings of Raising Money from Wall Street,\" Soliman added, referring to other senators who have raised more money from the industry than Menendez.\n\n \n\n As for Kyrillos, he has received his share of such donations as well.\n\n \n\n According to OpenSecrets.org, Kyrillos has received nearly $60,000 from the Securities & Investment industry for his current campaign.\n\n \n\n Chapin Fay, Kyrillos\u2019 campaign manager, responded to our findings in a statement: \"You seem to be on a search to find anyway to find our statements not accurate and are missing the main point Senator Kyrillos made\u2014Bob Menendez was cited as a top recipient of Wall Street money and Joe Kyrillos was not.\"\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n As the battle heats up for a U.S. Senate seat, Kyrillos claimed Menendez is \"the king of raising money from Wall Street, over a million dollars, one of the leaders in the United States Senate. I haven\u2019t raised any Wall Street money at all.\"\n\n \n\n Data on OpenSecrets.org shows that Menendez has received nearly $1.4 million from the Securities & Investment industry, putting him in 15th place among sitting Senators for such donations. That ranking means Menendez is one of the leading recipients, but it\u2019s an exaggeration to call him \"the king of raising money from Wall Street.\"\n\n \n\n Also, Kyrillos is wrong about his own fundraising, because he\u2019s received nearly $60,000 from the industry for his current campaign, according to OpenSecrets.org.\n\n \n\n We rate the statement Mostly False.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "lang": "en"}
