We recognize that politicians sometimes make a sincere evolution on a policy stance, especially as new facts emerge or as the constituency that elected them to office forms a new opinion on an issue. But it\u2019s important to acknowledge that this is a shift \u2014 which Trump never does.\n\nDuring the campaign, The Fact Checker had long discussions with the Trump campaign about the candidate\u2019s use of a very striking statistic \u2014 that 58 percent of African-American youth was unemployed. The official Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment rate for black youth at the time was 19.2 percent \u2014 about one-third of the rate used by Trump.\n\nHow did Trump get his figure? He was counting students who are not looking for work as a part of the \u201cunemployed\u201d population. Technically, those students don\u2019t have jobs. But that does not fit the definition of \u201cunemployed\u201d and is especially problematic for this age group, because the number of people who aren\u2019t looking for jobs includes people who are in school full time.\n\nFor instance, Trump was counting as \u201cunemployed\u201d 16-year-old high school sophomores, who were going to school full time and engaged in extracurricular activities when not in school \u2014 and who were not looking for jobs. The methodology \u2014 counting people as unemployed when they were not looking for jobs \u2014 just seemed absurd.\n\nThe Trump campaign was very defensive about the figure, insisting it was much more accurate than the official unemployment rate. We, however, ended up giving Four Pinocchios for the claim.\n\nNow that he\u2019s president, Trump appears all too happy to cite the unemployment rate for African Americans, bragging that it\u2019s the best since the turn of the century. The rate in June was 7.1 percent, the lowest since it hit 7 percent in April 2000 under President Bill Clinton, according to BLS.\n\nWe\u2019re pleased the president is now using accurate statistics but it\u2019s absurd to suggest, as he did to the audience in Youngstown, that he had anything to do with these numbers. There\u2019s only employment data for the first five months of his presidency \u2014 and the chart below demonstrates that the African American unemployment rate has been on a relatively steady decline since it hit a peak of 16.8 percent in March, 2010, during the Great Recession. The rate had already fallen to 7.7 percent when Trump took the oath of office, so Trump taking credit for this is like a rooster thinking the sun came up because he crowed.\n\nWe\u2019d be more inclined to accept that Trump was just engaging in campaign rhetoric, if not for his campaign\u2019s insistence at the time that simply using unemployment figures did not tell the whole story. It\u2019s all too convenient for Trump to embrace accurate statistics when they look good for him. For such a cynical flip-flop, we wish we could award the president a Super Upside-Down Pinocchio.", "lang": "en"}
