From Congress president Rahul Gandhi\u2019s Kailash Mansarovar yatra to PM Narendra Modi\u2019s outreach to the Bohra community, each of these occasions became fodder for those seeking to spread falsehood, apart from the usual tactics which routinely play out on social media.\n\nIt was alleged that Gandhi has used stock photographs from Google Images and passed them off ones taken him during his yatra.On September 5, 2018, Rahul Gandhi tweeted two pictures of Lake Rakshastal stating, \u201cThe stunning beauty of lake Rakshas Tal. KailashYatra.\u201d\n\nThe image that could be seen on Google image search and claimed to be a generic image by multiple accounts was actually an image from Rahul Gandhi\u2019s instagram feed which had been indexed by the Justdial account and which in turn showed up on Google images.\n\n(Found this video with great difficulty, it\u2019s a 1998 interview in which sir himself is saying that I have studied till high school. But now sir has a graduation degree attained in 1979 -translated)\u201d tweeted Divya Spandana, social media head of Congress party, with an old clipped interview of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The video was viewed more than 53,000 times from her tweet.\n\nSpandana shared the clipped video, six months after Alt News found that it was cropped to suggest that PM himself claimed to have studied till high school. It has been circulating on social media for at least three years now and we found an instance of the clipped video dating back to November 2015. In the longer version of the same video, Modi goes on to say that he did his BA and MA through external examination. Spandana acknowledged her error.\n\nA picture of a newspaper clip was shared widely on social media, according to which former Congress president Sonia Gandhi is the \u2018fourth richest in the world\u2019. Affixed to the clip is a caption that poses the question \u2013 \u201c\u0905\u092e\u094d\u092c\u093e\u0928\u0940 \u0905\u0926\u093e\u0928\u0940 \u0928\u0947 \u0932\u093e\u0916\u094b\u0902 \u0932\u094b\u0917\u094b \u0915\u094b \u0930\u094b\u091c\u0917\u093e\u0930 \u0926\u093f\u090f \u0915\u093e\u0930\u0916\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0916\u094b\u0932\u0947 \u0924\u092c \u0905\u092e\u0940\u0930 \u092c\u0928\u0947. \u092a\u0930 \u0938\u094b\u0928\u093f\u0906 \u0917\u093e\u0901\u0927\u0940 \u0915\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u0905\u092e\u0940\u0930 \u092c\u093e\u0928\u0940? (Ambani Adani became rich after giving jobs to lakhs of people and opening factories. But how did Sonia Gandhi manage to become rich?)\u201d\n\nThe rumours viral on social media were based on a six-year-old misreport that was circulated as a recent event. There is no conclusive evidence or data that proves Sonia Gandhi\u2019s net worth is between US$ 2 billion to 19 billion as claimed by these posts. A video clip of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was circulated on social media in which he was seen addressing an audience in a speech purportedly made at the Krupp factory at Essen in Germany in 1936. The video is laced with subtitles according to which Hitler is saying, \u201cI left everything for serving my nation. I am not here for any positions but for a responsibility. I have the responsibility for every actions taken for the future of our country. Burn me alive if I am wrong, not afraid of anyone\u201d. post-demonetisation speechThe clip sought to draw parallels with PM Modi\u2019s of November 2016. Alt News fact checked this claim floating on social media and found a longer version of Adolf Hitler\u2019s speech on YouTube. While the speech is indeed of Essen in 1936, the subtitles accompanying the viral video in which Hitler claimed \u201cBurn me alive if I am wrong\u201d are mischievous and false. 5. Misinformation in BJP\u2019s video on Rahul Gandhi and China Rahul Gandhi and China: Addiction, obsession or something else? was the title of a video that was posted by the official Twitter account of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on August 31, 2018. The first image that has been used in the video shows the Congress president along with Robert Vadra and Priyanka Vadra posing for a photograph with the Chinese ambassador to India. The photograph had been used to insinuate that Rahul Gandhi had secretly met the Chinese envoy at a time when Indian and Chinese troops were locked in a tense stand-off at Doklam in 2017. Rahul Gandhi and China : Addiction, obsession or something else? pic.twitter.com/tXDe2i8Ch2 Alt News had found that this photograph of Rahul Gandhi with the Chinese envoy had been available on the website of the Chinese embassy since April 2017 when Gandhi along with leaders from BJP, JDU and CPI had attended a Chinese food festival. The same photo had earlier been used by Republic TV and Times Now to target Gandhi.\n\n\u201c\u091c\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0939\u0947 \u0925\u093e \u0907\u0902\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u092d\u0940 \u091f\u094b\u092a\u0940 \u0938\u0947 \u0915\u093f\u0938\u0940 \u0926\u094c\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902\u0964 \u092e\u0938\u094d\u091c\u093f\u0926 \u0915\u0947 \u0905\u0902\u0926\u0930 \u0928\u091c\u0930 \u0906\u092f\u0947 \u0935\u094b \u0938\u093e\u0939\u0947\u092c \u0907\u0902\u0926\u094c\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902\u0964\u201d(Someone who had an issue with (skull)cap was seen inside a mosque in Indore -translated). Jignesh Mevani, an independent MLA from Gujarat, had tweeted an image of PM Narendra Modi wearing a skull cap on September 16, 2018 along with the aforementioned text.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi was in Indore on Friday to attend Ashara Mubaraka, an event to commemorate the death anniversary of Prophet Mohammed\u2019s grandson Imam Hussain. Mewani later deleted the tweet as it turned out that the image was photoshopped.\n\n\u201cPetrol-diesel prices have risen a little and all opposition parties are protesting. Rohingyas have increased to 11 crores but everyone is quiet,\u201d reads a post shared by Facebook page I Support NarendraModi. It was shared over 21,000 times. Another slightly altered post read, \u201cThe price of Diesel Petrol increased by Rs 5 and you declared Bharat bandh. But are those 8 crore Bangladeshi and Rohingyas your family members that you support them? Hypocritical congressis.\u201d\n\nThese claims are patently false. There are neither 11 crore Rohingya refugees in India nor 8 crore Bangladeshi immigrants, and these posts were put up and shared mainly to create a fear psychosis and hatred for immigrants.\n\n2. Accident during Muharram portrayed as Muslim attack on Hindu boy\n\nA claim about a Hindu boy\u2019s throat being slit by a sword during a Muharram procession in Gauri Bazar area of Deoria district in Uttar Pradesh was circulated on social media. \u201cIn Deoria\u2019s Gauri Bazaar, Islamic terrorists in a Muharram procession slit Hindu boy Vishal Ojha\u2019s throat. The question is why havent the Islamic terrorists been arrested yet? (translation)\u201d tweeted a social media user on September 21, 2018. Along with the message, he had tweeted a video of a boy bleeding profusely. The video was originally posted by Breaking Tube, a twitter handle.\n\nThe boy was injured not due to a sword attack but after a tubelight had burst on him during a Muharram procession. This was confirmed to Alt News by U.P police. The incident had also been misreported by some news organisations.\n\n3. False claim of Naga sadhu thrashed by Muslims in Uttarakhand\n\nA twitter handle @Imamofpeace tweeted in the morning of September 2, \u201cIslamic Extremists in India beating up a poor and elderly Indian beggar. I truly wish this Islamist criminal is arrested soon. @narendramodi.\u201d A video attached with this tweet showed a youth beating up an elderly man.\n\nAlt News contacted the SHO of Patel Nagar, Dehradun who told us that the incident was being circulated with a false narrative on social media. \u201cThe man who was beaten up is not a Naga Sadhu, but a beggar. He is married and has six children. He went to a house to beg for food and molested the woman who brought him tea and biscuits.\u201dThe SHO further said that he was beaten up by the woman\u2019s brother, who was not Muslim but belonged to a Hindu family.\n\n1. Fake quote of Arvind Kejriwal on Kashmir\n\nOn social media, numerous pages and accounts had posted an image of which looked like a cropped article from a Hindi e-paper clip. The article\u2019s title was a quote ascribed to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal \u2013\u201cIndia should concede its right on Kashmir as Kashmiris want independence.\u201d The post was shared nearly 5,000 times.\n\nAlt News fact checked this alleged statement and found that it is a fake e-paper clip which has been circulating on the internet since 2014.\n\nA quote attributed to Indian Army chief General Bipin Rawat was shared by a Facebook page I Support Dovalwhich has a massive follower base of over 1.7 million. The text inscribed along with an image of Rawat stated, \u201cArmy chief Bipin Rawat said that to become a leader, it should be made mandatory to serve the country in the army for 5 years. Believe it or not, 80 % of India\u2019s garbage will be cleared automatically. How many people agree with his statement. Share this, if you do -translated\u201d.\n\nThe above image had been shared in the past as well and in response to this, Indian army had clarified through their social media channels on September 11, 2018, that the statement being circulated was false. The clarification was published on the official Facebook page and the Twitter handle of the Indian Army.\n\nA tweet by an account @HAL_India was shared widely on social media. This tweet responded to Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman\u2019s recent statement that the deal for the procurement of 126 Rafale combat aircraft which was sought under the UPA regime fell through because Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) did not have the required capability to produce them.\n\nAs it turned out, social media users fell for what was an unofficial account of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), although this fact was clarified in the Bio section of the account itself. Moreover, HAL had tweeted that the account HAL_India \u2018impersonates\u2019 the official handle and that a formal complaint has been lodged with Twitter regarding the same. To this tweet, Hal_India replied, clarifying that it is not the official account of HAL.\n\n\u201cShocking list. One Indian political party included\u201d tweeted former Infosys director Mohandas Pai while sharing an article listing the ten most corrupt political parties in the world in 2018. The list was published in July 2018 and featured the Indian National Congress among other parties from different parts of the world. According to this list, INC ranks 2nd among the most corrupt political parties of the world.\n\nMohandas Pai had tweeted an article from a website masquerading as the website of BBC News. Alt News found that the website, the link to which was tweeted by Pai, was dubious and had routinely published such fake \u2018lists\u2019 about politicians and political parties.\n\n\u201cWhatever happened between me and nun, it is not rape. It is the Holi Ritual of enlightenment to feel the Magical Existence of Holi Jesus at the end of the act\u201d. Madhu Kishwar tweeted an image comprising of the aforementioned text along an image of rape accused Bishop Franco Mulakkal. The image also has the logo of ANI.\n\nAlt News did a Twitter search using the keywords, \u201cHoli Ritual of enlightenment\u201d and found the original source of this information. Unpaid Timeswas the first to tweet the screenshot of the claim and attributed to the Bishop. The Twitter biography of Unpaid Times clearly states that it is an \u201cIndian Satirical News Website\u201d. However, as it happens every so often, many people fell for such satire and circulated the information believing it to be true.\n\nThere are a few other prominent instances of misinformation in September apart from those represented so far in the article.\n\n1. False claim on Nehru thrashed by mob after 1962 war\n\nRecently, an image of Jawaharlal Nehru was shared by a few users on social media, suggesting that the first Prime Minister of India was thrashed by a mob after \u201cfailure on China war\u201d in 1962. Alt News found that this image had been shared on social media over the past few years.\n\nAlt News fact-checked this claim and found that while the photograph indeed was of 1962, it was taken before the war and thus, was not related to the debacle of 1962.\n\nHamid Mir, a prominent Pakistani journalist and news anchor has shared a gruesome video of a Kashmiri being purportedly tortured in India. He tweeted, \u201cLook at this torture in Kashmir and see who is making this torture?One can understand that why India is not ready for talks with Pakistan?Yes Pakistan will definitely ask about this torture.\u201d Hamid Mir\u2019s tweet was shared widely.\n\nAlt News\u2019 fact-check found that this claim is false, and the video is not of the Indian army torturing a Kashmiri as claimed. In fact, the video pertained to training of Pakistani army commandos.", "lang": "en"}
