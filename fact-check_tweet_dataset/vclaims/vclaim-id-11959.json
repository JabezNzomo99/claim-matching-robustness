Dialling 55 after you call 999 doesn\u2019t mean your location can be automatically traced, especially if you are using a mobile phone.\n\nThe National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council told us that if you can\u2019t speak when you call 999, you should be asked to dial 55 if you want to be put through to the police. However, they won\u2019t necessarily be able to track exactly where you are calling from.\n\nIf a 999 caller doesn\u2019t speak, they will be asked to dial 55 to be put through to the police\n\nWe asked the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), which deals with police matters across the UK\u2019s police forces, and it told us that when someone calls 999 and doesn\u2019t speak, the BT operators who initially pick up \u201cwill try to establish if the call received is genuine by asking questions\u201d.\n\nIt told us that if no one speaks, but the operator hears \u201csuspicious noises or a disturbance\u201d, the call will be forwarded to the police, who will establish if officers are required.\n\nBut if no noise is heard, the BT operator will forward the call to an automated service that will ask the caller to dial 55 which will also route the call to the police. This service is called \u2018Silent Solutions\u2019 and has been in use since 2001. Then police call handlers will try and establish if there\u2019s an emergency by asking questions that can be answered by tapping the handset, or with yes or no responses.\n\nThe NPCC told us that dialling 55 at any point in the call (even before prompted) is likely to alert the operator that the caller needs to be put through to the police, as would doing something like tapping the handset to make a noise.\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that typing 55 will get a caller\u2019s location tracked\n\nOn location tracking, the NPCC told us that calls from landlines can be linked to an address, but calls from mobile phones will only show a general location at the time of the call. The NPCC told us that the police \u201ccan\u2019t get exact locations from mobile phone calls because of things like tower blocks or densely populated areas\u201d.\n\nIt added that the police don\u2019t always send officers to silent calls \u201cso it is important for callers to try and provide as much information as they can\u2014in any way they can\u201d. Police will use other information, such as previous calls, to inform their decision on whether to send officers.\n\nIt\u2019s an \u2018urban myth\u2019 that silent calls will always get a response\n\nIn 2014, Karen Catherall was murdered by a man she had met on a dating site. A silent 999 call lasting 12 seconds was made from her mobile the night she was attacked, but the call wasn\u2019t forwarded to any emergency service.\n\nA report into her death published in 2018 said that it was an \u201curban myth\u201d that silent 999 calls always produce an emergency response. The report added that \u201cThe volume of silent calls... means that any plan to trace them is not sustainable within the resources likely to be needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other point to make is that whereas a landline can be traced to an address, a mobile would only be traceable to an area covered by a mobile phone...for safety\u2019s sake it is important that the message is given nationally that silent 999 calls, especially from mobiles, are not guaranteed to bring help.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
