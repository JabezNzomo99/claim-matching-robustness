No, that's not true: Oregon voters received the non-partisan ballots because they never took the second step of declaring a party affiliation, a spokeswoman for the Oregon secretary of state told Lead Stories. The procedure would affect Democrats, as well as Republicans.\n\nThe claim originated as individual complaints on social media that were then reported in an article (archived here) by BluntForceTruth.com on May 19, 2020 under the title \"HUGE SCANDAL: Oregon Changes Hundreds Of Republican Ballots To 'Non Partisan' Denying GOP Voters the Right To Participate In Primary.\" It opened:\n\nDisturbing news is coming out of Oregon, as hundreds of people are reporting that their voter registration was switched from Republican to non affiliated without their knowledge or permission.\n\nOregon is entirely vote-by-mail, and ballots were sent out in the last week of April, and due this Tuesday at 8:00 PM. Many were shocked to open their ballot to find that they were no longer with the party they thought they were with, and they received non partisan ballots. As Oregon is a closed primary state, this effectively denies these people the right to vote in the party's primary that they thought they were registered as.\n\nThis is only reportedly happening to folks who were registered as Republican.\n\nThe story went viral after an article cited a group of people on Facebook claiming they did not receive a Republican ballot to vote in the May 19, 2020, primary and instead were given \"non-partisan\" ballots against their wishes. The Oregon secretary of state denied changing citizens' party registration and told LeadStories.com that the claims that their party affiliation was changed against their wishes is \"misinformation.\"\n\nThe BluntforceTruth.com article came from information published by The Gateway Pundit on May 18, the day before the primary, which shared details about the Facebook posts.\n\nMy Party Was Changed is the Facebook page with multiple examples of people claiming that their registration was Republican, but they received ballots with only \"non-partisan\" voting options, not allowing them to vote in the Republican primary.\n\nThe description of the group includes:\n\nThe group was created on May 8, 2020, and claims over 1,100 members.\n\nOregon is a closed-primary state and voters must be registered with a party to vote in that party's primary race. Each party chooses if those registered as non-partisan can cast ballots in their primaries.\n\nOregon secretary of state spokeswoman Andrea Chiapella denied that there was any malfeasance with regard to party registration being changed:\n\nChiapella said her office received questions about the claims:\n\nShe explained the process of voter registration in Oregon:\n\nChiapella said it was not just Republicans complaining:\n\nOne Facebook commenter said they reached out to the Jackson County clerk of court. Jackson County clerk of court Chris Walker told Lead Stories her office had \"lots of phone calls,\" from people complaining about their ballots, but there were only two instances in their county where there was an internal mistake because of an error in an address. She said she did not see \"anything that looked unusual.\"\n\nWalker said the issue arises during primary elections. The secretary of state office handles the claims of party change, not the counties, since people registered though the Department of Motor Vehicles when they get their driver licenses. Walker told Lead Stories there were \"no actual cases that we had in this county of this happening.\"\n\nGateway Pundit noted that the \"confusion\" in the situation may lie with the way the DMV registers voters.\n\nAccording to the secretary of state's website, the voter registration law changed in January 2016 and the new system is explained here:\n\nThere is a second step that needs to be taken to be registered to vote in a specific party, according to the secretary of state's website:\n\nSimilar confusion over party affiliations happened ahead of California's primary when ballots were mailed last January.
