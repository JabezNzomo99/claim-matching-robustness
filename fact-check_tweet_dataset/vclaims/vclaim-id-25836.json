The think-tank, based in Canada, promotes human development and environmental sustainability.\n\nThe report says there are 500,000 small-scale miners in Nigeria, who support another 2.5 million people.\n\nBut how many people do small-scale miners support?\n\nAfrica Check traced the original source of the claim to the\n\nThe initiative\u2019s records are kept on the website\n\nhosts copies of CASM reports as well as an inventory placing the number of small scale miners in Nigeria\n\nDr Felix Hruschka, a mineral economist who runs the website, told Africa Check his methodology included \u201ctriangulation of legacy data, empirical statistics on the gold price and unstructured interviews\u201d.\n\nIt also \u201cdraws on informal conversations with various Nigerian mining professionals\u201d from when he visited Nigeria in March 2018.

He had found this ratio of one miner to five dependants to be true on the ground for most local miners in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBased on this rule of thumb, I would consider 5 million a reasonable guess for dependants on artisanal mining activities in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u2018No way of verifying the data\u2019\n\n\u2019s business school told Africa Check that nobody knew for sure how many small-scale miners there were in Nigeria.

These include artisanal and small-scale miners registered with the ministry through cooperatives, but excludes unregistered artisanal miners.\n\nThe mineral extracted the most was granite (38%), followed by limestone (31%) and laterite (8%), which is used for road construction.\n\nSmall-scale miners go for gems and precious metals\n\nin Ibadan told Africa Check that in his experience in the field, small-scale miners don\u2019t extract granite and limestone, but rather mine for precious metals and gemstones with hoes and diggers.\n\nCompanies who received licences to mine limestone in 2015 included cement manufacturing giants such as\n\nThe solid minerals produced in the largest quantities in Nigeria are mined by large companies, while the minerals dug out by small-scale miners don\u2019t even feature in the top 10.\n\nWe therefore rate the claim that artisanal and small-scale miners are responsible for 90% of Nigeria\u2019s mineral production as incorrect.", "lang": "en"}
