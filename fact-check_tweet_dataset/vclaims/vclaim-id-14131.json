The claim is false; the political parties and the ACTU have not signed any agreement on inheritance tax.\n\nThis post about the claimed \u201cagreement\u201d has been shared dozens of times since it was uploaded to Facebook on April 19, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Facebook post:\n\nThe same claim has been circulating on various social platforms, such as here and here on Facebook, and here and here on Twitter, ahead of Australia\u2019s federal election on May 18, 2019.\n\nThere has been no public agreement and the official tax policies of the two political parties show there is no such deal.\n\nA statement posted to Labor\u2019s official website here specifically denies the claim. The statement reads, in part: \u201cLabor has no policy or secret deal to introduce an inheritance tax\u2026 This fake news is completely without merit and just a desperate and pathetic lie\u201d.\n\nLabor Shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen tweeted on April 20 that the accusation is a \u201ccomplete fabrication\u201d.\n\nHere is the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand summary of Labor\u2019s tax policies ahead of the election. It makes no mention of a 40-percent inheritance tax.\n\nAFP contacted the ACTU\u2019s media office for its position. It sent the following emailed statement: \u201cThe ACTU supports the tax policies of the ALP. These do not include a \u2018death tax.\u2019\u201d\n\nALP is a reference to the Australian Labor Party.\n\nThe Greens\u2019 tax policies are available on its website here under the \u201cEconomic Justice\u201d section. The policies show there is no agreement with Labor on an inheritance tax.\n\nThis Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand summary of the Greens\u2019 tax policies ahead of the election does not mention a 40-percent inheritance tax.\n\nIn response to the spread of the claim on social media, Labor contacted Facebook requesting that the social media company remove posts about the false inheritance tax plan, AAP and SBS reported here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the news report:\n\nThe misleading Facebook post referenced at the top this fact-check, and multiple others, for example here and here, link to a media release posted to the official website of Treasurer and Liberal deputy leader Josh Frydenberg here on January 24, 2019.\n\nFrydenberg wrote that Shorten had in the past expressed wishes to \u201cintroduce death taxes\u201d. He also cited Labor Shadow Assistant Treasurer Andrew Leigh\u2019s March 7, 2016, article, in which Leigh said: \u201can inheritance tax would be an efficient way of raising revenues\u201d.\n\nBut the treasurer did not state in the press release that Labor had signed any deals, or that it had any plans to introduce an inheritance tax.", "lang": "en"}
