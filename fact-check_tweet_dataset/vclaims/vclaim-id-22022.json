Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of this post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Photo of Cobra flower which blooms once in every 36 years. Fact: The picture in the post is not even a flower. It\u2019s a creature at the bottom of the sea, which is called as \u2018Sea pen\u2019. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image in the post was searched using Google reverse image technique, a post published by \u2018Journal of Environmental & Agricultural Sciences \u2013 JEAS\u2019 in 2016 on their Facebook page was obtained. The post clearly mentions that the picture is not of a \u2018Snake flower\u2019 (Naga pushpam) which blooms in the Himalayas once in every 36 years, as being shared virally, but is a creature called as \u2018Sea Pen\u2019. It also states that this creature is found at the bottom of the sea. More information about \u2018Sea Pens\u2019 can be found here.\n\nIt can be observed that the organizations such as Snopes and AFP-Factcheck have already written that the image in the post is not \u2018Snake flower\u2019 (Naga pushpam). According to the Snopes article Gordon J. Bowbrick has captured this photo in the year 2013 and it is understood that he also captioned the picture as \u2018Sea Feather\u2019. Also, even in Indonesia the same photo went viral with the claim \u2018Once in 33 years \u2018Megapuspa\u2019 flower blooms in Jawajiya mountains\u2019 according to the article of \u2018Pusat Informasi Anti Hoax\u2019.\n\nFinally, a sea creature (\u2018Sea Pen\u2019) photo is shared as that of a \u201cCobra flower\u201d which blooms once in every 36 years.", "lang": "en"}
