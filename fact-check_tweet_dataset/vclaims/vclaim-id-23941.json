No, that's not true: The photo used in social media posts shows Obama on a small boat with billionaire Richard Branson, not Epstein. The implication that the image connects Obama to Epstein's alleged child sex trafficking ring is false.\n\nThe claim originated in a tweet (archived here) posted on July 14, 2019 . It read:\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nThe tweet was also shared on Facebook:\n\nThe 2019 federal arrest of Jeffrey Epstein, who was friendly with Bill Clinton and Donald Trump before a 2005 sex trafficking investigation became public, has provided fodder for more than a few fake claims in recent weeks. This one is a weak attempt to link former President Barack Obama to the Epstein scandal. The major problem is that the photo shows Obama playing around on the water with Richard Branson while taking a much-anticipated vacation after leaving the White House in 2017. Here is a CNN report at the time:\n\nObama enjoyed kite surfing and other water fun while being hosted by Branson in the British Virgin Islands. There is no evidence that Obama ever met Epstein, much less covorted with him on his infamous private island in the Caribbean.\n\nThis Twitter account plays on Q Anon, which is a conspiracy movement that promotes the idea of Deep State that is plotting against President Trump.", "lang": "en"}
