That means how many people choose to participate in the work force. In other words, the agency is examining whether the law increases or decreases incentives for people to work.\n\n\u201cThe estimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply, rather than from a net drop in businesses\u2019 demand for labor, so it will appear almost entirely as a reduction in labor force participation and in hours worked relative to what would have occurred otherwise rather than as an increase in unemployment (that is, more workers seeking but not finding jobs) or underemployment (such as part-time workers who would prefer to work more hours per week).\u201d\n\nThe reason that we don\u2019t use the term \u201clost jobs\u201d is there\u2019s a critical difference between people who like to work and can\u2019t find a job or have a job that was lost for reasons beyond their control and people who choose not to work. If somebody comes up to you and says, \u201cWell, the boss said I\u2019m being laid off because we don\u2019t have enough business to pay me,\u201d that person feels bad about that and we sympathize with them having lost their job. If somebody comes to you and says, \u201cI\u2019ve decided to retire\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ve decided to stay home and spend more time with my family\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve decided to spend more time doing my hobby,\u201d they don\u2019t feel bad about it, they feel good about it, and we don\u2019t sympathize. We say congratulations. And we don\u2019t say they\u2019ve lost their job because they have chosen to leave that job.\n\nStill, fans of the Affordable Care Act should not jump to the conclusion that departing workers will be simply replaced by other workers. Assuming a \u201cnormal\u201d unemployment rate of 5 percent, employers\u2019 demand for jobs would equal 95 percent of the supply of workers. Fewer workers initially would lead to higher wages as employers competed to hire people. But over time, the nation ends up with a slightly smaller economy because of the smaller workforce.\n\nTillis at least recognized that this is an \u201cequivalent\u201d number. But the CBO\u2019s figures represent a combination of two conclusions: fewer people looking for work and some people choosing to work fewer hours. The CBO added those two things and produced a hard number, but it actually does not mean 2.3 million fewer workers, just the \u201cequivalent\u201d of that many full-time workers choosing not to work.\n\nUltimately, some jobs will go away, but the actual number is unclear because of the unknown interaction between part-time and full-time work. It certainly does not add up to 2.3 million, so the use of the word \u201cjobs\u201d in this context is incorrect.\n\nAs a conservative, Tillis would have had every right to make an argument such as: \u201cObamacare will shrink our economy by driving millions of people to work less, and discouraging some of them from working at all.\u201d That opinion would have been justified by the CBO\u2019s findings.", "lang": "en"}
