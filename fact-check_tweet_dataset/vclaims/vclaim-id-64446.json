Wayfair does not have a president of operations.\n\nThe claim about the photo emerged online after Maxwell, the confidante and ex-girlfriend of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, was arrested in New Hampshire on charges that she allegedly helped Epstein recruit minors to sexually abuse. Epstein died of an apparent suicide in jail while awaiting trial for federal sex trafficking charges in August 2019, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe screen grabbed tweet, which was posted on Facebook, attempts to link Maxwell to the online home goods retailer Wayfair through its alleged president of operations, Bill Hutcherson. False claims that Wayfair is involved in human trafficking have recently circulated on social media, Reuters reported.\n\n\u201cHere we have Ghislaine Maxwell pictured with president of operations at #Wayfair, Bill Hutcherson,\u201d claims the screen grabbed tweet.

The caption reads, \u201cSocialite Ghislaine Maxwell with an unidentified male companion attends the Opening of the Asprey Flagship Store on 5th Avenue December 8, 2003 in New York City.\u201d\n\nThe pictured \u201cunidentified male companion\u201d is Bamford, the owner of a luxury watch customization company, according to The Associated Press. Heavy and Tatler also identified the man as Bamford.\n\nWayfair does not have the president of operations position listed among the executive roles on its website. The two closest roles, chief operating officer and vice president of operations product innovation, are held by Thomas Netzer and Doran Robinson, respectively.\n\n\u201cWe have never had a Bill Hutcherson at Wayfair and we have never had a \u2018President of Operations,'\u201d a Wayfair spokesperson told Reuters.", "lang": "en"}
