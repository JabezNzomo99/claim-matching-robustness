No, that's not true: the protest are real but the \"news\" about the army intervention came from a new site associated with a Belgian satire website. It is not true.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by a site named Conbini on November 14, 2018 titled \"L'arm\u00e9e s'organise contre la manifestation des gilets jaunes\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nAccording to le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9 (ed.: a satirical newspaper) and several media outlets, a column of Leclerc tanks of the 501st Combat Tank Regiment was sighted near the A1 motorway in anticipation of the demonstration on November 17 organized by the collective of yellow vests. The defense minister confirmed again this morning his willingness to break up any roadblockage, and thus confirms the words of Prime Minister Edouard Philippe.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nBut the image of the tank was not taken anywhere near the A1, it was made in Poland during a military excercise and the photo was modified to include a yellow safety vest:\n\nThe website publishing the news, conbini.fr, has only been online for about a week according to WHOIS registration data:\n\nIt sports following disclaimer at the bottom of the page:\n\nThat seems to be a parody of entertainment website https://www.konbini.com/, which has \"All Pop Everything\" as its slogan. The parody website is hosted on the same IP address as nordpresse.be (and several other related sites), namely 176.31.110.25.\n\nLe Journal Du Nord (nordpresse.be) is a satirical website that was set up to mock the (real) sudpresse.be (since renamed sudinfo.be), a Belgian media group. They were involved in a lawsuit with each other in 2017 which was eventually won by NordPresse.\n\nThey have sort of a disclaimer in their header that reads:\n\nTranslated: \"all information verified by our monkey analysts\".\n\nThe exact same article also appeared on that site, but it didn't do so well on social media, getting only a fraction of the engagement:", "lang": "en"}
