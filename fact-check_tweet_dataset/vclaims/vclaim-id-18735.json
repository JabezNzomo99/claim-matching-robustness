But Pelosi\u2019s \u201cbeautiful sight to behold\u201d remarks were not made in reference to clashes that have accompanied the Hong Kong protests.\n\nSpeaking on the 30th anniversary of the June 4, 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, Pelosi praised Hong Kong as \u201cthe only place in China where people are able to speak out.\u201d\n\nAfter being shown a picture of a candlelight vigil in Hong Kong\u2019s Victoria Square, where tens of thousands of people had peacefully gathered to pay their respects to the victims of the Tianamen Square massacre, Pelosi said:\n\n\u201cIt is a beautiful sight to behold and I commend the courage of the people there for speaking out in light of China\u2019s actions in Hong Kong these days\u2026\u201d\n\nAs for Beijing \u201cencroaching on Hong Kong people's autonomy and freedom',\" it is not clear what Xie was referencing. However, in a 2017 State Department report the Chinese central government\u2019s alleged \u201cencroachment on the SAR\u2019s autonomy\u201d was counted among the \u201cthe most significant human rights issues\u201d facing Hong Kong.\n\nThat dispute was in part sparked by an interpretation of Hong Kong Basic Law, which underpins the relationship between Hong Kong and the central government.\n\nThe Basic Law carries with it provisions that guarantee Hong Kong residents human rights and freedom of speech, assembly and association.\n\nIn November 2016, the National People\u2019s Congress Standing Committee \u2014 China\u2019s top legislative body \u2014 voted unanimously on an interpretation of the basic law that disqualified two pro-independence legislators from Hong Kong\u2019s Legislative council for making anti-Chinese statements while taking their oaths of office.\n\nA report issued by an advisory body to the U.S. Congress at that time accused Beijing of taking \u201cadditional steps toward undermining Hong Kong\u2019s legal autonomy.\u201d\n\nThe following year, the lawmakers\u2019 bid for reinstatement was rejected by Hong Kong\u2019s Court of Final Appeal.\n\nXie also accused certain western politicians of frequently meeting with \u201cradical activists calling for so-called \u2018Hong Kong independence\u2019,\" likely in reference to a US diplomat who publicly met with members of the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong.\n\nA pro-Beijing newspaper responded by leaking personal information about that diplomat, including the names of their children, prompting U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus on August 8 to liken Beijing\u2019s behavior to that of a \u201cthuggish regime.\u201d\n\nOn August 9, Ortagus tweeted: \u201cChinese authorities know full well, our accredited consular personnel are just doing their jobs, just like diplomats from every other country.\"\n\nShe added: \u201cForeign diplomats in the United States, including Chinese ones, enjoy open access to all elements of American politics, civil society, academia, and business.\u201d\n\nWhile some aspects of Xie\u2019s comments are open to debate, Polygraph.info finds his characterization of Pelosi\u2019s comment to be false.", "lang": "en"}
