Hundreds and hundreds of books regarding American history including Native Americans like Sitting Bull and Famous Sioux Chiefs, foreign nations far and wide, the Holocaust and even Mister Rogers, found in dumpster behind Sunrise Park Middle School in White Bear Lake, MN. No sign of any fiction books, just non-fiction regarding history, cultures, wars, tyranny, communism, politics, etc. they are trying to erase history.\"\n\nOne commenter asked: \"How long does this Chinese virus live?\"\n\nAnother replied: \"Just set them aside for a month should be good to go.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nOn July 10, a statement from the school\u2019s principal, Christine Pierre, was posted on the Sunrise Park Middle School Community Facebook page. The books in the photo were outdated library books, Pierre wrote, not books contaminated by the coronavirus.\n\n\"Sunrise\u2019s media specialist was recently weeding through the collection,\" the statement says. \"Before removing the outdated books, the proper book disposal protocol was followed by checking in with a partner organization \u2018Better World Books\u2019 to donate as many of the materials as possible, giving books to teachers in the district for classroom purposes and distributing them to Little Free Libraries placed throughout the White Bear area.\"\n\nAdditionally, the statement says, the media specialist tried to donate the books elsewhere but they were refused because the donation \"either didn\u2019t meet a specified criteria because of outdated content, required a fee or (the places the school contacted) weren\u2019t accepting donations with COVID-19 restrictions.\"\n\n\"The weeding procedure is important to help us find a new home for books 10 years and older to ensure that materials are keeping up-to-date with the needs of ever-changing curriculum, school goals and student needs,\" it says.\n\nWeeding library collections is a common practice. The American Library Association calls it \"essential.\"\n\nA Fox News affiliate reported that some residents salvaged some of the discarded books. But the claim in the Facebook post that all books had been removed from this middle school\u2019s classrooms because of the coronavirus is wrong.", "lang": "en"}
