The government has said that the policy change means up to 10,000 more training places could be offered by 2020. This is because the number of places universities offer will no longer be capped by the number of bursaries funded. We don\u2019t know how many of these will be on nursing courses.\n\nIt\u2019s also incorrect that 10,000 fewer places on nursing courses have been filled. This widely reported figure refers to the drop in applications from England, not places filled. Applications from students in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, who aren\u2019t affected by the changes, fell by much smaller amounts.\n\nWe don\u2019t know yet how many nursing places will be filled this year\u2014the January deadline for applications has just passed and courses won\u2019t start until September this year.\n\nNot everyone who applies is accepted, and not everyone goes on to work as a nurse in the NHS. Last year 44,000 English students applied and 23,000 were accepted. Some will leave their course or work outside the NHS.\n\n114,000 places on nursing and midwifery courses between 2012 and 2016 will give the equivalent of 84,000 nurses and midwives in the NHS by 2020, according to Health Education England estimates.", "lang": "en"}
