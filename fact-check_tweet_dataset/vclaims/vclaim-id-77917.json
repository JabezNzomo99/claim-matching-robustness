The caption claims it depicts people in Berlin \u201cright now..protesting the covid hoax.\u201d\n\nWhile thousands of demonstrators did take to the streets of Berlin to protest against Germany\u2019s coronavirus restrictions on Aug. 1, the image does not come from that event. Flags visible in the photo indicate it was taken in the Swiss city of Zurich, not Berlin.\n\nThrough a reverse image search, the Daily Caller News Foundation traced the photo to a 2019 music festival called Street Parade that occurred in Zurich. The picture appears on Street Parade\u2019s official website, and similar photos from different angles can be found on the annual festival\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nA spokesperson for Street Parade confirmed in an email to the DCNF that the picture depicts the 2019 Street Parade in Zurich.

In comparison, approximately 17,000 people attended the Aug. 1 protest in Berlin, according to CNN.\n\nThe 2020 Street Parade was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
