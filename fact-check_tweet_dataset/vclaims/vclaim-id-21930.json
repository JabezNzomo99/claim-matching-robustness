But did she criticize Michelle Obama eight years later during Clinton\u2019s unsuccessful bid against Donald Trump?\n\n\"Do we really need that Michelle [expletive] to be at the same events?\" reads a Facebook post published on April 23. \"It\u2019s enough to have her dumb [expletive] pimp stinking up the works. These [expletive] for brains voters need to just vote already.\"\n\nThe post cites WikiLeaks and claims Clinton made the comments in an email to her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, on Oct. 20, 2016.\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nBut searching WikiLeaks\u2019 archive of emails Hillary Clinton sent and received on a private email server when she was Secretary of State, we couldn\u2019t find the statement the Facebook post attributes to her. The archive was last updated on Feb. 2, 2018, according to Wikileaks.\n\nWhen we searched the Wikileaks database of emails from the U.S. Democratic National Committee, we couldn\u2019t find the statement there, either.\n\nWe also couldn\u2019t find the statement in a trove of emails from the hacked account of Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta.\n\nLastly, we looked for news stories of Clinton making such a statement about Michelle Obama. Between the release of hacked emails to the controversy over Clinton using a private email server while she was secretary of state, the two-time presidential hopeful has garnered wide media coverage when it comes to messages sent online. It would follow that such inflammatory comments about Michelle Obama would draw journalists\u2019 attention. And yet, we found no credible reports that Clinton ever said such a thing.\n\nWe rate this Facebook post as Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
