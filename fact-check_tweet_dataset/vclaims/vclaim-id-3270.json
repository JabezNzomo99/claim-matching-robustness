These were a fiction of the media and the Labour party.\u201d \u201cThe reality is that David Davis and Theresa May said on nine separate occasions in the House of Commons that they'd done, or were doing, 58, sometimes he said 57, sometimes 60, but around 58 sectoral analyses that were absolutely meant to show what the impact of Brexit would be on those different sectors, and he now says that there aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThis is the debate about whether or not the government bluffed about having detailed assessments of the impact of Brexit on different parts of the economy.\n\nOn 25 October 2017, at the Select Committee on Exiting the European Union, Seema Malhotra noted that Mr Davis had previously \u201cconfirmed that DExEU [Department for Exiting the European Union] was carrying out 57 sets of sectoral analysis on the impact on the economy of Brexit\u201d. Mr Davis confirmed that these analyses were in his department\u2019s possession.\n\nMs Malhotra then asked \u201cHas the Prime Minister seen the impact assessments\u2026 yes or no?\u201d\n\nAfter clarifying that Ms Malhotra was referring to reports that had not yet been published, Mr Davis responded \u201cShe will know the summary outcomes of them. She will not necessarily have read every single one. They are in excruciating detail.\u201d\n\nAlthough Mr Davis has not, as far as we have found, used the term \u201cimpact assessment\u201d himself, he did confirm to MPs the existence of something referred to as impact assessments. He also confirmed that there were 57, in \u201cexcruciating detail\u201d.\n\nBy December he was saying that \u201cThere were no 58 sectoral impact assessments; there was sectoral analysis.\u201d\n\nSince the House of Commons voted to demand copies of the impact assessments the government has put a lot of weight on the distinction between \u2018impact assessments\u2019 and \u2018sectoral analyses\u2019, as we point out below. It\u2019s up to you whether you think that\u2019s a vital difference or different words for the same thing in this context.\n\nIf the distinction is important, then at best the government allowed a misunderstanding about how informed its negotiations were by not correcting MPs who asked about impact assessments back in October.\n\nWhat the government has said, in its own words\n\nBelow is a list of every quote we could find from a relevant government official on impact assessments and sectoral analyses. We do not know if they include all \u201cnine separate occasions\u201d referred to by Owen Smith.\n\n5 September 2016: David Davis to the House of Commons: \u201cmy officials, supported by officials across Government, are carrying out programme of sectoral analysis and regulatory analysis, which will identify the key factors for some 50 sectors of British business.\u201d\n\n20 October 2016: David Davis to the House of Commons: \u201cWe currently have in place an assessment of 51 sectors of the economy. We are looking at those one by one, but the aim at the end is that this will inform the negotiating approach so that no one gets hurt.\u201d\n\n14 December 2016: David Davis to the Select Committee on Exiting the European Union: \u201cWe are in the midst of carrying out about 57 sets of analyses, each of which has implications for individual parts of 85% of the economy\u2026 everything except sectors that are not affected by international trade.\u201d\n\n17 January 2017: David Davis to the House of Commons: \u201cWe have paid an enormous amount of attention to business, finance, manufacturing, aviation, energy and so on\u2014every single sector; 51 different sectors\u2014to get the best possible deal that suits all of them. We will continue to do so.\u201d\n\n2 February 2017: David Davis to the House of Commons: \u201cWe continue to analyse the impact of our exit across the breadth of the UK economy, covering more than 50 sectors\u2014I think it was 58 at the last count\u2014to shape our negotiating position.\u201d\n\n26 June 2017: Undersecretary of State for the Department for Exiting the European Union, response to a written question: \u201cOur work covers the breadth of the UK economy, and we are looking in detail at more than 50 sectors as well as areas of cross-cutting regulation\u2026 I can confirm that we will shortly be publishing the list of sectors we have been examining\u201d\n\n25 October 2017: David Davis to the Select Committee on Exiting the European Union:\n\nSeema Malhotra: \u201cAll of those assessments and the decision to not publish them at this point would be in your department.\u201d\n\nMr Davis: Of that 57, yes they would.\n\nSeema Malhotra: Could I ask you another question? You have answered that question; that was very helpful. Has the Prime Minister seen the impact assessments that have been published, yes or no?\n\nMr Davis: The details of them? Sorry, did you say \u201chave been published\u201d?\n\nSeema Malhotra: Sorry, I am just asking whether she has seen the impact assessments. A yes or no answer is fine.\n\nMr Davis: Which ones? I will give a proper answer; I do not give yes/no answers.\n\nSeema Malhotra: I mean the impact assessments that you have not published.\n\nMr Davis: That we have not published?\n\nMr Davis: She will know the summary outcomes of them. She will not necessarily have read every single one. They are in excruciating detail.\n\n30 October 2017: David Davis to the House of Lords EU External Affairs Sub-Committee: \u201cGovernment has been looking at more than 50 areas of activity, or sectors\u2026 We set out below, in alphabetical order, 58 sectors.\u201d\n\n1 November 2017: Undersecretary of State for the Department for Exiting the European Union, to the House of Commons: \u201cI have explained that the analysis is not a series of 58 economic impact assessments. It is a cross-sectoral analysis.\u201d\n\n3 November 2017: David Davis to Chair of the Exiting the European Union Committee: \u201cAs we have made clear, it is not the case that 58 sectoral impact assessments exist\u2026 it is not, nor has it ever been, a series of discrete impact assessments examining the quantitative impact of Brexit on these sectors.\u201d\n\n7 November 2017: David Davis written statement to the House of Commons: \u201cThe sectoral analysis is a wide mix of qualitative and quantitative analysis, contained in a range of documents developed at different times since the referendum\u2026 It is not, nor has it ever been, a series of discrete impact assessments examining the quantitative impact of Brexit on these sectors.\u201d\n\n6 December 2017: David Davis to the Select Committee on Exiting the European Union:\n\nChair: Just to be clear, have the Government undertaken any impact assessments on the implications of leaving the EU for different sectors of the economy?\n\nMr Davis: Not in sectors... so there is no systematic impact assessment.\n\n6 December 2017: Theresa May to the House of Commons: \u201cThe House requested, as I understand it, 58 sectoral impact assessments. There were no 58 sectoral impact assessments; there was sectoral analysis.\u201d\n\nThis House of Commons Library briefing also has a rundown of what has been said.\n\nFollowing the House of Commons vote, on 1 November 2017, \u201cthat the impact assessments arising from those analyses be provided to the Committee on Exiting the European Union\u201d, Mr Davis and his team began to emphasise the difference between an impact assessment and a sectoral analysis.\n\nFor example, in that same debate on 1 November 2017, the Undersecretary of State for DExEU said \u201cI have explained that the analysis is not a series of 58 economic impact assessments. It is a cross-sectoral analysis\u201d.\n\nOn 3 November 2017, Mr Davis told the chair of the Select Committee on Exiting the European Union, \u201cAs we have made clear, it is not the case that 58 sectoral impact assessments exist\u2026 Let me clarify exactly what this sectoral analysis is. It is a wide mix of qualitative and quantitative analysis, contained in a range of documents developed at different times since the referendum.\u201d\n\nThis culminated in Mr Davis seeming to tell the Select Committee on 6 December 2017 that no impact assessments exist: \u201cNot in sectors\u2026 there is no systematic impact assessment\u201d", "lang": "en"}
