If Mayor Muriel Bowser approves the bill, it will go into effect.\n\nThis means that there are still several legal procedural steps before/if the street signs near Russian embassy will change from Wisconsin Ave to Boris Nemtsov Plaza.\n\nHowever, leading Russian politicians are already responding to the news from Washington, DC with a flow of accusatory comments.\n\nNemtsov\u2019s former colleagues in the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, have proposed renaming the street on which the U.S. embassy is located in Moscow. They are calling for changing the current address, \u201c8 Bolshoi Devyatinskiy Pereulok,\u201d to \u201c1 Severoamericansky Tupik,\u201d which translates to 1 North American Blind Alley.\n\nOne top lawmaker said it was \u201cimmoral\u201d for the Americans to attempt \u201cpit the current Russian authorities against Boris Nemtsov.\u201d\n\nAnd Dmitry Novikov, deputy chairman of the Russian State Duma\u2019s foreign affairs committee, called the DC city council\u2019s move \u201cinterference in Russia\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d\n\nThat Novikov\u2019s claim is false was proven by his own boss, Duma foreign affairs committee chairman Leonid Slutsky, who called the DC city council\u2019s decision\u201crough\u201d and \u201cbrutal,\u201d but added that \u201cit is the American government\u2019s business.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Russia\u2019s Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said late last month concerning the Council of the District of Colombia\u2019s plans to rename the street in front of the Russian embassy in the U.S. capital: \u201cThe American authorities decide where, when and in whose honor they name a particular plaza, a particular street.\u201d\n\nExplaining why she co-sponsored renaming on Russian Embassy\u2019s doorstep, DC city council member Mary Cheh, said, \u201cthere is little doubt that his (Nemtsov\u2019s) murder was motivated by his political beliefs, his popularity, and his frequent and open criticism of the Russian government.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
