In trying to isolate the impact of exercise, the researchers \u201ccontrolled\u201d for other factors such as age, sex, smoking habits and body mass index. This means trying to limit the impact that these other factors have on the results so we can be more confident that changes are caused by exercise.\n\nHowever, certain important factors were not controlled for, meaning the impact of exercise on mortality risk may be clouded by the impact of these other factors. The authors acknowledged this in their study, citing in particular the fact that dietary intakes and disabilities could not be controlled for.\n\nWe also note that access to medical care wasn\u2019t one of the factors controlled for and as this varies considerably in the USA it could presumably have an impact on mortality risk.\n\nThat means that the reason why people doing more exercise had lower mortality risks, could have been, in part, because they had better healthcare, diets or fewer disabilities, rather than purely because they did more exercise.\n\nAnother important caveat the researchers note is that respondents only answer the survey once. So when the researchers followed-up to see whether the respondents were still alive, they had to class their physical activity based on what they were doing in the year they originally answered the survey.\n\nThat\u2019s problematic because someone\u2019s activity level could have changed considerably during that time. Someone who answered the survey in a year they weren\u2019t exercising could have gone on to do lots of exercise in future years which would affect the mortality risk of the inactive group.", "lang": "en"}
