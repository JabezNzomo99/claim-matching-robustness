Roy Cooper vetoed. He said the bill \"mandates secrecy for campaign finance investigations by the Elections Board.\"\n\n\"Not only that, the new bill makes it harder to prosecute people and groups that violate campaign finance laws,\" Cooper said in a Dec. 26 Facebook post.\n\nThe bill, which became law after the legislature overrode Cooper\u2019s veto, does make campaign finance investigations less transparent.\n\nBut does the new law make it harder for authorities to \"prosecute\" people who might have violated campaign finance laws?\n\nCooper\u2019s post, along with the word \"prosecute,\" are somewhat vague. Contacted by PolitiFact, Cooper spokesman Ford Porter argued that the bill introduces new hurdles that could impede prosecution of campaign finance violations.\n\nPolitiFact NC reviewed the new law and the changes explained by legislative staff. There\u2019s a new requirement for filing a complaint, a new statute of limitations on investigating complaints, and a new step the North Carolina elections board must take before referring campaign finance violations to prosecutors.\n\nUnder the old law, complaints could be made informally, by email. Under the new law, complaints have to be signed and sworn under oath.\n\nThe old law didn\u2019t provide a statute of limitations for investigating complaints.\n\nThe new law says:\n\nNo investigation shall be initiated more than four years from the earliest of the following dates:\n\u2022 The facts constituting the violation are known to the State Board or county board with jurisdiction.\n\u2022 The facts constituting the violation can be determined from the public record.\n\u2022 The complainant knew or should have known of the conduct upon which the complaint is based.\n\nThe new law also creates a new procedure that must be followed before the elections board can refer campaign finance cases to prosecutors.\n\nUnder the old law, the elections board and ethics commission were one agency \u2014 the N.C. State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement. And the agency could refer cases to prosecutors without waiting on a recommendation.\n\nUnder the new law, the agency will be divided into the state elections board and the state ethics commission. The new process is:\n\u2022 The elections board sends its findings to the ethics commission.\n\u2022 Within 90 days, the ethics commission makes a recommendation to the elections board on whether or not it should refer the case to prosecutors.\n\u2022 The elections board is free to refer the cases to prosecutors (with or without the ethics commission\u2019s support).\n\nSupporters of the new law might argue that it won\u2019t change the outcome of the review, referral and prosecution process \u2014 and they could be right.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the new requirement to have a complaint signed and sworn won\u2019t discourage anyone from coming forward with legitimate allegations, that having the ethics commission involved won\u2019t get in the way of prosecution, and that no cases will emerge that predate the new four-year statute of limitations on the election board.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s also a chance the new statute of limitations could prevent the board from holding someone accountable for something that happened more than four years ago.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that the ethics commission and elections board would disagree on whether to pursue criminal charges. The ethics commission will be composed of eight members, who could potentially deadlock. And it\u2019s possible that, if county prosecutors are aware of a disagreement between the elections board and the ethics commission, it would influence their decision to withhold charges.\n\nJohn Wallace, an attorney who has represented the N.C. Democratic Party, noted that the law requires the elections board to send some campaign finance cases to a politician\u2019s home district. He noted that some district attorneys \"may not be knowledgeable or experienced with respect to the prosecution of campaign finance matters.\"\n\nCooper said a bill passed by GOP legislators \"makes it harder to prosecute people and groups that violate campaign finance laws.\" The new law will require complaints to be signed and sworn, the elections board to abide by a new statute of limitations, and the state ethics commission to weigh in on cases.\n\nSupporters of the law could argue that those additions to the process are relatively small obstacles to clear to prosecute someone for campaign finance violations. And they may have a point. But the new requirements are hurdles, nonetheless.
