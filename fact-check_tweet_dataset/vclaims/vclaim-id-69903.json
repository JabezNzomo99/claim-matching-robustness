Mimi Walters is attempting to hold onto a seat in a district that backed Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nHouse Majority PAC, a group aligned with Democrats, puts Trump and Walters side by side a new TV ad. With Trump and Walters brand beer bottles in the background, and someone singing \"99 Bottles of Beer,\" the House Majority PAC ad claims Walters votes with the president \"99 percent of the time.\"\n\nThe ad also says Walters \"took big bucks from insurance interests\" and that she voted for Trump\u2019s plan to \"strip protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and slap an age tax on older Californians.\" We addressed those claims in a separate fact-check.\n\nHere, we focus in on whether Walters\u2019 votes put her in lock-step with Trump in a district that supported Clinton two years ago.\n\nHouse Majority PAC says Walters votes with Trump \"99 percent of the time.\"\n\nThat figure tracks back to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight. FiveThirtyEight tracked 93 key congressional votes since Trump took office to see whether members of Congress support or oppose the president\u2019s agenda. According to FiveThirtyEight, Walters voted on Trump\u2019s side in all but two instances.\n\nIn one case, Walters missed a vote to rescind previously approved but as of yet unspent federal funding. Trump supported rescinding those federal dollars.\n\nIn a second case, in July 2017, Walters voted to approve additional sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea that Trump had opposed.\n\nWhen you factor out the missed vote, according to FiveThirtyEight, Walters agreed with Trump in 91 of 92 instances, or 98.9 percent of the time. Five Congressional Republicans lined up a perfect 100 percent of the time with Trump, while Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., only voted in line with Trump 49 percent of the time.\n\nWe decided to check Congressional Quarterly as well, which also tracks how members of Congress voted when the president took a clear position. That includes statements of administration policy provided in advance of the vote, as well as his messages to Congress, news conference remarks and other public statements and documents.\n\nAccording to CQ (subscription required), Walters supported the president in 100 percent of the time in 2017.\n\nSo, when it comes to votes, Walters has been almost always on the side of Trump.\n\nOne caveat: As we have said in the past, you can debate the value of these types of comparisons, as they may overlook instances where an elected official bucked the leader of his or her party. Walters did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe House Majority PAC says that Walters votes in line with Trump 99 percent of the time.\n\nIt is true that Walters has supported Trump\u2019s agenda in almost every case. FiveThirtyEight looked at 93 votes and found Walters on the side of the president 99 percent of the time. CQ said Walters agreed with Trump 100 percent of the time in 2017 in the votes they studied.\n\nThe caveat in claims like these is that you can debate the usefulness of the statistic itself.\n\nWith that in mind, we rate this claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
