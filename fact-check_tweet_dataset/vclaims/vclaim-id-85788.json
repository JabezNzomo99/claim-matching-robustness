Is this really the case?\n\nIn its back-up material, ESAF points to a series of articles, many of which ran in The Washington Post, reporting that Obama deferred taking executive action on immigration until after the midterm elections. Previously, he had pledged to announce executive steps at end of the summer, having said he was disappointed that the House of Representatives did not take up a bill that had been approved by the Senate in 2013.\n\nAs we have noted before, \u201camnesty\u201d is a loaded phrase when used in the context of illegal immigration. The dictionary definition is: \u201cThe act of an authority (as a government) by which pardon is granted to a large group of individuals.\u201d\n\nBut the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, which was approved in the Senate in 2013 on a vote of 68 to 32, including the support of 14 Republicans, did not contain anything as sweeping as that dictionary definition of amnesty.\n\nIf the bill had become law, undocumented aliens would have had to jump through all sorts of hoops before they could be considered for legal permanent residence, including registering with the government, having a steady job, paying a fine, paying back taxes, passing background checks, learning English \u2014 and then getting in line behind immigrants who had entered the country legally. It would have taken at least 13 years before citizenship could be obtained.\n\nBy its very nature, a presidential executive order would be even less than that, since an executive order does not permanently change the law. While the specifics have not been outlined, the key aspect of the president\u2019s plan would be to slow down or halt the deportation policies that have led to 2 million undocumented immigrants being deported during Obama\u2019s presidency. (Update: the Los Angeles Times has cast doubt on that 2 million figure.)\n\n\u201cIdeas under consideration could include temporary relief for law-abiding undocumented immigrants who are closely related to U.S. citizens or those who have lived in the country a certain number of years \u2014 a population that advocates say could reach as high as 5 million,\u201d David Nakamura of The Post reported in a 2013 article cited by ESAF.\n\nNote the 5 million number. That\u2019s much lower than 11 million, which by itself is considered the total universe of undocumented immigrants in the United States. There are other options that could bring the total affected higher, but the Congressional Research Service, in a report, found that the White House\u2019s authority to defer deportations is limited. The Wall Street Journal on Oct. 29 reported that the White House was considering options that could offer protections to 1 million and 4 million people in the country illegally.\n\nAt this point no one really knows the exact impact. But the odds are the number will be much less than 11 million \u2014 and under no circumstances could Obama\u2019s action be considered \u201camnesty.\u201d Immigrants in theory would still face legal risk because an executive order can be changed by Obama\u2019s successor.\n\nFor the record, Shaheen has opposed Obama dealing with immigration through executive order. Shripal Shah, an adviser to Shaheen, told The Post that she \u201cbelieves Congress must address our broken immigration system with a comprehensive fix, and would not support a piecemeal approach issued by executive order.\u201d\n\nWhile Obama has said he will take executive action, he\u2019s never said it would result in \u201camnesty\u201d for that many people. Indeed, \u201camnesty,\u201d or something like it, requires an act of Congress. On top of that, it\u2019s highly unlikely that executive action would affect all 11 million undocumented immigrants. The most recent news report on the White House plans pegs the figure as between 1 million and 4 million.", "lang": "en"}
