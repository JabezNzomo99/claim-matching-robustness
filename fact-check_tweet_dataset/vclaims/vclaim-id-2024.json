Originally, in an effort to keep people buying health insurance, the legislation had a requirement that people not have a lapse in coverage or they risk a 30 percent increase in premiums for one year. The bill that passed included an amendment that would allow states to seek waivers from this \u201ccontinuous coverage\u201d provision.\n\nJust before the Obama administration left office, HHS published an updated version of the report, which said 61 million to 133 million (23 to 51 percent) of non-elderly Americans have preexisting conditions. The difference in the numbers depends on the definition that is used. The more narrow definition is based on eligibility of state-run high-risk pools that predated Obamacare \u2014 which might reemerge as an option under the GOP plan for people in a waiver state and a lapse in coverage. The broader definition includes health conditions (such as arthritis) or behavioral health disorders (such as substance abuse) that might have resulted in denial of coverage or higher premiums.\n\nThere are other estimates, as well, such as a Kaiser Family Foundation study that said 27 percent of adult Americans younger than 65 have \u201chealth conditions that would likely leave them uninsurable if they applied for individual market coverage under pre-ACA underwriting practices that existed in nearly all states.\u201d This number is more conservative in part because the survey did not have enough detail on some illnesses (such as HIV/AIDS) that before Obamacare would have left someone without insurance.\n\nMeanwhile, a 2010 investigation by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, based on documents from the four largest for-profit health insurers, found that companies denied coverage to one out of every seven applicants. So that would be 14 percent. So even if you took the entire U.S. population with health insurance \u2014 about 257 million people \u2014 that means 34 million would face a denial of coverage. Within the individual market \u2014 assuming every state sought a waiver \u2014 the result would be 2.5 million, assuming they all experienced a lapse in coverage of more than two months.\n\nUpdate: We were so focused on fact-checking the \u201c129 million\u201d number that we neglected to consider the second part of her statement \u2014 that these people \u201ccould be denied coverage.\u201d The problem is that the AHCA does not change the ACA\u2019s guarantee of coverage. The rule for debating the amendment actually included a line to clarify any possible ambiguity, though it sounds more like a public relations exercise \u2014 that \u201cnothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting health insurance issuers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions.\u201d\n\nThe Harris staff says the language in the tweet referred to the possibility that people would be \u201ceffectively denied coverage\u201d because they could not afford it. This line of reasoning was based on the notion that the House GOP bill, as drafted, could lead to a death spiral because of the continuous-coverage provision, with the stabilization funds unable to help people cover their costs during the one-year period when they are not in the community-rated premium pool. But the CBO report said that the AHCA, as originally structured, could \u201cattract a sufficient number of relatively healthy people to stabilize the market.\u201d (CBO also said, contrary to GOP claims, that the Obamacare markets were also stable.) There has not been a CBO report yet on the final bill. (Further update: see our fact check on the CBO report, which does conclude that in some states, with about one-sixth of the U.S. population, the law\u2019s efforts to protect people with preexisting medical conditions might end up undermining the individual insurance markets so much that effectively there is no protection at all. )\n\n\u201cWe stand by the reality that \u2026 the push to eliminate the Affordable Care Act will result in 24 million Americans losing access to affordable health care,\u201d Harris said, referring to the CBO\u2019s estimate that 24 million fewer people would have health insurance compared to current law. We can quibble over the exact statistics and data based on the source, she said, \u201cbut there is an undeniable reality that if they get rid of the Affordable Care Act, there are millions of Americans who will lose their health care.\u201d\n\nThe use of the word \u201ccould\u201d does not get Harris off the hook. As currently drafted, the provision affects a relatively small portion of the health insurance market \u2014 and even then several factors would need to play out before a person faced an issue. Moreover, the Republican plan specifically sets aside billions of dollars to help states create high-risk or invisible health pools to assist people if their health condition results in higher premiums or loss of coverage during the one-year transition period. It\u2019s a valid question about whether the funding is adequate, but that\u2019s different than assuming there is no funding at all.", "lang": "en"}
