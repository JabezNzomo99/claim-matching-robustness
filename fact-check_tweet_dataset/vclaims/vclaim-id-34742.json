The raises kick in automatically at the start of every calendar year. Since 2007, the raise has been equal to the growth in the Employment Cost Index \u2014 specifically, the ECI\u2019s measure of \u201cwages and salaries, private industry workers\u201d as of the end of September. Wages and salaries for private industry workers rose 3.1 percent in the year-long period through September 2018, according to ECI data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe Senate amendment contained a provision (sec. 601) that would authorize a pay raise of 2.6 percent for all members of the uniformed services effective January 1, 2019. The conferees note that current law authorizes automatic military pay raises consistent with the Economic Cost Index, which for calendar year 2019 amounts to a 2.6 percent raise in basic pay for all members of the uniformed services.\n\nBy operation of law (37 USC \u00a71009), the annual military basic pay raise is set at the percent change in the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Employment Cost Index \u2014 a measure of changes in wages and salaries for private industry workers as measured by the 12-month change ending September 30 of the previous fiscal year (i.e., September 30, 2018 sets the default basic pay raise for January 1, 2020) \u2014 unless superseded by law or by the imposition of an alternate pay raise by the President before September 1. The President\u2019s Budget proposed a 3.1 percent basic pay increase for Fiscal Year 2020, which is consistent with the \u201cEmployment Cost Index, Private Industry, Wages And Salaries, 12-Month Percent Change\u201d for the period ending September 30, 2018. Therefore, unless Congress enacts legislation setting a different military basic pay raise or the President imposes an alternate pay raise before September 1, 2019, the military basic pay raise is automatic and will increase by 3.1 percent on January 1, 2020.\n\nBoth Democrats failed to acknowledge that a different federal law \u2014 on the books for more than a decade \u2014 provides the 3.1 percent raises automatically. Because of that law, military pay increases kicked in at the start of 2019 even though Congress did not mention them in the defense authorization bill. As Harrison said, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing stopping\u201d the Trump administration from handing out the raises in 2020, regardless of what happens with the bill in the House.", "lang": "en"}
