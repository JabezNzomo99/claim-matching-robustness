The text sarcastically points out the highlighted photo frame of Aurangzeb painting calling it a picture of a patriot.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nAlt News did a Google reverse image search and found a list of news reports on Rahul Gandhi filing his nomination for Congress President. An article published in The Indian Express article on Dec 4, 2017 was titled, \u201cCongress hails Rahul Gandhi\u2019s elevation as beginning \u2018new era\u2019: Who said what\u201d. The original image has a Mahatma Gandhi portrait in the background.\n\nAt times when social media is rife with photoshopped images, users can utilize image verification tools like Google reverse image search which comes handy in debunking misinformation. In this case, however, it is plain ridiculous to believe that a political party would have a picture of Aurangzeb on their wall. Posts like these are aimed at the most gullible who unfortunately tend to believe and share such content.", "lang": "en"}
