But the photos actually show unrelated incidents that happened in neighbouring Bangladesh, according to media reports and Bangladeshi police.\n\nThe photos were shared in this Facebook post on May 17, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe lengthy Hindi language caption translates to English in part as: \u201cMany examples of extreme violence against Hindus have been seen in various districts of West Bengal in the last couple of days. People are fleeing, leaving behind their homes, farms, land and cattle etc.\n\n\u201cAnnouncements are being made from mosques in the month of Ramazan that Hindus will have to chant 'Allah is great' if they want to live.\n\n\u201cThe police are silent spectators because all the accused are from the so called peace-loving minority community and belong to the Trinamool Congress, led by respected Mamata didi.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrinamool Congress\u201d refers to the ruling party of West Bengal. This is their official website.\n\n\u201cMamata didi\u201d (\u201cMamata sister\u201d) refers to Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal. Here is her biography on the Trinamool Congress website.\n\nThere have been clashes between the Trinamool Congress and India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in West Bengal during India's general election. Here is a recent AFP report about the incidents.\n\nOne of the photos in the misleading post was also shared in a Facebook post here alongside similar claims.\n\nBut the photos have actually circulated online since April 2019 in reports about unrelated incidents in Bangladesh.\n\nA reverse image search on Google for the first image in the misleading Facebook post found it had been published in this story on Bengali news site www.desh1.com on April 16, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the two photos in the misleading Facebook posts (L) and the same photos on the Bengali news site (R):\n\nThe www.desh1.com report\u2019s Bengali language headline translates to English as: \u201cMiscreants vandalise idols in Biteswar Kalibari temple in Daudkandi in Comilla\u201d.\n\nThe Bengali text reads: \u201cMiscreants have vandalised idols in the Biteswar Kalibari temple in Daudkandi (subdistrict) in Comilla (district). It happened today (Apr 16, 2019) at around 4pm, sources said.\u201d\n\nDaudkandi police chief Rafiqul Islam told AFP by phone the statues were damaged accidentally during an incident in April.\n\n\"Three minors went inside and were playing in the temple when they accidentally pushed the clay-made idols,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have later solved the matter with the local Hindu elders and the priests. But meanwhile some people took photos and spread it over the internet saying it was an incident of vandalism.\"\n\nAnother reverse image search on Google found the second photo in the misleading Facebook posts in this report on Bengali news site Bdmorning.com published on April 20, 2019.\n\nThe report describes an incident in the district of Bandarban, Bangladesh.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the first photo in the misleading Facebook posts (L) and the photo in the Bdmorning.com report (R):\n\nThe Bengali language headline of the Bdmorning.com report translates to English as: \u201cPhoto of teenage girl tied to a tree goes viral, technology minister wants to learn identity.\u201d\n\nThe text reads: \u201cRecently a photo of the torturing of a teenage girl who was tied to a tree has been shared on social media. Facebook users condemned the incident that took place in Bandarban district's Lama subdistrict.\u201d\n\nLama district police chief Oppela Raju Naha told AFP: \u201cThe photo (accompanying the April 20, 2019 news story) is from Fythong municipality in Lama subdistrict in Bangladesh's southeastern Bandarban hill-district.\n\n\u201cIt is from December 2018. A quarrel between families broke out over some land, and one group tied up this teenage girl to the tree. Someone took the photo and spread it on the web.\u201d\n\nThe girl, aged between 13 and 14, has recovered, he told AFP.", "lang": "en"}
