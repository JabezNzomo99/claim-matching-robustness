The claim is false; in Zheng's interview with Xiakedao, a media channel overseen by the state-run People\u2019s Daily, he does suggest cutting Hong Kong\u2019s water supplies; Zheng said in a statement posted by one of his universities that his comments had been \u201cseriously twisted\u201d and that he had never called for water supplies to Hong Kong to be cut off.\n\nXiakedao published their interview with Zheng here on August 19, 2019.\n\nThe article's headline states: \u201cConversation with Zheng Yongnian: How would the Hong Kong disturbance ends?\u201d\n\nHong Kong has seen months of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests this summer, sparked by a now-suspended bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China. Here is a recent AFP report on the issue.\n\nZheng was asked by Xiakedao how the situation in Hong Kong could be resolved.\n\nHe answered: \u201cAs a whole, these people in Hong Kong will not get anywhere. A friend of mine is a top Singaporean official, and he says: \u2018you can just threaten to cut the water supply.\u2019 Because Singaporean people are very sensitive, they will be in trouble if Malaysia stops providing water.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s absolutely a joke. Actually, there are a lot of restrictions in Hong Kong, and most of the local people know it\u2019s impossible to lose connection with the Chinese mainland. But a few radical people are taking advantage of the convenience brought by (the city\u2019s) internationalization.\u201d\n\nA day after the original interview was published, Shanghai-based website, The Paper, picked up Zheng\u2019s comments and published this report around noon on August 20, 2019.\n\nThe simplified Chinese headline translates to English as: \u201cZheng Yongnian interviewed by People\u2019s Daily: Cutting water supply can end the chaotic situation in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the article and misleading headline published by The Paper:\n\nThe article's second paragraph states: \u201cRecently, the editor of the official WeChat account \u2018Xiakedao\u2019 had a conversation with Professor Zheng Yongnian from National University of Singapore. Below is a transcript of the dialogue.\u201d\n\nXiakedao is a media channel run by the People's Daily\u2019s overseas edition. It\u2019s verified Weibo account can be seen here.\n\nHong Kong has been importing Dongjiang water from Guangdong province in southern China since 1965 to meet local water demand, according to Hong Kong's Water Supplies Department on its website here.\n\nThe same article and misleading headline that appeared in The Paper has been published elsewhere by regional news sites such as those from the Chinese cities of Shenyang, Yangzhou and Linxia, which can be seen here, here and here.\n\nAfter the comments began circulating widely under the misleading headline, the Institute of Public Policy from South China University of Technology published this post on Weibo on August 21, 2019, clarifying, after a request from Professor Zheng, that the headline was misleading.\n\nThe Weibo post's caption states: \u201cZheng Yongnian, Honorary Professor of South China University of Technology, entrusted the official Weibo account of the Institute of Public Policy of South China University of Technology, to issue a solemn statement strongly condemning the \u2018sensational headline writers\u2019 of media organizations such as The Paper, which has severely twisted and worsened the opposition between people from mainland China and Hong Kong, and has caused extremely bad effects.\u201d\n\nThe Weibo post contains two pictures, one of which shows a statement from Professor Zheng Yongnian.\n\nThe simplified Chinese statement translates to English as: \u201cI have noticed that some media organizations in China published a news article at noon today, headlined \u2018Zheng Yongnian interviewed by People\u2019s Daily: Cutting water supply can end the chaotic situation in Hong Kong\u2019. The headline has seriously twisted my original meaning when I was interviewed by \u2018Xiakedao\u2019 under the People\u2019s Daily. At this sensitive moment when the situation in Hong Kong is grim, these acts by \u2018sensational headline writers\u2019 have severely infringed my right of fame, and also severely twisted and worsened the opposition between people from the mainland and Hong Kong, which has caused extremely bad effects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a tragedy if the media\u2018s morality degenerates. I am indignant about these deeds by specific media organizations, and I ask them here to delete the article and publish apologies, so as to diminish the bad effects.\n\n\u201cI reserve the right to take legal action against these media organizations.\u201d\n\nThe statement ends with a signature \u201cZheng Yongnian\u201d and the date \u201cAugust 20, 2019\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the statement picture posted by the institute:\n\nThe other image contained in the institute\u2019s Weibo post is a screenshot of a mobile-version of The Paper\u2019s news article page, with the misleading headline. Two sentences have been added onto the image, saying \u201cThe Paper\u2019s malicious sensational headline writer, severely twisted the truth\u201d in red font and \u201cAmoral media, (we) strongly denounce\u201d in orange font. Below is a screenshot of the image:\n\nXiakedao published on August 20, 2019 a Weibo post, which can be seen here, saying: \u201cThese sensational headline writers are really hateful! Professor Zheng Yongnian has never mentioned anything about \u2018cutting water supply to end the Hong Kong chaotic situation\u2019, which has been clearly seen from our interview yesterday. We hereby declare it here!\u201d\n\nThe Weibo post contains two images, one of which shows Professor Zheng Yongnian\u2019s statement, in a slightly different layout.\n\nThe other image shows a screenshot of the Xiakedao\u2019s interview article with its original headline, as well as a screenshot of the content which shows the relevant section of Zheng\u2019s answer circled in red.\n\nBelow are screenshots of Xiakedao\u2019s Weibo pictures:\n\nThe Paper subsequently corrected it\u2019s story, which can be seen here, with the headline now saying: \u201cConversation with Zheng Yongnian: How would the Hong Kong disturbance ends?\u201d\n\nBut the misleading version continues to circulate on social media and Hong Kong's local news sites for example here, here, and here.", "lang": "en"}
