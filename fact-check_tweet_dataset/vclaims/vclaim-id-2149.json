Facebook users flagged all of those stories as potentially fake news.\n\n\u201cZeroHedge found a Craigslist ad posted several days prior to the Charlottesville protests from a firm called \u2018Crowd Hire,\u2019 recruiting \u2018actors and photographers\u2019 at $25 an hour,\u201d the Red News story says. \u201cNow, this is bringing doubts over how these paid protesters were used as campaigners in counter protests.\u201d\n\nBut the so-called \u201cevidence\u201d that zerohedge.com wrote about is an online advertisement that says: \u201cActors and Photographers Wanted in Charlotte.\u201d That\u2019s right, Charlotte, North Carolina, not Charlottesville, Virginia. The cities are a roughly 270-mile drive apart.\n\nThe main text of the Craigslist ad reads: \u201cCrowds on Demand, a Los Angeles-based Public Relations firm specializing in innovative events, is looking for enthusiastic actors and photographers in the Charlotte, NC area to participate in our events. Our events include everything from rallies to protests to corporate PR stunts to celebrity scenes. The biggest qualification is enthusiasm, a \u2018can-do\u2019 spirit. Pay will vary by event but typically is $25+ per hour plus reimbursements for gas/parking/Uber/public transit.\u201d\n\nCrowds on Demand is a real company. It was founded in 2012 by UCLA graduate Adam Swart. The \u201cprotests and rallies\u201d page on the company\u2019s website says: \u201cWhether your organization is lobbying to move forward a healthcare, financial or other social initiative, we can organize rallies and get media attention for your causes and candidates.\u201d\n\nBut the Craigslist ad is not proof that anyone was paid to be a counterprotester in Charlottesville, or to be disruptive for that matter anywhere else. For one thing, the ad asked job seekers if they were \u201cok with participating in peaceful protests.\u201d\n\nFor the record, Swart, the CEO of Crowds on Demand, told FactCheck.org in an email that his company was \u201cnot involved in any capacity with the recent tragic events in Charlottesville, Virginia.\u201d He has previously said that his group will work with all political parties, but will not work with hate groups.\n\nThere was an anti-racism vigil in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Aug. 13. That was the day after the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally, where one female counterprotester was killed and 19 others were injured when a car plowed into a crowd.\n\nBut Scott Huffman, the founder of Indivisible Charlotte, the anti-Donald Trump group which organized the vigil, said that his team also did not hire Crowds on Demand.\n\n\u201cIndivisible Charlotte did not request or hire or pay anybody for appearing,\u201d Huffman said in an interview with Snopes.com.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nStanglin, Doug, and Cavallaro, Dave. \u201c1 dead, 19 injured as car hits crowd after a \u2018Unite the Right\u2019 rally in Charlottesville; driver in custody.\u201d USA Today. 13 Aug 2017.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: Charlottesville Protesters Were Payed [sic] To Make CHAOS, Here\u2019s The Evidence.\u201d Rednewshere.com. 18 Aug 2017.\n\nDurden, Tyler. \u201cWhy Was This \u2018Crowd Hire\u2019 Company Recruiting $25 An Hour \u2018Political Activists\u2019 In Charlotte Last Week?\u201d Zerohedge.com. 17 Aug 2017.\n\nGillin, Joshua. \u201cNo evidence that protesters are paid to disrupt Republican town hall meetings.\u201d Politifact.com. 27 Feb 2017.", "lang": "en"}
