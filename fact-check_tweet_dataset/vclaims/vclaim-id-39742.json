But in July 2018 the standard of proof was lowered to a civil legal standard\u2014on the balance of probabilities.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that this change will account for the whole rise, however. Official statistics on suicide already incorporated both suicides where the judgement was that the deceased intended to take their own life AND cases where the intent was recorded as \u201cundetermined.\u201d\n\nSo, in theory, changes to the number of cases coroners will now record as suicide as opposed to cases with undetermined intent are unlikely to make much difference to the statistics on suicide. In Scotland\u2014where there was no change to the definition\u2014there was also a significant rise in suicides in 2018.\n\nNevertheless, The Office for National Statistics says: \u201cIt is likely that lowering the standard of proof will result in an increased number of deaths recorded as suicide, possibly creating a discontinuity in our time series.\u201d In other words, you might not be comparing like-for-like when you compare last year\u2019s figures to those in previous years.\n\nThe Telegraph article does not mention this at any point, although it does link to another article on the change to recording practice.\n\nThe Samaritans\u2019 media guidelines clearly state that, in reporting on suicide, journalists should aim for \u201csensitive, nonsensationalising coverage\u201d.\n\nIt adds: \u201cUse statistics with caution. Check with Samaritans or the relevant national statistical agency to make sure you have the most recent data and are comparing like with like.\u201d\n\nThe Samaritans\u2019 helpline is available at all hours and can be contacted free on 116 123, or you can email jo@samaritans.org", "lang": "en"}
