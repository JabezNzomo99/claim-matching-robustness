The quote is likely a misinterpretation of public remarks she has made about executive orders she would take regarding gun safety laws.\n\nOn April 22, 2019 Harris stated that, if elected President, she would give lawmakers in Congress 100 days to pass \u201creasonable gun safety laws,\u201d during a CNN Town Hall in Manchester, New Hampshire ( here ). \u201cIf they fail to do it,\u201d Harris continued, \u201cthen I will take executive action.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Harris outlined a proposal to put in place requirements for \u201canyone who sells more than five guns a year\u201d to conduct background checks and for unlawful gun dealers to face penalties from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).\n\nA third stipulation of the order would prohibit \u201cfugitives from justice\u201d to purchase a weapon, or \u201cany kind of weapon.\u201d During these remarks, Harris made no mention of the role of law enforcement in gun safety and gun control measures.\n\nHer answer at this Town Hall was reflected on her website at that time, as a Democratic hopeful for the 2020 election bit.ly/2YfJpNt . Biden\u2019s gun safety plan is outlined on his website, bit.ly/2E1040H . More information on Harris\u2019 Town Hall remarks is visible here .\n\nWhile addressing union members at a forum hosted by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees in Las Vegas, Nevada in August 2019, Harris was asked by the conservative outlet The Washington Examiner if any of her proposals for a \u201cprocess of a ban in certain kind of guns\u201d would involve creating a database of gun-owners or a more active role by law enforcement ( here ).\n\nHarris responded by talking about her experience as California Attorney General (AG), when her office \u201cput resources into allowing law enforcement to actually knock on the doors of people who were on two lists.\u201d She explained this criteria as: \u201cA list where they had been found by a court to be a danger to themselves and others, and were on a list where they were precluded and prohibited from owning a gun because of a conviction that prohibited that ownership.\u201d\n\nThe entries of these lists, Harris said, were combined and then law enforcement was sent out \u201cto take those guns.\u201d ( here ). Harris clarified that it was necessary to separate \u201clegal good ownership\u201d from other gun-related issues, including the ownership of assault weapons.\n\nThe Senator did not specifically state that these measures implemented as California AG would be a part of her executive action on gun control, if elected President.\n\nFalse. Kamala Harris did not say she would sign an executive order allowing police to show up at people\u2019s houses to take their guns if they did not \u201csurrender\u201d them voluntarily.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
