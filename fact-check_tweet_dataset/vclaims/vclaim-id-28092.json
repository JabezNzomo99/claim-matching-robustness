(God\u2019s punishment, the pig (Khinzeer), who burned the holy Quran, got his hands burnt in an incident. Share this and let everyone know that Allah is himself protecting the holy Quran -translated)\u201d\n\nTwo images are being shared with the claim that a man who had burnt the Quran was punished by Allah. According to the claim, the man\u2019s hand got burnt in a separate incident and this was Allah\u2019s \u2018retaliation\u2019 to his impious act. Facebook user Hania Khan posted the message with the above claim.\n\nUmpteen accounts on Facebook and Twitter shared the images with the same narrative.\n\nWith the help of reverse image on Russian search engine Yandex, Alt News found that the two images are unrelated. The first image depicts Stop Islamization of Norway (SIAN) group leader Lars Thorsen who defied a police order against burning the holy Muslim book. \u201cThe rally had been approved by local authorities, but police had warned SIAN against desecrating the Koran, after the group said it planned to do so. Two copies of the religious text were thrown in a trash can during the rally, while Thorsen set fire to another one. The unsanctioned actions infuriated counter-protesters, who vaulted over a fence and attacked SIAN\u2019s leader.\u201d, reported Russian state-owned news outlet Russia Today on November 19, 2019.\n\nThe man in the second image is Paul Gaylord, a resident of Oregon, USA, who suffered from bubonic plague. \u201cDoctors amputated the blackened extremities of Paul \u2018Steve\u2019 Gaylord in an operation that lasted two-and-a-half hours on Monday at the St Charles Medical Center in Bend, Oregon. The 60-year-old Prineville man told The Oregonian the surgery was a success but painful.\u201d, stated an article published by UK\u2019s Daily Mail on September 19, 2012.\n\nAccording to a report by Oregon Live, Gaylord was hospitalized in critical condition with plague in June 2012, after he was infected by a cat which was originally infected by a plague-carrying rodent. \u201cCharlie(the cat) came home one day choking with a mouse stuck in the back of his mouth. Gaylord tried to pull the mouse out and in the process, Charlie bit him\u201d, said the July 2012 report. It was later confirmed that the cat had the plague.\n\nIn January 2014, Gaylord recalled the time when doctors decided to amputate his limbs in a piece penned for UK-based news outlet The Guardian. He writes, \u201cAfter a month in hospital, I went home. I had to live for six weeks with the dead fingers and toes, so doctors could work out which parts were going to heal before they performed the amputations. They wanted to take off my hands and feet at the wrists and ankles, but I didn\u2019t want that. Instead, they removed my fingers; I still have my hands and part of my thumbs. They took off all the toes on my left foot, and about a third of my right foot is gone.\u201d\n\nAmerican News outlet CNN\u2019s Health unit quoted Gaylord in a September 2015 report saying that he has prosthetics but he doesn\u2019t use them because they hurt to use.\n\nIn conclusion, an old and unrelated image of a patient who suffered from bubonic plague is being shared on social media to falsely claim that Lars Thorsen, the man who burnt a Quran in Norway, was punished by Allah and his hands were charred as a result.", "lang": "en"}
