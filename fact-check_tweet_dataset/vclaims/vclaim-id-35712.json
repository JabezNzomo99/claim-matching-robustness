The photo and caption were accompanied by the hashtag \u201c#BrightFuture.\u201d The tweet was posted a few hours before Jahromi met with a group of students, whom he told: \u201cOur dream is to plant Iran\u2019s flag on the surface of the moon.\u201d This was days before a satellite launch to commemorate the 41st anniversary of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolution.\n\nNot long after Jahromi tweeted the photo, observant Twitter users noticed the new \u201cspace suit\u201d was suspiciously similar to a children\u2019s costume sold by a company called Wonder Costumes. Among the giveaways were lines on the front of the uniform where the original patches had been removed. The costume typically sells for $39.09, but as of this writing it was on sale for as low as $20.19.\n\nA number of Iranian Twitter-users turned to sarcasm. One photo-shopped the uniform onto the bodies of U.S. astronauts from the Apollo 11 moon landing.\n\nAnother responded to Jahromi with a photo of shiny girls\u2019 sneakers, suggesting they might go well with the new space suits.\n\nStill another user responded with a photo of a remote-control toy, suggesting it could be Iran\u2019s new spaceship.\n\nIn a similar incident in 2013, Iran unveiled its first \u201cstealth fighter jet,\u201d the F313 Qaher. In that case, observers noted that the plane shown in a hangar was in fact a mock-up that could not move under its own power. The plane reappeared in a 2017 video, and while this time it was able to taxi around a tarmac, military experts said it still could not fly.\n\nIran launched its first domestically-produced satellite in 2009 and successfully launched a monkey into space in 2013 (the monkey returned safely). In September 2019, the Iranian space program suffered a setback when a Safer SLV rocket exploded on its launch pad during a test.\n\nThis report was compiled with contributions from Mehdi Jedinia of VOA's Extremism Watch Desk.", "lang": "en"}
