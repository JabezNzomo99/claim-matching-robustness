But the image is being shared out of context: It shows figures for Lassa fever, not coronavirus.\n\nThe screenshot from a broadcast on Nigeria\u2019s ChannelsTV station appears in several posts on Facebook, including this one published on March 22, 2020.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption partly reads: \u201cI just knew it. Nigerians, just stay home if you love your life.\u201d\n\nThe post alleges that Nigerians \u201cdon\u2019t even believe corona virus is real(sic)\u201d, and attributed the \u201c472 confirmed cases\u201d to the pandemic that has caused more than 18,000 deaths globally and put one-third of the world\u2019s population under lockdown.\n\nThe TV screenshot does not feature the words \u201ccoronavirus\u201d or \u201cCOVID-19\u201d, but references the World Health Organization (WHO) in the bottom right-hand corner.\n\nThe image was shared in Facebook posts here, here and here, as well as in tweets here and here, alongside similar claims.\n\nBut the claim is false: The data on the screen actually shows a breakdown of the spread of Lassa fever across Nigerian states.\n\nLassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and some other West African countries, including Benin, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, and Togo. More than 900 cases of Lassa fever including at least 160 deaths have been recorded in Nigeria since the start of the year.\n\nFewer than 50 novel coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the West African country, as of March 25, 2020.\n\nAFP found that the figure of \u201c472 confirmed cases\" that was wrongly attributed to coronavirus was indeed sourced from the World Health Organization; it represents the number of confirmed cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria between January 1 and February 9, 2020.\n\nCases were reported in 26 of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states, including the capital Abuja.\n\nAFP compared the breakdown of the figures across the 26 affected states on the WHO website and found it matched the one on the screenshot circulating on social media.\n\nMoreover, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has dismissed the claim. The NCDC said in a tweet that the figures on the television screenshot \u201care reported cases of #Lassafever,\u201d as of February 2020.\n\nNCDC urges Nigerians to check its website for updates on the Lassa fever outbreak in the country.\n\nChannelsTV has also refuted the claim, saying that the screenshot \u201chas been mischievously shared\u201d. The television station says the breakdown of 472 confirmed cases was aired on Sunday, March 22, 2020, for \u201ca report on Lassa Fever and not COVID-19\u201d.\n\nMore than 427,000 people have been infected with COVID-19 globally since the first cases of the virus were reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019.", "lang": "en"}
