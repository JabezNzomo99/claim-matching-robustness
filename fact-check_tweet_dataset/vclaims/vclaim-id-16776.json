{"title": "Article 50 and EU budget payments", "subtitle": "The UK is still a member of the European Union pending exit negotiations, so budget contributions will continue.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-16776", "url": "https://fullfact.org/europe/article-50-and-eu-budget-payments/", "vclaim": "It\u2019s correct that the government will pay tens of billions into the EU budget over the next few years. What\u2019s less clear is whether this could legally be avoided.\n\nTotal payments to the EU are fixed over a seven-year period, with annual budgets set in order to meet this overall limit. The 2014-2020 period will see the EU spend over a trillion euro.\n\nThe UK is forecast to pay in \u00a39.7 billion in the current financial year 2016/17, \u00a38.4 billion in 2017/18 and \u00a39.3 billion in 2018/19. This is the net contribution\u2014taking off the discount we get because of the UK rebate and the money that comes back to the Treasury in EU funding. So \u00a320 billion over two or three years following the referendum in June 2016 is plausible, depending on how exactly you do the sums.\n\nBut it\u2019s not obvious that there\u2019s an easy alternative. Quitting the EU instantly without using the Article 50 process at all would be illegal. The Article 50 process envisages a two-year time limit before a country leaves, during which there will be negotiations over the terms of divorce. If Article 50 is to be used, continuing to pay into the EU budget\u2014and receiving payments from it\u2014during that period is inevitable.\n\nOn top of ongoing payments, EU officials are reportedly keen for the UK to pay a lump sum covering its budget liabilities beyond 2019\u2014up to \u20ac40 billion, according to the Financial Times. The exact amount, if any, will be settled during negotiations.", "lang": "en"}
