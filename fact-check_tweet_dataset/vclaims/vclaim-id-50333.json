One was an image file and another is a link to a Facebook post.\n\nFacebook\u2019s monitoring tool Claim Check flagged another post containing the same graphic, which was also shared on March 9. However, the posts have already been taken down from Facebook as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIn a tweet on March 10, Sotto refuted the claims that an entire family in Pasig has been infected with the novel coronavirus. He said, in all caps: \u201cAno ba ang napapala ng mga gumagawa ng mga fake news katulad nitong fake \u2018GMA\u2019 post na \u2018to?\u201d\n\nIn an email to Rappler, GMA\u2019s social media team also said they did not release the graphic. \u201cNo, it did not come from us. The one who posted this used our breaking news poster for their announcement,\u201d said Justin Joyas, head of GMA\u2019s social media for news.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, when the graphic spread, the Department of Health (DOH) announced that the number of confirmed cases in the country spiked to 20 \u2013 double the number of cases reported the day before.\n\nAmong these, one patient is confined in Medical City Pasig, and another patient is a Pasig resident but confined in St. Luke\u2019s Medical Center in Bonifacio Global City in Taguig. Later on Monday night, another 4 cases were added \u2013 bringing the total number to 24.\n\nAs of Tuesday, March 10, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Philippines is at 33, 9 cases more than the previous day. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
