How can that be? \u2018Well, look at the unemployment numbers.\u2019 Yeah, okay, people are working, they\u2019re working two or three jobs to pay the bills.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe so-called leaders are walking around saying the economy is doing great, the economy is doing great. But you got to ask, great for who? \u2026'You can look at the unemployment rate, you can look at the unemployment numbers.' Yeah, so okay, people are working. They are working two or three jobs to pay bills.\u201d\n\nShe lays out a bunch of statistics \u2014 that many Americans don\u2019t have enough savings to cover a $500 emergency (true) or that the biggest cause of bankruptcy are medical bills (probably true though the data is mixed). But she also appeared to say something that made us stop the video and constantly replay it \u2014 that the unemployment rate is low because people are working two or three jobs.\n\nWe urge readers to take a look at the video above. These clips of her speeches pose a conundrum. On paper, she comes close to saying something that we criticized Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, soon to be elected as representative for New York\u2019s 14th Congressional District, for saying over the summer.\n\nThat\u2019s clearly wrong, for reasons we will explain below. But Harris is a skilled politician. She does not quite make the linkage as directly as Ocasio-Cortez. That\u2019s particularly clear when you watch the video clips. She speaks with an ironic, slightly humorous tone. All members of the Fact Checker team viewed the clips to reach a consensus, and we wavered on whether it was misleading or not.\n\n\u201cAs the senator has traveled in California and across the country, she has met many of the millions of Americans who still have to work two or three jobs to make ends meet,\u201d Adams said. \u201cHer statement wasn\u2019t meant to imply causality between that reality and the unemployment rate or the trajectory of either, she was simply saying that when some point to the unemployment rate as the primary measure of economic health, it does not reflect the difficult economic reality of millions of Americans who have to work that second or third job.\u201d\n\nIn her remarks, Harris did not indicate she was speaking anecdotally. It certainly would have been clearer if she had said: \u201cSome people tell me they are working two or three jobs to pay bills.\u201d\n\nThe fact of that matter is that relatively few people hold two or more jobs. As of September, only 4.9 percent of employed people had multiple jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (You only get counted once in the unemployment rate calculation no matter how many jobs you hold.)\n\n\u201cAfter reaching a peak of 6.2 percent during 1995-96, the multiple job-holding rate began to recede,\u201d the BLS said in a July report. \u201cBy the mid-2000s, the rate had declined to 5.2 percent and remained close to that level from 2006 to 2009. In 2010, the multiple job-holding rate decreased to 4.9 percent and has remained at 4.9 percent or 5.0 percent from 2010 to 2017.\u201d\n\nGiven the state of the economy, the number of people with two or more jobs may decline further. For the first time in 20 years, there are now more job openings than there are people looking for work.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that President Trump, when he was running for president, repeatedly used to make a similar claim about people having to hold more than one job, such as saying in September 2016: \u201cMany people, because of Obamacare and for other reasons, are holding two jobs.\u201d But, in June, he flipped the script: \u201cWe had people working three jobs, two jobs, and they were doing worse than they did 20 years ago. That\u2019s not happening anymore.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019s line may get applause, but she needs to be careful with it. Some listeners may get an impression not warranted by the facts. If she really is speaking anecdotally, she needs to be clearer. Given the uncertainty surrounding the statements, we\u2019re not going to award Pinocchios. (Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s phrasing was worth Four.) But readers are invited to offer their own opinion in the poll below.", "lang": "en"}
