No, that's not true: Fox News is available in parts of Canada and the \"Radio Act\" is a made-up piece of legislation.\n\nThe claim has been circulating online in different forms since 2011. This iteration of the claim reads:\n\nUsers on social media saw this image:\n\nBoth Fox News Channel and Fox Business Channel are available in Canada through a number of private dish providers, according to a 2019 article published by Fox. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) first approved Fox's broadcast in Canada in 2004.\n\nThe Radio Act does not exist as the post claims. Rather, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Act is regulatory law that regulates the broadcast industry. \"It's not punitive in any way. It's not a criminal code,\" said Iain MacKinnon, the president of the Canadian Media Lawyers Association. \"There is no act in Canada that prevents anybody from misleading or lying to the public,\" MacKinnon continued.\n\nPolitiFact and Snopes have previously conducted fact checks on similar claims.", "lang": "en"}
