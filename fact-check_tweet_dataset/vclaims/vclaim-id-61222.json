The groups, which include the League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, and the Environmental Defense Action Fund, kicked off a nearly $1 million campaign with a 30 second on June 23, 2014.\n\nThe ad raises concern over Ernst\u2019s promises \"to shut down the Department of Education and abolish the EPA.\" It claims that these promises are \"why extremist Sarah Palin and the billionaire Koch brother want Ernst in Washington.\" All in all, the ad concluded that Ernst is \"Too extreme for Iowa.\"\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for political ads to distort candidate\u2019s positions. Does Ernst really call for the abolition of the U.S. Education Department and the Environmental Protection Agency?\n\nOur research showed that the ad was right on track. Ernst called for the closure of both agencies in April.\n\nWill she do away with the Education Department?\n\nErnst is a state senator who won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate. She\u2019s running against the Democratic nominee, U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley.\n\nErnst brought up both the Education Department and the EPA in the Republican primary debate on April 24, 2014.\n\nOne of the moderators asked candidates how they would fund repairs for the nation\u2019s \"crumbling road and transportation systems.\" Ernst suggested cutting the federal budget to free up funds.\n\n\"I do believe that we can make the cuts necessary within our federal government,\" . She called for \"closing the doors to the Department of Education at the federal level. And not just because it would save taxpayer dollars, but because I do believe our children are better educated when it\u2019s coming from the state.\"\n\nWe ran those comments by Ernst spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel, who said that Ernst wants to see power taken from Washington and put back in the hands of Iowans. She is \"about state-driven policy,\" Hamel said.\n\nAccording to the Education Department\u2019s the \"federal role in education is limited.\" States handle almost all education policy and issues. But, , the Education Department takes on many tasks such as conducting research and overseeing state policy to prevent discrimination. It also awards and distributes federal financial aid in the form of loans and grants.\n\nThe ad says that if Ernst is elected, 213,000 Iowa students would lose their federal Pell Grants. According to , that is the number of Iowans who received Pell Grants in 2011-12. We asked the Ernst campaign what her plan for Pell Grants is, but we didn\u2019t get a response.\n\nWhat about the EPA?\n\nWhile answering the same question that prompted her Education Department response, Ernst also mentioned the EPA. \"Let\u2019s shut down the EPA,\" she said. Ernst gave the same rationale for this slash in government, saying, \"The state knows best how to protect resources.\"\n\nSo, the ad is on solid ground. Ernst did say that she would shut down the EPA.\n\nAgriculture and manufacturing are two of Iowa\u2019s , and they are both heavily affected by EPA regulation. Hamel, Ernst\u2019s spokeswoman, said that \"Joni wants to have Iowa make its own decisions.\"\n\nThe ad also refers to the Clean Air Act. This raises the question of how states would deal with national issues, like air pollution. Unlike the Education Department, where the states already play a huge role, this could be more complicated for the EPA.\n\nTwo experts on environmental law told us that abolishing the EPA would dramatically reduce regulations on industry.\n\n\"Nearly all states have seen significant cuts in the budgets of their state environmental agencies in recent years,\" said one of them, Joel A. Mintz, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University who specializes in environmental law. \"Although some states may have the expertise, resources and political will to subsume EPA\u2019s responsibilities, many \u2014 probably most \u2014 do not.\"\n\nAn attack ad aired by the League of Conservation Voters said that Ernst wants to \"shut down the Department of Education and abolish the EPA.\" In an April debate, Ernst called for the closure of both federal agencies, and her campaign didn\u2019t dispute that.
