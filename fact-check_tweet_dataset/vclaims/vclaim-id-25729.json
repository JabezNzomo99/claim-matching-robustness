Next to her was a photo of Monte, which showed a message praising her for her contribution to the cause.\n\nFour of Roxas' pictures, on the other hand, were compared against each other to confirm her identity through the earrings she was wearing and a mole on her neck.\n\nThe claim was posted on March 17, 2018. Data from the social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle showed that it has since been shared for over 16,000 times with almost 3,000 reactions and 500 comments. It resurfaced weeks after a senior high school student went \"missing\" and was allegedly kidnapped by Anakbayan.

She is not an NPA. She is a cultural worker,\" they said.\n\nRoxas did not study at UP as well. A Filipino-American activist affiliated with Bayan-USA, she was only visiting the Philippines to do community work. While she was in Tarlac province for an immersion program, armed men abducted and tortured her in a military camp for 6 days in May 2009. They tried to force her to admit she was an NPA member but she refused.\n\nRoxas identified these men as elements of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). In an ABS-CBN article, then-Bantay representative Jovito Palparan and Alliance for Nationalism and Democracy (ANAD) Representative Jun Alcover accused her of training in an NPA camp in Aurora province based on a video. Roxas\u2019 camp dismissed the allegations.\n\nIt is true that Monte was an engineering UP student who joined the NPA in 2002. She was killed in September 2014 during a military operation in Abra province. (READ: \u2018Never be silenced\u2019: U.P. community leads walkout vs campus militarization)", "lang": "en"}
