Help recognise stranger on video!\u201d or \u201c[Location] 8-year-old girl kidnapped on Sunday! Do you recognize kidnapper? [SEE VIDEO]\u201d has been shared hundreds of times across Facebook.\n\nThe story is false, and takes you to a website that attempts to gather your Facebook password. You should not click this link.\n\nThe article headline appears to have been adapted for many different UK locations, with claims that the girl has been abducted from Salisbury, Weymouth, Watford, Buxton, Aylesbury and more. Different versions use pictures of two different girls.\n\nThere are multiple clues that this story has been falsified in order to trick people into giving their Facebook details.\n\nClicking on the links lead to articles from a Polish domain with multiple inconsistencies and grammatical errors. Some versions of the article claim that a girl called Alice was abducted in both March and January (others says February), they say she was abducted in an area referred to only as \u201cdowntown\u201d, and they include a quote from a police \u201cCaptain\u201d, a rank that does not exist in UK police forces.\n\nThe article is also notably missing any of the information that would typically be in a news story, such as details about the family, the specific area in which it happened, or the police force involved.\n\nChild Rescue Alert, a service for sending out alerts about missing children that is run by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection command (part of the National Crime Agency), has sent out no alerts since January. None of the three alerts sent this year has been about a girl called Alice, and all three were resolved with the missing child being found.\n\nSearching for any recent news articles about a girl called Alice missing also returns no matching stories.\n\nThe comments at the bottom of the article, which are designed to look like Facebook profiles, also lead to Polish domain sites, rather than Facebook accounts.\n\nThe webpage has also been flagged by Google as a phishing attempt.\n\nThe article asks for people to watch CCTV footage of the apparent incident, but only after supposedly confirming their age through Facebook. Clicking this takes you to another page on the Polish website, designed to look like a Facebook login page, which asks you to enter your login details.\n\nYou should never give your Facebook password to a website other than Facebook. (You can check the website address in your browser\u2019s address bar to see if it says \u201cfacebook.com\u201d.) Facebook has tips on how to keep your account secure. They say \u201cWhen in doubt, type www.facebook.com into your browser to get to Facebook.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Facebook post, if someone does enter their details, it results in the person\u2019s Facebook groups being spammed with versions of the fake story.\n\nThe CCTV footage in the article is actually from an incident that happened in India.", "lang": "en"}
