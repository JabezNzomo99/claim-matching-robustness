Chris Collins, R-Clarence, addressed the issue during a town hall-style event on CNN before Republican leaders pulled the bill.\n\n\"In New York under our state insurance commissioner, we have what we call a one to one,\" Collins said. \"You cannot charge an older person even one dollar more than a younger person.\"\n\nThe Affordable Care Act remains the law. While insurance companies are still allowed to charge older Americans up to three times more for coverage under that law, Collins says that\u2019s not the case in New York state.\n\nIs he right that New York state residents pay the same price for insurance regardless of age?\n\nNew York state has had what\u2019s called a \"community rating\" model of health insurance since 1993. It requires health insurance companies to charge the same price for coverage in select regions regardless of age, gender, occupation or health status.\n\nThe bill, sponsored in 1992 by Assemblyman Pete Grannis, a Democrat from New York City, passed with bipartisan support from both chambers and then-Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.\n\nThe bill changed the state\u2019s insurance law from the federal model, which allows different pricing based on age, and guaranteed \"the premium for all persons covered by a policy or contract form is the same \u2026 without regard to age, sex, health status or occupation.\"\n\nIt remains on the books today and now includes the same protection for tobacco users.\n\nAlthough the price is the same for different ages within each region, the regions are allowed to have different prices statewide. There are eight regions in the state.\n\nVermont is the only other state that requires the same health insurance price for all ages.\n\nExperts we spoke to said New York state\u2019s model works with the Affordable Care Act and would not have changed under the American Health Care Act.\n\n\"Federal law preempts state law, but sometimes it creates a floor instead of a ceiling for actions that can be taken by the states,\" said Rachel Morgan of the National Conference of State Legislatures. \"You must also consider that states until recently were the principal regulators of the business of insurance and instituted requirements that best served their markets.\"\n\nThe floor, in this case, is the federal cap on age-based health care premiums. New York state\u2019s law stands because its added restriction does not change federal law but supplements it.\n\nCollins said in New York \"you cannot charge an older person even one dollar more than a younger person\" for health insurance.\n\nCollins is right. New York state has barred insurance companies from pricing based on age for more than two decades. Experts say the Affordable Care Act did not impact that law, and its would-be Republican replacement would not have either.", "lang": "en"}
