This will cost over \u00a39 million of public money (including \u00a33 million in digital promotion), according to the government.\n\nLeave campaigners object to this, saying it\u2019s a misuse of public funds and that they won\u2019t be able to get as much during the actual campaign period.\n\nIt\u2019s correct that the two official campaigns will get some public money in direct grants and publicly funded benefits such as a free mailout across the country. This is likely to amount to millions, but it\u2019s not clear exactly how much. It shouldn\u2019t be confused with the \u00a37 million spending limit each will have which is money they have to raise themselves.\n\nBoth Remain and Leave lead campaigns have a \u00a37 million spending limit\n\nThe Electoral Commission will make its decision on an official \u2018lead\u2019 campaign for each side\u2014\u2018Remain\u2019 and \u2018Leave\u2019\u2014by 14 April.\n\nBoth lead campaigns have a spending limit of up to \u00a37 million, although some kinds of spending fall outside.\n\nAnyone else can spend up to \u00a310,000, or \u00a3700,000 if they register with the Commission. Political parties are entitled to spend more on the campaign, depending on their share of the vote.\n\nThis isn\u2019t public money; they have to raise it themselves.\n\nThe government\u2019s spending of \u00a39 million on this week\u2019s leaflet is separate from all this, as the government is not treated as a campaign. Restrictions on what information the government can put out for the referendum only come into force between 27 May and polling day on 23 June.\n\nBoth campaigns also receive benefits which will cost public money.\n\nWhat assistance the campaigns can get\n\u2022 A grant of up to \u00a3600,000. The Electoral Commission says this can be used for certain spending including administrative costs, putting together campaign broadcasts and producing a leaflet to send out to voters.\n\u2022 A free mailing of that leaflet to voters. This is only for the delivery by Royal Mail, rather than dissemination online. It excludes any spending on production.\n\u2022 A free dedicated page in an information booklet sent to every household by the Electoral Commission.\n\u2022 Use of certain public buildings for meetings.\n\nThese don\u2019t count towards the \u00a37 million limit for campaign spending as they\u2019re not charged to the campaigns.\n\nThere\u2019s good reason to assume these benefits amount to \u201cmillions of pounds\u201d of public money, as Mr Fallon said.\n\nThe free mailout each lead organisation is entitled to, for instance, is likely to cost a significant amount. Back in 2011, during the referendum on the AV voting system, over \u00a38 million of public money was spent funding the delivery of the two lead campaigns\u2019 free mailout to addresses across the country.\n\nSo while the campaigns only directly get \u00a3600,000, the free benefits they\u2019re also entitled to will amount to a public cost.\n\nMichael Fallon mentioned on Sky News today a figure of \u201cover \u00a320 million\u201d of public money being made available to both campaigns. We\u2019ve asked the government for a source for this figure.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why the direct grant is set at \u00a3600,000, incidentally, it\u2019s designed to be the equivalent in today\u2019s money of what the campaigns in the 1975 EU referendum got.", "lang": "en"}
