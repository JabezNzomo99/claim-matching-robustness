The report soberly referenced studies that showed the \u201cmixed and nuanced nature of NAFTA\u2019s estimated impacts on aggregate employment\u201d without concluding there was a definitive estimate. Most mainstream economists do not believe the number of jobs is significantly affected by trade policy; instead, trade changes the mix of jobs.\n\nSo why do we care about this quarter-century-old statement? It continues to often be cited as an example of presidential funny numbers on trade. In the era of President Trump, when presidential facts are often wrong, it might seem par for the course. But 25 years ago, more attention was paid at the White House to getting the numbers right.\n\nAfter some inquiries in the Clinton universe, we were directed to Michael Waldman. He\u2019s now president of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. At the start of the Clinton administration he was in his early 30s and was a special assistant to the president for policy coordination. He was assigned to write Clinton\u2019s speech making the case for NAFTA, even though before entering the White House he had been a fervent foe of the accord.\n\nOne might assume that Waldman plucked the highest possible estimate from a pro-trade think tank to come up with a million jobs. But Waldman told The Fact Checker it was an invented number, a placeholder that was supposed to be replaced by a more realistic number later. (In the news business, reporters often write \u201cTK\u201d for numbers to come later. Waldman wrote \u201cmillion.\u201d)\n\nAs Waldman recounted in his memoir of his years as a presidential speechwriter, \u201cPOTUS Speaks,\u201d his final draft of the speech had been rigorously fact-checked by Sylvia Mathews, then a 20-something aide to Robert Rubin, director of the National Economic Council. (Now Sylvia Mathews Burwell, she eventually served as secretary of health and human services under President Barack Obama and now is president of American University.)\n\nClinton liked to have his speeches printed out in segments on a stack of index cards. Before he delivered the speech, a huge error took place: The first draft was accidentally printed and pasted onto index cards for Clinton to read. (The various drafts had been on a floppy disk, which is how speeches were transferred from person to person in a pre-networked age.) But the mistake was not caught before Clinton went into the East Room to deliver the speech.\n\nEventually Clinton also realized there was a problem when he turned an index card and found a notation saying that the following paragraph had been taken from a speech by the labor secretary and it would be rewritten later. \u201cHis eyes bulged briefly when he realized something was amiss,\u201d Waldman wrote. \u201cHe began to ad-lib \u2014 seamless paragraphs, new arguments, flowing effortlessly. Some of these, I recognized too: in the instant that he had scanned the speech draft in the Red Room, he had absorbed large chunks of the arguments.\u201d\n\nIn a background briefing for reporters after the speech, an unidentified senior administration official appeared understandably puzzled about why the president said a million jobs would be created. \u201cNow, that one study that showed a million net job creation I would be a little bit careful of because . . .\u201d he said, before a reporter interrupted and said, \u201cThe president used it today in his speech.\u201d The official responded: \u201cNo, no, no. That\u2019s not the figure.\u201d He tried to concoct a rationale for the number before giving up. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to tell you is, there are all kinds of estimates out there of job gains,\u201d he said.\n\nEven Clinton got into the act. During a joint news conference with the Australian prime minister a few hours later, he admitted to the error but tried to minimize it: \u201cI think we should be very careful that if we make an assertion, that we know that it has some factual basis. And if any of us make a mistake we ought to say so,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, my office has already put out a statement because I inadvertently made a factual error today, not a big one, but it was an error, and we corrected it.\u201d\n\nRegular readers know that we do not award Pinocchios when a politician admits error. So if The Fact Checker had existed in 1993, the White House\u2019s quick admission of a mistake would have ended the matter. But now that we know that Clinton had not even intended to make this prediction \u2014 that it was indeed the result of a sloppy error \u2014 it\u2019s also time for people to stop reporting it as a presidential assertion.", "lang": "en"}
