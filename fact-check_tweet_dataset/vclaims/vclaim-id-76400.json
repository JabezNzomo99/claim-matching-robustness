They go down to 7 percent, 8 percent, and it's a national tragedy. We're at zero, we're not doing anything.\"\n\nAssuming that Trump was talking about growth in GDP and not the real gross domestic product (which was more than $18 trillion in the last quarter of 2015), his statement that it\u2019s zero is an exaggeration.\n\nIn reality, GDP grew at an annual rate of 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, and 2 percent in the third quarter, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nCompared to China\u2019s 6.9 percent in 2015, that may seem like scant growth. But it\u2019s not zero, nor is it historically low \u2014 a point Trump tried to make and flubbed in his June 2015 presidential announcement speech.\n\n\"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product \u2026 was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero,\" he said back then.\n\nWe rated that claim Pants on Fire, noting that economic growth dipped below zero no less than 42 times since 1947.\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t have the new talking point down, either.\n\nTrump said, \"GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters.\"\n\nEconomic growth in the last two quarters of 2015 was modest: 1 percent and 2 percent. But that\u2019s not zero.", "lang": "en"}
