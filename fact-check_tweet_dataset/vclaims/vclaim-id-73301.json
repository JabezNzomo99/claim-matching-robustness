This quote is fabricated; it originates from a website known for fictitious political stories, and there is no record of Harris publicly making the statement.\n\n\u201cAnd once Trump\u2019s gone and we have regained our rightful place in the White House, look out if you supported him and endorsed his actions, because we\u2019ll be coming for you next,\u201d reads a quote attributed to Harris in Facebook posts shared on August 11, 2020.\n\n\u201cAfter We Impeach, We Round Up the Trump Supporters,\u201d more ominous versions of the quote add.\n\nWhile most social media posts using the quote in August 2020 claimed that Harris made her vengeful promise on April 30, 2020, some alleged the quote was from June 18, 2020.\n\nThe same quote had already made rounds on social media in August 2019, but was not real then and is not real in 2020.\n\nThe quote was invented for an article published on August 7, 2019 on the satirical news website, bustatroll.org.\n\nThe fictional piece claimed: \u201cWhile giving a speech on the effectiveness of zero punishment prosecutions, she (Harris) veered off script to talk about impeaching our president and describe in detail one \u2018crime\u2019 she would not hesitate to punish.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything on this website is fiction,\u201d a disclaimer warns on the website\u2019s \u201cAbout Us\u201d section.\n\nThe disclaimer adds that bustatroll.org \u201cis a subsidiary of the \u2018America\u2019s Last line of Defense\u2019 network of parody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d The ambiguous nature of this network\u2019s tone has led much of its content to be taken seriously by online users.\n\nThere are no records of Harris at a Democrat fundraiser for Criminal Justice Reform on April 30, 2020. Harris\u2019s public communications that day focused on legislation aiming to combat racial and ethnic disparities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThere is also no evidence Harris said the quote on June 18. Her main public appearance that day focused on a Supreme Court ruling blocking Trump\u2019s attempt to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\nAfter Biden announced Harris as his running mate on August 11, 2020, making her the first black and Asian-American vice-presidential candidate, AFP Fact Check also found posts falsely suggesting that the California senator could not be president because her parents were born outside the US.", "lang": "en"}
