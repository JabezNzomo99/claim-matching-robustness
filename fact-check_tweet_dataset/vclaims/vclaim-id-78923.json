These are guaranteed labor contracts and the governor said, `If you want to get state money (for the project), you\u2019ve got to rebid those contracts. So they did and the price came down $300 million.\n\n\"Gov. McAuliffe won\u2019t force the rebidding of guaranteed union contracts and Gov. Cuccinelli will,\" he said.\n\nCuccinelli made the same claim during a July 20 debate with McAuliffe. So we decided to examine his contention that $300 million was saved by rebidding the contract without the union-friendly provision.\n\nConstruction of the 23-mile Silver Line began in early 2009. Phase 1, a $2.7 billion extension of Northern Virginia subway lines from Falls Church to past Tysons Corner, is expected to be completed this year. Work on Phase 2, an 11-mile expansion to Dulles Airport and slightly beyond, is scheduled to start next year and be finished in 2018. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority is managing the project and last year the second phase would also cost $2.7 billion.\n\nIn April 2010, the MWAA Board of Directors a Project Labor Agreement that would allow construction unions to determine the wages, benefits and employment conditions for all Phase 2 laborers -- whether they belonged to a union or not.\n\nThe action was denounced by the state chapter of Associated Builders and Contractors and many Republican politicians, including Cuccinelli and Gov. Bob McDonnell, who said the agreement would elevate costs to depress bidding competition for Phase 2.\n\nCritics also said the agreement was inconsistent with the state\u2019s libertarian culture, pointing to an that found 95 percent of private-company construction workers in Virginia last year were non-union. Virginia is one of states with a right-to-work law that bars compulsory union membership.\n\nIn April 2012, McDonnell signed a banning state aid to projects requiring a Project Labor Agreement. Two months later, the MWAA the union-friendly policy.\n\nNow, let\u2019s return to Cuccinelli\u2019s claim that after the agreement was dropped, Phase 2 was rebid and taxpayers saved $300 million. Cuccinelli\u2019s campaign defended the claim by sending us a May 2013 news release from the MWAA announcing its awarding of a construction contract for roughly half of the work in Phase 2.\n\nBut there has been no rebidding in Phase 2, according to Transportation Secretary Sean Connaughton, so any savings from eliminating the union agreement is conjecture.\n\nThe MWAA originally estimated that the contract it put out this spring would come in at between $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, but Capital Rail Constructors submitted a winning bid of $1.18 billion. That\u2019s the basis of the savings Cuccinelli claims: A range of $222 million to $422 million compared to the original estimates.\n\nConnaughton said he believes the elimination of the union agreement reduced costs -- although he didn\u2019t know by how much -- because it encouraged contractors weary of unions to bid on the contract. That expanded competition and bidders \"sharpened their pencils,\" he said.\n\nDebate over the value of Planned Labor Agreements goes far beyond Virginia and there are many defenders of the arrangements. The Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America pointed us to from Cornell University professor Fred Kotler that says PLAs have saved money on New York projects because they establish predictable costs, guarantee standards of excellence and management rights, and give contractors flexibility on starting times.\n\nA few final notes: Cuccinelli said that McAuliffe, if he was governor, would back union-guaranteed contracts. McAuliffe, in June, to say whether he supports such agreements.\n\nMcAuliffe has reaped almost in contributions from organized labor this year, prompting Cuccinelli to portray him as a pawn for unions. Cuccinelli, in contrast, has received only from unions.\n\nIn July, we gave a rating to a Cuccinelli claim that McAuliffe \"opposes\" Virginia\u2019s right-to-work law.\n\nCuccinelli says Virginia saved $300 million by rebidding a Dulles Metrorail contract without a union-friendly agreement. But the project was not re-bid -- the \"savings\" was a reflection of preliminary construction estimates compared to the winning bid made by a contractor.\n\nThe state\u2019s transportation secretary believes that eliminating a requirement for union contracts expanded bidding competition and led to savings, but says there\u2019s no way of knowing how much.\n\nThe basis of Cuccinelli\u2019s statement has merit; Virginia did force the repeal of the union requirement and project bids came in lower than expected. But he twists facts to suggest there was a tangible $300 million savings in killing the union agreement.", "lang": "en"}
