Scott Walker and -- reading from notes that he said came from \"books\" -- made a number of statistical claims that reflect negatively on the state.\n\nThe Republican frontrunner for president cast blame on the Republican governor and onetime presidential candidate, citing figures on state government debt and the number of people on food stamps.\n\nBut one of Trump\u2019s most striking claims was about unemployment -- something Walker frequently takes credit for having brought down.\n\n\"Unemployment rate -- well, they say -- that can't be possible,\" Trump told a crowd in Janesville, looking at his notes. \"Unemployment rate, they have down 20, that can't be possible.\"\n\nAs members of the audience interjected, Trump continued by saying:\n\n\"What? Is it 20 percent? Effective or regular? I mean just -- effective unemployment rate, 20 percent. Hey, this is out of the big book.\"\n\nThere is no official measure for the effective -- or as Trump on other occasions called it -- the \"real\" unemployment rate.\n\nBut even taking into account the federal government\u2019s most expansive measure of unemployment, Wisconsin\u2019s rate doesn\u2019t even reach double digits.\n\nHere\u2019s what the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics told us:\n\nBLS has six measures of unemployment, ranging from U-1 -- the most restrictive -- to U-6 -- the most expansive.\n\nIn between is U-3, the official unemployment rate. That\u2019s the one you see reported in the news most often.\n\nThe U-3 official unemployment rate in Wisconsin was 4.6 percent in 2015. That rate is updated monthly. The most recent rate, for February 2016, was also 4.6 percent.\n\nThe U-6 rate, meanwhile, is sometimes referred to unofficially as the \"real\" unemployment rate. U-6 includes people who are unemployed, plus \"marginally attached workers,\" meaning those who are not in the labor force but want to work and are available for work. It also includes people who want to work full time but, because of economic conditions in their area, are able to work only part time.\n\nThe U-6 rate is calculated only annually. Wisconsin\u2019s U-6 rate for 2015 was 8.3 percent -- again, far below Trump\u2019s 20 percent.\n\nTrump made a similar claim in June 2015 in announcing his run for president. He said the \"real\" unemployment rate for the United States at the time was \"anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don't believe the 5.6. Don't believe it.\" (At the time, the official unemployment rate nationally was 5.5 percent.)\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign staff didn\u2019t respond for that fact check and, as of press time on this fact-check, had not responded to our requests for information.\n\nWisconsin\u2019s latest official unemployment rate -- the one reported most often in the news -- was 4.6 percent in February 2016. It was also 4.6 percent for all of 2015.\n\nThe government\u2019s most expansive unemployment rate -- which includes the unemployed, people in the labor force who aren\u2019t looking for work and people who are working part time but want to work full time -- for Wisconsin was 8.3 percent for 2015.", "lang": "en"}
