There\u2019s usually some think tank that has produced a report that, conveniently, comes up with a sound-bite that will grease the wheels of publicity for a particular legislative initiative.\n\nThe factoid comes from an annual report, Ten Thousand Commandments, put out by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market group founded in 1984 to combat what it considered excessive government regulation. So already you have to take the analysis with a large grain of salt. Indeed, the report is billed as \u201cAn Annual Snapshot of the Federal Regulatory State.\u201d\n\nThe $15,000 is derived from an estimate that regulations cost at least $1.8 trillion a year, the figure cited by Rep. Jenkins. (This number is calculated in a CEI working paper titled \u201cThe Tip of the Costberg.\u201d) Then $1.8 trillion is simply divided by the number of American households. Presto, each household \u201cpays\u201d $14,974 annually in a hidden regulatory tax.\n\nThose aren\u2019t our quotation marks around \u201cpays.\u201d That\u2019s exactly how it appears in the report. The word \u201cspent\u201d also appears in quotation marks when the report tries to argue that \u201cmore is \u2018spent\u2019 on embedded regulation than on health care, food, transportation, entertainment, apparel and services, and savings. Embedded regulatory costs can be said to absorb up to 29 percent of the typical household\u2019s expenditure budget.\u201d\n\nLook at cars, for example. Seat belts are a regulation, but they also result in fewer deaths, which is presumably a benefit. Higher fuel-economy standards raise the initial cost of a car, but also result in savings on gasoline over time. (Note: We have previously faulted President Obama for touting the benefits of fuel-economy standards, without mentioning the costs.)\n\nIt could well be that the costs exceed the benefits (though the annual Office of Management and Budget annual report on the issue frequently shows benefits far exceeding costs) but it seems to make little sense to completely ignore the cost side of the ledger. The \u201cCostberg\u201d report makes impassioned defense of the need not to consider benefits, but also, somewhat tongue in cheek, admits its tally consists of \u201capples and oranges,\u201d \u201chaphazard distinction between consumer and employer impacts,\u201d \u201cold data sets\u201d and the like.\n\nAnnie Dwyer, a CEI spokeswoman, pointed out that the $1.8 trillion is similar to a $1.7 trillion estimate made by a study for the Small Business Administration and a $2 trillion estimate made by National Association of Manufacturers. Four years ago, The Fact Checker had looked at the SBA study, and both the SBA study and the NAM study have the same limitation of looking only at the cost side of the ledger. (The NAM study, however, appears to have a more sophisticated effort at trying to estimate the impacts of regulations on various sizes of businesses, rather than a broad-brush per-household figure.)\n\nDwyer said \u201cit was a good question to ask\u201d about the benefits, but insisted it was a complex undertaking and not enough information is available. \u201cWe are not saying that someone should not do the same analysis for benefits,\u201d she said. \u201cCEI would support more cost-benefits analysis.\u201d (OMB, in its congressionally mandated report, focuses on major regulations over a 10-year period; it does not consider rules issued by independent agencies which, after all, are not bound by administration policy.)\n\nDwyer added that the CEI report was not suggesting that the $15,000 figure was direct cost that families had to pay. \u201cCEI does not say households actually pay this much money out of pocket \u2013 that\u2019s why the word is in quotation marks (\u2018pay\u2019) \u2013 because regulatory costs are embedded and spread across the economy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to explain a really complicated topic.\u201d\n\nWhen we had looked at SBA figure of $1.7 trillion back in 2011, we noted that Thomas Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, added this useful caveat when he cited it: \u201cNow, look, many of these rules we need, they\u2019re important for the economy, and we support them.\u201d In other words, he conceded that there were indeed benefits to the regulations and that such benefits need to be acknowledged.\n\nThe $15,000 figure has serious methodological problems \u2014 even the report admits it is \u201cnot scientific\u201d and \u201cback of the envelope\u201d \u2014 and we fear these caveats are being forgotten as it is repeated in Capitol Hill news conferences and then in news reports.\n\nIn blindly citing the $15,000 figure as a \u201cburden,\u2019 without realizing its limitations or even admitting that there are indeed benefits that might offset at least some of the costs, lawmakers are making a misleading statement worthy of at least Two Pinocchios. These talking points are incomplete without a Donohue-like caveat.", "lang": "en"}
