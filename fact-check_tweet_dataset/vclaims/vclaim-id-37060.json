No, that's not true: Eric Holder is maintaining his innocence and his lawyer is preparing to defending him in a murder trial for the shooting death of Nipsey Hussle. There is no sourcing for a report that Holder is claiming he was hired by Los Angeles police to carrying out a hit on the popular musical artist.\n\nThe story originated from an article (archived here) where it was published on April 19, 2019 under the title \"Eric Holder Says The Government Offered Him 75K To Kill Nipsey Hussle\". It opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nContrary to the claim in this report, Holder has not made any statements or given any indication that he planned to admit to the shooting and blame the LAPD for offering him a payoff. His public defender lawyer, in fact, was in court on May 31, 2019 for a hearing in advance of a jury trial for the case. Holder is jailed in lieu of $6.5 million bail as he awaits trial.\n\n\n\nThe fake report offered no sourcing and just speculation about why police would want to have Hussle killed and why they would have relied on Holder to carry it out without pointing the finger back at them. The report suggested the LAPD wanted to ignite a gang \"turf war\" in Los Angeles:\n\nThe Los Angeles Times offered this explanation of why police believe Holder killed Hussle:\n\nPolice have been tight-lipped about their investigation other than to say that Holder had gotten into a dispute with Hussle earlier on the day he was shot. Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said investigators believed the shooting was the result of a \"personal matter between the two of them,\" but he has not elaborated. Video of the shooting was captured by a nearby security camera.\n\nThe false report incuded an embedded YouTube video with the same time. It offered no additional details.\n\nThe publisher listed this description of itself at the bottom of the article:\n\nOpus Magnum #1 Urban News Channel is quickly becoming a well known and respected brand With over 1.2 Million followers across our social networks, and website hits surpassing 1 million a month, we are rapidly establishing our place in the Media.
