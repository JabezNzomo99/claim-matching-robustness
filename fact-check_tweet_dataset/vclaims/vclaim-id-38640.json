The top court, however, refused to hear the case until the matter of Mander\u2019s alleged \u2018derogatory\u2019 comments against the judiciary is sorted.\n\nAkhilesh Mishra, former director of BJP government\u2019s online citizen engagement initiative \u2018MyGov India\u2019, referred to the alleged comments in a tweet. Mishra shared the affidavit filed by DCP Delhi police (legal cell) against Harsh Mander in the Supreme Court. The plea, among other things, claimed that the social activist instigated violence. Mishra wrote, \u201cThe wheels of justice have started turning. All those who plotted to unleash violence on the \u201cstreets\u201d and subvert India\u2019s democracy will have to face justice.\u201d\n\nBJP spokesperson Sambit Patra shared a part of the speech in question and wrote, \u201cHe is the real rioter who is instigating people to come out in the streets and carry out violence.\u201d\n\nIn the video, Mander can be heard saying, \u201cThis fight will not be won in the Supreme Court. We have been observing the Supreme Court since some time now in the cases of NRC, Ayodhya and Kashmir. Supreme Court has failed to uphold humanism, equality and secularism. We will keep trying in the Supreme Court, it is our Supreme Court, but the decision will neither happen in the Parliament nor in the Supreme Court. What will be the future of this country \u2013 you all are the youth \u2013 what sort of country do you want to leave for your kids \u2013 where will this decision happen? One, it will happen on the streets, we have come out on the streets\u2026\u201d \u2013 before the clip is stopped mid-way.\n\nOpIndia penned an article on Mander\u2019s speech that sparked controversy. The right-wing website wrote, \u201cWatch: \u201cSupreme Court did not save secularism in Ayodhya, so now time has come to hit the streets\u201d Harsh Mander inciting mob violence\u201d\n\nSeveral others claimed that Mander instigated violence during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya tweeted the clip and attributed the following words to Mander \u2013 \u201cNow the decision will not be taken in the Parliament or the SC. SC did not protect secularism at the time of Ayodhya and Kashmir which is why the decision will now be taken on the streets.\n\nBased on Malviya\u2019s tweet Free Press Journalwrote an article titled, \u201cSC didn\u2019t defend secularism, we have to take decisions on the streets: Activist Harsh Mander stirs controversy.\u201d The BJP IT cell chief\u2019s tweet was also featured in a Hindi report by Zee Newsand a Marathi report by Lokmat. Others associated with the BJP who shared the video were Haryana IT cell head Arun Yadav, Karnataka tourism minister CT Ravi and Rahul Kaushik who describes himself as a \u2018swayamsevak\u2019 on Twitter.\n\nHarsh Mander\u2019s speech that stirred controversy was made on December 16, 2019, at Jamia Milia Islamia. The address focused on how every Indian has equal rights in the country. It was made after students were thrashed by Delhi police inside the university campus. At 3:40 minutes into the speech, Mander said, \u201cThose who claim to take your rights away from you, in response to them, a wave of protests have started in the country, and these protests are to save our constitution, and the soul of the constitution which is love and friendship, and which is why we all are out on the streets and will continue to do so. This fight will not be won in the Parliament because political parties which call themselves secular have no moral courage left in them to fight. This fight will also not be won in the Supreme Court\u2026\u201d\n\nThe above excerpt was said right before the part which is viral.\n\n\u201cWhat will be the future of this country \u2013 you all are the youth \u2013 what sort of country do you want to leave for your kids \u2013 where will this decision happen? One, it will happen on the streets, we have come out on the streets, but even beyond the streets, there\u2019s another place where this decision will take place. Which is the place in which this fight will eventually be decided? That is in our hearts, in my heart, in your heart, we have to give a response \u2013 if they want to fill our hearts with hate, if we respond with hate, hatred will become deeper\u201d \u2013 was Mander\u2019s statement, starting at 5:25 minutes, after his address was abruptly stopped in the viral clip.\n\nHe continued to say, \u201cIf someone is attempting to bring darkness to the country, and we also do the same in order to fight, then the darkness will only become more severe. If there\u2019s darkness, then the only way that can be fought is by lighting a lamp. And if there\u2019s a huge storm, we will light a lamp against the darkness. The only answer we have to their hate is love. They will resort to violence, they will instigate us to indulge in violence but we will never carry out any violence. You must understand that it is their plan to instigate you towards violence so that when we commit 2% violence, they respond with 100%. We have learnt from Gandhi ji how to respond to violence and injustice. We will fight with non-violence. Anyone who instigates you toward violence or hatred, they are not your friends.\u201d\n\nQuite evidently, Mander was not instigating violence but advocating for a non-violent approach to fight injustice. Karwan e Mohabbat also tweeted the relevant portion where the context of his speech hasn\u2019t been distorted.\n\nTherefore, a clipped video was presented by members of the BJP and amplified by certain media outlets to portray that Harsh Mander\u2019s reference to \u201ccoming out in the streets\u201d promoted violence. Contrary to claims, the social activist said that people need to come out to protect the soul of the Constitution, which was founded on the ideals of love. He also stated that people can only be won over by love, not hate and the only way to fight injustice is through non-violence.\n\n[Update: Sambit Patra\u2019s tweet was added to this report on March 5, 2020.]", "lang": "en"}
