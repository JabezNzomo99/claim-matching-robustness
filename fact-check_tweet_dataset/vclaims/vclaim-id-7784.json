He also pointed to NATO exercises featuring scenarios of a military confrontation with Russia, saying: \u201cWe carefully watch every NATO exercise and take steps accordingly.\u201d\n\nThe remarks follow statements by Colonel General Leonid Ivashov, a former top Russian Defense Ministry official, who claimed in November that NATO and the United States were preparing to start a war with Russia. Polygraph.info fact-checked and debunked his claims.\n\nContrary to the statements by Shoigu and Ivashov, NATO\u2019s presence in the region appears insignificant compared to Russia\u2019s substantial military buildup on its western flank.\n\nMoreover, the NATO deployments, announced in 2016, are rotational and defensive. They were initiated as a deterrence tool in response to Russia\u2019s military actions in Ukraine and Georgia, and only serve as \u201ctripwires\u201d in case of a Russian attack, which would require significant reinforcements.\u200b\n\nThe deployments are specifically designed to fill gaps in the deterrence posture of the alliance, beset as it is by low military spending and the weaker military capabilities of its eastern members.\n\nDescribing the conventional threat from Russia as \u201creal,\u201d Brian Hook, a senior U.S. foreign policy adviser, said on November 17 at a forum by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, DC that the \u201cmilitary arrangement of forces in Europe favors Russia.\u201d\n\nIn his testimony before a U.S. Senate committee in 2016, U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley underscored that the U.S. military is \u201ctechnically outranged, outgunned\u201d by Russia\u2019s military in Europe.\n\nAs for manpower, only 64,440 U.S. troops were deployed in Europe at the end of 2016, a significant reduction from the 285,000 deployed at the end of the Cold War. Meanwhile, the number of NATO troops in the four multinational groups deployed in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia stands at just 4,760 personnel. The overall number of NATO troops there is 7,200.\n\nCommenting on the deployments, Steven Pifer, an arms control expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC, underlined that the battalions \u201care not going to invade Russia.\u201d They \u201cprovide tripwires\u201d and would require reinforcements to repel a Russian attack, let alone prevail in a major conflict, he explained.\n\nAccording to Richard Sokolsky, who was a member of the U.S. Secretary of State\u2019s Policy Planning Office from 2005 to 2015, this \u201cthin tripwire force\u201d could prove sufficient in deterring Russia, as a similar force did in West Berlin during the Cold War. \u201cFrom NATO\u2019s perspective, this is a prudent approach that serves to bolster deterrence and reassure the Baltic states without presenting a significant military menace right up against Russia\u2019s borders,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSome of Russia\u2019s own experts dismiss or downplay Moscow\u2019s military threat assessments.\n\nSergey Samuilov with the Russian Academy of Sciences\u2019 Institute of the USA and Canada says Russia should treat the deployments calmly: \u201cToday their number [U.S. forces in Europe] is about 60 thousand. With such a potential, the Americans and NATO will not attack Russia.\u201d\n\nProkhor Tebin, an international security expert, argues that NATO\u2019s presence in eastern Europe does not threaten Russia directly. However, he cautions that this development represents \u201can alarming and vexing factor\u201d if one considers the deployment of U.S. missile defense systems in Europe and disagreements over the INF Treaty. (Polygraph.info previously examined mutual Russian and U.S. allegations of violations of the treaty in fact-check 1 and fact-check 2.)\n\nNevertheless, Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine have strained Russia-NATO ties. In 2016, Russia planned to form three new divisions in response to NATO deployments. A year later, it announced plans to create 20 new units along its western borders by the end of 2017. Russian tanks currently outnumber both U.S. and NATO ones in Europe. And, as of early 2017, Russia had 22 maneuver battalions in the Western Military District and three in Kaliningrad.\n\nSokolsky says NATO can ready 17 battalions for an \u201cinitial forward defense,\u201d besides its four deployed battalions. While these capabilities are not insignificant, he notes that Russia enjoys numerical and qualitative advantages in a number of areas, including heavy armor, artillery, surface-to-surface missiles, combat aircraft and assault helicopters.\n\nAccording to Sokolsky, the current dynamics in Eastern Europe present a classic security dilemma, whereby one side\u2019s defensive moves are seen as threatening by the other. Therefore, he points out, NATO emphasizes a dual-track approach of deterrence and dialogue with Moscow.", "lang": "en"}
