The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office\u2019s work and conclusions. We communicated that concern to the Department on the morning of March 25. There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations.\u201d\n\u2022 None On March 5, at a meeting that included Barr and Mueller, the special counsel said the introductions and executive summaries of his two-volume report accurately summarized his investigation and conclusions.\n\u2022 None On March 22, Mueller submitted his 448-page report to Barr.\n\u2022 None On March 24, Mueller\u2019s team reiterated to Justice Department officials that the introductions and executive summaries were accurate.\n\u2022 None Later in the day on March 24, Barr publicly released a letter relaying Mueller\u2019s bottom-line decision not to bring criminal charges against Trump. Barr declined to release the Mueller report\u2019s introductions or executive summaries, stating later that the redaction process was incomplete at the time and that he was concerned about releasing too much or too little information from the report.\n\u2022 None The next morning, March 25, the special counsel\u2019s office reached out to Justice Department officials with concerns about Barr\u2019s letter. Mueller sent a letter to the attorney general enclosing the introductions and executive summaries \u201cmarked with redactions.\u201d (This letter has not been released to the public.)\n\u2022 None On March 27, Mueller sent another letter to Barr, stating that the attorney general\u2019s March 24 letter \u201cdid not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office\u2019s work and conclusions\u201d and requesting that the introductions and executive summaries of his report be released.\n\u2022 None The next day, March 28, Barr read Mueller\u2019s letter, and the two had a phone conversation. The Washington Post reported a month later: \u201cIn that call, Mueller said he was concerned that media coverage of the obstruction probe was misguided and creating public misunderstandings about the office\u2019s work, according to Justice Department officials. Mueller did not express similar concerns about the public discussion of the investigation of Russia\u2019s election interference, the officials said. Barr has testified previously that he did not know whether Mueller supported his conclusion on obstruction.\u201d\n\u2022 None On April 3, the New York Times and Washington Post reported that some of Mueller\u2019s investigators were frustrated by Barr\u2019s limited disclosures about their work. The Post reported that \u201cmembers of Mueller\u2019s team have complained to close associates that the evidence they gathered on obstruction was alarming and significant,\u201d and more acute than Barr had indicated.\n\u2022 None On April 9, Barr testified before a House panel and took Crist\u2019s question.\n\u2022 None On April 10, Barr went before a Senate panel and took Van Hollen\u2019s question.\n\u2022 None On April 18, Barr released the full Mueller report with some redactions.\n\u2022 None On April 30, The Washington Post first reported on Mueller\u2019s letter dated March 27 and the subsequent phone call between the special counsel and attorney general.\n\u2022 None The next day, May 1, the Justice Department publicly released Mueller\u2019s letter from March 27 in full. Later that day, Barr gave testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and defended his responses to Crist and Van Hollen.\n\n\u201cAnd I said to him I wasn\u2019t interested,\u201d Barr said. \u201cAnd by the way, those summaries, even when he sent them, apparently, they actually required, later, more redaction because of the intelligence community. So, the fact is, we didn\u2019t have readily available summaries that had been fully vetted, but I made it clear to him I was not in the business of putting out periodic summaries, because a summary would start a whole public debate. It\u2019s by definition under-inclusive, and I thought what we should do is focus on getting the full report out as quickly as possible, which we did.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
