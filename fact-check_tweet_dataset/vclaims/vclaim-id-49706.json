Yes, this is a real flyer, but it is outdated advice that was revised after COVID-19 became more widespread. The mask recommendation has been revised and the flyer in this photo was last published in March 2020. It was replaced with an updated version in the infographic downloads available from their website.\n\nThe photo of a flyer appeared as a post (archived here) where it was published on July 7, 2020. The flyer titled, \"Protect Yourself and Others,\" has seven points and includes the website address and phone number of the Delaware Health and Social Services Division of Public Health.\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nLead Stories reached out to Martin Luta, the Chief of the Bureau of Communicable Diseases at the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services, he explained:\n\nThese are old graphics and have long since been replaced with updated guidance based on the Governor's Executive Order which required use of face coverings (April 25). None of the graphics/flyers (in the Facebook post in question) exist on our webpages or social media postings.\n\nThere was a period of time when face coverings for healthy people were not recommended by the CDC. On March 9, 2020 the Facebook Page of the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) shared this infographic (here)(archived here). Lead Stories marked this outdated infographic to avoid any confusion.\n\nThe CDC guideline was revised in early April of 2020. This CBS News clip (here)(archived here) shows the April 3, 2020 press briefing from the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Surgeon General Jerome Adams steps up to the mic (about 1:07 into the video clip after President Trump speaks) to explain the changes in the guidelines:\n\nAfter this policy was updated, The Delaware Department of Health and Social Services posted this new infographic to their Facebook Page. (here)(archived here) The graphic is dated April 8, 2020.\n\nThe 'Guidance for Face Coverings' page of the Delaware Health and Social Services Coronavirus Response can be found (here)(archived here). Highlighted in the document is this from the Governor:\n\nThe Delaware Department of Health and Social Services has made many Coronavirus infographics available to share on social media, in English, Spanish and Haitian Creole language. The downloadable graphics are available (here)(archived here).\n\nThe current infographic flyer produced by Delaware Health and Social Services (here)(archived here) it is not identical to the flyer in the Facebook post. This flyer has six points and finishes by stating that Delawareans must wear cloth face coverings in public:\n\u2022 Do not touch your face\n\u2022 Cough or sneeze into your elbow\n\u2022 Stay home when you are sick\n\u2022 You must wear cloth face coverings in public\n\nLead Stories has fact checked many misleading claims about feace masks, including these most recently:\n\nFact Check: Walmart Can And Does Require All Shoppers To Wear Face Masks; 'Reference Number' Will Not Exempt You\n\nFact Check: People Not Wearing Masks Can NOT Be Reported to (281) 330-8004\n\nFact Check: The CDC Did NOT Say That Cloth Masks 'Do Not Filter Anything' And Wearing One 'Risks Your Health'\n\nFact Check: Truck Driver NOT Found Dead With COVID-19 On California Highway With Load Of COVID-19 Contaminated Face Masks\n\nFact Check: Wearing A Mask Does NOT Remove Your Ability To Legally Carry A Concealed Carry Weapon\n\nFact Check: Test Does NOT Show Face Masks Cause Oxygen Levels To Drop Into The 'Danger Zone'\n\nFact Check: Ear Loop Masks Meant To Protect Others From Coronavirus (NOT Yourself)\n\nFact Check: Meme Claiming Five Reasons Not To Wear A Face Mask Is Misleading", "lang": "en"}
