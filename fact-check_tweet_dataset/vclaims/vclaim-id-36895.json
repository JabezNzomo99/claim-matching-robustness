This found that of 5,304 patients seen from January to December 2005, all older than 16, there were 349 deaths. Sixty (25.8%) of them were from \u201call forms of stroke\u201d. It did not say how many were diagnosed with stroke.\n\u2022 None at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital from 1982 to 2001. Half (52%) of the 252 deaths linked to high blood pressure were due to stroke.\n\u2022 None of 200 unconscious adult patients at the from August 2004 to March 2005. A third of them were diagnosed with acute stroke, which was the most common cause of the patients\u2019 coma.\n\u2022 None , in 2011, of 66 of the adults diagnosed as having had a stroke in the previous research at the\n\u2022 None to see if hospital admission after hours or over weekends resulted in higher death rates. Out of 339 patients, 55.7% (187) had suffered a stroke. But the 339 patients accounted for 34.5% of all admissions in the study period.\n\u2022 None admitted into the accident and emergency department of the Federal Medical Centre in Ekiti state from January 2010 to December 2012. Heart failure was of admission with 329 patients, followed by stroke with 283 patients. \n\n\n\nWe asked several experts if this evidence supported the claim.\n\nHospital, reviewed the papers shared with us. More evidence was needed, he said.\n\n\u201cOne would need to look for articles on medical admissions as a whole out of which the percentage that form stroke patients can be determined.\u201d\n\nBello said stroke was a common medical emergency, but if primary, secondary and tertiary health centres were all considered, it was unlikely to be the most common.\n\nagreed that a comprehensive survey would be required.\n\n\u201cIn my field, I believe the most common medical emergency is head injury. For a neurologist, it is stroke. Each medical field has its most common medical emergency,\u201d Odebode said.\n\n\u201cMedical emergency is a broad topic. If the claim was that stroke is the most common neurological emergency then I would say it is true,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFor adult internal medicine, which is a subspecialty in medical emergency, the claim you are fact-checking is true. However, there are other subspecialties in medical emergency.\u201d\n\nother emergencies were more common. These included cardiac failure, severe hypertension,\n\nBut Akande added that the claim could be true for specific age groups and hospital settings.\n\nmany studies showed stroke was the leading cause of medical admission in adults and elderly patients in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is equally the most common neurological diagnosis warranting admissions\n\n, a consultant paediatrician, said stroke was the most common medical emergency \u201camong adults\u201d. But \u201cin children, I would say febrile convulsion\u201d or seizure was most common.\n\nBased on this, we rate this claim as unproven.\n\nThe Nigerian Stroke Society\u2019s Ogun directed us to\n\non admissions for neurological diseases in Kano, which he said was Nigeria\u2019s most populous state.\n\nOut of 6,282 admissions at the\n\nAminu Kano Teaching Hospital from January 2005 to September 2008, some 980 were for neurological diseases. The study found stroke accounted for 77.6% of these.\n\n, said the figure would likely change from one healthcare facility to another.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t state for a fact that stroke accounts for up to eight out of 10 neurological admissions. It varies.\u201d\n\nYakub Nyandaiti, a professor of neurology at the college of medical sciences,\n\n\u201cFindings or the data from the hospital (mentioned in the claim) is not a general picture of what is going on in all hospitals in Nigeria. Also, a claim must have a time frame. That is, the claim should read in the last five to 10 years, or something,\u201d he said.\n\nAs admissions at one hospital are not representative of \u2018most hospitals\u2019 in Nigeria, we rate this claim as misleading.\n\nOther organisations have given different figures. In\n\nas saying that \u201cin Nigeria, stroke continues to affect 200,000 people annually\u201d. We have asked her for the source of this statistic.\n\nin the Lancet journal also made an estimate of 200,000 new cases, adding that Nigeria did not yet have a national stroke registry.\n\nOgun told Africa Check that his number was likely \u201cunderestimated\u201d, which was why he said \u201cat least\u201d.\n\nin the Surulere Local Government Area of Lagos state.\n\nThis focused on 189 first-ever cases of stroke, which were then adjusted for age to allow for comparisons, to find an incidence rate of 54.08 cases per 100,000 people a year.\n\nthe most up to date reference we have on the incidence of stroke in Nigeria\u201d, he said.\n\nOgun said that with \u201c\n\nNigeria\u2019s 2019 population being estimated at over\n\nthe number of incidents (new) stroke cases will be at least 108,000 per year\u201d.\n\n, with a census last conducted in 2006.\n\n\u201csufficient since it is an estimate derived from incidence reported\u201d.\n\nBello asked us to check further\n\nat the University of Washington in the US.\n\nWHO communications officer Paul Garwood told Africa Check the organisation did not have specific data on the number of new cases of stroke in Nigeria in a year. It only had data on how many deaths were due to cerebrovascular disease, he said. But this didn\u2019t cover Nigeria.\n\n, who heads the neurology section at the global burden of diseases study, told Africa Check that their\n\nshowed that there were \u201cover 149,000\u201d new strokes in Nigeria. This could have been as high as 167,000 or as low as 133,000.\n\nWe therefore rate Ogun\u2019s claim of \u2018at least 100,000\u2019 as correct.", "lang": "en"}
