His comment also attracted the attention of other reporters. We were especially taken with Collins\u2019s reference to \u201ca massive amount of money\u201d earned by Hunter Biden \u2014 earnings that were news to many witnesses. That sounded a lot like the probes that lawmakers such as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) have said are necessary.\n\nREP. ELISE STEFANIK (R-N.Y.): But let\u2019s take a first \u2014 a step back. The first time you personally became aware of Burisma was actually when you were being prepared by the Obama State Department for your Senate confirmation hearings. And this was in the form of practiced questions and answers, this was your deposition. And you testified that in this particular practice Q&A with the Obama State Department, it wasn\u2019t just generally about Burisma and corruption, it was specifically about Hunter Biden and Burisma. Is that correct?\n\nSTEFANIK: And the exact quote from your testimony, Ambassador, is, quote, \u201cThe way the question was phrased in this model Q&A was, what can you tell us about Hunter Biden\u2019s, you know, being named to the board of Burisma?\u201d So for the millions of Americans watching, President Obama\u2019s own State Department was so concerned about potential conflicts of interest from Hunter Biden\u2019s role at Burisma that they raised it themselves while prepping this wonderful ambassador nominee before her confirmation.\n\nREP. JOHN RATCLIFFE, (R-TEX.): You understood from Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent\u2019s testimony, as it\u2019s been related to you, that he testified a few days ago, do you understand that that arrangement, Hunter Biden\u2019s role on the Burisma board, caused him enough concern that, as he testified in his statement, that \u201cin February of 2015, I raised my concern that Hunter Biden\u2019s status as a board member could create the perception of a conflict of interest.\u201d He went on to talk about the Vice President\u2019s responsibilities over the Ukraine and \u2014 or over Ukraine \u2014 Ukrainian policy as one of those factors. Do you recall that?\n\nSTEFANIK: Well I know \u2014 I know that my constituents in New York 21 have many concerns about the fact that Hunter Biden, the son of the vice president, sat on the board of a corrupt company like Burisma. The Obama Administration, State Department was also concerned and yet Adam Schiff refuses to allow this committee to call Hunter Biden despite our requests. Every witness who has testified and has been asked this has answered yes. Do you agree that Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma has the potential for the appearance of a conflict of interest?\n\n\u201cRanking Member Collins meant what he said: People have testified that the relationship between Hunter Biden and Burisma needed to be looked at. At the very least, Hunter Biden\u2019s position on the board of Burisma deserved consideration,\u201d Andrews, the communications director for House Judiciary Committee Republicans, said. \u201cThe ranking member didn\u2019t prescribe the who, what, or when of that consideration. Instead, he took his cue from testimony offered by Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent and Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who agreed that the matter needed to be addressed, specifically by the Office of Vice President Biden. Mr. Kent himself raised his \u2018concern that Hunter Biden\u2019s status as a board member could create the perception of a conflict of interest\u2019 with the Vice President\u2019s office. Ambassador Yovanovitch agreed with Mr. Kent\u2019s action. They agreed that the issue was concerning enough that it needed to be looked into, and Ranking Member Collins heard that concern.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
