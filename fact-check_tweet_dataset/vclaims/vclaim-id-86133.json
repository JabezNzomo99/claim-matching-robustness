I drank beer with my friends. Almost everyone did. Sometimes I had too many beers. Sometimes others did. I liked beer. I still like beer. But I did not drink beer to the point of blacking out, and I never sexually assaulted anyone.\u201d\n\nSarah Hepola, author of a memoir titled \u201cBlackout,\u201d wrote that blacking out is \u201ca temporary, alcohol-induced state in which you can remain functional and conversational, but later you will have no memory of what you did, almost as though your brain failed to hit the \u2018record\u2019 button.\u201d So if it could be established that Kavanaugh had ever blacked out during drinking, it would provide a possible explanation for Ford\u2019s vivid memory of an attack and his insistence that, if it happened, he was not involved.\n\nKavanaugh was a \u2018sloppy drunk\u2019 and surely had blackouts\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that while at Yale, he was a big partyer, often drank to excess. And there had to be a number of nights where he does not remember. In fact, I was witness to the night that he got tapped into that fraternity, and he was stumbling drunk in a ridiculous costume saying really dumb things. And I can almost guarantee that there's no way that he remembers that night.\u201d\n\nJames Roche, Kavanaugh\u2019s freshman-year roommate at Yale and now chief executive of a software company called Helix Re, issued a statement saying that Kavanaugh was \u201cwas a notably heavy drinker, even by the standards of the time, and that he became belligerent and aggressive when he was very drunk\u2026. I do remember Brett frequently drinking excessively and becoming incoherently drunk.\u201d Roche said he was unaware of the incident alleged by Ramirez but \u201cbased on my time with Brett, I believe that he and his social circle were capable of the actions that Debbie described.\u201d In Slate, Roche wrote: \u201cHe claimed that he occasionally drank too much but never enough to forget details of the night before, never enough to \u2018black out.\u2019 He did, regularly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt Yale, and I can speak to no other times, Brett was a frequent drinker, and a heavy drinker,\u201d Ludington said. \u201cI know, because, especially in our first two years of college, I often drank with him. On many occasions I heard Brett slur his words and saw him staggering from alcohol consumption, not all of which was beer. When Brett got drunk, he was often belligerent and aggressive. On one of the last occasions I purposely socialized with Brett, I witnessed him respond to a semi-hostile remark, not by defusing the situation, but by throwing his beer in the man\u2019s face and starting a fight.\u201d The New York Times reported that a police report showed Kavanaugh was questioned in the incident but was not arrested.\n\nKavanaugh drank but was not a \u2018stumbling drunk\u2019\n\nDan Murphy, a Yale roommate, said in a statement distributed by the White House: \u201cI never saw Brett black out or not be able to remember the prior evening\u2019s events, nor did I ever see Brett act aggressive, hostile, or in a sexually aggressive manner to women. Brett was and is a good-natured, kind, and friendly person, to men and women. The behavior I\u2019ve heard other people want to attribute to him, but from people who did not live with Brett and therefore not in the same position to observe, is simply wrong, and such behavior is incompatible with what I know to be true.\u201d\n\nBrookes, in her CNN interview, recounted that \u201cI do remember one party in particular where both Brett and Chris Dudley were very drunk. And they thought it would be really funny to barge into a room where a guy and girl had gone off together and embarrass that woman. Chris Dudley was, I believe, the one that went in under the egging on of Brett Kavanaugh, and they thought it was funny. The girl was mortified and I was furious. So, I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s the best character witness.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
