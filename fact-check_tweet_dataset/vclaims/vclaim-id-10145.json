So, naturally, any reduction in tax rates is going to mostly benefit wealthier Americans. The House plan does expand a child tax credit and double the standard deduction to shift some tax savings to working Americans. Even so, any broad-based reduction in taxes is still going to mostly benefit the wealthy.\n\nSecond, what\u2019s a definition of \u201crich\u201d? As the New York Times Upshot reported, people define \u201crich\u201d depending on how much money they make. A YouGov survey found that households earning between $30,000 and $60,000 believe \u201crich\u201d was $394,000 \u2014 while households making above $120,000 thought it was $501,000. Given Trump\u2019s claimed wealth, he might define \u201crich\u201d as even higher.\n\nThe JCT analysis (which does not include the impact of the estate tax repeal) shows how the taxpayers with incomes over $1 million would see their tax cuts grow over the course of the tax bill, from 2019 to 2027, while all other income groups would see their tax cuts dwindle or even turn into tax increases. (This is mainly because of expiring provisions for the middle class that Republicans claim would be retained in future tax bills, but there\u2019s no guarantee.)\n\nNot everyone in the upper echelon is a winner. TPC found that nearly 31 percent of the tax units in the top 0.1 percent would face a tax increase \u2014 but that\u2019s about the same as every other income group except for the lowest-income taxpayers.\n\nAlternative Minimum Tax repeal. The AMT increasingly has snared families in the upper middle class, especially if they live in high-tax states or have many children. The House bill calls for eliminating the itemized deduction for state and local taxes (except property taxes), as well as the personal/dependent exemptions, which are key add-ons when calculating the AMT. So it\u2019s possible that for many people it would be a wash, or even a net loser, depending on whether a tax filer lives in a state with high taxes.\n\nBut for the rich, especially the uber-rich, the AMT can be a real burden. In 2014, the top 400 taxpayers paid nearly $700 million because of the alternative minimum tax, nearly 2.5 percent of the total, according to IRS records. The one recent tax return of President Trump that has leaked \u2014 for 2005 \u2014 shows his tax bill increased $31 million because of the AMT.\n\nNew pass-through rate. This sounds arcane, but it could mean big gains for passive investors, including more than 500 Trump entities, according to our colleague Steven Mufson. The JCT says the provision, which will slash the top rate from 39.6 percent to 25 percent for pass-through entities, will reduce revenue by $448 billion over 10 years.\n\nA host of small and medium businesses \u2014 including service providers such as doctors, lawyers, dentists, architects and accountants \u2014 would be blocked from obtaining any benefit. But it would be a boon for NFL owners and also Jeffrey P. Bezos, currently the world\u2019s wealthiest man and owner of The Washington Post (which is part of a pass-through entity called Nash Holdings). The billionaire Koch Brothers would also benefit. Officially, the House bill would levy a 39.6 percent rate on incomes of couples over $1 million, but this provision would allow the rich to sidestep that rate and instead be taxed at a much lower rate.\n\nEstate tax repeal. Trump conceded this point but suggested it was necessary because the rich do so poorly otherwise. As The Fact Checker reported, however, the estate-tax provision is even more generous than Trump\u2019s own campaign plan. That\u2019s because it essentially allows heirs to avoid paying any taxes on gains in value that took place when an asset was held by a decedent. So potentially tens of billions of untapped capital gains would remain beyond the reach of the U.S. government. Repealing the estate tax, paid by just 5,500 estates a year, would reduce revenues about $35 billion a year after it takes effect in 2024, according to JCT.\n\nContrary to the president\u2019s claim, the tax plan is not \u201cso bad\u201d for the wealthy. In fact, no matter how you slice it, the superwealthy do rather well under the House GOP proposal. As we have said, that\u2019s largely because they already pay a large chuck of income taxes already.\n\nTrump could actually make the distribution tables look better if he pushed to keep the AMT in place for incomes above $1 million and the estate tax in place for estates larger than $11 million. The failure to do so underscores the fact that this tax plan is not only for the middle class.", "lang": "en"}
