The alleged quote, which has been repeatedly used to discredit Biden, is missing context.\n\nSome of the iterations of the seven second ad, whose title and copy vary, are visible here , here , here and here\n\nThe videos are sponsored by the Committee to Defend the President, an organization which describes itself as \u201cdefending President Trump and his \u2018America First\u2019 agenda \u2013 and supporting those who enact it.\u201d ( here ) The videos carry a disclaimer at the end reading: \u201cPaid for by the Committee to Defend the President which is responsible for the content of this message. Not authorized by any candidate or candidate\u2019s committee. www.committeetodefendthepresident.com\u201d\n\nTwo seconds into the video, the narrator says that Biden \u201crepeated the N-word twice on camera,\u201d while on-screen text reads, \u201cWe don\u2019t need any more [N-word] bigshots\u201d \u2013 C-SPAN 6/5/1985\u201d\n\nAs presented, the video implies that the words spoken by Biden were his own opinions, when actually he was quoting a white legislator and trying to expose the comments as racist.\n\nIt is not the first time that this quote is taken out of context to criticize Biden ( here ). Reuters Fact Check recently debunked a misleading compilation of Biden footage that included this clip, visible here\n\nThe alleged quote was part of a confidential staff memorandum that Biden referenced on several occasions ( bit.ly/38kHeMo ) at William Reynolds\u2019 nomination for becoming Associate Attorney General on June 4 and June 5, 1985. Moments captured on camera of Biden mentioning the quote are visible here ( cs.pn/2ZRBRSz , minute 1:29:15) and here ( cs.pn/3fUto6x , minute 17:14).\n\nDuring the two-day hearing, Biden quoted these words from a white legislator who opposed the Louisiana redistricting plan in 1981, a case that was criticized for being biased against Black people. Biden mentioned the case to argue against Reynolds\u2019s nomination ( here ).\n\nThe narration in the video claims Biden \u201cpraised KKK members\u201d, while on-screen text reads \u201cPraised KKK member Robert Byrd - BBC 07/03/10\u201d.\n\nThe video presumably refers to a BBC report published on July 3, 2010, visible www.bbc.co.uk/news/10497254 about Robert Byrd\u2019s memorial service, an event that was attended by then-President Barack Obama, Vice-President Joe Biden and former President Bill Clinton, among other political figures. The BBC article mentions that \u201cMr Clinton and Mr Biden both spoke in praise of Mr Byrd's dedication to serving the people who elected him,\u201d but includes no direct quotation of Biden\u2019s speech.\n\nDuring his speech visible here ( cs.pn/3fRQ1Zx , see minute 1:43:20), Biden described Byrd to be \u201cfiercely devoted\u201d to his principles and that he stood up \u201cfor the people he proudly was part of\u201d and for the constitution he revered.\n\nSenator Robert Byrd was a former member of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and expressed regret about it later in his life. In a 2005 interview, Byrd said \u201cI know now I was wrong. Intolerance had no place in America. I apologized a thousand times \u2026 and I don\u2019t mind apologizing over and over again. I can\u2019t erase what happened.\u201d (Read more here )\n\nA Reuters Fact Check going into more detail into Byrd\u2019s history is visible here .\n\nTHE COMMITTEE TO DEFEND THE PRESIDENT\n\nA breakdown of The Committee To Defend the President\u2019s Facebook Ad activity is visible here bit.ly/2CSLzuN .
