However, the bird is not an eagle, and the fish is not a shark.\n\nThis video was taken by Ashley White from a 17th-floor balcony in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, on June 22, 2020. A few days later, the video started to circulate on social media, along with various assumptions about what it showed.\n\nThe bird in this video is an osprey, not an eagle. These large raptors, also known as fish hawks or sea hawks, can grow to nearly two feet in height, and have wingspans that can stretch nearly seven feet wide. The fish in its talons is most likely a Spanish mackerel or a ladyfish, not a shark.\n\nEd Piotrowski, the chief meteorologist for WPDE ABC-15, a local news station in Myrtle Beach, shared this footage on Twitter, along with a message identifying the bird as an osprey and the fish as a Spanish mackerel:\n\n\u201cAshley White from Erwin, TN took this video from her hotel balcony of an osprey with a large spanish mackerel in its talons! Some think it\u2019s a condor with a great white. I like the way they think\u201d\n\nWhile the above-displayed video does not show a osprey carrying a shark, that sight wouldn\u2019t be too surprising. Ospreys are large birds that subsist on a diet of fish. According to the Seattle Audubon Society, these birds typically catch fish between 5 to 16 inches long. It is certainly possible for an osprey to catch, kill, and eat a small shark.\n\nIn fact, in 2018, a photographer managed to capture a set of images showing exactly that. Incredibly, Doc Jon\u2019s image also showed that the shark was carrying a fish. Yes, an osprey \u2014 carrying a shark \u2014 carrying a fish.", "lang": "en"}
