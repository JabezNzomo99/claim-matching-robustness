Never seen this before in recorded history.\"\n\nMr Sturgess is close to the mark.\n\nIn making the claim, he referred only to Queensland, so Fact Check examined only records for Queensland in assessing the claim.\n\nFact Check obtained daily records from the Bureau of Meteorology about bushfire danger since January 1950 for four south-east Queensland fire districts: Port Curtis; Moreton; Darling Downs; and Maranoa Warrego.\n\nThe records are a district average of the Forest Fire Danger Index for the day, which is comprised of data including temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and drought.\n\nThey showed the index reached unusually high levels for the time of year in south-east Queensland in the first eight days of September 2019.\n\nOn September 6, Maranoa Warrego, Darling Downs and Port Curtis recorded higher average FFDI values than at any time in those districts in any June, July, August or early September back to 1950.\n\nIn Maranoa Warrego and Darling Downs, the FFDIs recorded on September 6 were the two highest recorded between June 1 and September 8 of any year in any district.\n\nBut in the district of Moreton, stretching along the coast from the NSW border to the north of Brisbane, higher values than were recorded in early September were recorded in August 1991 and August 2004.\n\nHow do we measure fire danger?\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, a fire scientist named Alan McArthur devised a way to forecast the potential danger posed by bushfires in forested areas of Australia.\n\nIn the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Meter, first seen in operation in 1967, Mr McArthur combined measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and fuel conditions with a formula to account for the effect of drought.\n\nThe drought formula considers how long it has been since it last rained and the amount of the last rainfall to assess how dry or moist the soil is, and therefore how combustible the fuel is likely to be. The fuel is the bark, leaves, and small branches accumulating in the landscape.\n\nMr McArthur used the measurements to create a Forest Fire Danger Index from one to 100, in which one represented the lowest risk and 100 the highest.\n\nThe meter is used by the Bureau of Meteorology and rural fire authorities in forecasting the likelihood and potential severity of bushfires.\n\nThe danger ratings are published on signs by the side of the road as well as the news media.\n\nThe bureau develops the danger ratings in consultation with state fire authorities. Other risk factors may be considered when determining a fire danger rating, but the Forest Fire Danger Index is a major factor.\n\nWhen the index was introduced, the range of 1 to 100 was translated into five danger ratings: Low; Moderate; High; Very High; and Extreme.\n\nAfter the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria in February 2009, the system was revised nationally to include index values above 100 and new ratings categories.\n\nThe Queensland government adopted two new categories in September 2009: Catastrophic representing index values above 100; and Severe between Very High and Extreme. Low and Moderate were combined, leaving six categories.\n\n*Victoria uses the term \"Code Red\" instead of \"Catastrophic\".\n\u2022 Low-moderate: a fire that can be easily controlled and poses little or no risk to life or property.\n\u2022 High: a fire that can be controlled, where loss of life is unlikely and damage to property will be limited.\n\u2022 Very high: a fire that can be difficult to control, with flames that may burn into the tree-tops. During a fire of this type, some homes and businesses may be damaged or destroyed.\n\u2022 Severe: a fire that may be uncontrollable and move quickly, with flames that may be higher than roof tops. A severe fire may cause injuries and some homes or businesses may be destroyed.\n\u2022 Extreme: a fire that may be uncontrollable, unpredictable and fast moving. The flames will be higher than roof tops. During an extreme fire, people may be injured and homes and businesses may be destroyed.\n\u2022 Catastrophic: a fire that may be uncontrollable, unpredictable and fast moving. The flames will be higher than roof tops. Many people may be injured and many homes and businesses may be destroyed.\n\nFor fires expected to be in the \"extreme\" and \"catastrophic\" categories, even well-constructed homes that are well-prepared for fires are no longer safe, and residents are warned that leaving is the only option for survival.\n\nMr Sturgess made his claim at a media conference about the bushfires that had broken out in south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales.\n\nHe referred only to Queensland, so Fact Check has not examined records for New South Wales in assessing his claim.\n\nHe mentioned the Queensland towns of Applethorpe, around 200km south west of Brisbane, and Sarabah, 90km south of Brisbane.\n\nHe closed his remarks by saying: \"So this is an omen if you will, a warning of the fire season we are likely to see ahead in the south eastern parts of the state, the driest parts of the state, where most of our population is.\"\n\nGiven this context, Fact Check has assessed the claim against historical records for south-east Queensland.\n\nMr Sturgess made his claim on September 8 and said \"at this time of the year\".\n\nAfter making the claim at the media conference he said: \"Fire weather has never been as severe this early in spring.\"\n\nGiven this context, Fact Check has assessed the claim against historical records for the months of June, July, August and the first eight days of September.\n\nIn other words, Fact Check considers \"this time of the year\" and \"this early in spring\" to refer to any time after temperatures begin rising from their winter lows.\n\nWhat data is available?\n\nFact Check approached the Bureau of Meteorology, who suggested a dataset of averages for four south-east Queensland fire danger districts \u2014 Darling Downs, Maranoa Warrego, Moreton and Port Curtis \u2014 that are based on the bureau's rainfall districts, published on its website.\n\nThe dataset was developed by bureau researcher Andrew Dowdy. It begins in 1950 and divides Australia into a grid of approximately 5km by 5km.\n\nAn index value is recorded for each grid point for each day, using the maximum temperature for the day, humidity at 3pm, the afternoon wind speed and a drought factor.\n\nThe bureau told Fact Check the gridded dataset was \"intended for broad scale analysis at a regional level\" and provided Fact Check with daily averages of the grid points in each district. It confirmed that the four districts being analysed were suitable for this regional analysis.\n\nAndy Pitman, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes at the University of New South Wales, said he would use data from individual weather stations in the target area.\n\nHe said there could be issues with averaging over a large area: \"If you average over an area you can imagine a situation where half a district beats all records, and half is low giving you an average that is lower than truly reflecting the values in one region.\"\n\nBut he said there was merit in BoM's approach, noting that the bureau may have a reason for suggesting it \"that makes it more appropriate to the data they know is reliable\".\n\n\"I do not think there is a right/wrong here,\" he told Fact Check in an email.\n\nHamish Clarke, a research fellow at the School of Atmospheric and Life Sciences at the University of Wollongong, said that using data from individual stations, as well as averaging gridded values, were both valid methodologies.\n\n\"An average value will always obscure higher and lower values ... You just need to be clear what you're reporting.\n\n\"Note, the same logic applies to station records: we assume that the weather station represents the average of the area surrounding it.\"\n\nBased on this advice, Fact Check has used daily district averages from the bureau's gridded dataset to assess the claim.\n\nWhat does the data show?\n\nThe bureau provided Fact Check with values for the Forest Fire Danger Index every day from the 1st of January, 1950, to the 30th of September, 2019 for four districts in south-east Queensland: Darling Downs; Maranoa Warrego; Moreton; and Port Curtis.\n\nEach value is an average of all the grid points in the district for that day.\n\nFact Check has plotted the data relevant to Mr Sturgess's claim on the graph below.\n\nAll values from the same date of each year are plotted in the same vertical column, illustrating their historical severity.\n\nThe highest value for 2019 (shown in red on the graph) between June 1 and September 8 occurred on September 6 for all four districts.\n\nDarling Downs recorded 71.97, Maranoa Warrego was 81.76, Moreton was 54.57 and Port Curtis was 51.54.\n\nFor Darling Downs, Maranoa Warrego and Port Curtis, these were higher than any value for the months of June, July, August or the first eight days of September in any year since 1950.\n\nFor Moreton, there were higher values on August 14, 2004 (65.28) and August 24, 1991 (55.88).\n\nLooking at the four districts as a single region, the September 6 records for Maranoa Warrego of 81.76 and Darling Downs of 71.97 were higher than any other day in this period.\n\nThe next highest (67.9) occurred in Maranoa Warrego on September 1, 1961.\n\nAs outlined by the bureau in a special climate statement on September 24, the event began on September 2, with a fire burning in Sarabah in the Gold Coast hinterland.\n\nOn September 5 and 6, south-east Queensland was hit by an almost record-breaking early season heatwave. The bureau said the soaring temperatures were \"generally second only to the exceptional winter heat\" of August 23 and 24, 2009.\n\nRainfall in the lead-up to September 2019 had been below average on a range of timescales from months to years, leading to a prolonged and severe drought.\n\nThe bureau said at almost all sites in south-east Queensland, the drought factor (the dryness of fuels) was at or near the highest value used for the Forest Fire Danger Index.\n\nFrom September 6, this combination of high temperatures, low humidity, strong winds and dry conditions led to elevated fire danger.\n\nThe Sarabah fire, having burned for several days, spread to Binna Burra on September 6. Fires also took hold around Stanthorpe and Applethorpe, with homes destroyed overnight.\n\nBy September 7, more than 50 fires were burning across Queensland, with the rainforest tourism property Binna Burra Lodge engulfed on the morning of September 8.\n\u2022 Bureau of Meteorology, Special Climate Statement 71, Severe fire weather conditions in south-east Queensland and north-east New South Wales in September 2019, 24 September 2019\n\u2022 Chiara M.
