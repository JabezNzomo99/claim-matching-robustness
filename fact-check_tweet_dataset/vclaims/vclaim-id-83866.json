Trump has made no such endorsement, and the video is a doctored version of footage showing the American president in October 2017, signing an executive order weakening the health reforms known as Obamacare.\n\nThe video, which has been shared more than 3,000 times, was posted with the caption: \u201cBreaking News from Capitol Hill, Washington D.C: United State President Donald Trump has officially endorsed Alh Atiku Abubakar as the incoming president of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe original version of the footage from October 2017 can be found on the official YouTube channel of the White House.\n\nMany viewers identified the fake Atiku endorsement as a doctored video or took it as a joke, though others took it seriously or questioned how the doctoring was possible.\n\n\u201cIs this really a photoshop? How is it possible! Pls someone I really want to know,\u201d read one comment under the video.\n\nNumerous meme generators can be found online which allow anyone to make Trump appear to sign anything they want -- sites which have been used to produce a large volume of jokes and satirical posts since he became US president in 2017.\n\nFor example, this meme generator was used to create the image below.\n\nThe Nigerian government has called on the international community not to interfere in the elections, although Foreign Minister Geoffrey Onyeama has said that impartial support in delivering a free and fair election is welcome.\n\nOn February 15 -- the eve of the initial election date before it was postponed until February 23 -- the US government said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had spoken with both President Muhammadu Buhari and his main rival Atiku.\n\n\u201cHe underscored U.S. support for the Nigerian goal of free, fair, transparent, and peaceful elections that reflect the will of the Nigerian people,\u201d the State Department said in a statement after the phone calls.", "lang": "en"}
