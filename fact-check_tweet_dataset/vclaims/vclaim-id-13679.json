It received over 700 shares.\n\n\u2018The Fearless Indian\u2019 is run by Devang Dave, who describes himself as the national convenor of IT and social media at the youth wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party, BJYM.\n\nThe quote ascribed to Priyanka Chaturvedi could not be located in any media reports. Alt News contacted the Congress spokesperson who informed that the quote was fake. \u201cThis shows the desperation of BJP pages and BJP-supporting pages to create a false narrative,\u201d she said.\n\nChaturvedi has often been targetted on social media in a similar fashion. Earlier, a false and provocative quote on Kashmir encounter was attributed to her. The Congress spokesperson and her daughter were, last year, threatened on social media over a fake quote.\n\nOther Congress leaders have also found themselves in the crosshairs of manufactured statements accredited to them. A clipped video of Ashok Gehlot was used to claim that the Rajasthan CM said that generating electricity will remove energy from water. Earlier, a statement made by Rahul Gandhi (\u2018Aloo ki factory\u2019) had been subjected to similar treatment following which the Congress president was ridiculed incessantly.", "lang": "en"}
