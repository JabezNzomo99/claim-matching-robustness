Charlie Crist is trying to pump up his conservative credentials.\n\nIn a new radio advertisement for his campaign, he says, \"Here in Florida, I\u2019ve slashed government by 10 percent. That\u2019s $7 billion.\" It\u2019s a statement Crist has also made on the campaign trail, and at a Hillsborough County Republican Party fundraiser earlier this month.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Florida\u2019s budget has dropped by 10 percent, or about $7 billion, since Crist was elected governor in November 2006. The budget passed by the Legislature and approved by then-Gov. Jeb Bush in May 2006 came in at $73.9 billion. This year\u2019s spending plan tops out at $66.5 billion.\n\nBut can Crist, as his radio ad claims, really take credit for the cuts?\n\nIn 2007, Crist did veto $459 million from the state budget, setting a state record with his veto pen.\n\nBut the Florida Constitution requires that state lawmakers prepare a balanced budget, which is built around revenue generated by sales taxes, corporate taxes, other taxes and fees, and federal appropriations.\n\nAnd since 2007, that revenue has declined significantly as the nationwide recession has taken hold. State budget documents show that in the 2006-2007 fiscal year, $31.7 billion was available in the general revenue fund. This year, the fund had only $21.9 billion. (In fiscal year 2007, the fund had $28 billion, and in 2008, it had $24.3 billion.)\n\nWith revenue down and a constitutional requirement for a balanced budget, Crist had to either cut spending or raise taxes.\n\n\"This is not a concerted effort on the part of our governor and Legislature to cut the budget,\" said Dominic M. Calabro, president and CEO of Florida TaxWatch. \"It is because of the worst economy Florida has had since the Great Depression.\"\n\nCrist has defended the budget-cut claim by saying that in other states, taxes were increased to cover shortfalls. While Crist didn\u2019t push for tax increases to make up the entire shortfall, he did approve fee and tax increases this year \u2014 on everything from fishing licenses to initial vehicle registrations to cigarettes \u2014 that total $2.2 billion.\n\nSo while it is true that state government has shrunk by 10 percent since Crist\u2019s election, it had little to do with him, and a lot to do with the shrinking economy. For those reasons, we give Crist\u2019s statement a Barely True.", "lang": "en"}
