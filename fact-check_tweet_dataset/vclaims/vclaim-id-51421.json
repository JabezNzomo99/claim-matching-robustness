West said in July that he would run for president under the \"Birthday Party\" and has since targeted ballots in several states \u2014 including key swing states like Wisconsin.\n\nIt remains unclear whether West obtained enough signatures to secure his spot \u2014 or if his campaign even filed the paperwork in time. But the attempt has stirred controversy across the state and country.\n\n\"The GOP lawyer who helped @kanyewest get on the ballot in Wisconsin is actively working for @realDonaldTrump\u2019s campaign,\" stated an Aug. 5, 2020 Instagram post.\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s and Instagram\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on their News Feeds.

Matt Smith, a reporter for WISN in Milwaukee, tweeted a video of Ruhland walking into the state Election Commission\u2019s building a few minutes after the 5 p.m. filing deadline.\n\nRuhland is also representing Trump\u2019s campaign in a lawsuit against the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA and a Rhinelander TV station, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.\n\nDaniel Bice of the Journal Sentinel also noted that some of West\u2019s 10 electors, who must pledge to vote for the rapper in the Electoral College if he wins Wisconsin, appear to be Trump supporters and Republican activists.\n\nCiting a tweet from a Vice reporter, an Instagram post said the GOP lawyer who helped Kanye West get on the ballot in Wisconsin is actively working for Donald Trump's campaign.\n\nWest lined up help from several Republicans in Wisconsin in his effort to appear on Wisconsin\u2019s presidential ballot, including a GOP lawyer who\u2019s representing the Trump campaign in a federal lawsuit.", "lang": "en"}
