David Jolly and Alan Grayson whether climate change presented the greatest threat the world currently faces. That\u2019s when Jolly steered the conversation into a ditch.\n\nThe Indian Shores Republican answered that \"agents of terror\" are the greatest threat against America, but the effects of climate change are real and will need to be addressed. He said he preferred tax credits and federal money for research instead of stricter environmental and energy regulations from Washington.\n\n\"What won't work is the president's Waters of the United States regulation that's going to cost Pinellas County, just one county, between $400 million and $2.5 billion,\" Jolly said on April 25, 2016. \"It will cost them $31 million to fix a single ditch.\"\n\nWe wanted to know if there was a new regulation forcing Pinellas County to spend $31 million to fix a ditch. What we found out is that the price is an old estimate, and there's little consensus how the Environmental Protection Agency is actually changing the rules.\n\nJolly\u2019s campaign said his example came from a letter the business lobbying group Associated Industries of Florida sent to members of Congress on Aug. 12, 2014. The letter asked the state\u2019s congressional delegation to support changes AIF wanted for a new rule concerning the Clean Water Act.\n\nBefore we get swept up in regulatory minutiae: The original Clean Water Act was passed in 1972 after pollution issues and disasters like Cuyahoga River fire in Ohio of 1969 and Lake Thonotosassa fish kills in Florida. The legislation was supposed to regulate discharges into waterways and wetlands, but environmentalists and industry groups have long debated which bodies of water the act encompassed.\n\nU.S. Supreme Court rulings in 2001 and 2006 raised questions about the law\u2019s reach, so the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers aimed to clarify what waters were federally protected, or \"waters of the United States\" (known as WOTUS, really). The agencies published a proposed rule change on April 21, 2014, that addressed several issues, including whether the law applied to ditches and in which circumstances.\n\nThat did anything but dry up debate. Groups like the National Association of Counties and Republican attorneys general from several states flooded the EPA with objections to the rule. (Florida later joined the call for courts to review the rule.)\n\nWe\u2019re sticking to ditches for this fact-check. Opponents were concerned that if the rule reclassified a ditch as a water of the United States, county governments could be on the hook for upgrading them to meet EPA rules. In its letter to Congress, AIF said upgrades would be costly.\n\nAIF\u2019s initial assessment was based on a \"preliminary analysis\" commissioned by the Florida Stormwater Association, a group of the state\u2019s stormwater management officials. The analysis looked at eight waterways and the estimated cost to bring them in line with the new regulation.\n\nAmong the eight examples was \"Pinellas Park Ditch #5,\" a 1.3-mile-long flood control canal known as Bonn Creek that empties into the Joe\u2019s Creek Watershed. The ditch, with mostly concrete banks, was designed to handle stormwater runoff. The analysis said the ditch wasn\u2019t currently under the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act, but it would be under the proposed rule change.\n\nThe report estimated it would cost $31.3 million to make the ditch compliant with the Clean Water Act\u2019s accepted phosphorous and nitrogen discharge levels. Whether any upgrades to that ditch would be that expensive \u2014 or even necessary \u2014 is still up in the air.\n\nJon Devine, senior adviser to the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, said the analysis Jolly cited doesn\u2019t say why it would cost $31.3 million, and is out of date as a talking point.\n\n\"It\u2019s based on the proposed rule, not the final rule, and the final rule took account of a lot of input \u2014 including that of municipal stormwater dischargers,\" Devine said.\n\nCritics did manage to alter the current of the discussion. After the rule was announced in April 2014, the public was invited to comment. Their concerns about ditches led to changes in the final rule, which was announced in May 2015, and published in June.\n\nAmong the revisions was that \"the rule further reduces existing confusion and inconsistency regarding the regulation of ditches by explicitly excluding certain categories of ditches, such as ditches that flow only after precipitation.\"\n\nThe short version: If a ditch that handles stormwater wasn\u2019t under federal jurisdiction before, it wouldn\u2019t be under the new rule. When we contacted AIF for comment on the revised rule, the group said they were not currently working on the issue and had nothing to add.\n\n\"The bottom line is that the final Clean Water Rule does not change, in any manner, the way stormwater systems have always been covered under the CWA and, therefore, does not result in any new costs for CWA compliance,\" EPA spokeswoman Enesta Jones told us in an email.\n\nIf the EPA doesn't require a status change, that would leave the ditch in local control. Devine noted that the EPA usually allows state agencies to decide most of their own policies.\n\n\"The states establish what criteria apply to particular waterways, based on their state-designated uses,\" he said. \"Though this is subject to EPA oversight, in my experience (the) EPA is extremely deferential to state judgments.\"\n\nKelli Hammer Levy, chairwoman of the Florida Stormwater Association\u2019s legislative committee and a section manager for Pinellas County watershed management, disagreed with the EPA\u2019s assertion. She said the rule\u2019s reach was not yet fully known, and provisions in it would change the ditch\u2019s status.\n\n\"Bonn Creek would be classified as a tributary in this case because it has a bed, bank and high water mark and discharges into a (water of the United States),\" Levy said in an email.\n\nPinellas County isn\u2019t alone in not accepting what the EPA says. Many state officials across the country still didn\u2019t trust the parameters of the final rule, which was set to go into effect in August 2015. It has been put on hold nationally because of pending litigation from more than a dozen states.\n\nJolly said that under a new federal regulation, it will cost Pinellas County \"$31 million to fix a single ditch.\"\n\nHis figure comes from a 2014 report that claimed it would cost the county that much to make a stormwater ditch in Pinellas Park compliant with Clean Water Act pollution guidelines under a new rule. But the report didn\u2019t specify why it would cost so much, and didn\u2019t reflect changes the EPA made to the rule in 2015.\n\nJolly didn\u2019t make up the $31 million estimate, but his wording makes it sound as if the EPA is definitely forcing crippling regulatory costs on the county. The agency denies the rule change affects how ditches are classified, but the scope of the new rule is still far from settled. Debate abounds about how specific waterways would be affected by the final rule, which currently is under a court stay pending litigation.\n\nThere\u2019s no irrefutable evidence of an imminent (and expensive) federal takeover of the ditch in question. We rate his statement Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
