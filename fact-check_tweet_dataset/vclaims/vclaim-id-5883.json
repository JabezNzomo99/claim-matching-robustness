This is partly false. Although two caucuses did leave out \u201cunder God\u201d, the phrase was used in the Pledge of Allegiance on every night in the main programme of the DNC.\n\nOne post on Facebook, shared over 1,000 times, reads, \u201cThe DNC omitted, One Nation Under God. From the pledge of allegiance. It was thought to be offensive and may trigger some people\u201d (here) and others say, \u201cThe fact that the DNC omitted \u201cunder God\u201d from the pledge of allegiance on a national platform should worry every believer!\u201d ( here , here )\n\nThe current Pledge of Allegiance is as follows: \u201cI pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\u201d\n\nThe Pledge of Allegiance has been adapted over the years and the phrase \u201cunder God\u201d was added on Flag Day, June 14, 1954 under President Dwight D. Eisenhower ( here , here ).\n\nSeveral legal challenges have been mounted over the use of \u201cunder God\u201d in the Pledge (here). Most notably, in 2004 atheist Michael Newdow brought an ultimately unsuccessful case to the Supreme Court saying California school\u2019s pledge requirement violated his daughter\u2019s rights under the First Amendment\u2019s Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses (here).\n\nAt this year\u2019s DNC, several caucuses took place alongside the main convention (here).\n\nAt the LGBTQ Caucus Meeting on Tuesday 18, Dr Marisa Richmond, left out \u201cunder God\u201d from the Pledge of Allegiance, as seen at the 01:48 minute mark in video here . At the Muslim Delegates and Allies Assembly on the same day, AJ Durrani, DNC Committeeman & Co-Chair Interfaith Council, also omitted \u201cunder God\u201d, see the 01:10:47 minute mark in livestream here .\n\nThese are the only two caucus meetings\u2019 livestreams (here) that Reuters found to have omitted the words \u201cunder God\u201d from the Pledge. The caucus livestreams were not part of the prime-time convention broadcast.\n\nIn all four nights of the convention\u2019s main programme the words \u201cunder God\u201d were included in the Pledge of Allegiance. On the first night, the Pledge was said by Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden\u2019s grandchildren (here), on the second and third nights, by a diverse group of Americans ( here , here ) and on the fourth night, by Cedric Richmond Jr, the son of Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana (here).\n\nBiden is a Roman Catholic who for years has written and spoken publicly about his faith (here). Recently, Biden has leaned into his religious commitments, emphasizing his faith during the presidential election and the DNC (here).\n\nPartly false. Videos of the DNC show that two caucuses did omit \u201cunder God\u201d from the Pledge of Allegiance but the words were included on all four nights of the main programme.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
