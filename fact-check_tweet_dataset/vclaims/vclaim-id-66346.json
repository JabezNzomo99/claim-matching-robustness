But his assertion about staffing levels is something concrete and led us to wonder: Is CPS really dead last in the state when it comes to staffing? If so, that would seem to contradict a common narrative about an unwieldy bureaucratic bloat at CPS.\n\nSo we decided to take a look.\n\nNot rock bottom, but very close\n\nTo support his claim, LaRaviere pointed us to data from the Illinois State Board of Education listing the pupil-to-staff ratio for each district in the state. That figure includes teachers, administrators and professional staff like counselors, librarians and nurses certified by the state to work with students.\n\nThe state dataset shows CPS has fewer staff members per student than all but two of the more than 850 school districts in Illinois. It was tied for second-to-last with Lincoln Way Community High School District in suburban New Lenox. In last place was a tiny elementary district in downstate Breese, 40 miles east of St. Louis.\n\nIn 2016, the average student-to-staff ratio for all Illinois school districts was 11-to-one. At CPS it was more than 16-to-one.\n\nThe state data also show that CPS\u2019 ranking has worsened under Emanuel. In the 2010-11 school year, the last under former Mayor Richard M. Daley, CPS staffing levels were low but still better than 79 other districts in the state.\n\nIn other words, LaRaviere\u2019s claim checks out.\n\nStill, that raises a question: How did CPS staffing slip so far even as its spending per pupil outpaces the state average by $2,000?\n\nLaRaviere sees that conundrum as evidence CPS is wasting money because of unsound financial policies that drain resources to pay for adequate staffing.\n\nBut experts also point to other, less politically fraught, explanations.\n\nAndy Crosby, a professor of public administration at Pace University in New York said urban districts are more likely to serve students from low-income backgrounds who may require additional resources to educate. Districts in large urban areas, he said, typically pay teachers higher salaries to compensate for increased cost of living as well.\n\nBut he also pointed to U.S. Census data showing Chicago was far from the biggest spender among large urban school districts. In 2015, the data show, New York City spent roughly $22,000 per student while Chicago spent less than $14,000.\n\nIllinois data, meanwhile, show that Chicago\u2019s per-student spending may be above average, yet there are many districts in the state that spend far more.\n\nAnother factor to consider when weighing spending at CPS is the looming shadow of high pension costs. Prior to changes made by state lawmakers last year, CPS bore the entire expense of funding the employer share of pensions for its teachers and staff. All other districts in Illinois relied on state taxpayers to pick up their pension tab.\n\nRebecca Hendrick, a professor of public administration at the University of Illinois-Chicago, suggested the pension overhang could be putting pressure on the district to lower operating costs to free up funds for pension payments. Those payments ramped up significantly during Emanuel\u2019s second term as a consequence of years of contribution deferrals that began under Daley.\n\nA recent Tribune investigation revealed CPS\u2019 failure to protect students from sexual abuse by district employees. LaRaviere suggested staffing levels could have played a role in that scandal, saying that, \"under Emanuel, CPS has become the most understaffed school district in Illinois.\"\n\nThe correlation LaRaviere sought to make is impossible to prove. However, his claim about low staff-to-student ratios lies on firmer ground.\n\nData from the Illinois State Board of Education show that last year CPS employed just one staffer\u2014teachers, administrators and other trained professionals\u2014for every 16 students. The statewide average was one per every 11.\n\nBy that measure, CPS tied for second to worst in the state. Technically speaking then, CPS is not the most understaffed in the state as LaRaviere says.\n\nIt is almost the most understaffed, a quibbling distinction that might bear relevance in math class or on the debate club but is besides the point for purposes of evaluating the credibility of his claim.
