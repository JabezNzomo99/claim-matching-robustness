Those who comply by spamming their friends are then allowed to click a \u201cReceive the Coupon\u201d button. However, there is no actual coupon to receive. Like innumerable other \u201cfree merchandise\u201d offers on Facebook (including previous examples targeting Walmart customers), this one is a scam. We\u2019ve had many occasions to alert readers to this kind of fraud:\n\nThese types of viral \u201ccoupon\u201d scams often involve websites and social media pages set up to mimic those of legitimate companies. Users who respond to those fake offers are required to share a website link or social media post in order to spread the scam more widely and lure in additional victims. Then those users are presented with a \u201csurvey\u201d that extracts personal information such as email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, and even sometimes credit card numbers. Finally, those who want to claim their \u201cfree\u201d gift cards or coupons eventually learn they must first sign up to purchase a number of costly goods, services, or subscriptions.\n\nThe Better Business Bureau offers consumers several general tips to avoid getting scammed:", "lang": "en"}
