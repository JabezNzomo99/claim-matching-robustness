The attack came after Russian state TV accused Echo of Moscow\u2014and Felgengauer specifically\u2014of working for the U.S.\n\nCommenting on the Time\u2019s choice of the Russian journalist, the head of the Kremlin\u2019s broadcasting arm \u201cRussiya Segodnya,\u201d which includes RIA Novosti, Sputnik as well as most of Russia\u2019s mainstream TV channels, Dmitry Kiselyov cried out \u201cHypocrisy!\u201d\n\nKiselyov claimed the inclusion of Felgengauer was inappropriate and done by the order of the American Russophobic establishment. He expressed outrage that the Time put the five journalists of the Annapolis newspaper Capital Gazette murdered on duty in a same group with Felgengauer, who suffered \u201ca papercut\u201d to her skin.\n\nTatiana Felgengauer was stabbed in her throat and seriously wounded. The doctors had to put her under induced coma for the surgery, after which she has spent two weeks in the hospital.\n\nAs for the motives of the \u201cmentally ill sex maniac\u201d \u2013 that is a version supported by Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin who said at the time, the attack had \u201cnothing to do with freedom of speech,\u201d but a work of a \"sick man.\"\n\nAfter Putin\u2019s comment, the court in Moscow declared the assailant mentally incapable and placed him in a psychiatric facility.\n\nStill, journalists inside and outside of Russia as well as opposition politicians said the attack was politically motivated, pointing to the attacker\u2019s familiarity with the Echo Moskvy offices and Felgengauer\u2019s schedule, as well as to his possession of the building\u2019s blue prints.\n\nKiselyov\u2019s own channel Rossiya24 broadcast a series of TV reports targeting Felgengauer and Echo Moskvy saying the \u201cdanger such journalists pose is not less than the danger posed by the terrorist group ISIS (the Islamic State).\u201d\n\nThe Russian Journalists Trade Union said the attack was provoked by the Rossiya24 reports targeting Felgengauer as the \u201cagent of the American State Department.\u201d The Journalist Union called the attack an attack against freedom of speech.\n\nWell-known Russian Journalist Oleg Kashin said, the \u201cmental diagnosis was faked specifically to cover up for the political motives.\u201d\n\nWhile the suspicions cannot be verified at this time, a number of attacks on journalists in Russia have raised similar concerns.\n\nKiselyov tends to give credence to the Annapolis, Maryland attack and yet downplay the Felgengauer stabbing as the work of a mentally ill man. The defendant in Marmyland, however, also is considering an insanity plea. In October, the judge presiding over the case gave Jarrod Ramos\u2019 lawyers 60 additional days to explore the 38-year-old suspect\u2019s state of mind. Ramos' name was signed on letters written to the newspaper\u2019s former lawyer and two judges, saying the writer wanted to kill everyone in the Annapolis newsroom. He pleaded not guilty in July, but has additional time to consider whether to claim insanity.\n\nTatiana Felgengauer was laconic in her reaction to Kiselyov\u2019s comment, \u201cThis is cute,\u201d she wrote sharing the news on Twitter.\n\n\u201cIs anybody surprised, that Dmitry Kiselyov is a stinking scum?\u201d the chief editor of Echo Moskvy Alexey Venediktov said in a post in his Telegram channel.\n\nEditors\u2019 Note: In interest of full disclosure, Echo Moskvy publishes a blog online of select Polygraph.info fact checks.", "lang": "en"}
