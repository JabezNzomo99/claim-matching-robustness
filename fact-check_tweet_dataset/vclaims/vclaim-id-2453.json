Is it true that Kirk called for the mass arrest of 18,000 African-Americans and, second, that Kirk had no objection to Trump\u2019s call for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants? We checked the record.\n\nDuckworth's deputy campaign manager Matt McGrath said in an email she was referencing a statement Kirk made in May 2013 during an interview with Fox 32 Chicago political editor Mike Flannery.\n\nKirk told Flannery: \"My top priority is to arrest the Gangster Disciple gang, which is 18,000 people. I would like to do a mass pickup of them and put them all in the Thomson Correctional Facility. I will be proposing this to the assembled federal law enforcement: ATF, DEA and FBI.\"\n\nKirk made that statement in response to the January 2013 shooting death of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, who was struck in the back by a stray bullet during a gang-related shooting on Chicago\u2019s south side.\n\nThe Gangster Disciples is an African-American gang from the city's south side and has an estimated 18,000 members, though its membership could be as high as 30,000, according to the Chicago Crime Commission\u2019s press officer John Pastuovic.\n\nThe statement from the media as well as from Kirk\u2019s colleagues in Congress, including U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill, who called the proposal an \"upper middle class elitist white boy solution to a problem he knows nothing about.\"\n\nBut Kirk acknowledged in July 2013 that his plan to arrest every member of the Gangster Disciples was \"not actually that practical.\"\n\nStill, not only does Duckworth's tweet take what Kirk said out of context, it also implies he supported the general mass arrest of 18,000 African-Americans, even though Kirk never mentioned race or used the term \"African-Americans\" during his interview with Fox 32 Chicago.\n\nWhat about Kirk on deportation?\n\nAnd as for Duckworth\u2019s claim that Kirk \"was apparently fine with Trump\u2019s call for mass deportation?\"\n\nOn May 4, Trump appeared on NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt, where he reiterated his plan to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants if he were to become president.\n\nIn a May 6 interview with CNN before Trump\u2019s primary-clinching win in Indiana, Kirk said he would support Trump as the Republican nominee, calling Trump\u2019s candidacy a \"net benefit\" for his own campaign in Illinois.\n\nKirk withdrew his support for the presumptive GOP presidential nominee on June 7 after Trump said an American-born federal judge of Mexican ancestry couldn\u2019t preside fairly over civil fraud lawsuits against the defunct Trump University because he has called for a wall to be built along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nWhile Kirk did back Trump knowing his position on illegal immigration, Kirk has made clear in the past he does not support Trump\u2019s controversial immigration policies.\n\nIn July 2015, Kirk at news conference he had a message for Trump: \"In a typical Chicago way, to my Mexican-American friends, I would say, 'Donald Trump callate' shut up.\"\n\nAnd Kirk\u2019s congressional voting record suggests he would not be \"fine\" with deporting 11 million immigrants living here illegally.\n\nEleni Demertzis, the Kirk campaign\u2019s communications director, noted in an email the senator supported and voted for the high-profile comprehensive immigration reform package in June 2013, which first would have secured the border and then created a tough but fair pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, among other things. But that measure never made it to a vote in the House.\n\nIn addition to his pro-immigration reform stance, Kirk in October 2015 broke ranks with his party and was the only GOP Senator who voted to preserve federal funding for \"sanctuary cities.\" However, Kirk did vote in favor of increasing penalties from two years to five years for illegal immigrants who re-enter the country illegally after being deported, denied entry or removed for other reasons, voting largely along party lines.\n\nDuckworth tweeted: \"Kirk, who called for the mass arrest of 18,000 African Americans, was apparently fine with Trump\u2019s #StillTooRacist call for mass deportation.\"\n\nWhile Kirk did call for the mass arrest of the Gangster Disciples, an African-American gang estimated to have 18,000 members, Duckworth\u2019s tweet takes Kirk\u2019s statement out of context and gives the impression he had called for the general mass incarceration of 18,000 African-Americans.\n\nDuckworth also fails to acknowledge Kirk walked back his statement shortly after he made it. More importantly, Kirk did not mention race when he originally called for a \"mass pickup\" of the Gangster Disciples gang.\n\nAs for Kirk being \"apparently fine\" with mass deportation, his congressional voting record on immigration shows he supports comprehensive reform that would both improve border security and implement a tough, but fair pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants -- not to mention he was the lone Republican senator to vote against legislation that would have withheld federal funds from sanctuary cities.", "lang": "en"}
