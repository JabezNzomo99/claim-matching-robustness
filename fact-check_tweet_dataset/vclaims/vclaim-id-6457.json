And the loss of some units won\u2019t represent an equivalent loss in service provision, in every case.\n\nMr Corbyn is referring to analysis from the Health Service Journal, published earlier this week. It identified 24 major A&E units that could be downgraded or closed altogether in the next four years\u2014about 15% of departments across the country.\n\nThe figure is mostly based on analysing public plans and statements from NHS trusts across the country.\n\nBut not all of these are confirmed closure or downgrade plans.\n\nOf the 24, four will be downgraded and three will be closed. The rest have plans that aren\u2019t finalised or are up for consultation. The researchers say these units could be downgraded or closed, but could equally be kept or upgraded.\n\nIn the case of City Hospital and Sandwell and District General Hospital in Birmingham, the planned closures are set to be replaced by a new hospital anyway.\n\nSo we don\u2019t necessarily know how services will actually be affected by these changes.", "lang": "en"}
