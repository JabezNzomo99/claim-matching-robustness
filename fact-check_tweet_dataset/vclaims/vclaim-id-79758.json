It purports to show the Swedish teenager posing with an Islamic State member, philanthropist George Soros and an Antifa shirt. \"Well well well \u2026 do I need to explain anymore?\" reads text above the images, followed by the hashtags, \"#AnonsKnew #GretaThunberg #DeepStatePuppet.\"\n\nA Facebook user who shared the post wrote next to the image, \"This is Typical Twisted Lies and Deceit, the Stupid Left Believes these Idiots!\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) And versions of it have been shared hundreds of times, so we wanted to see if the photos are real.\n\nBased on our analysis, only one of the photos in the Facebook post is authentic \u2014 the other two are doctored or taken out of context. And the caption over the real one, which shows Thunberg wearing an antifascist shirt, isn\u2019t accurate.\n\nThe first image in the flagged post is a screenshot of another post from a Facebook user. It claims to show Thunberg posing with a bearded member of the Islamic State, the man\u2019s arm around her shoulder as he speaks into a microphone.\n\nBut the photo is not of Thunberg. A reverse image search reveals that the image is six years old and was taken from a video made during an ISIS-led Quran recitation competition in Aleppo, Syria, according to a news caption, as we noted in a previous fact check.\n\nThe photo was published in a now-defunct article on an Iranian website in August 2014. And The Morocco World News reported around the same time that the girl in the video was 7 years old, tearful over mistakes she made in her recitation. While the child looks vaguely similar to Thunberg \u2014 who would have been 10 at the time \u2014 there\u2019s no evidence that it\u2019s her.\n\nThe second image in the flagged Facebook post purports to show Thunberg posing next to Soros, a philanthropist and Democratic donor who is often the target of conservative attacks.\n\nBut we found that the photo was digitally altered to make it look like Thunberg is chummy with the wealthy liberal financier. The original image actually shows Thunberg posing with former Vice President Al Gore in December.\n\nThe altered version of the image appears to have been created by a French parody outlet in late August.\n\nThe final photo in the suspect Facebook post shows Thunberg sitting on a couch while wearing a shirt that says \"antifascist all stars.\" Text written over the image claims that the activist \"aligns herself with the Antifa terrorist organization.\"\n\nAntifa is a loosely-affiliated group of left-wing activists whose mission is to counter the ideology of fascism. It has drawn criticism for its members\u2019 willingness to use violence against far-right groups.\n\nThe photo of Thunberg is real. On July 26, she tweeted that she had deleted a photo of herself wearing the shirt after learning that it could be linked to \"a violent movement.\"\n\nHowever, in the same tweet, she said the shirt was borrowed.\n\nWe could find no evidence that Thunberg has participated in Antifa demonstrations. And being antifascist does not necessarily mean one supports the left-wing group Antifa.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Facebook post\u2019s claim that Antifa is a terrorist organization is dubious. The Central Intelligence Agency has not included the group on its list of such organizations, although some lawmakers have called for it to be. However, in the past, some officials in the intelligence community have called Antifa members \"domestic terrorists\" in confidential documents.\n\nA Facebook post claims to show Greta Thunberg posing with ISIS, George Soros and an Antifa shirt.\n\nThe first photo was taken out of context and doesn\u2019t show Thunberg at all. The second photo was digitally altered. The third is genuine, but Thunberg has said she borrowed the shirt at the time. Also, being antifascist is not the same as being a member of Antifa.\n\nThe post is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
