Information gathered by regional reporters says that it has varied depending on the season.\n\nConstruction of Fisht stadium cost $783 million (23.5 billion rubles) -- three times more than originally planned. The stadium, which was built to accommodate 40,000 people, was used during the 2014 Olympics for the opening and closing ceremonies, and to award the winners.\n\nAs soon as the games were over, the stadium was closed for renovations until March 2017. Those renovations, which cost $156 million (4.7 billion rubles), expanded the capacity of the Fisht stadium to almost 48,000 people. In March 2017, the venue hosted a test match between Russia and Belgium which was attended by 40,000 people. The following month, it hosted a match between teams from Sochi and Volograd, and in May 2017, it hosted a Russian National Soccer Cup match attended by 24,500 people. The following month, the venue hosted four more soccer games. The highest attendance of those games was for a match between Germany and Mexico, which attracted 37,923 spectators.\n\nIn 2017, the Fisht stadium was used seven times, after which it was closed down for almost a year. It has been reopened for six planned matches during the World Cup 2018.\n\nThis venue, which can seat 12,000 people, was originally projected to cost $48 million (1.43 billion rubles) to build but ended up costing $296 million (8.9 billion rubles). The Iceberg winter Sports Palace opened in 2012, and prior to the 2014 Olympics it hosted five competitions, including the Grand Prix Final and National Championship of Russia in figure skating.\n\nIn May of this year, the venue hosted the Black Sea Cup, a three-day international junior hockey league championship.\n\nOverall, competitions and tournaments keep the Iceberg Winter Sports Palace busy for several days each month. It is also used for concerts once or twice a month, as well as other performances. Those events sell from 300 to 5,000 tickets.\n\nWith a 12,000-seat capacity, the Bolshoi Ice Dome was supposed to cost $200 million (6 billion rubles) to build, but ended up costing $330 million (9.9 billion rubles). During the 2014 Olympic Games, it hosted a hockey tournament. Prior to the Games, it hosted a junior hockey world championship; after the Games, it hosted the Channel One Cup international hockey tournament.\n\nThe Bolshoi Ice Dome is the busiest Olympic coastal cluster venue. As the home base for the Sochi hockey club, it is where the team practices and plays three to six home games every month.\n\nThe Bolshoi Ice Dome also hosts a training center for figure skaters and a school run by Olympic champions Tatiana Volosojar and Maxim Trankov, which provides instruction to children of different age groups, and hosts practice sessions and local competitions several times a month.\n\nOriginally known as the Sochi Olympic Park Circuit, the Sochi Autodrom was not used as a sports venue during the 2014 Olympic Games, but was built under the federal program titled \u201cConstruction of Olympic Venues and Development of the City of Sochi as a Mountain Climate Resort.\u201d This race track cost more than $263 million (7.9 billion rubles) to build.\n\nFrom 2014-2017 the race track was used for annual Formula-1 races and the Russian Grand Prix event. Each such event lasts three days. The race track is also used for up to five smaller-scale motor racing events each year.\n\nWhen not hosting car races, the Sochi Autodrom offers paid racing sessions to anybody with their own vehicle. Those events are held two to four times a month, but only during the winter.\n\nThe project to build Rosa Khutor started well before the 2014 Olympics -- in 2003 \u2013 and the ski resort hosted its first group of tourists in 2010.\n\nHowever, the Russian government built a ski center at Rosa Khutor specifically for the 2014 Olympic Games. The ski center can accommodates 7,500 visitors at a time, and also has an \u201cExtreme Park\u201d (for sports like snowboarding) that can hold up to 10,250 people.\n\nThe total cost of preparing the ski resort for the 2014 Olympic Games was $1.8 billion (55.7 billion rubles).\n\nToday, Rosa Khutor continues to operate as a ski resort that hosts up to 800,000 visitors in the winter and 300,000 in the summer.\n\nRosa Khutor\u2019s owners say the resort, including the Olympic venues, costs $31 million (2 billion rubles) a year to maintain. In 2016, the resort made $69 million (4.4 billion rubles). However, while the profits continue to grow, it will take 20 years to cover the costs of preparing the resort for the 2014 Olympics.\n\nThe Laura Biathlon & Ski Complex and the infrastructure attached to it \u2013 the Olympic villages, a road, electric grid stations, water supply, etc. -- cost more than $3.3 billion (100 billion rubles) to build.\n\nThe venue holds 9,600 people. During the 2014 Olympic Games, it was site of skiing and biathlon tournaments, which continue to be held there. The Laura Biathlon & Ski Complex also operates a ski resort. While it does not disclose the total number of visitors a year, its annual profits -- around $57 million (3.6 billion rubles) -- are slightly lower than those of Rose Farm and just a fraction of the complex\u2019s construction costs.\n\nThis venue ended up costing $263 million (7.9 billion rubles) -- twice as much as originally projected. It holds 5,000 people. During the 2014 Winter Olympics, it hosted tournaments in bobsleigh, luge and skeleton racing. Prior to the Olympic Games, it hosted International Luge Week and the Luge World Cup.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, the venue once again hosted the Luge World Cup, as well as the World Cup in Bobsleigh and the European Championship in Luge. Similar tournaments take place several times a year.\n\nThe Sanki Sliding Center is the national tournament center for the Russian team. Like the Laura Biathlon & Ski Complex, the Sanki Sliding Center holds periodic practices. The tracks, however, are open for training members of the general public and tourism only during the winter season.\n\nWith an initial projected cost of $40 million (1.2 billion rubles), the RusSki Gorki Jumping Center ended up costing $266 million (8 billion rubles) to build. It has a seating capacity of 7,500 people. During the 2014 Olympic Games, it hosted the ski jumping competition.\n\nHowever, even while the RusSki Gorki Jumping Center was still under construction, various competitions were held on the facilities there that had already been built.\n\nSince 2014, the RusSki Gorki Jumping Center has hosted an annual summer ski jumping championship, which lasts 3-4 days. However, during most of the year, the RusSki Gorki Jumping Center is closed.\n\nThis fact-check has been adapted from our RFE/RL partner Factograph.info: https://www.factograph.info/a/29289261.html\n\n(The exchange rate was 34 rubles to the dollar at the time of the game but lower leading up to the 2014 Olympics. Polygraph.info chose to follow the formula of a number of news agencies both inside and outside Russia and used 30 rubles as the exchange number).", "lang": "en"}
