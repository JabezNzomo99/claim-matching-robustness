The meme included names of people who have gained prominence over the past few years for their connection to right-wing movements and conspiracy theories.\n\nWe went through the real list \u2014 available here \u2014 and learned that only a few of these people are actually going to speak at the RNC, which begins on Monday, Aug. 24.\n\nFirstly, the student often described as \u201cthe MAGA hat kid from Covington Catholic\u201d will indeed be speaking at the second day of the convention. Nicholas Sandmann was a high school student at the center of a viral video from early 2019. In the video, Sandmann was wearing a Make America Great Again hat and was in Washington, D.C., for the March for Life rally. The video appeared to show him staring down a Native American activist who played a drum. Mainstream and social media commentators accused Sandmann of harassing the activist, but a longer version of that video contradicted the notion. Sandmann sued CNN and The Washington Post for defamation surrounding their coverage of the incident, in cases that were later settled for undisclosed amounts.\n\nNext up is Mike Lindell, the CEO of MyPillow, a pillow manufacturing company, and Trump\u2019s friend. He has been promoting oleandrin, a toxic botanical extract, as a treatment for COVID-19, despite a lack of proof that it works. He does not appear to be on the speaker\u2019s list, though he will be speaking at a Republican fundraiser in September. (Update: Though he was not a featured speaker, Lindell did speak briefly during the roll call portion of the convention.)\n\nThird on the list is Dr. Stella Immanuel, nicknamed \u201cThe Demon Sperm Doctor\u201d in the meme. Immanuel gained notoriety after Trump himself pushed her theories that face masks were not necessary to stop the spread of COVID-19. She has also said that a range of medical issues usually occurring in women are caused by demonic sperm after having sex with demons. She is not speaking at the convention.\n\nActor Scott Baio spoke at the 2016 RNC, while musician Kid Rock was being considered for a performance at this year\u2019s convention before the pandemic struck in 2020. Neither appear to be on the official speaker\u2019s list for 2020.\n\nFinally, Mark and Patricia McCloskey (dubbed \u201cthe racist gun couple\u201d in the meme) are, in fact, speaking on the first day of the RNC. The duo brandished their firearms at Black Lives Matter protesters in St. Louis in June 2020 in the wake of police custody deaths of Black men that resulted in nationwide demonstrations.\n\nOnly three people \u2014 including a couple \u2014 named in this meme will actually be speaking at the RNC. As such, we rate this claim \u201cMostly False.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
