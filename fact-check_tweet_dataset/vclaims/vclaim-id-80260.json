The independent polling group cited as the source of the information told AFP it had not conducted any such survey. A spokesman for the vice president said the survey was fake news.\n\nThe report on a website is headlined: 45 percent of Filipinos believe VP Robredo has a 'mental problem'.\n\nThe story claims that the Social Weather Stations (SWS), one of two non-governmental pollsters in the Philippines, conducted a survey which found that 45 percent of Filipinos believed Robredo has a mental health problem.\n\nThe story was shared hundreds of times on Facebook to accounts with nearly 100,000 followers.\n\nSWS did not conduct any such opinion poll, Leo Laroza, SWS director for communication and information technology, told AFP.\n\n\u201cThis is fake news. Also, SWS has not conducted any survey related to the state of mental health of any public official or person,\u201d he said.\n\nLaroza said that SWS had conducted a survey on the public\u2019s perception of President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s physical health.\n\nSWS issued an official statement saying it had not conducted any survey on the mental health of any public official.\n\nSWS publishes the results of the surveys it conducted on its website and there was no survey posted on Robredo\u2019s mental health.\n\n\u201cThis is fake news.

Although they are officially colleagues, Robredo and Duterte have repeatedly attacked each other in public comments.", "lang": "en"}
