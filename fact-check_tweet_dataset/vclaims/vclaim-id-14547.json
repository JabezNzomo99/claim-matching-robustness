No, that's not true: the image was faked by a Belgian satire website that often doctors BFMTV screenshots.\n\nThe image appeared in an article published on December 1, 2018 titled \"Sela vient d'\u00eatre diffus\u00e9 sur BFMTV !\" (archived here) and it looked like this:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so they may have thought it was a real screenshot:\n\nBut Le Journal Du Nord (nordpresse.be) is a satirical website that was set up to mock the (real) sudpresse.be (since renamed sudinfo.be), a Belgian media group. They were involved in a lawsuit with each other in 2017 which was eventually won by NordPresse. It is run by Vincent Flibustier who also offers media training about fake news on his website, he knows what he is talking about.\n\nThey have sort of a disclaimer in their header that reads:\n\nTranslated: \"all information verified by our monkey analysts\".\n\nWe wrote about nordpresse.be before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Televison NOT Reporting 23 Dead, 300 Severely Wounded at 'Gilets Jaunes' Demonstration in Paris\n\u2022 Fake News: No 12 (or 123) Dead At 'Gilets Jaunes' Protests in France\n\u2022 Fake News: French Army Not Getting Ready to Stop Demonstration of Yellow Vests\n\u2022 Fake News: Halloween Purge in France, NO 1600 Cars Burned, NO 320 Wounded, NO 23 Dead", "lang": "en"}
