The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is a cultural center located in Washington, D.C. that received funding from the coronavirus stimulus bill.\n\nThe claim comes amid controversy surrounding the $2.2 trillion stimulus package, which included $25 million for the federally-owned performing arts center.

Other ex officio members include Trump administration officials, such as Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Education Betsy Devos. Melania Trump, Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton are among the Kennedy Center\u2019s Honorary Chairs.\n\nAccording to its \u201cOur Story\u201d page, the Kennedy Center was founded in 1958 as the National Cultural Center by President Dwight D. Eisenhower ( here ). After President Kennedy\u2019s assassination, \u201cby an Act of Congress signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on January 23, 1964, the nation\u2019s National Cultural Center was designated as a living memorial to President John F. Kennedy.\u201d\n\nFalse: None of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s daughters sit on the Kennedy Center board\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
