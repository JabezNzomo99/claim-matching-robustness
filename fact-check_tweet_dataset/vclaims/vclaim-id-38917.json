The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that while the disease can be transmitted through infected objects and surfaces, there is no evidence that it can spread through food.\n\nThe image appears to be the latest example of coronavirus misinformation that\u2019s become rampant on social media websites. As of March 4, the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, has spread from China to at least 76 other countries, sickening some 93,090 people and killing some 3,198 others, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nNo corroborating evidence or news reports could be found to support the image\u2019s claim that coronavirus has been found in bags of rice. In fact, the CDC website notes that while the respiratory virus can be spread through touching infected objects or surfaces, there is \u201cno evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn general, because of the poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures,\u201d states the CDC website.
