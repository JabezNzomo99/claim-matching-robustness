Patanjali also needs to provide the name and composition of the medicines being claimed as COVID treatment along with the site(s)/hospital(s) where the research study was conducted for COVID-19.\n\n\n\nOn June 23, 2020, Baba Ramdev launched these medicines and claimed that these clinically tested medicines were cures for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. He further claimed that these results showed 100 per cent recovery rate among patients.\n\nThe ministry said it told Patanjali that the advertisement and press conference falls under the provisions of Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954 and Rules and under the purview of the central government. Any research studies about AYUSH interventions and medicines on COVID-19 also have to be communicated to the ministry, according to a gazette notification issued in April.\n\n\n\nThe methodology and protocol, sample size selection, as well as the Institutional Ethics Committee clearance, the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) registration and resulting data of the said study also needs to be provided to the ministry. The ministry has also asked the State Licensing Authority of Uttarakhand Government to provide copies of the said license and the details of product approval to the centre.\n\nBaba Ramdev and Acharya Balkrishna, the CEO of Patanjali launched their COVID-19 Ayurvedic medicines 'Coronil' and 'Swasari Vati' on June 23, 2020 in a press conference. This coronil kit is priced at Rs.545 and would be available in Patanjali stores in a week's time, according to Ramdev. These medicines would be available online on an application in the same time period.\n\nRamdev claimed that the medicines are not an immunity booster but a cure for COVID-19 and have showed 100 per cent favourable results during clinical trials on affected patients at the Patanjali Yogapeeth in Haridwar. They, however, did not include people older than 60, who had respiratory disorders, and who were severely symptomatic.\n\nBalkrishna claimed that their medicines cured the disease in 3-14 days while Ramdev claimed that 69% of the patients recovered in three days. Patanjali also stated that they were assisted in this endeavour by the National Institute of Medical Sciences, Jaipur.\n\nBalkrishna had stated earlier this month that the company was conducting tests and was going to come out with the first Ayurvedic COVID-19 medicine.", "lang": "en"}
