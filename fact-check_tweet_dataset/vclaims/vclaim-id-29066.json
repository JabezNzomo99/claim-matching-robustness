A collage of photographs, where a man dressed in the Indian tricolour can be seen, was also shared along with the poster. The text reads, \u201cFarid Khan, this man from Pakistan wear Indian flag dress pretend to be an Indian cricket fan is peeing in The Oval gallery during India v/s Australia match and also recorded the video and posted on social media, video goes to viral then London police arrested him and his 2 brothers. Such a shameful act by Pakistani citizen\u201d. It suggested that a Pakistani citizen attempted to tarnish India\u2019s image by pretending to be an Indian fan who indulged in the obscenity.\n\nA Facebook page \u2013The Indian Stories \u2013 posted the same poster on June 10, 2019.\n\nAlt News found that the man dressed in the tricolour is an avid Indian cricket fan named Narendra Bhojani. He is one of the three Bhojani brothers known for attending Indian cricket matches dressed in the Indian tricolour; the other two being Harivardan and Suresh.\n\nThe siblings manage a cricket fan page, which was found to be taken down at the time of writing. Bhojani has also been photographed by Getty Images as \u201can Indian fan\u201d.\n\nNarendra Bhojani hails from Kutch, Gujarat and was interviewed by a Gujarati web portal Leva Patel News on April 7, 2016. In the interview, Narendra Bhojani can be heard saying, \u201cWe [brothers] were born in India and live in London\u201d. The interviewer introduced him as a Gujarati. He further added, \u201cWe are a special group, we call ourselves Bhojani brothers but other people also join us\u201d.\n\nFact-checking other photographs in the collage\n\nWith a reverse image search on Google, it was found that the second image where a group of policemen can be seen nabbing a person is old and unrelated to the urinating incident. The image dates back to 2013 and pertains to an incident where an anti-G8 protester was arrested by the London police.\n\nAlt News couldn\u2019t verify the picture of an Iranian national passport. However, it may be noted that this picture contradicts the claim itself as the message talks about a Pakistani citizen whereas, the passport is of an Iranian national.\n\nThe claim that Farid Khan, a Pakistani citizen, urinated in public during a cricket match while pretending to be an Indian is false. The man involved in the obscenity is an Indian-origin man named Narendra Bhojani.", "lang": "en"}
