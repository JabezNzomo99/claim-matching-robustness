He is the general secretary of BJP Kerala, K Surendran. The image was a part of BJP\u2019s campaign in Pathanamthitta, as per numerous tweets.\n\nContrastingly, the image of Rahul Gandhi was lifted from the Congress leader\u2019s visit to flood-affected areas of Tamil Nadu and Kerala in 2015. As seen in the tweet, an elderly woman is visible in multiple photographs including the one where she\u2019s hugging Gandhi.\n\nShashi Tharoor\u2019s photograph was tweeted by the MP himself on April 13.\n\nNot the same woman\n\nAll three women might seem alike because of their old age and white hair. A closer look, however, reveals apparent distinctions in physical features. Alt News has juxtaposed photographs of the three women for a clearer view. The one on the left was photographed with BJP\u2019s K Surendran and the one on the right, with Shashi Tharoor. The elderly woman in the middle is the same woman who could be seen embracing Rahul Gandhi. We have chosen a different photograph of hers from the images tweeted by Congress for ease of distinction.\n\nThe woman in the middle is visibly different from the other two.\n\nThe other two women also have distinct physical features. For instance, the one on the left has more black hair than the woman on the right.\n\nAnother clear difference is the teeth. While the front teeth of the elderly woman on the left seem blackened, the one on the right has visibly protruding front teeth. The shape of the nose is distinct as well.\n\nTherefore, the three women aren\u2019t the same person. Moreover, one of them did not have an encounter with a Congress leader by BJP Kerala\u2019s K Surendran.", "lang": "en"}
