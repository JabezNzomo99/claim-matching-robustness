I never endorsed any individual candidate or a group of candidates. I never called for an ouster of Duterte although I have made and will continue to make critical remarks about his words and actuations,\u201d she told Rappler via email. (READ: Breaking Glass: Feminist, activist nun)\n\nRappler has also reached out to Evangelista to ask for the source or basis of his post, but he has not responded to our message.\n\nMananzan is part of the Movement Against Tyranny (MAT), an alliance of groups and individuals that fights for human rights. Though the organization has called for Duterte\u2019s resignation, she has cautioned in a speech during the first anniversary of MAT that the call for Duterte to step down should not be taken lightly.\n\n\u201cOur problems will not end with his resignation, if he has even the guts or delicadeza to do it,\u201d she said in her speech delivered in August 2018.\n\nMananzan also didn\u2019t advocate for Robredo as an immediate replacement to Duterte \u2013 or any other substitute for that matter \u2013 as the Facebook post suggests. She reasoned in the same speech that it would take not only an acceptable successor, but also the people\u2019s high level of engagement to make sure the mistakes of the past are not repeated.\n\nThere is another video circulating on social media where the activist nun was recorded as saying, \u201cKung wala na tayong aasahan sa gobyerno, sinong inaasahan? Tayo po mismo. (If we can\u2019t rely on the government anymore, who do we depend on? It\u2019s ourselves, the people.) Kaya po (So) let\u2019s go and again, ibalik natin ang (let\u2019s bring back the) magic of people power.\u201d\n\nThe video was taken during the #MadayangHalalan mobilization on May 17 to protest the results of the 2019 midterm elections. However, there was no mention of Duterte, Robredo, or Otso Diretso. (WATCH: Sr Mary John Mananzan reacts to youth's views on People Power)\n\n\u201cI never said those words. Pure invention, not even my style \u2013 far from it. Even my friends knew in an instant that they are not my words,\u201d Mananzan said via email, referring to the Facebook post. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
