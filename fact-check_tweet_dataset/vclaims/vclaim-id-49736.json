The claim is misleading; there is no evidence to support the statistics in the graphic, an epidemiologist said; as of July 17, 2020, international health authorities have not published any data on the effectiveness of face masks in curbing the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe graphic was published here on Facebook on April 27, 2020. It has been shared more than 150 times since.\n\nThe graphic suggests masks could cut the risk of COVID-19 transmission. It claims that the transmission rate between a COVID-19 carrier and a non-carrier is 100 percent, which can drop to 1.5 percent if both parties wear masks.\n\nA warning written in simplified Chinese at the bottom of the graphic states: \u201cPlease refuse to interact intimately with anyone who are not wearing masks / all types of masks would work\u201d.\n\nUnder the graphic, a simplified Chinese-language banner emphasises \n\n \"the difference between wearing and not wearing a mask / when both parties are masked, the transmission rate is the lowest, at 1.5% only\u201d.\n\nHu Zhaoming, the spokesperson for China's Bureau of Public Information and Communication, also tweeted an English version of the graphic, asking the netizens to \u201cmake your own decision after careful study of this illustrated picture\u201d.\n\nThe same graphic was shared here on Weibo with a similar claim. Its English version was shared here and here on Facebook; here on Twitter, and here on Instagram alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading.\n\nProfessor Benjamin John Cowling, head of Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support the statistics cited in the graphic.\n\n\u201cMasks are effective, but I think those numbers [in the graphic] overestimate the effectiveness of masks,\u201d he told AFP by email on July 16, 2020.\n\nRegardless of whether the wearer has been infected with COVID-19 or other communicable diseases, surgical masks can reduce but not eliminate \u201cvirus-laden particles\u201d passing through the mask into a person\u2019s lungs or into the environment, Professor Cowling added. \u201cSome masks are better than others, and some particle sizes can be filtered more effectively than others.\"\n\nNeither the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nor the World Health Organization (WHO), have published official statistics about the effectiveness of face masks in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe CDC advises the general public to wear cloth face coverings to reduce the spread of COVID-19, while healthcare workers are required to wear surgical masks, according to information on the CDC's website here.\n\nIn response to an inquiry from AFP about the misleading posts on July 16, 2020, a WHO spokesperson shared its official guidance on mask wearing that has been published here and here.\n\nAs stated here in the WHO\u2019s interim guidance on the use of masks in the context of COVID-19, published on June 5, 2020, \u201cWHO continues gathering scientific data and evidence on the effectiveness of different masks use and on its potential harms, risks and disadvantages, as well as its combination with hand hygiene, physical distancing and other IPC measures.\"\n\nIn response to the misleading posts, a spokesperson for the Hong Kong Department of Health told AFP by email on July 16, 2020: \u201cDroplet transmission occurs when a person is in close contact of within 1 metre and exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets through coughing or sneezing.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson declined to comment on the percentages listed in the graphic.\n\nAs of July 17, 2020, the Hong Kong Department of Health urged the public to wear surgical masks in crowded areas.", "lang": "en"}
