Kennedy\u2019s shirt -- Kardashian refuted the claim that she acquired it\n\nAn image of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s bloodstained assassination shirt has been shared repeatedly on Facebook, Twitter and Reddit alongside a claim that US socialite Kim Kardashian gifted it to her daughter, North West. The image purports to show a screenshot of an Instagram Story on Kardashian\u2019s official account. The claim is false; the US National Archives states on its website that the clothing Kennedy wore when he was murdered remains preserved in its archives; Kardashian has publicly refuted the claim as a \u201csick joke\u201d, stating on Twitter that the purported screenshot from her Instagram story was \u201cobviously fake\u201d.\n\nThe image was published here on Facebook on December 29, 2019.\n\nThe text in the screenshot of the purported Instagram story reads: \u201cAlong with the Michael Jackson\u2019s jacket and hat, North also got the shirt John F. Kennedy wore when he was assassinated.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe image was also posted on Twitter here, where it has been liked for more than 1,700 times, and on Reddit here.\n\nThe claim in the posts is false. The clothing worn by Kennedy on the day he was assassinated remains in the \u201clegal and physical custody\u201d of the US government\u2019s National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), according to this page on its website.\n\n\u201cThe apparel is located in a secure area, under climate-controlled conditions, and stored flat in special containers for preservation purposes,\u201d the agency\u2019s website reads. \u201cIn addition, NARA created detailed color photos of these materials as part of a larger preservation effort to photograph the significant artifacts in the JFK Assassination Records Collection. Due to the restraints of the deed of gift under which the materials were transferred to NARA, NARA has not posted these photographs online, as we have with photographs of other JFK assassination related artifacts. However, the photographs of the clothing are available for examination in our research room in College Park, Maryland, or may be purchased for a fee.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the statement on the NARA\u2019s website:\n\nThe image in the misleading post contains a card with this former seal for the US National Archives.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the seals:\n\nAnother photo of the same shirt, credited to the National Archives, was published here by Getty on January 1, 1995.\n\nKardashian refuted the claim that she had bought the shirt after Refinery29, a US-based news and lifestyle website, reported the story.\n\n\u201cWOW this is obviously fake!\u201d Kardashian tweeted here on December 31, 2019. \u201c@Refinery29 I did not get JFK\u2019s shirt. That is a sick joke that someone tweeted as a fake ig story that I never posted.\u201d\n\nRefinery29 issued a correction in this article on December 31, 2019, which stated that an earlier version of the report included a \u201cfalsified Instagram image\u201d that had been removed.\n\nThe correction states: \u201cThis story has been updated from the original version. Earlier, it included a falsified Instagram image, which has been removed.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the article and the correction:\n\nKardashian\u2019s denial and the Refinery29 correction were reported here by US media site Insider and here by US tabloid the New York Daily News on December 31, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
