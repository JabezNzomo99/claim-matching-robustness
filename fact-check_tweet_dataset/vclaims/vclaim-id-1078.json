Though Gates did argue that African-Americans, second to health care workers, should be given priority access to the COVID-19 vaccine once it is available, she did not say that they \u201cmust be vaccinated first.\u201d The headline and its interpretation on Facebook is misleading.\n\nExamples of posts can be found here , here , and here .\n\nThe posts have misled users into believing that Gates wants to test the COVID-19 vaccine on black people. Comments include, \u201cWe are not crash test dummies, we\u2019ll go after you,\u201d \u201cNow that is a very racist remark. Uncalled for, how dare she,\u201d and \u201cHmmm in other words we\u2019re the guinea pigs.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with TIME Magazine on June 4, 2020, Gates said, \u201cThe first people that need this vaccine are the 60 million health care workers around the world. They deserve to get it before anybody else. Then you start tiering.\u201d Answering the question of who has the highest need for COVID-19 vaccines after health care workers, Gates answered, \u201cIn the U.S., that would be black people next, quite honestly, and many other people of color. They are having disproportionate effects from COVID-19.\u201d (here )\n\nBlack Americans are more likely to die from COVID-19, reflecting longstanding disparities in health and inequalities in access to medical care. By early April in Illinois, for example, black people had made up about 30% of cases and about 40% of coronavirus-related deaths, according to statistics provided by the state\u2019s public health agency. African-Americans make up just 14.6% of the state\u2019s population ( here ).\n\nMeanwhile in New York City, the wealthy, mostly white enclave of Gramercy Park in Manhattan has a rate of 31 deaths per 100,000 residents, according to data released by New York City\u2019s health department; a long subway ride away in Far Rockaway in the borough of Queens, which is more than 40% black and 25% Latino or Hispanic, the death rate is nearly 15 times higher: 444 deaths per 100,000 residents ( here ).\n\nMisleading. Melinda Gates did not say that \u201cblack people must be vaccinated first\u201d but that, after health care workers, they should have priority access to a COVID-19 vaccine once available due to the pandemic disproportionately affecting people of color.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
