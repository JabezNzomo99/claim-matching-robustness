The man in the video is actor Javed Hyder and it has been claimed that he resorted to selling vegetables to make ends meet as there is no work amid the lockdown due to COVID-19.\n\nThe caption of the video read: \u201cHe\u2019s an actor #Javed_Hyder\n\n No work due to lockdown mahamari.\u201d\n\nThe same video was shared by actress Dolly Bindra on her official Twitter handle with the same claim.\n\nALSO READ: Fact Check: Old picture shared as Indian soldiers marching towards China\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above video and found that the claim attached to the video is misleading.\n\nUpon our investigation we found that the video in question is authentic as the man in the video is actor Javed Hyder himself, but he was just acting for the video and NOT selling vegetables for real.\n\nIn a recent interview with Mumbai Mirror dated June 29, 2020, Hyder had clarified that he is NOT a vegetable vendor and the video of him selling vegetable was an \u2018act\u2019 for his followers on TikTok.\n\n\u201cNo, I am not a vegetable vendor. I am an actor by profession even now. The entire selling vegetables video was just an act and I had made that TikTok only to motivate my followers that one should not give up when times are tough and that no work is small or big. I had no idea that it would go out with this message. Dolly Bindra ji had shared the video on her social media handle stating that I\u2019m selling vegetables now and I had even commented that it was only an act and nothing more, but I think people didn\u2019t notice it and the video went viral overnight,\u201d Javed Hyder was quoted by Mirror Online.\n\nHence, we can conclude that the claim of Javed Hyder selling vegetable due to lockdown is false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
