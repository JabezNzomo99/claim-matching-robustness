But it\u2019s open to debate whether it\u2019s undervalued right now.\n\nHaving an exchange rate that\u2019s too high can be a problem. In particular, it makes it cheap to import foreign goods (which are priced in cheap foreign currencies) and hard to sell exports (which are priced in expensive sterling). A country may end up buying much more than it sells abroad, as the UK does.\n\nIn February, the International Monetary Fund said the sterling was overvalued by somewhere between 5% and 15% in 2015. Just before the referendum, the IMF put the over-valuation slightly higher, saying that sterling was overvalued by between 5% and 20% in 2015. Other experts, like the former governor of the Bank of England and the IMF, have agreed that sterling was overvalued.\n\nOn 14 October, the effective exchange rate was 18% below the average for 2015. That\u2019s the value of sterling compared to a range of other currencies used by the UK\u2019s most important trading partners. If nothing had changed since the IMF\u2019s recommendations were made, it could mean sterling was now undervalued.\n\nBut other things have changed.\n\nWhen the IMF made these judgements it assumed the UK would vote to remain in the EU. In the IMF\u2019s view, the value of the pound might need to be even lower now that the UK has voted to leave.\n\nThat\u2019s because leaving the EU single market would mean other countries would put tariffs (taxes) on imports from the UK. Higher tariffs would make imports from the UK more expensive and so other countries would be less inclined to buy them. To make up for this, the value of sterling would have to fall even further to keep the price of UK exports low.\n\nSo right now it\u2019s hard to say whether the value of the pound has dropped lower than what the IMF would recommend. Since no-one knows what kind of trade relationships the UK will have once it leaves the EU, opinions on the UK\u2019s long-term potential for trade or the best exchange rate for sterling are open to debate.", "lang": "en"}
