After we leave the EU, that means we cannot take back control of \u00a3350 million a week.\n\nHowever you adjust the claim to make it more accurate, it will always miss the key context: economists on both sides during the referendum predicted that the impact on the economy from changes to trade and more would be far bigger than the UK\u2019s EU membership fee.\n\nThe UK rebate means we would never send or take back control of \u00a3350 million\n\nIt was often claimed during the referendum that the UK \u201csends\u201d \u00a3350 million a week to Brussels, and that this sum of money could be spent on other things like the NHS if we left the EU. This is wrong.\n\n\u00a3350 million is roughly what we would send to the EU budget if it wasn\u2019t for the UK\u2019s budget rebate. The rebate is effectively a discount on what we would otherwise be liable for. This rebate was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher in 1984 and the way it is calculated can\u2019t be changed in future without the UK\u2019s agreement.\n\nThe closest\u2014not perfect\u2014analogy is that \u00a3350 million is like the amount a supermarket till displays before the discounts are applied. You never pay it and you never owe it. The number is just one step towards the final bill.\n\nThe UK actually pays around \u00a3250 million a week. We also get some money back from the EU, but that isn\u2019t fully under our control, as Mr Johnson points out.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s most recent claim in the Telegraph is still inaccurate, despite his more careful wording: it doesn\u2019t make sense to talk about taking back control over money that is never sent and never owed to anyone else.\n\nThis needs to be corrected\n\nMr Johnson has not, as far as we know, explicitly distanced himself from last year\u2019s \u00a3350m claim\u2014if anything the current claim echoes it\u2014even though it was called \u201cpotentially misleading\u201d and, after it continued to be used, simply \u201cmisleading\u201d by the UK Statistics Authority last year (under the leadership of a previous Chair).\n\nWhile it would be helpful for the Authority to explain why it has worded its latest letter more strongly in response to a less inaccurate version of the claim, the more pressing need is for an apology and correction from Mr Johnson to set the record straight.\n\nWe've published a more detailed analysis of the letters from the UK Statistics Authority and the Foreign Secretary.", "lang": "en"}
