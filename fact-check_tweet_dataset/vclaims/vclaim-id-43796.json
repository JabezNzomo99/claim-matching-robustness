The claim is false; a closer analysis of the video found it shows protesters chanting pro-India slogans; the protest's organisers said they heard no pro-Pakistan slogans being chanted at the protest.\n\nThe video was shared in this Facebook post published on December 28, 2019. It has been viewed more than 50,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nCAA refers to India's Citizenship Amendment Act, a law passed on December 11, 2019, which grants Indian citizenship to non-Muslim immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. Critics labeled the law anti-Muslim, resulting in violent nationwide protests, as reported by AFP here on January 7, 2020.\n\nThe same video was also published here, here and here on Facebook, here and here on Twitter, and here and here on YouTube, with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video shows protesters chanting pro-India slogans at an anti-citizenship law protest.\n\nThe video shows a December 13, 2019, protest organised by the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) party\u2019s Lucknow office in the north Indian city of Lucknow.\n\nA longer video of the same protest was published here on Twitter on December 29, 2019. The video in the misleading posts corresponds with the Twitter video from the 10-second to the 22-second mark.\n\nProtesters in the longer Twitter video can be heard chanting \u201cAkbar Owaisi Zindabad, Kashif Sahab Zindabad, Hindustan Zindabad\u201d, which translates to English as: \u201cLong live Akbar Owaisi, Long live Kashif sir, Long live India.\u201d\n\nAkbar Owaisi refers to Akbaruddin Owaisi, Indian politician and leader of the AIMIM party. Kashif is the aforementioned leader of the AIMIM party\u2019s Lucknow division.\n\nThe AIMIM\u2019s Lucknow office chief Kashif Ahmad denied reports of pro-Pakistan slogans being raised during the protest in a phone conversation with AFP on January 8, 2020.\n\n\u201cThat claim is fake, there were no pro-Pakistan slogans raised in our entire rally. Our supporters only raised anti-citizenship law slogans, pro-party and pro-party, pro-party leadership, including my name, and pro-India slogans,\u201d he said.\n\nAhmad shared four photos from the protest on his Twitter account here. No pro-Pakistan placards can be seen in these photos.\n\nAnother video of the same rally uploaded here on YouTube on December 13, 2019, shows protesters chanting \u201cIndia is ours\u201d.\n\nSimilar videos of the December 13 protest were published on YouTube here, here, here, here, here and here but none showed protesters holding or chanting pro-Pakistan slogans.\n\nAccording to this report by the English-language Indian daily newspaper Indian Express published December 18, 2019, Lucknow police filed sedition charges against protesters at the December 13 rally \u201cfor allegedly raising anti-national and objectionable slogans\u201d.\n\nPolice later dropped these charges, citing a \u201c\u2018clerical\u2019 mistake\u201d, as reported by English-language Indian newspaper Hindustan Times here on December 18, 2019.\n\nThe Indian Penal Code defines sedition as committed when \u201cwhoever, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the Government estab\u00adlished by law\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
