That\u2019s around 30% of all children.\n\nRelative poverty looks at households with less than 60% of the median income that year. There are other ways to measure poverty, though.\n\nOne is to look at households with 60% less than the median income in 2010/11, accounting for inflation. That\u2019s known officially as \u2018absolute poverty\u2019.\n\nLooking at it this way around 3.7 million children were living in poverty, or around 27%.\n\nIf we look at poverty before housing costs are considered, as government statisticians recommend, around 2.7 million children were in relative poverty in 2015/16, or around 20%. Around 2.3 million were in absolute poverty, or around 17%.", "lang": "en"}
