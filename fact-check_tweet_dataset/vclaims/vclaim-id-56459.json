The claim is false; the original tweet that Gandhi posted in tribute to Rajput has been doctored to replace the word \u201cactor\u201d with \u201ccricketer\u201d.\n\nA screenshot of the purported tweet was posted in this Facebook post on June 15, 2020. It has been shared more than 300 times.\n\nThe purported tweet from the @RahulGandhi Twitter account states: \u201cI am sorry to hear about the passing of #SushantSinghRajput. A young & talented Cricketer gone too soon. My condolences to his family, friends & fans across the world.\u201d\n\nSushant Singh Rajput, a 34-year old bollywood actor, was found dead at his residence on June 14, AFP reported here on the same day. Rajput played Mahendra Singh Dhoni, former captain of the Indian cricket team, in a 2016 biopic.\n\nThe purported tweet appears to be from the verified Twitter account of former opposition leader Rahul Gandhi. The caption of the misleading Facebook post, which reads: \u201cMovie Star became Cricketer\u201d, appears to mock Gandhi for confusing Rajput with a cricketer.\n\nThe image was also shared here, here, here and here on Facebook, and here, here, here and here on Twitter alongside a similar claim in English and Hindi.\n\nThe claim, however, is false.\n\nA keyword search on Twitter found this post published on Gandhi\u2019s Twitter account on June 14, 2020. The tweet has the same time and date stamps as the one in the misleading posts. The tweet includes the word \u201cactor\u201d instead of \u201ccricketer\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the doctored tweet (L) and the original tweet from Gandhi (R) with the time and date stamps, as well as the key difference marked in red by AFP:\n\n\u201cThis is not the original tweet but a doctored one,\u201d Randeep Singh Surjewala, chairperson of the communication department of Indian National Congress (INC), India\u2019s main opposition party, told AFP in a text reply on June 20. Gandhi was the president of the INC between 2017 and 2019.\n\nAFP has previously debunked misleading claims related to doctored visuals of Gandhi here, here and here.", "lang": "en"}
