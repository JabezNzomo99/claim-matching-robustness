The Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the Cape Coast Metropolitan Assembly (CCMA), Richmond Yeboah, said the plan to have a daycare centre in the market was changed at the initial stages of its construction.\n\nResponding to a question on the National Democratic Congress\u2019s (NDC) plans for improving social support for vulnerable groups and women at a gathering to mark International Youth Day, the running mate of the opposition NDC, Prof Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang, claimed that the new Kotokuraba market in Cape Coast had a daycare centre in it (11:00 \u2013 13:00).\n\n\u201cIt was during the time of John Evans Atta Mills that the Kotokuraba market was initiated. It was completed by John Mahama and there is a daycare in that place,\u201d she said while indicating that the NDC had put in place policies that demonstrated care for women and vulnerable groups.\n\nThe Kotokuraba market was built and commissioned by former President John Mahama in 2016.\n\nTo verify the claim, this reporter visited the Kotokuraba market to check if there is a daycare facility there.\n\nThe market has 246 lockable shops, 496 stalls, 26 supermarkets, two banks, 14 office spaces, fire station, butchery, cold store, warehouse, and two-level car parks with a total of 188 parking lots. This reporter did not see a daycare centre at the market.\n\nWe also spoke to some traders in the market on the issue. All the traders we spoke to said they were not aware of the existence of a daycare centre in the market.\n\n\u201cIf there is anything like that, then I am yet to know where it is located in the market,\u201d said Emelia Baidoo of store number AGS43.\n\nWe further spoke to Mr Yeboah, the public relations officer of the Cape Coast Metropolitan Assembly (CCMA), managers of the market, who confirmed that the market in its current state has no daycare facility.\n\nAccording to him, although it was part of the initial plan to have a daycare centre in the market, the plan was altered at the initial stage of construction of the market.\n\n\u201cWhen the market was handed over to us, that plan had been altered. It changed initially when they realised the number of stores did not correlate to the number of registered market traders.\u201d\n\nBased on the information gathered from a physical inspection of the market and speaking to the relevant bodies, it is evident that there is no daycare centre at the new Kotokuraba market at the moment. Though the initial plan was to have a daycare facility at the market, that plan never materialised.\n\nThe reporter produced this fact-check under the auspices of the Dubawa 2020 Fellowship to facilitate the ethos of \u201ctruth\u201d in journalism and to enhance media literacy in the country.", "lang": "en"}
