It is not true and stems from an unfounded article that has been circulating since 2017.\n\nThe lengthy quote begins: \u201cYou learn to (sic) recognise early on which of them want to abuse you\u201d and continues by talking about alleged abuse in Hollywood including gruesome allegations of shoes made of human flesh.
