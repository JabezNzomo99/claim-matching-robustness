Police and their political masters should hang their heads in shame- translation).\n\nThe image in question is not recent and thus, does not pertain to the ongoing protest by JNU students. This particular photograph was published in news reports from December 2012. It may be recalled that in the same month, a massive protest had broken out in the national capital following the brutal rape and murder of Nirbhaya on December 16, 2012. Alt News reverse-searched the photograph on Google in order to ascertain its origin.\n\nThe image is from Raisina Hill, where protesters had gathered in large numbers, and the police had resorted to lathicharge to quell the unrest. Alt News found the image published in news reports of the Hindustan Times and India Today. On further probing, Alt News found the photograph on the website of Reuters. It was clicked by Adnan Abidi on December 22, 2012.\n\nIt may thus be noted that this photograph is not representative of the ongoing protest by JNU students. It pertains to the protest over the Nirbhaya case, and was clicked in December 2012. In another instance, a photo of CPI leader Annie Raja was shared as a protesting JNU student. Also, random images of young women found online were circulated to malign JNU students.", "lang": "en"}
