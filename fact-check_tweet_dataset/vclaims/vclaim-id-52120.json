It is important that it be confidential to the recipients of this email and up your chains of authority only. As I mentioned on Friday, Senator Leahy\u2019s staff has distributed a \u2018confidential\u2019 letter to Dem Counsel on Thursday from Collyn Peddie, who served as the attorney for \u2018Jane Doe\u2019 in some or several of the Texas bypass cases. According to either the letter or the Leahy staff Ms. Peddie sent this letter in the strictest confidence because she is up for partner, and believes she will be fired if it is publicized. Several members of her firm are lead supporters of the Owen nomination. Leahy\u2019s staff is only sharing with Democratic counsels. However, we might expect this letter to be used like the Brenda Polkey in Pickering at a moment when we are unable to respond. \u2026 \u201cI have not seen the letter but it strongly criticizes Owen\u2019s actions on the Doe cases, especially for her \u2018appalling insensitivity\u2019 To the pregnant minors before her court. \u201cSpecifically, Peddie accuses Owen of publishing \u2018dissents and concurrences in which paragraph after paragraph of confidential testimony was quoted in great detail.\u2019 \u201d Later on in the same email: \u201cPeddie criticized Owen\u2019s dissent in Jane Doe 4 which argued that parental rights should trump the risk that \u2018parents would throw a minor girl out on the street upon finding out she was pregnant.\u2019 \u201d", "lang": "en"}
