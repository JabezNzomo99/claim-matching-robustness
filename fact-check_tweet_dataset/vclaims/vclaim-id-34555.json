However, the photographer who took the pictures told AFP that\u2019s \u201cnot true\u201d.\n\nThe Facebook post, which we\u2019ve archived here, has been shared more than 4,000 times since it was published on November 20, 2019. It shows pictures of a rhinoceros using its horn to pluck a small zebra out of the mud. \u201cWorth a share!\u201d the caption reads. \u201cRhino rescues a zebra foal from the mud.\u201d\n\nSimilar posts started circulating on Facebook and Twitter in 2015, for example here, here and here.\n\nHowever, the wildlife photographer who snapped the interaction told a less heart-warming version of events.\n\nA Google search for the phrase \u201crhino saves zebra\u201d reveals multiple media reports which name the man behind the photographs as Roel van Muiden.\n\nContacted by AFP, he said the zebra had been \u201cabandoned by its mother\u201d when he found it at Madikwe Game Reserve near the South Africa-Botswana border.\n\n\u201cI know the posts usually mention that the rhino saved the foal, but that is not true,\u201d he said via Facebook Messenger.\n\n\u201cThe rhino was curious and lifted the thing stuck in his mud-wallow. In doing so, the foal got disembowelled. It died later.\u201d\n\nVan Muiden said the photographs \u201cdo not really show the speed and force the rhino acted with\u201d.\n\nThe photographer previously wrote about his experience in Africa Geographic in 2015.\n\nClaims that the rhino rescued the zebra were previous debunked by fact-checking site Snopes in 2016.\n\nVan Muiden, who now works as a safari guide around Africa, said nature is \u201cquite often very cruel to watch\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
