No, that's not true: Linda Collins, who lost her state senate post to another Republican last year, was shot to death at her Pocahontas, Arkansas, home on June 4, 2019, but there is no evidence that she had collected any evidence of a child trafficking ring before her apparent murder.\n\nStories claiming a connection between the ex-politician's death and child trafficking were published in the days after her killing, including an article published by NewsPunch.com on June 12, 2019 titled \"Police Investigating Death Of Former Senator Who Believed She Was Closing In On Child Trafficking Ring\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe 57-year-old woman dropped \"Smith\" from her name in the past year as she divorced her husband, a retired judge. The fact that a Republican politician in Arkansas was murdered and that investigators are being tight-lipped about the case is good fodder for the usual conspiracy promoters who target the Clinton Foundation -- the charity created by former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. This NewsPunch story also said:\n\nThis article offers no sourcing for the sensational claim, although there is a hyperlink embedded that points to another thinly-sourced report on a website called CDmedia. This story said:\n\nCDmedia promised \"much more information,\" but they were still \"in the process of verifying\" it. While this website would not give any qualifications for its \"verified source,\" Lead Stories did identify a source of the allegations that Collins' death was connected to her purported child trafficking investigation. She is Lisa Michaele Walker-McMillan, who described herself in her LinkedIn profile as a community advocate in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Walker-McMillan made her explosive claims in an interview two days after Collins' death, outlining an operation run by the Clinton Foundation in which the state Child Protective Services (CPS) agency takes children from their parents and send them on cargo ships and airliners to China where their organs would be harvested. Other children are allegedly used as sex slaves:\n\nIs this woman a credible source? Susan Constantine, a leading authority on body language and deception detection reviewed Walker-McMillan's video for Lead Stories and concluded she \"has a psychological issue and is delusional.\" Constantine noted that Walker-McMillan's body language \"betrayed\" her as she touched her neck and ears at times, and repeatedly looked away and in the air, with lots of pauses. \"She does believe in what she is saying, but at the same time her body language is betraying her because her subconscious knows what really happened,\" Constantine said. \"She reminds me of people that have dreamed up stories and start believing it.\"\n\nFor Walker-McMillan to believe that the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were staged as a strategy to change the system for tracking mortgages, which she believed made American children a \"commodity\" for trade, is also reason to believe she is delusional and not credible as the only source for the claim that Collins was murdered in order to squash evidence of a Clinton Foundation child trafficking operation. As for Merrill Lynch receiving a U.S. patent giving the investment banking company ownership of you DNA, check this list of every patent the company has been granted and there is none like that. But there is more. She also said in this interview that the country's top officials in charge of finding missing children are pedophiles:\n\nMarc Klaas, whose daughter Polly was kidnapped from her bedroom and murdered when she was 12 in 1993, told Lead Stories he found her claims that the Amber Alert system is controlled by pedophiles is \"absurd, absolute B.S.\" Klaas said he got to know President Clinton when he was working on laws to protect children and found Clinton to be very much concerned about the safety of children.\n\nNeed more reasons to doubt the story? Listen to what Walker-McMillan said in another interview on May 31, 2019 -- before the killing of Collins. She claimed that members of the Trump administration -- including the attorney general -- are part of a 50-year cover up of a plot to destroy America with a race war:\n\nSee that interview here:\n\nThere is no evidence to show that Walker-McMillan was close to Collins. She said she only met her last year while working on a non-related issue in the Arkansas legislature. There are no tweets or Facebook posts from Collins to indicate she was investigating child trafficking by the Arkansas CPS, although there is video of her questioning officials at a hearing about grandparents being denied custody of children taken from their parents. Some stories reference another hearing in which Sen. Collins questioned officials with the parent agency of the CPS about misspending money related to Medicaid expansion, not child protection.\n\nAlso, several stories said Collins was scheduled to share her purported evidence about a child sex trafficking with a grand jury this month. There is no evidence that such a grand jury has been convened.\n\nIn summary, the ONLY named source for the claim that Linda Collins was murdered to prevent revelations of a child trafficking ring controlled by Bill and Hillary Clinton is a woman who believes U.S. Attorney General William Barr and all of his relatives are plotting a race war to destroy America; that 53 million American children are missing and have been sent to other countries as sex slaves and organ donors; and that 9/11 was staged to change the banking system so Merrill Lynch could own your DNA, your children and your homes.\n\nOne more look at Walker-McMillan in a Facebook Live video:\n\nHere is an example of how some Facebook users shared the story:\n\nNewsPunch (formerly YourNewsWire) has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt. Their Facebook page \"The People's Voice\" even lost its verification checkmark according to a report from MMFA.\n\nThe Terms of Use of the site (archived here, still referencing YourNewsWire) also make it clear they don't really stand behind the accuracy of any of their reporting:\n\nThe site was profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes newspunch.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
