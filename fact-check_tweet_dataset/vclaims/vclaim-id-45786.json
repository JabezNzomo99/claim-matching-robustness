Beware of such Fraudulent websites and whatsapp forwards. pic.twitter.com/qvaeDODsWk When we clicked the website link, it led us to a website that did not have any government credentials. The page shows that precisely 1,936 lockdown packages are left and numbers did not change throughout the process. Then they asked a series of questions like, are you a Bonafide Indian Citizen. On clicking yes, we were navigated to the amount selection page. After completing the procedure, the site asks you to share the link on WhatsApp groups to avail the amount. However, no bank details or personal details were asked for throughout the process. It should also be noted that the URL does not have a gov.in or nic.in domain, which all government-run websites have.\n\n The above information proves that no such schemes of any amount have been launched by the Indian Government. Hence, the posts in question are fake.
