It was the latest twist in the election drama after the Supreme Court ruled that the election held the previous election was invalid. As reported by AFP here, she claimed her life was in danger.\n\nThis article published on June 24, 2019 on the Kenyan-Report website claimed that Akombe had been found strangled in her New York apartment.\n\n\u201cBreaking News: Roselyn Akombe found dead in her house in U.S.A,\u201d the headline read.\n\nAmong other places, the story has been posted in numerous Facebook groups, some of which have more than 150,000 followers.\n\nAccording to social media analysis tool CrowdTangle, the article has racked up more than 80 shares and 2,600 interactions on Facebook. We\u2019ve archived one of the Facebook posts here.\n\nBut hours after the article began spreading online, Akombe responded on Twitter to confirm that she was very much alive.\n\nAkombe, who now works for the United Nations, followed up with a photograph of herself and a second tweet.\n\n\n\nAkombe told AFP via WhatsApp that she has since received countless messages from concerned family and friends.\n\n\"I hope at some point we'll figure out a way of minimizing the impact these things have on families. The worst in my case was actually not just Facebook but WhatsApp given the large number of these groups and its accessibility to many,\" she said.\n\nAkombe's employers also confirmed that the death claim was bogus.\n\n\"I have not seen the reports but I can confirm that Ms. Akombe works for the UN Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs in New York. And she is very much alive,\" a UN spokesman told AFP.\n\nRumours of the deaths of prominent Kenyan personalities are not a new occurrence. Just in April AFP debunked here the false news of the death of Ken Okoth, an MP who is battling cancer.", "lang": "en"}
