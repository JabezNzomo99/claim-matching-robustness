Vishvas News investigated and found the viral post to be fake. As per experts, mouthwash can neutralize the virus in the oral cavity for some time but will not cure the person who is showing viral loads in the mouth or throat.\n\nA post shared on Facebook by a user named Kaye Ross claims that mouthwash kills coronavirus and can be the cure for COVID-19. The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nVishvas News investigated and found a report published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. According to the study, gargling with mouthwash solutions may help \u2018inactive\u2019 the viral load of the SARS-COV-2 virus in the mouth thereby helping in lessening the spread of the infection. However, the report clearly stated that the antiviral efficacy of oral rinsing solutions against SARS-CoV-2 has not been examined.\n\nWe further investigated and found a report on Science Daily website published by Ruhr-University Bochum. As per the report, high viral loads can be detected in the oral cavity and throat of some Covid-19 patients. The use of mouthwashes that are effective against Sars-Cov-2 could thus help to reduce the viral load and possibly the risk of coronavirus transmission over the short term. This could be useful, for example, prior to dental treatments. However, mouth rinses are not suitable for treating Covid-19 infections or protecting yourself against catching the virus.\n\nAccording to WHO, there is no evidence that using mouthwash will protect you from infection with the new coronavirus.\n\nVishvas News spoke to Dr. Aanchal Chaudhary of Career postgraduate institute of dental sciences & hospital, Lucknow. She said: \u201cThere are no studies that prove the efficiency of any kind of mouthwash against the novel coronavirus, yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cCosmetic mouthwashes do not have medicinal value, they just help in clearing off bad breath. However, therapeutic mouthwashes have the ability to remove microbes present in the oral cavity for some time. As of now, we can say that therapeutic mouthwash can reduce the neutralize the virus of the mouth but has not shown any effect on Novel Coronavirus yet,\u201d she added.\n\nWe scanned the profile of the user who shared the viral post. We found that the user named Kaye Ross is based out of California.\n\nPost claiming mouthwash can kill coronavirus or can cure it is fake.\n\nDisclaimer: The #CoronavirusFacts database records fact-checks published since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak.
