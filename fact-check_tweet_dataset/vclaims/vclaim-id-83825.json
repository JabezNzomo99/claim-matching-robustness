It has been my privilege and honour to serve in the Reserve Bank of India in various capacities over the years. The support and hard work of RBI staff, officers and management has been the proximate driver of the Bank\u2019s considerable accomplishments in recent years. I take this opportunity to express gratitude to my colleagues and Directors of the RBI Central Board, and wish them all the best for the future.\"\n\nSince his resignation, Patel has not spoken to media or made any public statements about the reasons for his departure.\n\nThe resignation has been a major story for Indian media.\n\nThe Hindustan Times, one of the biggest English language newspapers in India, has reported extensively on Patel\u2019s resignation and subsequent events.\n\nHere are all the articles in Hindustan Times that mention Patel\u2019s resignation, showing that his only public comments on the resignation were contained in the original letter.\n\nDainik Jagran, a widely read Hindi language daily, has also reported extensively on Urjit Patel\u2019s resignation.
