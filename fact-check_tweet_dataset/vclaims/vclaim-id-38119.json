No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to mislead Trump supporters and Republicans into sharing made up stories that are clearly marked as satire when you actually click them. Articles from the site are frequently copied by foreign-run fake news websites. The people liking and sharing these stories are enriching foreign website operators or a liberal from Maine via the ad revenue generated with the content which is probably not what they expected or wanted.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Daily World Update on November 4, 2019 titled \"Ocasio-Cortez Bill Requires Seniors to Renew Driver's Licenses Monthly\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nJust as Alvin and the Chipmunks had \"Chipette\", the unnecessary cutesy female character that added nothing intelligent to the mix, so the Democratic Congress has Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Full of grand ideas and possibly marshmallow fluffernutter, she's forever striving to make a name for herself. Besides \"Princess Sissy of Socialistia\". AOC's latest brainstorm is house bill 3868, the \"Magoo Vehicular Safety Act\", which mandates a requirement that all citizens over the age of 65 and in possession of a valid driver's license must renew it on a monthly basis and submit to a rudimentary vision test in order to remain legal to operate. This suggestion is not only blatantly ageist, but will lead to a shocking waste of government resources.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nTo anyone who clicked through to actually read the story it would be immediately apparent the story was satirical in nature. The header of the site proclaimed \"Satire for flat earthers, Trumpsters and y'all qaeda\" and the article in question was posted under a category named \"AOC Fan Fiction for the Discerning Tater\". To be really sure we searched for the closest thing to \"house bill 3868\" we could find and came up with this:\n\nThere is no \"Magoo Vehicular Safety Act\" either, that is just a reference to a cartoon character:\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes dailyworldupdate.us as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability. Read their full assessment here.\n\nThe site is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run byself-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry extremely visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nHere is a video of Blair explaining how his process works:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nWe wrote about dailyworldupdate.us before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Kamala Harris Did NOT Say \"Our Military Are Soulless Cowards. Their Budget Must Be Cut.\"\n\u2022 Fake News: NO FBI Surveillance, Malia Obama NOT Seen Leaving Antifa Meeting In Baltimore\n\u2022 Fake News: Trump Did NOT File Lawsuit To Deport George Soros\n\u2022 Fake News: Ihlan Omar Did NOT Propose Nationwide Ban on 'Unhealthy and Immoral' Bacon", "lang": "en"}
