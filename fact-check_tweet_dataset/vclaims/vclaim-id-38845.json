It is now listed as a less common symptom by the World Health Organisation.\n\nThe NHS advises that if you have a high temperature or new, continuous cough you should stay at home for seven days. If the fever has gone after that time you may leave your home again. If you still have a high temperature, remain at home until it returns to normal. You can return to your normal routine if you still have a cough but no high temperature, as the cough can last for several weeks after the infection. New advice published on 18 May now says that anyone experiencing loss of taste or smell (known as 'anosmia') should also self-isolate.\n\nIf you live with others, they should stay at home for at least 14 days to stop the virus spreading. After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. Anyone who has had symptoms should remain at home for seven days from the first day of their symptoms (even if this means being at home for more than 14 days in total).\n\nIf you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term health condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, the NHS says you should try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days. If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.\n\nDo not go to a GP, pharmacy or hospital.\n\nIf these symptoms don\u2019t go away after seven days, if you can\u2019t cope with them at home or if you get worse then use the NHS online 111 coronavirus service. If you can\u2019t get the help you need there then you should call the 111 phone service.\n\nIf you have a medical emergency, you should still call 999 as you would normally.", "lang": "en"}
