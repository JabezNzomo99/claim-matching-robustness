This claim is largely false.\n\nExamples of these posts can be found here , here , and here .\n\nThe posts show a screenshot of a Google search for \u201ccan pigs be poisoned\u201d with a response from \u201cBiology Stack Exchange,\u201d part of a network of crowdsourced question-and-answer websites ( stackexchange.com/about ). The six-year-old thread can be found here .\n\nOn July 26, 2014, the creator of the thread asked other Stack Exchange users for \u201cscholarly verification\u201d on \u201cseveral non-religious arguments against eating pork.\u201d These \u201carguments\u201d included \u201cPigs and swine are so poisonous that you can hardly kill them with strychnine or other poisons,\u201d \u201cSwine and pigs have over a dozen parasites within them, e.g. tapeworms, flukes, worms, and trichinae,\u201d and \u201cThere is no safe temperature at which pork can be cooked to ensure that they will be killed.\u201d\n\nARE PIGS POISONOUS? CAN PORK BE COOKED SAFELY?\n\nAccording to the World Organization for Animal Health, parasites associated with pork and pork products include Trichinella spiralis, Taenia solium and Toxoplasma gondii ( www.oie.int/doc/ged/d9157.pdf ). However, the organization says that \u201call three parasites are inactivated by various methods of cooking, freezing and curing.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood production practices, including a high level of sanitation, rodent and cat control on farms, can prevent opportunities for exposure of pigs to these parasites,\u201d the paper adds. \u201cAlternatively, meat inspection, proper commercial processing and adherence to guidelines for in-home preparation of meat are effective methods for reduction of risks for human exposure.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, trichinosis is a type of roundworm infection that can result from eating domestic pigs and wild boars hosting these parasites ( here ). The clinic says the infection is acquired by eating roundworm larvae in raw or undercooked meat, and that it is most widespread in rural areas throughout the world.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) says that in order to eat pork safely, one should cook \u201call raw pork steaks, chops, and roasts to a minimum internal temperature of 145 \u00b0F (62.8 \u00b0C) as measured with a food thermometer before removing meat from the heat source. For safety and quality, allow meat to rest for at least three minutes before carving or consuming. Ground pork should be cooked to 160\u00b0F (71.1 \u00b0C)\u201d ( here ).\n\nMore information on parasites that can be found in pork is available here and www.pig333.com/pig-diseases/ .\n\nThe Guardian published advice on cooking pork safely here .\n\nThe claim that pigs are difficult to poison is false. Several websites catering to pig owners mention common causes and symptoms of poisoning in pigs, from mycotoxins to salt poisoning to plants. The Pig Site, for example, says that mycotoxins, toxic compounds made by certain types of molds, \u201care one of the most common forms of poisoning\u201d for pigs ( here ).\n\nAccording to Michigan State University\u2019s College of Agriculture & Natural Resources, particularly harmful mycotoxins include Deoxynivalenol, or vomitoxin, which harms the pig\u2019s immune system ( here , here , here , ).\n\nPlant poisoning is rarer in pigs because, unlike cows or sheep, they are non-grazing animals. According to the website Veterian Key, plants found to be poisonous to pigs include cuckoo-pint, boxwood, hemlock, spurge olive, stinking iris root, tomato shoots and stems, tobacco, water dropwort, and rhubarb ( here ). The Animal Sanctuary Project, a digital guide for people operating animal sanctuaries, provides a list of other things that are toxic to pigs, including pesticides, herbicides, algae, lead, snakebites, sudden ingestion of too much salt, selenium, and ingredients found in wood stains and paints ( here ).\n\nStrychnine, a compound found in pesticides, is highly toxic to most animals, including pigs. The median lethal dose for dogs, cattle, horses, and pigs is 0.5\u20131 milligrams per kilogram ( here ). More information on strychnine, provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) can be found here .\n\nPartly false. Pigs can be poisoned and killed by strychnine, among many other substances. Pigs may harbor certain parasites but cooking pork to a minimum internal temperature of 145 \u00b0F (62.8 \u00b0C) will kill the three main parasites associated with pigs.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
