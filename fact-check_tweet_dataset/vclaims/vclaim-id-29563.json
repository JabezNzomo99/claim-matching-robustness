That\u2019s why they want climate change to be made a \u201ccore part\u201d of the national curriculum, so that students learn about it in greater depth.\n\nAs the students say, climate change is already incorporated into the curriculum in both geography and science in England. Short of asking every school or student directly, we can\u2019t say exactly how much children are taught about climate change in practice\u2014it will probably vary from school to school.\n\nWhat does the national curriculum cover at the moment?\n\nWe\u2019ve only looked at the situation in England, as education policy is devolved in the UK and the students in question go to school in England.\n\nIssues around climate change are covered in both science and geography at Key Stage 3 (age 11-14) and Key Stage 4 (age 14-16). Both subjects are compulsory at Key Stage 3, while only science is compulsory at Key Stage 4.\n\u2022 \u201cthe production of carbon dioxide by human activity and the impact on climate\u201d.\n\u2022 \u201cevidence, and uncertainties in evidence, for additional anthropogenic causes of climate change\u201d\n\u2022 And \u201cpotential effects of, and mitigation of, increased levels of carbon dioxide and methane on the Earth\u2019s climate\u201d.\n\u2022 \u201cweather and climate, including the change in climate from the Ice Age to the present\u201d\n\u2022 And \u201chow human and physical processes interact to influence, and change landscapes, environments and the climate; and how human activity relies on effective functioning of natural systems\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
