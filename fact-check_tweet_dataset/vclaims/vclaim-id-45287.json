{"title": "Does This Flyer Accurately Represent Derek Chauvin's Police Actions?", "subtitle": "The trial of the former police officer charged in George Floyd's death was scheduled to begin in March.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2020-05-31T17:55:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-45287", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/derek-chauvin-flyer-accuracy/", "vclaim": "However, the phrasing of some claims in the flyer is subjective, and some of those claims include outdated details or information that contradicts news reports and other evidence. In particular, the second claim, which alleges that the restraint technique Chauvin used on George Floyd before he died was not part of the Minneapolis Police Department's (MPD) training, was demonstrably false. At the time of Floyd's death in May 2020, the department's policy manual permitted officers to use what it called a \"non-deadly force option\" by kneeling on a suspect's neck in situations they deemed appropriate.\n\nSeven of the eight claims outlined in a flyer about Derek Chauvin are partially or completely true based on verifiable evidence.\n\nGeorge Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020, after a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, pinned him to the ground and kneeled on his neck while Floyd repeatedly said, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d A bystander recorded the confrontation in a video that swiftly spread across social media as a deadly example of what many viewers dubbed racism by American cops.\n\nThe footage ultimately sparked an international reckoning over racism, marked by weeks of protests that largely began peaceful during the day and then escalated to chaos at night, with many U.S. cities reporting property damage, fires, and violent clashes between law-enforcement officers and protesters.\n\nAt the center of the civil rights movement were four former police officers charged in Floyd\u2019s death \u2014 particularly Chauvin, 44, whom authorities arrested and charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter. A judge ruled he would stand trial on his own, separate from the other three defendants, beginning March 8, 2021, according to The Associated Press. (No, he did not commit suicide, like some rumors online claim.)\n\nWhat follows is everything we know about Chauvin, a 19-year veteran of the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD), based on court records, news reports, and police documents \u2014 evidence that pieces together a policing record that includes complaints against him, as well as several shootings of civilians.\n\nWe should note at the outset that the office of Chauvin\u2019s former attorney, Tom Kelly, did not respond to Snopes\u2019 request for comment and his current attorney, Eric Nelson, declined to be interviewed.\n\nAdditionally, Sgt. John Elder, a spokesman for MPD, declined to answer questions about Chauvin\u2019s career with that department (which ended with Chauvin\u2019s termination the day after Floyd died), asserting that, \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on former employees,\u201d and \u201cAnything we say\u201d could affect the current investigation into Floyd\u2019s death.\n\nTo structure our examination into Chauvin\u2019s career with MPD, we measured the validity of each point in the below-displayed flyer titled \u201cWho is Derek M. Chauvin?\u201d that went viral shortly after Floyd\u2019s death.\n\nThat\u2019s a question the jury trial will legally determine. Prosecutors have charged Chauvin with second-degree murder and manslaughter after they say he kept Floyd pinned to the ground and knelt on his neck for almost eight minutes, including for nearly three minutes after Floyd became non-responsive.\n\nProsecutors also charged the three officers who watched the fatal confrontation between Floyd and Chauvin \u2014 Tou Thao, J Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane \u2014 with aiding and abetting second-degree murder (maximum prison sentence is 40 years) while committing a felony, and with aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter (maximum prison sentence is 10 years).\n\nAs of this writing, they were scheduled to be tried together \u2014 separate from Chauvin\u2019s case \u2014 beginning Aug. 23, The Associated Press reported.\n\nAccording to the complaints, which will serve as the basis to prosecutors\u2019 arguments to try to convince jurors to convict the former police officers, Lane and Kueng responded to a 911 call reporting that someone had used a counterfeit $20 bill at a South Minneapolis convenience store.\n\nAccording to video evidence cited in the court documents, upon arriving at the scene the two officers approached Floyd, who was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a vehicle also occupied by two other persons.\n\nAs Lane began speaking with Floyd, the officer pulled his gun out and instructed Floyd to show his hands. Floyd complied with the order, whereupon the officer holstered his gun. Lane then ordered Floyd out of the car and \u201cput his hands on Floyd, and pulled him out of the car,\u201d handcuffing him, the complaint stated.\n\nMinutes later, while the officers tried walking Floyd to their squad car, \u201cFloyd stiffened up and fell to the ground,\u201d and told the officers he was claustrophobic, the court documents allege. Chauvin and Thao arrived at the scene at that point.\n\nThe officers tried again to get Floyd into a squad car but were unsuccessful in doing so, according to the complaints. While the officers tried to force Floyd into the vehicle, he began asserting that he could not breathe.\n\n\u201cFloyd did not voluntarily sit in the backseat and the officers physically struggled to try to get him into the vehicle,\u201d read the complaint outlining the charges against Chauvin. It continued:\n\nFloyd was later pronounced dead at a hospital. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner\u2019s office, which encompasses Minneapolis, ruled Floyd\u2019s manner of death a homicide.\n\nIt is important to note here: In the county office\u2019s preliminary autopsy report, medical investigators said Floyd\u2019s underlying health conditions, such as coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease, contributed to his death in similar ways as Chauvin\u2019s restraint. But an autopsy commissioned by Floyd\u2019s family had different results; it determined he did, in fact, die of asphyxiation. (Read more about those findings here.)\n\nAll of that said, in reference to the first claim in the flyer, attorneys representing Chauvin are likely to argue in the upcoming trial that he did not murder Floyd but rather operated within the law as an officer. Prosecutors and viewers of the viral video have said otherwise.\n\nYou can read the full charges against Chauvin here; Thao here; Kueng here, and Lane here.\n\n2. Was the Restraint Technique Used on Floyd Part of Police Department Training?\n\nThe second claim in the flyer (that the restraint technique used was not part of MPD training) was false.\n\nAt the time of Floyd\u2019s death, MPD\u2019s Policy & Procedure Manual (which governs everything from how officers should dress on the job to what tactics are OK to use during arrests) included the below-displayed section obtained by Snopes. In other words, department policy permitted officers to use what it considered a \u201cnon-deadly force option\u201d by kneeling on a suspect\u2019s neck if they had received lessons in how to do so without applying pressure to the suspect\u2019s airway. Officers could use \u201clight or moderate pressure\u201d to get someone under \u201ccontrol\u201d or \u201cadequate pressure\u201d to make someone unconscious in situations they deemed appropriate.\n\nHowever, in the aftermath of Floyd\u2019s death, MPD agreed to ban officers from using chokeholds and neck restraints at the request of state authorities. As a result of that change, the police manual now reads:\n\n3. Is Chauvin\u2019s Lawyer the Same Man Who Represented a Cop in the Death of Philando Castile?\n\nThe Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association (MPPOA), which provides legal services to police by drawing from about a dozen attorneys, is providing legal representation for Chauvin.\n\nAnd initially, yes, the association had assigned Tom Kelly to Floyd\u2019s case. Kelly was one of the defense attorneys who represented St. Anthony, Minnesota, police officer Jeronimo Yanez, who was acquitted on all charges in connection to the fatal shooting of Philando Castile, a Black man, during a traffic stop in 2017.\n\nBut on June 3, 2020, Eric Nelson of the Halberg Criminal Defense firm took over Chauvin\u2019s case, Reuters reported. Kelly told that news outlet the association had originally assigned the case to him because he was the on-call attorney at the time of Chauvin\u2019s arrest. But he gave up the case for medical-related reasons.\n\nIn short, Kelly, a lawyer who indeed argued Yanez\u2019s case, also represented Chauvin \u2014 but only for about nine days. The flyer\u2019s claim was outdated.\n\n4. Was Chauvin Placed on Leave in the Shooting of a Native Alaskan?\n\nBy and large, this assertion is true. Below, we lay out everything we know about the shooting of Leroy Martinez in 2011, which the flyer claimed was \u201can inappropriate police shooting\u201d involving Chauvin and resulted in MPD placing him on administrative leave.\n\nAccording to news reports, on Aug. 8, 2011, Chauvin and other officers chased down Martinez, 23, in a public housing complex in South Minneapolis after they said they heard gunshots and saw Martinez running with a gun. (The Indian County-Today news outlet confirmed that Martinez is an Alaskan Native.)\n\nOne of the officers shot Martinez in the torso, and as he recovered in the hospital, Martinez faced second-degree assault charges in connection with a shooting that had taken place before police arrived on the scene. Here\u2019s how The Star Tribune newspaper reported the incident: According to that newspaper\u2019s coverage, a witness who said she watched the shooting from her balcony in the housing complex maintained to journalists that police weren\u2019t telling the full story. The witness said Martinez had thrown down his gun and was holding his hands in the air when one of the officers (not Chauvin) shot him, after warning that he would open fire.\n\nAll officers involved, including Chauvin, were placed on three-day administrative leave, which is standard procedure in officer-involved shootings, and eventually exonerated of any wrongdoing.\n\nWhether the flyer is correct in describing the shooting as \u201cinappropriate\u201d is a subjective issue. The police chief at the time said he believed the officers acted \u201cappropriately and courageously,\u201d suggesting they had acted within department policy under the circumstances, The New York Times reported.\n\n5. Did Chauvin Shoot an Unarmed Black Man in 2008?\n\nThis claim in the flyer is largely true. Here\u2019s what we know about that incident:\n\nWhile responding to a call of domestic violence at a South Minneapolis apartment in May 2008, Chauvin opened fire on a 21-year-old Black man, Ira Latrell Toles. The Associated Press reported at the time:\n\nToles, who survived the shooting and later faced criminal charges, recalled the incident differently.\n\nFollowing Floyd\u2019s death, he told The Daily Beast that yes, the mother of his child had called police on him that night, and that he had locked himself in the bathroom with an unlit cigarette after officers broke down the apartment door. Then, Toles alleged, Chauvin busted in the bathroom door and started hitting the 21-year-old without warning.\n\nChauvin later told investigators that, because Toles supposedly failed to comply with officers\u2019 commands, he attempted to hit the young man in the head with the butt of his handgun and then opened fire when he thought Toles reached for his gun, The Star Tribune reported. Toles\u2019 ex-girlfriend reported that Chauvin fired his firearm \u201cabout two seconds\u201d after he entered the bathroom after Toles.\n\nIn summary, the flyer\u2019s point is accurate, with the caveat that only Toles\u2019 account suggested that he was unarmed at the time of the confrontation.\n\n6. Was Chauvin Among a Group of Cops Who Shot and Killed Wayne Reyes?\n\nThis claim is true. In 2006, Chauvin and five other officers opened fire on a truck in South Minneapolis while investigating a reported stabbing, killing 42-year-old Wayne Reyes.\n\nAccording to MPD\u2019s account of the incident, Reyes pulled out a shotgun when police pulled him over to ask him questions about the reported assault; the officers believed Reyes had stabbed his girlfriend and another friend in a domestic dispute, according to news reports.\n\nIn total, the six officers fired 42 rounds in four seconds, according to the The Washington Post. Reyes (who the Canadian national news outlet, APTN News, reported was a member of the Leech Lake Ojibwe Band in Minnesota) was struck multiple times and died. However, it was unclear if Chauvin fired any of the fatal shots.\n\nIn the end, a grand jury ruled the officers\u2019 actions appropriate, and Chauvin was recommended for a Medal of Valor following the shooting, according to The Star Tribune.\n\nIn reference to the flyer accusing Chauvin and the other officers of striking Reyes with 16 bullets, exactly, no reports corroborated that number. Otherwise, however, the claim about Reyes circulating after Floyd\u2019s death was accurate.\n\n7. Did Chauvin and Another Cop Chase a Car and Cause Three Deaths?\n\nThis accusation is largely unproven based upon the available evidence.\n\nHere\u2019s what we can confirm: Roughly four years into Chauvin\u2019s MPD career, in 2005, he and another officer used a squad car on duty to chase a car that ended up crashing into another vehicle, killing three people, according to news reports.\n\nBut we have not yet uncovered further details on why the officers were chasing the car, or whether the other drivers (and their conditions) were major factors in the collision.\n\nSo in reference to the flyer, while it was true Chauvin and another officer were involved in a deadly car chase, no trusted evidence showed the officers\u2019 actions indeed caused the three fatalities.\n\n8. Are There 12 Brutality Complaints at MPD Against Chauvin?\n\nAlthough MPD has not fulfilled requests for records to determine why, or under what circumstances, conduct complaints were filed against Chauvin prior to Floyd\u2019s death, this claim was somewhat true. Snopes obtained Chauvin\u2019s Employee Complaint Profile Card, which provided few details other than a tally of 17 complaints against him throughout his MPD career.\n\nThe only allegation that resulted in disciplinary action (two letters of reprimand) was filed in 2007, when Chauvin allegedly pulled over a woman for going 10 mph over the speed limit, frisked her, and put her in his squad car, according to news reports. The woman\u2019s baby and dog were reportedly inside the vehicle during the traffic stop.\n\nAnother complaint was filed by a 48-year-old man who said officers (one of whom was later identified as Chauvin) banged on his car window with a flashlight and attempted to force him to the pavement during a traffic stop in 2013, The Star Tribune reported. The man, a mental health worker, said he was driving home from working a double shift at Hennepin County Medical Center and believed officers had mistaken him for someone who had been using his name.\n\nIn other words, it was undetermined based on verifiable evidence whether all the complaints against Chauvin accused him of using excessive use of force, or whether they included allegations that he had violated other aspects of MPD policy. Anyone can file a complaint against a police officer for any reason.\n\nAlso unclear was whether, or to what extent, the complaints were connected to the incidents described above that resulted in civilian deaths or injuries.\n\nBeyond the Flyer, What Else is Known About Chauvin?\n\nAfter graduating high school in 1994, Chauvin worked restaurant jobs as a prep cook, joined the U.S. Army, and eventually attended St. Paul\u2019s Metropolitan State University, The Star Tribune reported. There, his focus shifted to police work \u2014 he eventually earned a degree in law enforcement \u2014 and he joined MPD\u2019s ranks in 2001, at age 25.\n\nWe also know that Chauvin and Floyd both worked at the same Minneapolis nightclub, El Nuevo Rodeo. Maya Santamaria, who owned the building that housed the club, confirmed with Snopes that both men worked at the business during periods that overlapped (Chauvin worked as an off-duty police officer), but it was unknown whether they ever ran into each other or were introduced.\n\nMPD leaders commended Chauvin\u2019s work at various points throughout his career, according to the news archives. For example, they awarded him a Medal of Commendation in 2008 after he apparently disarmed a man during one of his nightclub security shifts.\n\nIn 2010, Chauvin married his wife, Kellie Chauvin. The two had met at Hennepin County Medical Center, where she worked as a radiologic technician and he brought someone one night for a health check before an arrest, she told The Pioneer Press for a story about her preparation to compete in Mrs. Minnesota America.\n\nAdditionally, the couple owned and rented two homes in Woodbury, a suburb east of St. Paul, before they bought a home in Oakdale, Washington County, according to property records compiled by The Star Tribune. In 2011, they also bought a townhouse near Orlando, Florida, where voting records showed Derek Chauvin is registered to vote.\n\nJust weeks after Floyd\u2019s death, Kellie Chauvin filed for divorce and sought to change her last name. As of this writing, the court sealed access to records in the case, citing privacy and safety concerns.\n\nNonetheless, the couple\u2019s financial situation emerged in international news headlines in July, when authorities accused them of failing to report income from various jobs.\n\nWashington County prosecutors charged Derek and Kellie Chauvin with aiding and abetting tax evasion and tax fraud. According to the criminal complaint, they failed to report more than $460,000 in Minnesota income over five years and failed to pay almost $38,000 in taxes owed during that time frame, according news reports.", "lang": "en"}
