Some tweets had also shared the Instagram post by Amitesh from 2019 which had the same image with a Hindi caption.\n\nWe looked for Amitesh Kumar's Instagram handle and found that he is an assistant producer with the news portal, The Lallantop. The same picture was shared by him on June 11, 2019.\n\nAmitesh's post had a Hindi caption which translated to 'Since several people have shared the picture, it becomes necessary to mention here that the picture was clicked in 2017 during the Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Sabha elections. The photograph was clicked around 5.24 pm in Mirzapur'.\n\nBOOM then contacted Amitesh to get more details on the photograph.\n\nAlso read No, Video Of Patients Dancing At COVID-19 Centre Is Not From Mumbai\n\nAmitesh told us that the picture was clicked by him on the outskirts of Mirzapur in UP on March 1, 2017. \"The team of Lallantop was covering the UP legislative assembly elections. We were crossing Mirzapur when I saw the women and the child and clicked some shots from my camera. I did not use the pictures for a long time. Later, when I shared it on my Instagram, several people downloaded and shared it without giving credit,\" Amitesh told BOOM.\n\n\n\nThe same picture was shared on The Lallantop's Instagram handle latak.lallantop.\n\nUpon BOOM's request, Amitesh sent us the original picture clicked by him. BOOM extracted the metadata of the file with the help of the website metadata2go.com.\n\nAccording to the metadata of the original picture, it was clicked on 5.23 pm on March 1, 2017.\n\nOne Mayank Khurana's name can be seen in the artist's name section in the metadata report. To this, Kumar clarified, that the camera used to click the picture was not his and was provided to him by The Lallantop.\n\n\"The camera, a Canon Mark III, was hired by the company. Perhaps the person who used the camera before me was someone named Mayank Khurana. Since I got the camera just a couple of days before we started for the election coverage, I had not made any changes in the settings,\" Kumar told BOOM.\n\nAmitesh also shared another photo from the same location shot from a different angle.
