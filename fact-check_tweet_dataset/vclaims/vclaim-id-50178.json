Now that the matter of the franchise has been dealt a final blow by the Lower House, can our people be blamed for the perception that Congress, supposedly a fiercely independent body of the people\u2019s representative, has bent over in subservience to the President?\u201d\n\nPortions of Archbishop Villegas' statement were published in the body of the two stories.\n\nVillegas\u2019 statement was a reaction to the House Committee on Legislative Franchises\u2019 vote on July 10 to deny ABS-CBN\u2019s application for a new 25-year franchise.\n\nCitizen Express\u2019s inaccurate report has received over 7,200 interactions on FB so far, while Philip Nhatkimanh\u2019s version has over 1,900 FB interactions. Top traffic generators to the reports are public FB groups PRESIDENT RODRIGO DUTERTE INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENT, Manang Imee Marcos and FB page D Express.", "lang": "en"}
