The claim is false; the two photos in the composite image have been doctored from photos of Obama in which he did not show visible support for Duterte.\n\nThe composite image was shared here in a Facebook post on May 2, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nIn the composite image, the top photo appears to show a screenshot of a television report about Obama endorsing Duterte for president.\n\nIn the composite image, the bottom photo appears to show the former US leader holding a pro-Duterte shirt while standing with his wife Michelle Obama.\n\nThe caption in the misleading Facebook post says: \u201cUS pres. Barak Obama very much obsessed with precedent Rody Duterte. He advises to the Filipinos to vote for Hugpong Ng Pagbabago and PDP-Laban candidates\u201d.\n\nBarack Obama was elected as the 44th president of the United States on November 4, 2008. He held the position until January 2017. Here is his official biography on the White House website.\n\nRodrigo Duterte is the current president of the Philippines. This is his official Facebook page.\n\n\u201cHugpong ng Pagbabago\u201d refers to a regional political party headed by Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s daughter, Sara Duterte. Here is its official Facebook page.\n\n\u201cPDP-Laban\u201d refers to Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s political party. Here is its official Facebook page.\n\nThe same composite image was shared more than 3,000 times after being posted on Facebook here on April 27, 2016 with an identical claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the two photos in the composite image have been doctored from photos of Obama in which he did not show visible support for Duterte.\n\nA reverse search using Tineye found part of the top photo in the composite image here on Flickr.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the original photo:\n\nThe caption states: \u201cJohnson give gloves to Obama\u201d. The post also says the picture was taken on September 7, 2011.\n\nThe event, which saw NASCAR driver Jimmie Johnson presenting Obama with driving gloves, was covered in this report by the San Diego Union-Tribune on September 7, 2011.\n\nAnother further reverse image search on Tineye for the top image in the composite article found this article published on October 6, 2015, by the Huffington Post.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report:\n\nThe report states that Photofunia enables users to create customisable images, including images which replicate television news report. This is Photofunia\u2019s official website.\n\nAnother reverse image search on Tineye for the bottom photo in the composite image found this tweet posted on Obama\u2019s Twitter account on June 27, 2015.\n\nThe caption states: \u201cSo inspired by the grace shown by the Simmons family and all the victims' families in Charleston. #HateWontWin.\u201d\n\nThe tweet references a mass shooting in the southern US city of Charleston on June 17, 2015. Here is an AFP report about the shooting.\n\nAFP published this fact check report on January 24, 2019 about part of the same doctored image.", "lang": "en"}
