Parks is buried at the Rosa Parks Memorial Cemetery in Birmingham, Alabama and Leftists decided to get their revenge on Muriel Parks-Griffin for calling our President a \"modern civil rights hero\" by trashing her grave. Vandals knocked over her headstone and sprayed the \"anarchy\" sign that is often seen in groups of \"antifa\" instigators.\n\nIt is a sequel to another hoax that appeared earlier about Rosa Parks' daughter praising President Trump's response to the events in Charlottesville which was also untrue... because Rosa Parks never had a daughter. Note that in the earlier article the fictional daughter was named \"Muriel Parks-Rosenberg\" (in the present one it is \"Muriel Parks-Griffin\").\n\nThe woman in the picture was lifted from a stock video showing a \"motivational speaker\".\n\nAll of this is just barely funny satire, as the disclaimer at the bottom of the article attests:\n\nWe believe in the right to be free. No matter what, the freedom to do what we want, say what we want and publish what we want comes first.\n\nTherefore we make no guarantee that what you read here is true. In fact, it most definitely is not.\n\nOur Land Of The Free is here to entertain you with the kind of whimsical satire conservatives enjoy.\n\nSo if you encounter any people online spreading this hoax as if it was real, send them here for a dose of truth...", "lang": "en"}
