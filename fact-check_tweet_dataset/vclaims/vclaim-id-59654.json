Gupta attacked Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi by claiming that the picture is from Kirari assembly constituency which Kejriwal has converted into \u201cLondon\u201d.\n\nNational Spokesperson of Akali Dal Manjinder Sirsa quote-tweeted Gupta and took a jibe at Kejriwal \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t know about London but he surely converted Delhi into Venice.\u201d\n\n\u2018The picture is also doing the rounds on Facebook as Surat, Gujarat.\n\nA reverse image search led to a tweet by journalist Salil Tripathi on July 27. Tripathi said that this picture is not from Surat but Punjab. He retweeted a tweet by AAP MLA Gurmeet Singh from Barnala district of Punjab.\n\nOn July 18, 2016, Gurmeet Singh had tweeted this picture claiming that a family in Mansa district of Punjab protested against \u201cshoddy sewage work\u201d by the Akali Dal.\n\nA user shared a news clipping of Punjab Kesari while replying to Singh. The report describes the picture as, \u201cAfter rain in Mansa, people sitting on a street filled with water, enjoying the rain with a cup of tea.\u201d\n\nThe photo is circulating as Delhi since 2016. On July 20, 2016, a Twitter user had shared the Punjab Kesari clipping when Chairman of RPG Group Harsh Goenka promoted the false claim.\n\nA picture from 2016 shot in Punjab is therefore shared as Delhi to target the AAP government for \u201cpoor\u201d drainage system.", "lang": "en"}
