That\u2019s what some Pelosi critics are saying on Facebook. But it\u2019s not true.\n\n\"Nancy Pelosi is extremely evil,\" a Facebook post from Jan. 26 quotes Ronald Reagan as saying. \"She comes from the Baltimore democrat corruption machine the D\u2019Alesandro family, both her father Tom D\u2019Alesandro and her brother Tommy D\u2019Alesandro were mayors of Baltimore, a well oiled corrupt democrat family.\"\n\nThis post, which was shared more than 4,300 times by Jan. 29, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nPelosi was born in Baltimore in March 1940 to Thomas D\u2019Alesandro, Jr., who was the mayor of that city from May 1947 to May 1959. Her brother also served a term as mayor. Those are confirmable facts.\n\nBut we couldn\u2019t find any evidence that Reagan called Pelosi evil, or denounced her family as corrupt. That\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t exist, according to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute.\n\nJoanne Drake, chief administrative officer for the organization, said she could tell PolitiFact \"with great conviction that Ronald Reagan never spoke those words. Ever.\"\n\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
