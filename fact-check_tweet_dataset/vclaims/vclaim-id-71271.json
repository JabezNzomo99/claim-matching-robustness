Bernie Sanders for president.\n\nCarter has not publicly endorsed Sanders or any other candidate in the 2020 presidential race to date.\n\nAs the 2020 presidential election draws closer, some social media users have shared the news that Carter supposedly endorsed Sanders, who has in recent weeks lost his once-commanding frontrunner status to former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe news stems from a March 7 story posted by the blog Liberty Inquiries that stated, \u201cFormer President Jimmy Carter slyly revealed who he voted for in the Democratic primary Monday \u2014 and it seems he\u2019s still feeling the Bern.\u201d The story claims that during a recent public discussion between the two men about \u201cglobal peace and human rights,\u201d Carter at one point turned to the crowd and asked, \u201cCan y\u2019all see why I voted for him?\u201d\n\nBut the blog post is a near word-for-word copy of a 2017 story from Talking Point Memos, a news organization that covers American politics. The information recounted in the Liberty Inquiries version is years old and has nothing to do with the 2020 election. It noticeably alters one line from the original \u2014 \u201cCarter previously stayed mostly mum about the 2016 election\u201d \u2014 to say \u201c2020 election.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Carter has endorsed Sanders or any other presidential candidate ahead of the 2020 election. Had he thrown his support behind any candidate, it would have been picked up by major news outlets, yet none have reported on it.
