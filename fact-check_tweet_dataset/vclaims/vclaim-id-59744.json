The claim is misleading; a WHO spokesperson told AFP they have published no such statement; in July 2020, experts said there was \u201clittle evidence\u201d that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but there was some evidence of human-to-animal transmission.\n\nThe claim was published here on Facebook on July 19, 2020. It has been shared more than 300 times.\n\nThe post features a photo of a cat, and a traditional Chinese text overlay which translates to English as: \u201cThe World Health Organization officially states: Cats and dogs lack ACE2 within their bodies, which makes no way for it to bind with [COVID-19] strain's S protein, so cats and dogs will not become organisms carrying COVID-19. Please share if you care, my friends, in case [cats and dogs] are abandoned for misinformation.\u201d\n\nA similar claim has also been shared here, here and here on Facebook.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading.\n\nIn response to the posts, the WHO said it had not issued the purported statement.\n\nA WHO spokesperson told AFP by email on July 23, 2020: \u201cI checked and didn\u2019t find that we made that statement.\u201d\n\nIn a separate earlier email, dated July 22, 2020, the spokesperson said that while \u201cthere is evidence of transmission at the human-animal interface\u201d as the virus \u201cspreads primarily through human-to-human transmission\u201d, there is \u201cno reason or justification to take measures against companion animals\u201d.\n\nThe spokeperson also direct AFP to this July 2, 2020 WHO press conference discussing the \u201ctransmission [of COVID-19] from human to animals\u201d.\n\nAt the conference\u2019s one-hour, four-minute 11-second mark, WHO Chief Scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan stated: \u201cIt's clear that there are some animals like the felines - cats and ferrets and even tigers can get infection (so human to animal), but very little evidence of the reverse.\u201d\n\nThe WHO website\u2019s COVID-19 Q&A section also notes here that while \u201cseveral dogs and cats (domestic cats and tigers) in contact with infected humans have tested positive for COVID-19\u201d, \u201cthere is no evidence that these animals can transmit the disease to humans and spread COVID-19\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
