Towards the end of the gory clip, one of the youths is seen dragging another away, but he keeps rushing back to stab the victim, who\u2019s lying still in the middle of the road.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be misleading. There is no communal angle to the incident as the accused are Hindus too.\n\nTwitter user \u201cAshish Jaggi\u201d posted the video with the caption, \u201cIn Madipur area of Delhi, three jihadists killed a minor boy in the middle of a road with a knife for a petty matter. We are fighting amongst ourselves in the name of casteism and these peacefuls are getting trained for such things? When will Hindus wake up?\u201d\n\nThe video has gone viral on social media with similar claims. The archived versions can be seen here and here.\n\nUsing related keywords, we found multiple news reports regarding the incident. According to these reports, on July 8, three juveniles stabbed to death 25-year-old Manish Kumar in Delhi\u2019s Raghubir Nagar area. The victim worked as a driver and lived in the same area.\n\nCiting DCP (West) Deepak Purohit, Hindustan Times says Manish was attacked by three boys aged 15-17 years.\n\nManish had earlier objected to bike stunts and racing by one of the juveniles that ended in a spat. The murderous assault was a result of that.\n\nPolice inquiry revealed that Manish had thrashed the juvenile some 15 days before the incident when he didn\u2019t pay attention to his objections. To take revenge, the minor, along with two of his friends, attacked Manish and stabbed him 28 times.\n\nTo verify the claim, India Today reporter Tanseem Haider reached out to Delhi Police who confirmed that all the three accused were Hindus and not Muslims. Police also told us their names, but we won\u2019t disclose them as they are minors.\n\nHence, it can be concluded that there is no communal angle to the murder as the accused and victim are from the same community.", "lang": "en"}
