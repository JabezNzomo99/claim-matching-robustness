A spokesperson for The New York Times confirmed that the outlet didn\u2019t publish or retract any such article.\n\nFeatured in the Facebook post is what appears to be the beginning of a June 27 article, purportedly written by Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, that The New York Times allegedly published but quickly retracted. Krugman joined the outlet as an op-ed columnist in 1999, according to his author page.\n\nThe alleged article, which puts up the headline \u201cDonald J. Trump Pronounced Dead,\u201d claims that Trump died from a hydroxychloroquine overdose. It also speculates about whether the president was abusing the drug. (RELATED: Did Donald Trump Tweet That He Wasn\u2019t \u2018The Only US President To Hide From The American People In A Bunker\u2019?)\n\n\u201cEven if we can speculate, we can\u2019t be sure what the death of \u2018Donald J. Trump\u2019 means for future history,\u201d reads the supposed article. \u201cAccording to news accounts in Russia and around the world, \u2018Donald J. Trump\u2019 was found after holding a post-summit White House meeting with Vladimir Putin.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no evidence The New York Times ever reported that Trump, who has had numerous public appearances since June 27, died from an overdose. The formatting and style do not match that in articles on The New York Time\u2019s website, and an opinion columnist like Krugman would likely not be assigned to write a breaking news story.\n\n\u201cThe New York Times did not publish that story,\u201d Danielle Rhoades Ha, the vice president of communications at the outlet, confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller. \u201cThe image that circulated online was a doctored image.\u201d\n\nThe image being shared came from a TikTok user who posted the fake New York Times article as part of a prank to get #riptrump trending on the video-sharing app, according to The Associated Press. The hashtag spread rapidly, gaining 17 million views on TikTok by June 30, Forbes reported.", "lang": "en"}
