The post in question has 6,100 reactions and about 1,300 shares on the site.\n\nThe origins of 1918 influenza and its spread\n\nWhen it was discovered, the 1918 flu virus was spreading in a world at war. Because of the turmoil that World War I had wrought on societies around the globe, it\u2019s difficult for scientists and historians today to piece together the exact origins of the virus.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states there is no universal consensus as to the origins of the virus, though experts have theorized about origins as disparate as China, France, the United States and United Kingdom. Others have argued the virus was likely circulating in European armies for months \u2013 and potentially even years \u2013 before it was officially discovered. The CDC states that the first confirmed cases in the United States were military personnel in the spring of 1918.\n\n\u201cWe don't know and will probably never know,\u201d John M. Barry, the author of \"The Great Influenza,\" a history of the 1918 flu, told USA TODAY. In his book, Barry advanced the theory that the virus began in rural Kansas, but \u201cwork since then has caused me to back away from that. The best evidence points to China. Other theories suggest France or Vietnam.\u201d\n\nFact check:Coronavirus originated in China, not elsewhere, researchers and studies say\n\nThe comparatively mild effect the 1918 flu had on China has led some researchers to suspect that the virus or a related milder strain began there earlier, meaning the population had a higher level of immunity to the disease when it reached pandemic levels elsewhere. This research is disputed, however, notably because data from China\u2019s Warlord Period is arguably less reliable.\n\nThe 1918 flu was an H1N1 virus with genes indicating it likely originated in birds. This makes it like the H1N1 strain that caused the swine flu pandemic of 2009. Unlike swine flu, however, the 1918 flu was far more damaging for the world; an estimated third of the world\u2019s population was infected, with about 50 million people dying from the virus.\n\nUnlike most influenza viruses, the 1918 flu was most lethal for people ages 20-40 and young children. Researchers don\u2019t fully understand why this was the case, though the lack of a vaccine, poor sanitary conditions and no coordinated response nations likely contributed to the disastrous impact. The possibility of a similar virus having spread during the youth of 1918's older population may be why those 65 and older had a lower mortality rate than would be expected.\n\nThe role of governments in publicizing the flu's spread\n\nA key factor that made both mitigating the virus and tracing its impact difficult today is that governments at the time downplayed the issue. Countries did not want to lower national morale or cause panic while also fighting what was then the largest and most costly war in history.\n\nPublic health officials in France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States all downplayed the spread of the virus, treating it as a normal influenza virus or cases of \u201csimple pneumonia\u201d found in the ranks of soldiers.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. didn't formally censor,\u201d Barry said, but the mainstream press and government institutions instead opted for a kind of \u201cself-censorship.\u201d This strategy ultimately proved more damaging, because when the gravity of the situation became unavoidable, governments had lost their credibility about the pandemic.\n\nThe pressures of the global conflict weren\u2019t present in the Kingdom of Spain, which was neutral in World War I. As such, Spanish public officials and media more readily reported on the crisis as it spread throughout the country.\n\nAdditionally, King Alfonso XIII of Spain also fell gravely ill with the virus, heightening press coverage in the country and grabbing headlines elsewhere. There is no evidence, however, that the virus began in Spain, nor is there any indication that the virus was especially worse in Spain than anywhere else in Europe.\n\nThough it is difficult to determine from the historical record where the 1918 flu virus originated and how it spread across the globe, the origins of its common name are not in doubt. The Spanish press, being those most likely to report on the virus and its spread, also gave the false impression at the time that the disease originated there.\n\nThe name \u201cSpanish flu\u201d has accompanied the 1918 pandemic ever since, largely because other countries were unwilling or uninterested in reporting on the outbreak within their own borders.
