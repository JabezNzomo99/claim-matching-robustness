Is it wrong for politicians to socialize? India Today\u2019s Managing Editor Rahul Kanwal posted an update at 6:54 pm on April 22nd on his official Facebook page with two pictures of Rahul Gandhi which were purportedly released by former Congress Leader Barkha Shukla who joined BJP yesterday. In these pictures, Rahul Gandhi can be seen sitting with 3 other people at a restaurant/pub. \u201cIt\u2019s gone viral. Images of Rahul Gandhi and his friends at a pub. These pictures have been released by former Cong leader, Barkha Shukla, who has joined the BJP recently,\u201d stated Rahul Kanwal in his status update.\n\nWhy has Rahul Kanwal posted personal pictures of a politician on his Facebook page? What is the motive? Political leaders launching personal attacks at each other is a common thing, especially during the Election time, but why would a senior journalist like Rahul Kanwal indulge in such behaviour? Expectedly, he got called out by a lot of people on his Facebook page.\n\nIt is one thing if a person chooses to post their own personal pictures in the public domain. Rahul Kanwal has done that in the past on his own Twitter timeline.\n\nHowever, posting personal pictures of other people on your personal Facebook page just because a leader from an opposing party posted them is downright pathetic.", "lang": "en"}
