In this case, the meme suggests Biden made the remark about constitutional rights.

The Daily Caller News Foundation didn\u2019t find any media reports attributing the quote to him, and it appears nowhere on his social media accounts. ProPublica\u2019s archive of his deleted tweets also has no matching or similar remarks.\n\nThe alleged quote, which has been circulating online for years, bears some resemblance to a comment Biden made during a 2013 speech about gun control at Western Connecticut State University. At one point in his speech, Biden said, \u201cNo law-abiding citizen in the United States of America has any fear that their constitutional rights will be infringed in any way. None, zero.\u201d The fake quote appears to be a distortion of that 2013 statement.\n\nShortly after Biden\u2019s speech, Breitbart published an article that put up the headline \u201cBiden: No Ordinary American Cares About Their Constitutional Rights, Facebook Questions are Plants.\u201d The headline may have given some readers the false impression of a direct quote from Biden when it was not.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
