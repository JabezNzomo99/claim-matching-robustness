Axios and Reuters have retracted their stories about the FDA granting such authorization.\n\nThe company Biosphere claimed in a March 31 press release that they had received authorization from the FDA for the first serological coronavirus antibody test, according to CNN. The FDA uses emergency use authorizations (EUAs) to \u201cmake available diagnostic and therapeutic medical devices to diagnose and respond to public health emergencies.\u201d\n\nMultiple media outlets, including Reuters, Axios and The Hill, reported on the announcement.

The FDA does not include Bodysphere on its list of in vitro diagnostic EUAs and explicitly refuted that it granted such an authorization.\n\nA spokesperson for the FDA told the Daily Caller in an April 1 email that \u201cno serology tests have received an authorization to test for coronavirus\u201d when asked about Bodysphere\u2019s press release. Since then, several serology tests aimed at detecting the presence of coronavirus antibodies have received EUAs, but none of them come from Bodysphere, according to the FDA website.\n\n\u201cSerological tests measure the amount of antibodies or proteins present in the blood when the body is responding to a specific infection,\u201d the FDA spokesperson explained in an email. \u201cIn other words, the test detects the body\u2019s immune response to infection rather than the virus causing the infection. In early days of infection when the body\u2019s immune response is still building, antibodies may not be detected.\u201d\n\nReuters and Axios retracted their articles reporting on the company\u2019s announcement. Michael Becker, executive vice president of strategic partnerships and initiatives at Business Wire, told the Caller in an email that Business Wire \u201cremoved the news from the wire\u201d following \u201cconcerns\u201d regarding it.\n\nBodysphere later told Reuters and CNN that they had not received FDA authorization, with spokesperson D\u2019Anne Mica telling CNN that \u201cthere was a misunderstanding.\u201d The company\u2019s CEO, Charlton Lui, also said in a statement that Bodysphere \u201cbelieved when the manufacturer\u2019s product was listed on the FDA Registry website, that was the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s notification the Emergency Use Authorization was issued.\u201d\n\nThe company, which also lists N95 masks, sanitizing gel and hospital beds on its website, claimed to have done its clinical testing with a Zhejiang University-affiliated hospital in China, but a spokesperson for the university denied working with Bodysphere.

However, the FDA acknowledgment letter on the Bodysphere website lists the China-based firm Safecare Biotech as the manufacturer.\n\n\u201cThe kits are coming from China, so, they\u2019re not coming from China, but the company is, everything, you know, is manufactured in China right now,\u201d Mica told CNN.", "lang": "en"}
