That\u2019s war money ladies and gentleman. It\u2019s coming.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

We all need to do more.\"\n\nA Bank of America spokesperson told PolitiFact the post\u2019s claim is incorrect, and said the pledge builds on the organization\u2019s past efforts to support economic mobility and workforce development programs, but with an added emphasis on health services during the pandemic.\n\nThe claim, which was shared on July 17, may have stemmed from a July 16 Lou Dobbs Tonight Fox Business segment, in which Dobbs erroneously reported that Bank of America and other corporations were pledging money to Black Lives Matter.\n\nDobbs issued a correction and apologized for the mistake the next day.\n\n\"I reported to you that Bank of America, PepsiCo, Walmart, Apple and Comcast were pledging money to Black Lives Matter. They were, rather, pledges by those companies of investments to address economic and racial inequality,\" Dobbs says in the broadcast. \"I want to apologize to each of those companies for my mistake. We apologize to you for the error.\n\nFacebook posts claim that Bank of America pledged to donate $1 billion to the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThis isn\u2019t true. Bank of America announced it would donate the funds over the next four years to communities of color and minority-owned businesses that have experienced a greater impact from the COVID-19 health crisis.", "lang": "en"}
