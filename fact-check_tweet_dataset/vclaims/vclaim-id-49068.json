He rubbished the claims and said that the newspaper clipping is not true.\n\nSharma said, \"The newspaper clipping is a piece of dated misinformation that was doing the rounds for a couple of weeks. Jaipur's subdivision officer Yugantar Sharma and chief medical health officer Narottam Sharma investigated the matter and found that the claims stating that 300 sadhus infected with coronavirus through a chillum were not true. The probe results further could establish that the news articles were unsubstantiated.\"\n\nSharma further clarified about 300 people being quarantined in Jaipur. He said, \"We have checked on people as per the routine process and have quarantined who came in the suspect's contact. But this is certain that there is no such case where the virus spread through smoking a chillum.\"\n\nBOOM also reached out to Jayant Sharma from Rajasthan Patrika, who reported about the incident. Jayant said, \"A section of the media misidentified the COVID-19 positive person as a sadhu. Approximately 250-300 people had to be self-quarantined as preventive measures. The patient's close contacts, around 22 people, were sent to an institutional quarantine facility.\"\n\nAlso read: Misinformation On US Flu Shot Ingredients Viral During COVID-19 Crisis\n\nThe Press Information Bureau's (PIB) Jharkhand and Rajasthan branches have corroborated the information and debunked the fake claims on Twitter.\n\nThe clarification states: \"Claim: A news portal \"News Jharkhand\" has claimed that the corona infection has spread to 300 people due chillam of a Sadhu in the Transport Nagar area of \u200b\u200bJaipur. #PIBFactCheck: According to the District Collector, Jaipur, there is no truth of the news published and no such incident has happened.\"\n\nBOOM could not independently verify the viral newspaper clipping.", "lang": "en"}
