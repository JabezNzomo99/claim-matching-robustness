The eye on the right-hand side of the reader has been superimposed on the forehead of the baby. The right eye and the \u2018third\u2019 eye have the same movement.\n\nWe performed a reverse image search and found that the viral video was posted by a Twitter account with Chinese caption \u201c\u201d (translated from \u4e09\u53ea\u773c\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86)\u201d on July 9.\n\nThe claim was earlier fact-checked by Hoax or Fact on July 11.\n\nAn edited video showing a baby with three eyes was believed to be true on social media.\n\nIs it possible for children to be born with a third eye?\n\nBabies can very rarely be born with extra eyes. It occurs as part of a rare congenital disorder called diprosopus where the trunk and limbs are normal but there is a partial or complete duplication of different parts of the face. It is also considered as a variety of conjoined twins (Bhuyan, M et al. 2018). Babies with this disorder are usually stillborn (born dead) as this disorder is often associated with deformities of the brain, spinal cord, heart and abdominal organs (Yahaya, R.S et al. 2018).\n\nIt is important to note that such deformities of duplication of body organs do not appear without disfigurement. Any picture or video of precisely placed extra body parts on a body with no disfigurement is unlikely to be real. Furthermore, in the case of diprosopus, there are multiple parts of the face that are duplicated resulting in a grossly deformed face. Below is a photograph of a newborn with diprosopus.", "lang": "en"}
