She defended Syria\u2019s President Assad as a possible reformer at the start of that country\u2019s civil war. She failed to stop the nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea. And she decided not to designate the Nigerian group Boko Haram as a terrorist organization.\u201d\n\nFrankly, Wallace gets a few things wrong here. We\u2019ve already debunked the Boko Haram allegation. It\u2019s a bit much to say she couldn\u2019t stop the North Korea nuclear program; this is an endless problem. She didn\u2019t quite call Assad a reformer; she claimed that \u201cmany members of both parties\u201d who had gone to Syria had done so, but as The Fact Checker pointed out at the time, that was simply not credible.\n\nNevertheless, McCaskill\u2019s comeback included the very interesting claim that Clinton \u201claid the groundwork\u201d for the deal to remove chemical weapons from Syria. The 2013 deal is certainly an achievement \u2014 the State Department claims 92 percent of the weapons have been removed, but others warn that getting the rest out will remain a challenge and that the deal may actually be \u201ccrumbling.\u201d\n\nIn other words, a lot of weight is being placed on the word \u201cgroundwork.\u201d She was there in the first term, so anything good that happened in the second term was the result of her laying the \u201cgroundwork.\u201d While that may be the case for some portfolios \u2014 such as the negotiations concerning Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which McCaskill also cited \u2014 it does not appear to be credible for the chemical weapons deal.\n\nThe idea of containing Syria\u2019s stockpile of chemical weapons was first discussed between Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Obama at the Group of 20 summit in Mexico in June 2012, administration officials said. Clinton also attended that summit, but there is no indication that she worked the issue afterward.\n\nIndeed, it was not until August of that year that Obama, in an unscripted moment, told reporters that \u201ca red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized.\u201d He warned that such an attack by Syria would lead to \u201cenormous consequences.\u201d\n\nThat statement became a serious diplomatic problem in April 2013 when the administration sent a letter to Congress saying that it had evidence that Syria had used chemical weapons, in particular sarin. (The president\u2019s various versions of this \u201cred line\u201d were detailed by The Fact Checker.)\n\nBut even the concept was just that \u2014 a concept \u2014 until Obama started to threaten military strikes against Syria for the alleged use of chemical weapons and Kerry on Sept. 9, 2013 offhandedly threw out the idea that the strikes could be canceled if Syria gave up all of its chemical weapons.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Kerry replied. \u201cHe could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week. Turn it over, all of it, without delay, and allow a full and total accounting for that. But he isn\u2019t about to do it, and it can\u2019t be done, obviously.\u201d\n\nTo Kerry\u2019s utter surprise, Lavrov immediately took him up on the offer, hoping to avert an attack on Russia\u2019s most important Middle East client state. But making lemonade out of lemons, the Obama administration decided to see if the Russians were serious. Within days, the two sides met in Geneva to hash out the details \u2014 and Kerry kept the talks going even when the Russians were ready to give up.\n\nClinton, by contrast, was not part of the negotiations or even the preliminary discussions; her only tangential connection is that she was at the G-20 meeting in June 2012 when Obama and Putin first discussed Syria\u2019s chemical weapons stockpile. In terms of laying the groundwork, her failure as secretary to end the conflict during Obama\u2019s first term certainly created the conditions for the threatened airstrikes and the subsequent deal in the second term \u2014 but we doubt that\u2019s what McCaskill meant.", "lang": "en"}
