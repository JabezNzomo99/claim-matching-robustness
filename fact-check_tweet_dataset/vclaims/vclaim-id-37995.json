However, the title of this post contains at least one error: The wolf eel is not poisonous or venomous. Furthermore, the wolf eel isn\u2019t an actual \u201ceel.\u201d The wolf eel (Anarrhichthys ocellatus) is a species of wolffish that lives in the North Pacific Ocean. The Seattle Aquarium explains:\n\nThe above-displayed GIF comes from a longer video that was posted to YouTube in January 2019. The original video appears to have been taken aboard a commercial fishing ship. Filmmaker R\u00fani Djurhuus titled the footage \u201cCatfish vs. Coke,\u201d but the marine species in the video is labeled a \u201cwolf eel\u201d and a \u201ccatfish wolf eel\u201d in the description:\n\nOne reason for the confusion may relate to this fish\u2019s nickname, the \u201cocean catfish.\u201d We compared stills from the GIF with photographs and believe that the marine creature featured in this video is indeed a wolf eel. We\u2019ve reached out to the Marine Conservation Institute to confirm and will update this article when more information becomes available.\n\nThe original video also provides some insight into how and why this decapitated fish head bit down on a can of Coca-Cola. While some viewers hypothesized that this fish head was still alive when this video was filmed, it\u2019s likely that the footage shows an involuntary muscle reflex. The original video shows that this fish was decapitated just before a Coke can was pushed into its jaws. It\u2019s likely that the fish\u2019s nerve endings were still functioning, and that pressure near its jaw triggered a muscle spasm.\n\nIn June 2018, after a man in Texas was bitten by a decapitated rattlesnake head, National Geographic and Science Alert penned articles explaining the phenomena:\n\nThe bodies of snakes often writhe around for some time after they are dead, says Bruce Jayne, a biology professor at the University of Cincinnati. It\u2019s a similar reflex to that of a headless chicken being able to run around for a short time, Jayne says. The mechanism behind this eerie behavior is a nervous system pre-programmed to make certain movements without the brain needing to send a signal. And a decapitated venomous snake head is evidently pre-programmed to bite in response to a stimulus\u2014such as a someone trying to pick it up, he said. Snakes and other cold-blooded animals such as fish and amphibians, on the other hand, don\u2019t thermoregulate internally, instead relying on outside sources for warmth. Because their bodies aren\u2019t generating their own heat, their energy and oxygen requirements are lower. This is how some cold-blooded, or ectothermic, animals are able to survive conditions without oxygen for periods of time. And it\u2019s why snakes (and other reptiles) continue to move after being bisected. As seen in the below video, the body will reflexively writhe for a time after being cut off the brain \u2013 but the head itself can remain \u201calive\u201d, and likely on the defensive because of the pain of being chopped. It will attempt to bite whatever it can \u2013 even its own wriggling body.\n\nThe wolf eel may be scary looking and may have a powerful bite, but these fish aren\u2019t aggressive. In fact, these friendly fish are a favorite among scuba divers. The eel-like fish can grow up to 8 feet in length and subsists on a diet of sea urchins, mussels, and clams, which it can eat thanks to its powerful jaws:\n\nThe friendly, but fierce looking wolf-eel is a favorite of Pacific Northwest divers. They can often be spotted peering out of the many crevices and holes in popular local dive sites. When lured out of their dens in search of their favorite food (Sea Urchins), this impressive fish is a sight to behold, growing to a maximum length of 8\u2019. While not a true eel (eels have no pectoral fins), wolfies are actually a fish with an elongated body and are referred to by scientists as a \u201cwolf-fish\u201d. Don\u2019t judge a book by its cover with wolf eels. It\u2019s not an eel, but a long, slender fish. It\u2019s not aggressive like its sharp teeth suggest, but generally gentle. Wolf eels also form one of the sweetest pairings in the sea: they mate for life and huddle together in a rocky cave or crevice. They are dedicated parents, with both partners guarding the eggs and their territory. In the cold Pacific waters of their range, that sounds like the perfect way to keep warm!", "lang": "en"}
