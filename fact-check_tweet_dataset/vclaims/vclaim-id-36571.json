I\u2019ve felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic,\u201d said President Trump. \u201cAll you had to do was look at other countries, I think now it\u2019s in almost 120 countries all over the world. No, I\u2019ve always viewed it as very serious, there was no difference yesterday from days before. I feel the tone is similar but some people said it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe followed up with a tweet Wednesday morning, claiming, in part, \u201cI always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization declared the virus a pandemic on March 11. Just the day before, President Trump downplayed coronavirus\u2019 impact by comparing then-current statistics to the common flu:\n\nMany experts have pointed out that the lethality rate of the coronavirus makes it potentially much more serious than the common flu.\n\nThe president went on to claim \u201ctesting has gone very well. And when people need a test, they can get a test,\u201d despite the fact that the United States\u2019 coronavirus testing was set back by costly delays. He further argued that \u201cwe\u2019re prepared, and we\u2019re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away. ... It\u2019s really working out. And a lot of good things are going to happen.\u201d\n\nIn remarks before his now-infamous dinner with Brazilian President Bolsonaro on March 7, President Trump responded to a question about the coronavirus coming to Washington, D.C,. by saying, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not concerned at all. No, I\u2019m not. No, we\u2019ve done a great job.\u201d Several attendees later tested positive for the virus.\n\nOn February 27, the president claimed, \u201cwe have done an incredible job. We\u2019re going to continue. [The coronavirus is] going to disappear. One day \u2014 it\u2019s like a miracle \u2014 it will disappear.\u201d\n\nThat statement came one day after President Trump gave remarks alongside the coronavirus task force in which he discussed the coronavirus numbers in the U.S. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to come to that, especially with the fact that we\u2019re going down, not up. We\u2019re going very substantially down, not up.\u201d\n\nAnd on January 22, when CNBC anchor Joe Kernen asked Trump directly whether he was concerned coronavirus might become a pandemic, Trump said he didn\u2019t think so. \u201cAre there worries about a pandemic at this point?\u201d Kernen wondered.\n\n\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cAnd we have it totally under control. It\u2019s one person coming in from China. We have it totally under control. It\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201d\n\nDavid Leonhardt of the New York Times cited these examples and many other occasions the president has minimized the severity of coronavirus and the threat it poses. Despite President Trump\u2019s claim, it\u2019s clear that his tone has changed. If the president \u201cfelt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic,\u201d he chose not to say so on many occasions, and, in fact, sent the exact opposite message to the American public.\n\nWhen the president claims he\u2019d \u201calways known\u201d coronavirus was a pandemic and insists he has always treated it \u201cvery seriously\u201d he is not telling the truth.\n\nPhotograph of Donald Trump and the coronavirus task force briefing the media on Tuesday, March 17, by Drew Angerer/Getty Images.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
