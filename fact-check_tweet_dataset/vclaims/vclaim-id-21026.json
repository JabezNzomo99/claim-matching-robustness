Kennan senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nCaptions on photos of the two houses say the girls won\u2019t be getting the mansions because President Donald Trump will return the mansions to the Russian government, but the fate of the properties hasn\u2019t been confirmed yet, hence Peskov\u2019s demand.\n\n\"Those properties to which you refer are part of a larger dialogue with the Russian Federation,\" Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan told Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.\n\n\"There are a whole host of issues we're discussing with the Russian Federation, but my commitment is that we will consult with you on this issue before any final implementation of an agreement that we don't have yet with the Russian Federation,\" Sullivan said.\n\nThe source of the fake news, Newsfeedhunter.com, even admits its stories are fabrications.\n\n\"We present fiction as fact and our sources don\u2019t actually exist,\" the disclaimer says.\n\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
