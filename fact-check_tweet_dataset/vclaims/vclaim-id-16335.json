On Monday morning, President Obama signed Executive Order 13749 banning all fake news websites and ensuring penalties ranging from fines/fees to criminal prosecution for those that own and maintain such websites. In the days after President-Elect Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election the topic of fake news has been one of fierce controversy as many point to a myriad of frequently trending- yet fake news articles that were widely circulated on social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter during the election cycle. According to many critics, the rate in which fake news was circulated online unfairly influenced the results of the election.\n\nThe story quoted here was published by TheBostonTribune.com, a web site that has a history of publishing hoax stories, such as a completely baseless claim that Michelle Obama\u2019s mother would receive a $160,000 annual government pension, or that Wisconsin eliminated all \u201cFoodShare/EBT programs\u201d as of 1 December 2016.\n\nIn addition to the web site\u2019s less-than-nodding acquaintance with the truth, a list of executive orders signed by the President is available to the public. While the president did sign two executive orders on 29 November 2016, neither of them was \u201cExecutive Order 13749\u201d or had anything to do with the media.\n\nThe Boston Tribune made a second claim later in their hoax article, when (in a remarkable feat of self-awareness) its author wrote that Obama\u2019s alleged executive order was spurred by a story published by a fake news outlet, but masquerading as a real news outlet:\n\nAccording to multiple sources, the fake news article that was the apparent \u201clast straw\u201d leading-up to President Obama\u2019s decision to sign Executive Order 13749 was an article run on a fake news website with the misleading domain \u2013 www.thebostontribune.com.co. The website was designed to trick readers into thinking that they were reading information from our publication (The Boston Tribune), however \u2013 the almost unnoticeable distinction between our website and this fake website was the \u2018.co\u2019 added to the end of the domain. When we first learned of the copycat website spreading fake news we contacted the publisher of the misleading website (later identified at Aaron Baker) and asked that the website be taken down immediately \u2013 Mr. Baker failed to respond to our request. The article published by the fake news website is one that many will recognize as it spread rapidly on Facebook and quickly received over 300,000 shares. It featured the headline \u2013 \u201cUnmotivated Voters Paid $50 To Cast Democratic Vote\u201d.\n\nWhile it is true that a common tactic used by purveyors of fake news in 2016 was to publish stories on misleading domain names, anyone attempting to imitate a legitimate news organization by adding \u201c.co\u201d to TheBostonTribune.com would be severely misinformed, as neither version of the web site is a reliable source for truthful information.\n\nThe one aspect of The Boston Tribune\u2019s report that actually was based in reality was its mention of a speech that President Obama delivered in Berlin about the rampant spread of misinformation on the internet:\n\nBecause in an age where there\u2019s so much active misinformation, and it\u2019s packaged very well, and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television, where some overzealousness on the part of a U.S. official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere, if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won\u2019t know what to protect. We won\u2019t know what to fight for. And we can lose so much of what we\u2019ve gained in terms of the kind of democratic freedoms and market-based economies and prosperity that we\u2019ve come to take for granted.\n\nHe mentioned nothing about signing a ban into law, because the story reporting that he did so is indisputably false.", "lang": "en"}
