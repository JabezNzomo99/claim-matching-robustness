It\u2019s one of seven types of coronaviruses that infect humans, according to the CDC.\n\nMost cases of the new virus have resulted in mild symptoms, but the WHO has estimated that roughly 1 in every 6 people have become \"seriously ill,\" and about 2% have died. According to the organization\u2019s Feb. 27 situation report, the death rate has now crept up to almost 3.5%.\n\nThe vast majority of infections have occurred in China. During his press conference, Trump credited his policies with keeping Americans mostly safe to this point.\n\n\"We closed up our borders to flights coming in from certain areas, areas that were hit by the coronavirus and hit pretty hard,\" he said. \"And we did it very early. A lot of people thought we shouldn\u2019t have done it that early, and we did, and it turned out to be a very good thing.\"\n\nOn Jan. 31, the Trump administration placed a temporary ban on travel into the United States for immigrants and nonimmigrants who had recently been \"physically present\" in China, with exceptions made for U.S. citizens and permanent residents and their family members.\n\nThe move followed announcements from a number of airlines that they would suspend all flights between the United States and China while the outbreak ran its course.\n\nTrump also accurately cited an October study from Johns Hopkins University that ranked the United States No. 1 in the world in terms of the country\u2019s preparedness for a pandemic, although the study also found that \"no country is fully prepared for epidemics or pandemics.\"\n\nWhat Trump exaggerated or got wrong\n\nNot everything Trump said was in line with what\u2019s really happening, however. Throughout his press conference, Trump claimed that 15 Americans had contracted the new virus, even though the CDC's total count was then at 60 and is now up to 61.\n\n\"We have a total of 15 people, and they\u2019re in a process of recovering with some already having fully recovered,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president seemed to be referring to the 15 people who were diagnosed in the United States. He later called them \"the original 15.\"\n\nBut that left out the patients who were repatriated with the virus from abroad, including three people who returned from Wuhan and 43 who fell ill on a cruise ship, according to the CDC.\n\nThe president also made repeated references to the flu, at times suggesting that the flu was much worse than the new coronavirus, and at other times claiming the two were alike.\n\nAt one point, Trump said, \"The flu, in our country, kills from 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year.\"\n\nFewer people have died from the coronavirus than this season\u2019s flu, although the death rate for the coronavirus is higher than the death rate for the flu, which hovers around 0.1%.\n\nBut even so, Trump\u2019s annual range is above what the CDC has reported.\n\nThe CDC estimates that annual flu deaths in the United States have ranged from 12,000 to 61,000 since 2010. According to the agency\u2019s preliminary estimates, the flu has caused between 18,000 and 46,000 deaths so far this season.\n\nAt another point, Trump said the United States is \"rapidly developing a vaccine\" for the coronavirus and would \"essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner.\"\n\nBut Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in the same press conference that a vaccine was likely a year to a year and a half away. That would still be quick, but not fast enough to help manage the current outbreak.\n\nNow more than ever, it\u2019s important to sort fact from fiction. Please donate to support our mission.

This one is different, much different. This is a flu. This is like a flu.\"\n\nThe 2019 coronavirus is a respiratory virus like the flu, but it\u2019s \"not related to influenza,\" said Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California.\n\nEbola, which broke out starting in 2014 and killed more than 11,000 people in the West African nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, is also not the automatic death sentence Trump made it out to be.\n\nTrump was likely referring to the late stages of an Ebola infection, when the runaway virus causes internal bleeding and cuts down the body\u2019s ability to produce blood clotting agents.\n\nBut when people get treatment in time, their chances of survival increase. There were two deaths among the 11 cases treated in the United States during the Ebola outbreak, and the only two people who caught the virus while in the United States \u2014 both nurses \u2014 recovered fully.\n\nThat said, at this point, the Ebola virus seems deadlier than the coronavirus \u2014 although Ebola is much more difficult to catch, since it is only transmitted through bodily fluids.\n\nTrump said contradictory things about the virus\u2019s spread, often declaring victories where public health officials had said there was still room for concern.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inevitable,\" Trump said of the coronavirus\u2019s spread to the United States. \"I think that there\u2019s a chance it could get worse. There\u2019s a chance that it could get fairly, substantially worse, but nothing\u2019s inevitable ... There\u2019s a chance that it won\u2019t spread, too.\"\n\nThe president insisted that the number of cases in the United States is \"going very substantially down, not up,\" and he also claimed the same success for China.\n\n\"If you can count on the reports coming out of China, that spread has gone down quite a bit,\" he said. \"As opposed to getting larger, it\u2019s actually gotten smaller.\"\n\nDespite the president\u2019s confidence, his comments don\u2019t square with what public health officials have been saying about the coronavirus.\n\nJust minutes before Trump claimed the number of cases was going \"substantially down,\" Anne Schuchat, the CDC\u2019s principal deputy director, said the CDC does \"expect more cases.\"\n\nAnne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, speaks during a press conference on the coronavirus on Feb. 26, 2020, in Washington. (AP/Vucci)\n\nTrump said that \"because of all we\u2019ve done, the risk to the American people remains very low.\"\n\nThe local risk in most U.S. communities seems relatively low, but that could change. The same day as Trump\u2019s press conference, the CDC announced that a California patient tested positive for the coronavirus, marking the first U.S. case in which the source of infection was unclear.\n\n\"The risk is unknown at this point,\" said Cohen, the director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel.\n\nTrump has also claimed on multiple occasions that the coronavirus will likely \"go away in April.\"\n\n\"A lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat,\" he said Feb. 10 during a White House meeting with state governors.\n\nBut there\u2019s no way to know this soon whether the new coronavirus will phase out with the shift in seasons like the flu or other, more mild coronaviruses.\n\n\"Since COVID-19 is an emerging pathogen that surfaced in December, it is hard to draw conclusions for the spring,\" Cohen told us. \"Some respiratory viruses are seasonal, so this might be considered a reasonable hope.\"\n\nIn the meantime, public health officials and epidemiologists are \"trying to learn the \u2018rules\u2019 that govern COVID-19\" so they can \"maximize prevention and treatment,\" Cohen said.", "lang": "en"}
