Rick Scott named former House Republican leader and Miami-Dade property appraiser Carlos L\u00f3pez-Cantera as his lieutenant governor and runningmate on Jan. 14, 2014.\n\nL\u00f3pez-Cantera was born in Spain to Cuban parents and lives in a county with a large number of Hispanic voters. Democrats dove into L\u00f3pez-Cantera\u2019s past record on immigration and launched immediate attacks, including about a controversial 2011 proposal known as the Florida Immigration Enforcement Act (HB 7089).\n\n\"In 2011, Lopez-Cantera staunchly supported HB 7089, the anti-immigrant bill modeled after the racial profiling Arizona law, which Rick Scott embraced during his first governor's race,\" said the Miami-Dade chapter of the Democratic Hispanic caucus of Florida in a Jan. 16 press release. \"Lopez-Cantera called it a \u2018common sense\u2019 and \u2018reasonable\u2019 bill in a press release on March 10, 2011.\" The Florida Democratic Party launched a similar attack.\n\nWe wanted to know, did L\u00f3pez-Cantera \"staunchly support\" House Bill 7089?\n\nL\u00f3pez-Cantera\u2019s comments about an Arizona-style law in 2010\n\nDuring his Republican primary in 2010, Scott vowed to bring an Arizona-style law to Florida.\n\n\"Rick Scott backs Arizona\u2019s law; he'll bring it to Florida and let our police check if the people they arrest are here legally. That\u2019s common sense,\" his campaign said.\n\nSigned into law by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer in 2010, that law requires police who stop a person to verify their immigration status if they reasonably suspect the person of being in the country illegally. (The U.S. Supreme Court struck down part of the law in 2012.)\n\nThe law became a focal point of a hotly contested Republican primary between Scott and then Attorney General Bill McCollum as they battled for conservative voters. In May 2010, McCollum announced he would support an Arizona-style law.\n\nThough Scott strongly supported the measure as a candidate, he abandoned it once he became governor. PolitiFact Florida rated the campaign pledge a Promise Broken on our Scott-O-Meter, a database of his campaign promises.\n\nBack during the 2010 campaign, the Miami Herald interviewed Hispanic legislators, including L\u00f3pez-Cantera, about McCollum\u2019s support for the Arizona law.\n\n\"As far as I\u2019m concerned, I don\u2019t think Florida has a problem like Arizona does,\" L\u00f3pez-Cantera said. \"I realize there\u2019s a problem in Arizona. They have a serious problem, but I don't think you can compare it to Florida.\"\n\nIn August 2010, L\u00f3pez-Cantera told the Tampa Bay Times: \"I am concerned that this could jeopardize civil liberties.\"\n\nThe topic of immigration reform remained a concern for L\u00f3pez-Cantera after Scott won the primary, and it appeared the two had a conversation about it.\n\n\"I asked about the issue going forward, and he (Scott) said immigration is an issue, but the more pressing one is jobs and the economy,\" L\u00f3pez-Cantera told the Miami Herald in September 2010.\n\nL\u00f3pez-Cantera served as the state House majority leader and would have to deal with a range of Republican viewpoints on immigration reform: both hardliners who wanted a crackdown and some Hispanic lawmakers and constituents who viewed such a push as anti-Hispanic.\n\nDuring the 2011 session, legislators introduced the Florida Immigration Enforcement Act as HB 7089 and a similar bill in the Senate, SB 2040. The bills were not identical to Arizona\u2019s law, but for immigrant advocates it raised fears that it would increase racial profiling. Some business-backed groups also raised concerns because there was a component that related to employers.\n\nThe House bill would have required police to check the immigration status of a person subject of a criminal investigation if the police had \"reasonable suspicion\" the person was in the country illegally. Also, employers would be required to check workers\u2019 immigration status. The Senate counterpart didn\u2019t go as far and only let police police check the status of an inmate -- not a person only under investigation -- and it gave some wiggle room to employers.\n\nIn March 2011, the House judiciary committee passed the bill 12-6.\n\nL\u00f3pez-Cantera, Miami-Dade\u2019s delegation chair, wasn\u2019t a member of that committee. But in his press release after the vote he spoke positively about the law but didn\u2019t specifically state how he would vote on it:\n\n\"Chairman Snyder and the Judiciary Committee recognize the unique and diverse history of our state and have worked hard to bring all stakeholders to the table to produce this piece of common sense, Florida immigration reform. This legislation is designed to preserve employment opportunities for Floridians through the use of the E-Verify system.\n\n\"The bill does not require law enforcement officers to ask individuals for immigration documentation during routine traffic stops. It does, however, give law enforcement officers the tools necessary to enforce the immigration laws of the United States.\"\n\n\"I look forward to watching this reasonable and effective approach to immigration reform work its way through the legislative process.\"\n\nActivists opposing the bills turned up the heat and particularly targeted L\u00f3pez-Cantera and Sen. Anitere Flores, a sponsor of the Senate bill and another Hispanic Republican from Miami-Dade.\n\nIn April, left-leaning and Hispanic groups announced they would launch Spanish-language radio ads calling out the two legislators. Groups also held a protest in front of L\u00f3pez-Cantera\u2019s office.\n\nWhile the attacks were going on, the Herald reported that L\u00f3pez-Cantera was now against the House measure and planned to vote against it as well. \"Florida doesn\u2019t need an immigration law,\" he said in April 2011.\n\nThe Senate passed a version of the bill, but the full House never took a vote. The measure was dead by the end of the session.\n\nWe asked for evidence from the Miami-Dade group that made the claim but didn\u2019t hear back. However Joshua Karp, spokesman for the Florida Democratic Party, said there was a period of time when L\u00f3pez-Cantera supported the bill but later flip-flopped.\n\nWe were unsuccessful at getting a direct response from L\u00f3pez-Cantera. A spokesman for the Republican Party of Florida sent us a statement arguing that Florida\u2019s proposed bill was different from the Arizona law and repeated this line from L\u00f3pez-Cantera\u2019s press release:\n\n\"The bill does not require law enforcement officers to ask individuals for immigration documentation during routine traffic stops.\"\n\nThe Democratic Hispanic Caucus of Florida\u2019s Miami-Dade chapter that stated L\u00f3pez-Cantera \"staunchly supported\" a bill modeled after Arizona\u2019s immigration law.\n\nL\u00f3pez-Cantera never had to take a vote on the bill, so the only evidence we can evaluate is his statements about the bill. At first, L\u00f3pez-Cantera said he looked forward to \"watching this reasonable and effective approach to immigration reform work its way through the legislative process.\" That\u2019s a positive statement, but hardly \"staunch\" support.\n\nBut as protesters turned up the heat on L\u00f3pez-Cantera, he became decidedly opposed, saying \"Florida doesn\u2019t need an immigration law.\"\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
