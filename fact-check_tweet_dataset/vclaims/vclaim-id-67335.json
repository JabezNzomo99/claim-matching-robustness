Incumbent Mark Pryor, a Democrat, about how the Bible guides him.\n\nInterestingly, when the National Republican Senatorial Committee , challenger Rep. Tom Cotton\u2019s office went against fellow Republicans to .\n\nBut that\u2019s not where the debate about Pryor\u2019s faith ends. It circles back to his November the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, a bill that would prevent workplace discrimination based on sexuality and gender identity. It passed in the Senate but hasn\u2019t been taken up by the House.\n\nWhile the bill\u2019s status is in flux, the debate among lawmakers, advocacy groups and religious leaders continues.\n\nThe Traditional Values Coalition, a religious activist group, criticized Pryor for his ENDA vote. Andrea Lafferty, the coalition\u2019s president, highlighted a perceived contradiction of Pryor\u2019s religious beliefs in a Dec. 6 mass fundraising email.\n\n\"There's a reason why Pryor is attempting to run as a Christian in Arkansas,\" she said. \"It's because Pryor has voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) in Washington, a bill that discriminates against Christian daycare, Christian parents, Christian business owners, and the rights of religious freedom.\"\n\nPolitiFact wanted to take a closer look at how religious organizations would fare if the bill becomes law.\n\nBefore we take a look at the bill, let\u2019s contextualize the coalition\u2019s claim in the broader context of American Christianity. It\u2019s important to note that within Christianity, gay rights is a divisive and complex issue.\n\nThe Traditional Values Coalition\u2019s ENDA disapproval is other Christian groups, like the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. They expressed their view in an Oct. 31 press release:\n\n\"The USCCB continues to promote the dignity of both work and marriage and to oppose unjust discrimination on any grounds, including those related to homosexual inclination or sexual identity. But we cannot support a bill, like ENDA, that does not justly advance the dignity of all workers and authentic non-discrimination.\"\n\nAt the same time, groups like ReconcilingWorks, a Lutheran group that welcomes gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) members, support ENDA\u2019s passage.\n\n\"ReconcilingWorks: Lutherans for Full Participation believes that all hardworking people \u2014 including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people \u2014 should have a fair chance to earn a living and provide for their families without fear of being fired for reasons that have nothing to do with their job performance,\" spokesman Tim Fisher said. \"We strongly support the passage of ENDA.\"\n\nAs the gay rights movement gains more traction, some Christians have changed their perspectives.\n\n\"Most American Christians do not want a gay pastor overseeing their church, and that is not likely to change soon,\" said Kate Bowler, an American Christianity professor at Duke University. \"However, we are seeing thawing numbers of those who agreed that gay people should be allowed same-sex unions.\"\n\nThe ENDA bill would prohibit private-sector employers and government employers on the local, state and federal levels from discriminating against employees based on sexual orientation and gender identity. That protects people who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender.\n\nUnder the law, employers can\u2019t fire or refuse to hire people based on actual or perceived sexuality and gender identity (which need not align with a person\u2019s biological identity).\n\nChurches and other institutions with religious purposes (like schools and daycares) are exempt from the ENDA rules, just as they are from the religious discrimination portion of the \u2019s Title VII.\n\nUnder Title VII, and therefore under ENDA, religious organizations, which need not be church-run, would be exempt. Additionally, all businesses with fewer than 15 employees are exempt, whether they\u2019re religious or not.\n\nNelson Tebbe, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who specializes in religious liberty, said ENDA\u2019s religious exemption exceeds Title VII\u2019s.\n\n\"It\u2019s broader because the religious exemption in Title VII only allows religious organizations to discriminate on the basis of religion,\" he said. But it doesn\u2019t allow religious groups to discriminate based on factors like an employee\u2019s gender or race.\n\nSo by permitting religious organizations to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, ENDA allows them more flexibility than Title VII.\n\nLet\u2019s break down the Traditional Values Coalition claim to see how each mention would be treated if ENDA becomes law:\n\u2022 Daycare: \"If it were a secular daycare that just happened to be owned by a religious individual with a conviction that prohibited them from hiring LGBT folk, then the exemption would not apply,\" Tebbe said. He added that nonprofit daycares with religious affiliations would be exempt.\n\u2022 Parents: \"There is nothing in ENDA that would require parents to alter their beliefs or what they teach their children about religion, homosexuality, marriage equality, et cetera,\" said Ian Thompson, an American Civil Liberties Union representative for LGBT issues.\n\u2022 Business owners: For-profit companies with 15 employees or more would need to abide by ENDA, said Dena Sher, an ACLU religious liberty counsel. But Christian nonprofits and Christian (or any other) businesses with fewer than 15 employees would be exempt. Tebbe also noted that religious organizations who don\u2019t hire LGBT people are protected under ENDA.\n\u2022 Rights of religious freedom: \"Not only does the Constitution protect religious freedom broadly, but existing federal discrimination law already prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion,\" Thompson said.\n\nThe Traditional Values Coalition doesn\u2019t believe that these religious exemptions are broad enough.\n\n\"ENDA would not cover any secular companies and organizations that are run by committed Christians,\" said Harry Mihet, a Liberty Counsel lawyer the coalition referred us to.\n\nMihet is correct. But as far as discrimination goes, in the bill\u2019s , there\u2019s no reference to Christianity, or to any other individual religion, for that matter. All religions are treated the same and can legally invoke the same exemption. And Christianity isn\u2019t the only religion that has historically grappled with acceptance of sexuality and gender identity issues.\n\nMerriam-Webster as \"the practice of unfairly treating a person or group of people differently from other people or groups of people.\" To say that the law discriminates against Christians doesn\u2019t fit based on our experts\u2019 interpretation of the bill and the inclusion of an overall religious exemption that applies to any religion, not just Christians.\n\n\"If you had some exemption that wasn\u2019t available to Christians, that would be discrimination,\" said Doug Laycock, a law and religious studies professor at the University of Virginia. \"The only way they\u2019re treated differently is they get an exemption.\"\n\nThe Traditional Values Coalition said ENDA discriminates \"against Christian daycare, Christian parents, Christian business owners, and the rights of religious freedom.\"\n\nThe bill\u2019s religious exemption indicates that churches, church-run initiatives and other religious businesses need not comply by employing people of all sexualities and gender identities. And there\u2019s no special negative treatment for Christians. Businesses of any religion could qualify for the exemption. Individuals of any faith who oppose sexuality would have to abide by the law, so no religion is singled out.\n\nWe can understand why religious conservatives may take issue with this bill. However, the rhetoric in the email is too broad and overstated, and claims to speak for all Christians.", "lang": "en"}
