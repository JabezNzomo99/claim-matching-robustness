The claim is false; the video shows Duterte stating that a successful vaccine had not yet been created for COVID-19 during a government press conference aired on July 21, 2020.\n\nThe video was published on YouTube here on July 21, 2020. It was viewed more than 10,000 times before it was removed.\n\nThe eight-minute 23-second video features Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte speaking at a press conference. The Tagalog-language caption of the video states: \"GOOD NEWS! PRESIDENT DUTERTE CONFIRMED THERE IS ALREADY A VACCINE FOR COVID-19!\"\n\nIdentical videos were also shared here and here on Facebook alongside a similar claim about Duterte\u2019s purported COVID-19 vaccine announcement.\n\nThe claim is false; in the video, Duterte urged people to wear a mask and follow social distancing rules because a COVID-19 vaccine was not yet available.\n\nThe video in the misleading post was taken from this Philippine government video broadcast on July 21, 2020. The footage shows Duterte meeting with several officials and providing an update about the country\u2019s COVID-19 response.\n\nA closer examination of the video in the misleading post and the original video found no comments from Duterte about a newly-developed COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nAt the three-minute 48-second mark of the video in the misleading post, Duterte\u2019s Tagalog-language remarks translate to English as: \"Actually what I promised you before if there'd be -- what -- this vaccine. There is, in final trials.\"\n\nAt the five-minute one-second mark, he says: \"So just wait a little more. For our plans, put it something like towards the end of the year. But if there is a thing that develops which is really good for you, I will be first -- I will take out loans.\"\n\nAt the five-minute 30-second mark, he states: \"In the meantime, there's nothing. Not in America, Europe, not one for them or two, three. Social distancing, don't yell, don't stay too close to other people. Mask, America, Russia, all, China, mask, this is very important.\"\n\nThis official transcript and this report by state-run Philippine News Agency also do not contain references to Duterte making the purported announcement.\n\nAs of July 27, 2020, the World Health Organization maintains: \u201cWHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19 and will continue to provide updated information as soon research results become available.\u201d\n\nMore than 150 researchers worldwide were in the process of developing and testing a vaccine for the novel coronavirus, AFP reported here on July 22.", "lang": "en"}
