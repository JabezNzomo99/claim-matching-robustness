We continue to work in close coordination with all stakeholders to minimize any inconvenience to the passengers,\" the tweet read.\n\nIndia Today reported that the Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri also gave a statement at the parliament clarifying that the incident is three days old and did not happen on the morning of March 18.\n\n\n\nIn his statement, Puri was quoted as saying, \"This is a three-day-old video. What happened that day was a number of flights arrived at the same time and that was the day we had introduced the mandatory quarantine' rule. But everything is smooth now.\"\n\nAccording to the directions of the Health Ministry, all the travellers coming from or with travel history of visiting China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, France, Spain, and Germany are to be quarantined for at least 14 days starting March 13.\n\nThe incident is seen in the video actually occurred at the Delhi airport within a couple of days after this particular advisory was implemented.\n\nInternational passengers were not being allowed to exit the airport before a thorough check-up.
