Furthermore, 6 AAP MLAs and 1 Bharatiya Janata party MLA have also declared cases of assault on woman with intent to outrage her modesty (IPC Section-354).\n\nAlok made this claim in a tweet which read (translated from Hindi):\n\n\"40 out of 62 MLAs are rape accused, with their support Arvind Kejriwal becomes Chief Minister, truly new type of politics have begun, people calling Delhi the rape capital have left even RJD (Rashtiriya Janata Dal) behind (sic), Lalu Prasad Yadav will be happy that at least someone is getting ahead, do you understand why Nirbhaya scandals happen people?\"\n\n\n\nTo fact check this, BOOM accessed the latest report by ADR, which compiles all the declared criminal cases in the affidavits filed by all candidates prior to polling.\n\nIt mentions that out of the 70 MLAs, 37 of them (which includes AAP and BJP MLAs) have declared serious criminal cases against them - which is lesser than the number claimed by Alok.\n\nADR defines the following offences as \"serious\":\n\u2022 Offence for which maximum punishment is of 5 years or more.\n\u2022 If an offence is non-bailable\n\u2022 If it is an electoral offence (for eg. IPC 171E or bribery)\n\u2022 Offences that are mentioned in Representation of the People Act (Section 8)\n\nCrimes against women are further divided into rape (IPC Section-376) or \"assault or criminal force on woman with intent to outrage her modesty\" (IPC Section-354).\n\n\n\nUpon searching for declared cases of rape, BOOM found that only one MLA had declared a case against himself - AAP's Mohinder Goyal from the Rithala constituency.\n\nFurthermore, there were 7 MLAs who had declared cases of assault on women with intent to outrage her modesty by force - 6 from AAP and 1 from BJP.\n\nTherefore, overall there were 7 MLAs from AAP who have declared serious cases of crime against women, and 1 MLA from BJP who had declared the same.", "lang": "en"}
