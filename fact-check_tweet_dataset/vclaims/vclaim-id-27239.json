The photograph was frequently accompanied by the claim that both sides (white nationalists and counter-protesters) had contributed to the violence, and that while Republicans had denounced racists, Democrats had not denounced antifa protestors:\n\n\n\n This is not a genuine photograph of an antifa protestor striking a police officer. This image was digitally manipulated to add the antifa logo to an unrelated photograph.\n\nThe real image was taken in Athens, Greece in December 2009 during a demonstration on the one-year anniversary of the death of Alexandros Grigoropoulos, a 15-year-old who was killed by a police officer. Photographer Milos Bicanski took the photograph, which is available on Getty Images with the following caption:\n\nThe protester\u2019s jacket in the original image was blank. The antifa logo was digitally added to this image, which was then reshared as if it depicted a recent incident in an attempt to show that \u201cboth sides\u201d contributed to the violence in Charlottesville:\n\nSeveral politicians denounced both violence and white supremacy \u2014 which culminated in Charlottesville with a white supremacist driving his car into a crowd of counter-protestors, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring dozens more. However, more controversially, President Trump initially refused to condemn racism and instead blamed \u201cmany sides\u201d for the violence:\n\nSome Republican lawmakers also chastised Trump\u2019s response in implicit and explicit terms. \u201cMr. President\u2014we must call evil by its name,\u201d Colorado Senator Cory Gardner wrote on Twitter. \u201cThese were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism.\u201d Florida Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said \u201cthere are no other \u2018sides\u2019 to hatred and bigotry.\u201d Florida Senator Marco Rubio also noted it would be \u201cvery important for the nation to hear [President Trump] describe events in #Charlottesville for what they are, a terror attack by [white supremacists].\u201d", "lang": "en"}
