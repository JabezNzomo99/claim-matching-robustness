And I hate to tell you, but Missouri happens to be one of them,\" he told a crowd in St. Charles on Nov. 29, 12 days after the October preliminary unemployment rates were released.\n\nSo is it true that Missouri is one of \"13 states this year (that) have seen unemployment drop to the lowest levels in the history of their state\"?\n\nThe White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for evidence, so we don\u2019t know how they got their numbers. But the usual way of looking at this question is to use data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government\u2019s official tabulator of employment statistics.\n\nThe bureau compiles the seasonally adjusted highs and lows for states, which can be found on its website. It lists 13 states that have hit historic lows this year. Not included: Missouri.\n\nWe looked at seasonally adjusted data, which is the way economists prefer to compare numbers in various months of the year. For example, during the holidays, there\u2019s typically a bump in temporary or seasonal workers. So if employment grows by 2 percent every November due to seasonal workers, seasonal adjustment takes that 2 percent out of the equation.\n\nThe seasonally adjusted preliminary unemployment rate for October is 3.5 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The historic low was from October 1999 through January 2000 when the unemployment rate was 3.1.\n\nIn a visit to St. Charles, Trump said that Missouri is one of \"13 states this year have seen unemployment drop to the lowest levels in the history of their state.\"", "lang": "en"}
