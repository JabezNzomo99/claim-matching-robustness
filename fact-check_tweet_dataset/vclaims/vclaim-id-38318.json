Bernie Sanders making racist remarks in front of schoolchildren.\n\nThe video was deceptively edited to remove the context around Sanders\u2019 comments. He was actually explaining how harmful stereotypes develop and perpetuate about certain groups of people.\n\nThe short clip that\u2019s making the rounds on social media comes from the public access channel television show \u201cBernie Speaks with the Community\u201d that the Vermont senator hosted while he was mayor of Burlington. It appears to come from the Dec. 4, 1987 episode in which Sanders spoke to Edmund Middle School Paradise Project students about racial stereotypes.\n\n\u201cAll the Irish people do is drink. That\u2019s the Irish,\u201d Sanders says. \u201cAll Italians are gangsters, and Irish are drunk, and Jews are greedy, and black people smell. Okay?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the full video of the roughly hour-long episode:\n\nThe Daily Caller reviewed the episode in its entirety and found that the viral clip has been deceptively edited to make it appear like Sanders is making derogatory comments about black, Italian, Irish and Jewish people. The clip leaves out important context that he was actually explaining how some people develop and perpetuate racial stereotypes about certain groups of people to \u201cdehumanize them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you want to deal with a group of people, if you want to do bad things to them, you do what I call, dehumanize them,\u201d Sanders explained. \u201cYou make them less than human beings \u2013 they\u2019re not like you, they\u2019re something else. And what you do, therefore, is you develop a stereotypical image of them.\u201d\n\nHe also asked the middle school students to provide examples of stereotypes they\u2019ve heard and offered some that he\u2019d heard about different races and nationalities.

In the full video, it\u2019s clear that Sanders was criticizing the stereotypes, not expressing his personal views.", "lang": "en"}
