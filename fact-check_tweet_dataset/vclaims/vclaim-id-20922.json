In fact, after we expanded, the governor signed into law the largest investment in the system for the developmentally disabled in the history of the program \u2014 $286 million. To say Medicaid expansion had a negative impact on the (developmental disabilities) system is false, as it is just the opposite of what actually happened.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office found that the per capita caps would not give states any more substantial flexibility. In fact, the most expensive 5 percent of Medicaid enrollees account for about half of Medicaid spending, according to a 2015 analysis by the Government Accountability Office. The least expensive 50 percent of Medicaid enrollees accounted for less than 8 percent of Medicaid spending. This means a small number of people heavily depend on the program for their medical needs, and would be affected the most if a state has a fixed amount of federal money to spend on each person.\n\nHowever, block grants do not fluctuate automatically based on the number of people enrolled in Medicaid. They also \u201cwould disconnect the level of funding from the number of Medicaid beneficiaries and the cost of providing care,\u201d according to the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s November 2016 analysis of proposals for per capita caps and block grants. Moreover, block grants under the Senate bill is for medical assistance to non-disabled adults, excluding the newly eligible adults under Medicaid expansion in Obamacare, so it\u2019s not exactly the \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d population, like Pence says.\n\n\n\nPence said the bill would give states stability to manage their insurance markets. This is a reference to the State Stability and Innovation Program in BCRA, which provides $182 billion in federal funding over nine years for states to help stabilize their insurance markets in the face of large cuts under the bill. It\u2019s worth noting that this would only be a partial offset to the reductions in Medicaid spending that states otherwise would have had under current law.\n\n\n\nPresident Barack Obama, when campaigning in 2008, did misleadingly say that his plan would reduce premiums for families by $2,500. This promise came with a big asterisk that he did not always make clear: He was not saying premiums would fall by $2,500 or save up to $2,500 in premiums, but that health-care costs per family would be that much lower than anticipated. In other words, if overall costs \u2014 not just premiums \u2014 were expected to rise by $5,000 by 2012, they would only rise by $2,500. We gave him Pinocchios for this misleading claim at the time.\n\nOn average, eight out of 10 marketplace enrollees receive government premium subsidies, and they are protected from a premium increase (and may even see a decrease) if they stay with a low-cost plan. The White House, meanwhile, previously said that it is not accounting for the cost after subsidies because two out of 10 enrollees do not receive any subsidy, and therefore face the full impact of the premium hikes. Of course, the whole point of Obamacare was to provide subsidies to the majority of people on the exchanges.", "lang": "en"}
