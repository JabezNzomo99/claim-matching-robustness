While observers expect Lynch to win confirmation, the Senate\u2019s Republican majority has been withholding a vote as leverage to secure other legislative items. In addition, some Republicans have taken issue with Lynch\u2019s refusal to speak out against President Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, which some in the GOP have called unconstitutional.\n\nObama himself decried the delay at a with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on April 17, 2015.\n\nObama called it a \"crazy situation where a woman who everybody agrees is qualified, who has gone after terrorists, who has worked with police officers to get gangs off the streets, who is trusted by the civil rights community and by police unions as being somebody who is fair and effective and a good manager -- nobody suggests otherwise -- who has been confirmed twice before by the United States Senate for one of the biggest law enforcement jobs in the country, has been now sitting there longer than the previous seven attorney general nominees combined.\"\n\nWe wondered: Has Lynch\u2019s nomination been \"sitting there longer than the previous seven Attorney General nominees combined\"?\n\nWe looked at data from the Senate about the past seven nominees. Here\u2019s a rundown, in reverse chronological order:\n\nSo the previous seven nominees waited a collective 119 days. How about Lynch? Here it gets a little complicated.\n\nLynch\u2019s nomination was initially received in the Senate on Nov. 13, 2014. The Senate -- then under lame-duck Democratic control -- did not move the nomination forward. One obvious problem, beyond a short calendar interrupted by Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks: Rushing the nomination through might have been seen as thwarting the will of the people, who had just voted for a Republican Senate.\n\nThen, the Obama administration resubmitted Lynch\u2019s nomination to the newly Republican-held chamber on Jan. 7, 2015. That\u2019s standard procedure when one Congress ends and another begins.\n\nIf you count the entire period -- from Nov. 13 to April 17, the day of Obama\u2019s remark -- then Lynch had waited for 155 days (and 158 by this article\u2019s publication date). That\u2019s easily more than the 119 logged by the previous seven nominees.\n\nHowever, if you count only the time after the Republicans took over the Senate -- the period for which Obama\u2019s obstructionism argument is strongest -- the delay was 100 days by the time of Obama\u2019s comments, and 103 by this article\u2019s publication. That\u2019s less than the 119 days waited by the previous seven nominees, though it\u2019s possible the wait could ultimately reach or exceed 119 days if no action is taken by early May.\n\nObama does has a point that the delay for Lynch -- however many days it was -- has been unusually long.\n\nOf the hundreds and hundreds of nominations submitted in recent decades, only a few have waited for longer than 100 days, according to the Senate Historical Office. Among the more notable waits:\n\u2022 Richard Cordray, nominated for director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 2011-13: 1+ years\n\nOf these, the only nominee for an official Cabinet position to wait longer than Lynch was Strauss, and that was more than half a century ago.\n\nSo Lynch\u2019s case is pretty unusual by historical standards.\n\nSarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a political scientist at George Washington University, sees the argument for starting the clock with the resubmission of Lynch\u2019s nomination, but she added that focusing on that distinction misses the larger point.\n\n\"Presidents are typically given the right to field their own team,\" Binder said. \"Given Lynch's previous confirmations and stellar credentials, why force her and the president to wait so long for a confirmation vote?\"\n\nBurdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist who has studied the Senate, agreed. \"There\u2019s a little sleight of hand\" in Obama\u2019s comment, \"but the overall message is that there\u2019s been a lot of delay and that it\u2019s historic in length.\"\n\nAnd it\u2019s not as if Republicans were powerless to resist even if the Democratic-controlled Senate had tried to act, said Steven S. Smith, a political scientist and Senate expert at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\n\"The Democrats could have moved the nomination quickly at the end of the last Congress if the Republicans were not requiring cloture on everything, even nominations, which created a backlog of must-pass legislation and nominations as the Congress came to a close,\" Smith said.\n\nObama said that Lynch\u2019s nomination \"has been now sitting there longer than the previous seven attorney general nominees combined.\"\n\nMathematically, Obama was correct if you start counting from Lynch\u2019s initial nomination, but short by 19 days if you start counting from the resubmission of her nomination to the newly installed Republican-controlled Senate. Either way, it\u2019s clear that Obama has a point that Lynch\u2019s delay has been long by historical standards, especially for a Cabinet nominee.\n\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
