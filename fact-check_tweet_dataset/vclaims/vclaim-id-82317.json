I mean, think of it. 250,000 people. And we all have heart. And we all want people taken care of and all of that. But with the problems our country has, to take in 250,000 people \u2014 some of whom are going to have problems, big problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the president says things like, you know, through an executive order, \u2018I\u2019m going to bring 100,000 people in here from Syria,\u2019 Congress needs to say \u2018you do that and we\u2019re going to defund everything including your breakfast.\u2019 \u201c\n\nRather than drop the figure, Trump has boosted it to 250,000. And other candidates have followed his lead with exaggerated figures, just not quite as high. Ben Carson claimed 200,000 from the Middle East \u201cregion\u201d and 100,000 from Syria; Fiorina said 100,000 from Syria.\n\nIn fact, the planned number of Syrian refugees thus far is 10,000. How can people running for president \u2014 even if they are all political novices \u2014 continue to get this so wrong?\n\nAs we have explained before, the only thing close to a 200,000 figure is an announcement in September by Secretary of State John Kerry that the United States was prepared to boost the number of total refugees accepted from around the world in fiscal 2016, from 70,000 to 85,000. Then, in 2017, Kerry said that 100,000 would be accepted.\n\nBy law, the president every fiscal year sets the maximum number of refugees the United States can accept in a year. (Note to Carson: This is not done by executive order; it is a legal requirement.) Over the past decade, the annual limit has been between 70,000 and 80,000, according to the Congressional Research Service. (In fiscal 2013, about 30 percent came from the Middle East, mostly from Iraq.) So, 100,000 from around the world in 2017 would be a big jump, assuming Obama goes through with the pledge to authorize that level. But nothing is set in stone.\n\nAs for Syria, Obama has only directed the United States to accept at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next year. That\u2019s certainly an increase \u2014 fewer than 2,200 Syrians have been admitted to the United States since the uprising began in March 2011, according to State Department officials \u2014 but it\u2019s hardly the flood that Trump worries about. (Indeed, it\u2019s only a drop in the bucket of some 4 million Syrian refugees.) In theory, if Obama lifted the ceiling to 100,000 in 2017 and then filled the gap entirely with Syrians, that would be 25,000 more\u2013but that\u2019s still far less then 100,000.\n\nNote: Some readers have pointed to this tweet by Obama as evidence for the \u201c100,000\u201d figure. Note the phrase \u201cand other refugees.\u201d We certainly hope the candidates are not basing their assertions on a tweet.\n\nOf those admitted to the United States from Syria so far, about half have been children and a quarter are adults over 60. There are slightly more men than women, but only 2 percent of those admitted are single males of combat age, officials said.", "lang": "en"}
