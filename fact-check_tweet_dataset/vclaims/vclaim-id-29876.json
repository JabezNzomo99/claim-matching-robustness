No, that's not true: The protest on Monday was peaceful, according to media reports. The website that posted the story is known for creating satirical content and describes itself as \"the most reliable source of fake news on the planet.\"\n\nThe claim originated from an article published by Genesius Times on January 20, 2020, titled \"BREAKING: 23 killed at Virginia white supremacist gun-rights protest, dozens injured\" (archived here).

Ralph Northam, a Democrat, to declare a state of emergency and place a temporary ban on weapons on the grounds of the State Capitol.\n\nABC News estimated 6,000 unarmed members held a rally outside of the legislative building. Another 16,000 armed activists stayed outside of the Capitol grounds.\n\nThe day after Democrats took control of the state legislature on November 5, 2019, Northam appeared on CNN and vowed to push new gun control measures. Ever since, disinformation campaigns and conspiracy theories have emerged online, trying to stir up fears that authorities in Virginia were going to start confiscating guns.\n\nWe wrote about genesiustimes.com before.
