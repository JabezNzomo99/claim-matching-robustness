(The two spoke through interpreters.) The White House did not respond to our request for clarification.\n\nXi \u2014 and Trump \u2014 may have been referring to the tributary system between China and Korea, during which Korea gained protection from China while it was forced to pay \u201ctributes,\u201d or gifts. These gifts \u201csignaled a subordinate but still independent position,\u201d historian Kyung Moon Hwang wrote in the Korea Times.\n\nThe birth of the modern Korean Peninsula can be traced to the mid-7th century, after the unification of three kingdoms: Goguryeo, Silla and Baekjae. The name \u201cKorea\u201d is derived from \u201cGoguryeo,\u201d the original kingdom that is believed to have formed as a political entity as early as the 1st century B.C. Goguryeo encompassed what is now Manchuria and the northern part of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThere were two points in history when the Korean Peninsula came close to being absorbed into the Chinese civilization, according to Hwang. One was during the Han dynasty, through a system called \u201ccommanderies\u201d of northern parts of the Korean Peninsula under Goguryeo. This was more of a colonial system, but Quartz noted that Chinese researchers \u201chave tried to argue that this places Korea within \u2018Chinese local history.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe other time was in the 13th century during the Goryeo era, which succeeded the original three kingdoms, under Mongolian rule of both China and Korea. Hwang wrote: \u201cFor nearly a century Mongol-controlled China treated Goryeo somewhat like a colony, directly controlling its northern territories and constantly interfering in Goryeo\u2019s internal affairs; in fact the Mongol emperor in Beijing even determined Goryeo\u2019s monarch, whose ancestry, beginning with his mother, was usually more Mongol than Korean.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s description echoes a Chinese nationalist version and ignores the competing interpretations of the relations among Korea, China and Japan. Tensions between Koreans and Chinese over whether China exerted territorial control over Goguryeo blew over about a decade ago \u2014 when a Chinese government-backed group sought to rewrite the history of ancient Chinese influence in Northeast Asia, particularly in Korea. Koreans saw this as an effort to recast them as political subjects of China, and South Korea started its own competing government-backed project to research the history of Goguryeo. In the face of growing controversy, China promised South Korea it would not revise its textbooks, according to the Atlantic.\n\nIn March, when North Korea fired ballistic missiles into the body of water between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, administration officials used the name preferred by the Japanese government (\u201cSea of Japan\u201d) with no acknowledgment of the naming dispute for the body of water or alternative names. In response to a display of North Korean missiles this month, Trump claimed the USS Carl Vinson was headed toward North Korea when the vessel was actually traveling in the opposite direction.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to rate Trump\u2019s claim, since it\u2019s unclear whether Trump was actually quoting Xi or instead misunderstood what he was told. But his flippant reference to the Chinese-centric version of Sino-Korean relations was careless, at best.\n\nIf Trump was actually referring to the tributary system between Korea and China, then he left out a significant amount of context that distorted the relationship between them. Korea and China have long been intertwined, geopolitically and culturally. But Korea, or even Goguryeo, was not a spinoff of China, as he made it seem.", "lang": "en"}
