Tamilnadu and Jammu & Kashmir have a scheme but the beneficiaries are restricted to respective states.", "author": "factly.in", "date": "2019-07-10T05:44:05+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-46554", "url": "https://factly.in/there-is-no-such-scooty-yojana-scheme-launched-by-the-modi-government/", "vclaim": "A video alleging that the Modi government has launched a \u2018Scooty Yojana\u2019 scheme has been viral on YouTube and is being shared on social media platforms. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Modi government has launched \u2018Scooty Yojana\u2019 scheme to distribute scooters to all the girls across the country, who passed 10th standard. Fact: There is no such \u2018Scooty Yojana\u2019 scheme launched by the Central Government. In Tamilnadu, there is \u2018Amma Scooter Scheme\u2019 but the beneficiaries are restricted to that state itself. In Jammu & Kashmir, also, there is such a scheme but the beneficiaries are covered within that state. Hence, the claims made in the post stands FALSE.\n\nWhen googled to check if there is any such scheme as claimed in the post, no supporting information was found. If Modi has launched such a scheme nationwide, it would have been reported in all the major newspapers across the country. When searched on government websites to check the details about the scheme, no such scheme was found. Usually, when Central Government launches any scheme, information about it would be released through \u2018Press Information Bureau\u2019. When searched for the press release about the scheme, no such thing was found.\n\nLast year, newspapers have reported that Modi has launched \u2018Amma Scooty Yojana\u2019 in Tamilnadu. As per the scheme, working women who intend to purchase a scooter will be given a subsidy of 50% or Rs 25,000 in cash. \u2018Amma Scooty Yojana\u2019 is a Tamilnadu state-sponsored scheme and beneficiaries within the state can avail it. In 2016, the Jammu & Kashmir government has also launched a scooty scheme that aims to provide scooters to the girls who are going to college. This scheme is also a state-sponsored scheme and beneficiaries are restricted to within the state.\n\nNot only Tamil Nadu and J&K, even Rajasthan has its own scooty scheme. In Rajasthan, there are two schemes under which scooty vehicles are given: \u2018Medhavi Chathra Scooty Yojana\u2019 and \u2018Devnarayan Chathra Scooty Yojana\u2019. Each scheme has its own set of eligibility criteria but both of them are state-specific schemes under the Rajasthan State Government. So, these schemes are also not related to any \u2018Scooty scheme\u2019 which is nation-wide.\n\nTo summarise, the Modi government hasn\u2019t launched any \u2018Scooty Yojana\u2019 scheme that distributes scooters to girls across the country.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
