They were cheering as the World Trade Center came down. I know it might be not politically correct for you to talk about it, but there were people cheering as that building came down \u2014 as those buildings came down. And that tells you something. It was well covered at the time, George. Now, I know they don\u2019t like to talk about it, but it was well covered at the time. There were people over in New Jersey that were watching it, a heavy Arab population, that were cheering as the buildings came down. Not good.\u201d\n\nTrump says that he saw this with his own eyes on television and that it was well covered. But an extensive examination of news clips from that period turns up nothing. There were some reports of celebrations overseas, in Muslim countries, but nothing that we can find involving the Arab populations of New Jersey except for unconfirmed reports. (Some conspiracy Web sites cite a column by controversial blogger and commentator Debbie Schlussel, who is highly critical of Muslims, that makes a reference to an MTV broadcast of protests and riots in Paterson, N.J.; this claim has never been authenticated.) As the Newark Star-Ledger put it in an article on Sept. 18, 2001, \u201crumors of rooftop celebrations of the attack by Muslims here proved unfounded.\u201d\n\nWe also heard from some readers who claim to have heard this story from neighbors or friends or, in a handful of cases, said they personally saw some some people celebrating. (Matthew H. Rudd, an attorney, said he left the courthouse in Paterson midday three days after the attacks and saw \u201chalf a dozen cars full of young Arabic-looking men drove by blaring Arabic music and cheering loudly. I do not have any recordings or photos, but I can tell you that it was a very disturbing and unsettling sight.\u201d) These accounts are of course only anecdotal, do not involve thousands of people and were not filmed. In the case of Rudd\u2019s description, this did not take place on 9/11 but a few days later.\n\nWe also heard from many other readers who were in New Jersey at the time and said nothing happened on the day of the attacks. One man who said he walked up and down through Jersey City on 9/11 wrote: \u201cAt no time did I see anyone celebrating. It did not happen. Not thousands \u2014 not hundreds \u2014 not dozens \u2014 not one. At no time did I meet anyone who claimed to have seen any celebrations. It\u2019s also worth noting that I saw no TV-news vans who might have shot footage of celebrations. They did not show up until the next day.\u201d\n\nBut Walter Zalisko, a former police officer in Jersey City, contacted The Fact Checker to say Farmer was wrong. He says he heard on the radio dispatch at the time that officers had found Middle Easterners \u201cclapping and laughing\u201d on a number of rooftops, even in one case knocking down a cardboard version of the Twin Towers. But he does not think a police report was filed. \u201cIt was at most a hundred people doing this,\u201d he said, saying Trump\u2019s description of \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d was an exaggeration. As for Farmer\u2019s account, Zalisko said: \u201cJohn was holed up in his office and he didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d But Zalisko did not personally witness any of this.\n\nUpdate, Dec. 2: The Trump campaign posted snippets of video clips from a local CBS New York City newscast at the time that reported on the arrest of \u201ceight men\u201d\u2013not \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d\u2013 who were reported by neighbors as having celebrated the attack. One snippet mentions they had a model of the Twin Towers, as Zalisko had recalled. But while the newscast quotes an investigator as allegedly saying these men knew about the attack in advance, it is unclear if any charges were ever brought\u2013or if the claims of celebrations were ever proven. As Farmer said, investigators looked into many such reports\u2013and found them to be groundless. So this appears to be yet another unconfirmed report.\n\nUpdate, Nov. 26: MTV found the video and posted an excerpt on YouTube. This further undercuts Trump\u2019s case (and Schlussel\u2019s). One person, a then-high school senior named Emily Acevedo, was quoted as saying she had seen a group of kids acting up in front of the Paterson courthouse, banging on trash cans and shouting. She does not say they were Middle Eastern or Arab. Her recollections are intercut with comments from others, including a reporter on a newscast, saying nothing happened. MTV News interviewed Acevedo 14 years later and she said what she \u201csaw that night [was] not anything any different than would\u2019ve happened on any other summer night, on any other day where school was let out early.\u201d So this demonstrates once again there is no evidence of mass demonstrations. At best, there were only some kids acting up\u2013who may or may not have been Arab.", "lang": "en"}
