Now, the candidates for U.S. Senate in Ohio will square off face-to-face in their first debate Friday.\n\nThis debate is the first of three in the major Ohio cities of Youngstown, Columbus and Cleveland.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio has kept a close eye on this race, one of the tightest matchups in the country. The incumbent, Republican Sen. Rob Portman, recently pulled away from his challenger in the polls, Democrat Ted Strickland, by 14.5 points. The stream of controversies soaking the candidacy of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has freshened up Strickland\u2019s narrative against Portman, even though he un-endorsed Trump.\n\nHere\u2019s a guide to some of the candidates\u2019 favorite talking points.\n\nPortman was a six-term state representative for Ohio before President George W. Bush tapped him as his U.S. Trade Representative, his role from May 2005 to May 2006. He aided the passage of the North American and Central America free trade agreements.\n\nStrickland likes to call Portman \"the best senator China\u2019s ever had.\" With Portman as U.S. Trade Representative, America\u2019s trade deficit with China increased 21 percent. But Strickland went too far in one statement tying Portman\u2019s tenure to an influx of cheap Chinese steel in the market\n\nIn reality, Portman filed the first successful suit with the World Trade Organization against China, regarding China\u2019s purchases of domestic auto parts over U.S.- and foreign-made products.\n\nThe Strickland ad about Portman\u2019s role in stopping Chinese steel dumping fundamentally mischaracterized the role that the U.S. Trade Representative plays in imposing trade relief measures. We rated it False.\n\nPortman and Strickland have developed passive-aggressive alter egos for each other, with corresponding websites. At RetreadTed.com, Strickland is portrayed as an absentee congressman, a weak governor and an invisible Senate candidate. He\u2019s criticized for his work at a liberal Washington lobbying firm in the gap between serving as governor and running for Senate. BeltwayRob.com knocks Portman\u2019s bio as a career politician in Washington and claims he has poor name recognition in his home state. Portman\u2019s also branded as a flip-flopper on trade, because of his vote to fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal with countries in Asia, and his more recent statements in opposition to the deal. Share the Facts Widget Embed Portman is equally hard on Strickland over Ohio\u2019s loss of manufacturing jobs while Strickland was governor from 2007 to 2011. It was an era of economic downturn from which few political leaders emerged unscathed. Taking a page from Ohio Gov. John Kasich\u2019s playbook, which worked against Strickland in the 2010 governor\u2019s race, Portman and his aligned super PACs blamed Strickland\u2019s governorship for Ohio\u2019s loss of over 350,000 jobs. The estimated number of lost jobs is accurate, but the finger-pointing is misplaced. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1ad827d7-b4ea-44da-85e6-cd05045fe756 Strickland became governor at the apex of the nation\u2019s 2008 recession, which snowballed into a global economic crisis. PolitiFact Ohio rated the claim Half True that Strickland alone should be faulted for 350,000 lost jobs. That was the result of forces outside of his control. \"If the roles were reversed, and Ohio were led by a Republican governor and it was Democrats making the accusation, our rating would be the same,\" PolitiFact Ohio wrote. We also weighed in on Strickland\u2019s statement that the state\u2019s economic recovery began while he was still governor, in 2010. We called that claim Mostly True. PolitiFact Ohio has fact-checked 44 of Portman\u2019s statements and 18 of Strickland\u2019s dating back to 2010.
