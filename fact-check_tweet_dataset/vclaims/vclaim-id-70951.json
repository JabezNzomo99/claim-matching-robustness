Barack Obama had a 10-point plan to \"change\" the Second Amendment, including a ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns.\n\n \n\n We found it False, saying a \"fuzzy stand in \u201896 does not amount to a plan.\"\n\n \n\n This time, LaPierre said that Obama \"endorsed a total ban.\" Does his wording make a difference?\n\n \n\n Here\u2019s the shred of truth behind LaPierre\u2019s rhetoric: In 1996, Obama\u2019s campaign for Illinois Senate filled out a questionnaire for a state voter group. (Maybe Obama did it; maybe his campaign manager did. A spokesman for his 2008 presidential campaign later said that staff \"unintentionally mischaracterized his position,\" and that he never saw the survey.)\n\n \n\n The questionnaire asked about Obama\u2019s stance on various issues, including, \"Do you support state legislation to \u2026 ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns?\"\n\n \n\n The typed answer: Yes.\n\n \n\n (You can see the questionnaire here and here, and read stories about it by the Associated Press and POLITICO.)\n\n \n\n Obama never endorsed a \"total ban.\" But his campaign for state Senate almost 16 years ago did say yes to supporting such a ban on a state level in a questionnaire.\n\n \n\n What came of the campaign endorsement of such a policy?\n\n \n\n The Associated Press noted that Obama's legislative record in Illinois \"shows strong support for gun restrictions, such as limiting handgun purchases to one a month, but no attempts to ban them.\" On a different questionnaire eight years later, Obama\u2019s position was that \"a complete ban on handguns is not politically practicable\" but that reasonable restrictions should be imposed, AP reported.\n\n \n\n The president\u2019s policies\n\n \n\n Has Obama\u2019s presidential administration shown sympathy for banning handguns?\n\n \n\n In 2009, FactCheck.org said, \"We\u2019ve seen little or no evidence that the Obama administration is doing much to regulate guns or gun ownership.\"\n\n \n\n In 2010, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence gave the president a report card of seven F\u2019s for his first year in office, including on \"standing up the to the gun lobby.\"\n\n \n\n We talked with Caroline Brewer, director of communications for the Brady Center\u2019s sister organization, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\n \n\n \"We certainly don't have a record of him calling for a ban of any kind on handguns in the United States,\" she said. \"... There's no logical reason to believe the president would ever advocate the banning of all handguns, and we as organization don't advocate for that, either.\"\n\n \n\n She noted that after the Tucson, Ariz., shootings that injured former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, the president called for better background checks, not banning guns.\n\n \n\n Here\u2019s a quote from that Obama op-ed, as published in the Arizona Daily Star on March 13, 2011:\n\n(It\u2019s true, by the way, that Obama repealed Reagan-era rules to keep loaded guns out of national parks, something else that didn\u2019t sit well with the Brady Campaign.)\n\n \n\n LaPierre argues Obama\u2019s rhetoric is a sign that he\u2019s biding his time until a second term, when he\u2019ll unfurl his full anti-gun agenda \u2014 an uncheckable prediction. (See: \"Obama\u2019s Secret Plan To Destroy The Second Amendment By 2016.\") However, none of Obama\u2019s previous years in office hint at the kind of extreme policy push the NRA claims he\u2019s yearning to unleash.\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n LaPierre said \"(Obama) endorsed a total ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of all handguns.\" Obama\u2019s 1996 campaign for state Senate did endorse a state-level ban, on a questionnaire from which he has since distanced himself.\n\n \n\n He never suggested such a law in office, and later questionnaires showed a more nuanced approach, as have his more recent statements on gun control, including those during his time in the U.S. Senate and as president. In fact, his gun-control agenda has earned him failing grades from a prominent gun-control advocacy group.\n\n \n\n We can\u2019t rule on a shadowy conspiracy to destroy the Constitution in Obama\u2019s second term. But we can say that LaPierre\u2019s claim that Obama endorsed a total ban on handguns contains a small element of truth (a typewritten \"yes\" on a long-ago questionnaire about a state ban) but ignores critical facts \u2014 that is, Obama's statements and record \u2014 that would give a different impression. That's our definition of Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
