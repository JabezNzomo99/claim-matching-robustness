As of this fact check\u2019s publication, antifa.com does redirect users to joebiden.com, but this is not proof of a connection among the two.\n\nOne viral post with over 67,000 shares is visible here . It reads, \u201cif you go to Antifa.com, it takes you directly to joe bidens webpage....whats that tell ya...try it yourself.\u201d Other popular examples can be seen here and here .\n\nSeveral top officials from the Trump administration, including U.S. Attorney General William Barr, have blamed Antifa and other \u201cagitators\u201d for taking over the protests in U.S. cities. It is not clear how many, if any, of the protesters participating in demonstrations across the country are from Antifa, which experts say is not an organization but rather an amorphous movement (here).\n\nWhois.net, a website that displays public information related to domain ownership (www.whois.net/), says that antifa.com is registered to NameCheap, Inc., a domain registration and web-hosting platform (www.namecheap.com/).\n\nBy using Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine (here: rb.gy/d2scrf), the earliest snapshot available where the page redirects to JoeBiden.com is August 8, 2020 (here: rb.gy/hsfyr5). The previous snapshot, from July 24, 2020 leads to a page titled \u201cWe Are Antifa: Join Us & Take Action,\u201d and describes messages typically associated with the group (here: rb.gy/nwh30s). This site links to a YouTube channel (here) and a Twitter account that is now suspended (twitter.com/AntifaWebsite).\n\nMashable, a culture and tech news outlet, explained the ease with which any domain owner can forward visitors on to other websites: \u201cThe owner of a domain name can redirect their domain name to any webpage [\u2026] It\u2019s an easy process that just requires that you type in the URL you want your domain to redirect to in your registrar\u2019s administration panel.\u201d (here)\n\nMashable explains, \u201cCould it still mean Joe Biden\u2019s campaign runs the domain? It could. But it could also mean that the Trump campaign or someone supportive of it did the same just to cause a little controversy.\u201d They add, \u201cIt could also just be the work of a troll, a comedy group, or even someone just looking to add value to the domain when they look to sell it.\u201d Essentially, \u201cThe point is the redirect on its own doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d (here)\n\nWhile this could have been put in place by the Biden campaign, it would make little sense for them to have done so. Biden has condemned violence from the right and the left (here). Biden also said, following the shooting of Jacob Blake, that protesting police brutality \u201cis absolutely necessary, but burning down communities is not.\u201d (here)\n\nAntifa, short for \u201canti-fascist,\u201d is an amorphous movement whose adherents oppose people or groups they consider authoritarian or racist, often using aggressive tactics, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which monitors extremists ( here ). Horizontal in nature and largely lacking official organization, it is unclear how Antifa is funded, if at all (here).\n\nIts horizontal nature and lack of clear leadership makes it impossible to confirm the claims or officially contact Antifa as a group. One Facebook page called Antifa International (here) told Reuters in a statement it didn\u2019t believe the group is getting involved with the elections because \u201cAntifa doesn\u2019t support any politician.\u201d A Twitter account called Antifa Checker (twitter.com/AntifaChecker) that says it filters true from false information about Antifa online told Reuters it believed \u201cAntifa.com was registered by a troll at some point.\u201d\n\nPartly false. While antifa.com does redirect to Joebiden.com, there is no evidence of a connection between the two.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
