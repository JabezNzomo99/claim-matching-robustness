(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe\u2019ve previously fact-checked some of the claims in this video.\n\nBiden was friends with former U.S. Sen. Robert Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat who was once a member of the Ku Klux Klan. But Byrd renounced his views, and his public expressions of regret and shame over his involvement with the racist organization were well-documented by the time Biden \u2014 and former President Barack Obama \u2014 praised him at his memorial service in 2010.\n\nBiden also opposed court-ordered busing to integrate public schools, saying in 1977 that \"unless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle with tensions built so high that it is going to explode at some point.\"\n\nBut in this fact-check, we\u2019re addressing the other quote attributed to Biden, in which he uses the N-word.\n\nThe video cites a C-SPAN video from June 5, 1985. We found a clip that a user created on Feb. 11, 2020 and titled: \"In 1985, Joe Biden twice says the N-word.\"\n\nIn the clip, Biden is referring to a court ruling when he says: \"The court concluded, quote: \u2018The governor\u2019s opposition to the Nunez plan was predicated in significant part on his delineation of a majority Black district centered in Orleans Parish.\u2019 And in confidential portions of your staff memo, they brought to your attention the allegation that an important legislator, in defeating the Nunez plan in the basement, said, quote: \u2018We already have a (n-----) mayor; we don\u2019t need another (n------) big-shot.\u2019\"\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nBiden was speaking from his perch on the Senate Judiciary Committee during one of the confirmation hearings for William Bradford Reynolds, who then-President Ronald Regan nominated to be associate attorney general of the United States.\n\nThe court ruling Biden was reading from struck down a Louisiana redistricting plan because it was biased against the state\u2019s Black residents. Reynolds, who headed the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights section, had told the state of Louisiana the federal government wouldn\u2019t object to the plan. Biden focused on the case during his hearing in part because the former head of the civil rights section during the Nixon administration described the plan as \"a blatant racial gerrymander,\" the Washington Post reported at the time. The Senate committee ultimately rejected the nomination.\n\nBiden was wielding the quote with the racist slur as evidence against Reynolds\u2019 fitness for the position.\n\n\"There was clear, clear evidence of intent to discriminate against Black folks,\" Biden went on to say during the hearing, addressing Reynolds. \"I have been here 13 years, and you are one of the best lawyers we have ever had sit in front of us that worked for the federal government. And you are clearly not a racist. You are not out there saying, \u2018Man, I want to get those Blacks.\u2019 And then I sit back and I ask: If that is the case, how could he look at all this and not come to the conclusion that something was rotten in Denmark?\"\n\nIt\u2019s true that Biden twice used the word on camera, as the video says. But context matters, and the video doesn\u2019t make clear that Biden was quoting from a passage in a court ruling when he said it. Someone watching this could understandably \u2014 and wrongly \u2014 believe that these were Biden\u2019s own words. They weren\u2019t.", "lang": "en"}
