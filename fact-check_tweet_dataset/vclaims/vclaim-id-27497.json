Vishvas News investigated and found that okra has certain health benefits but diabetes cannot be completely cured with Okra.\n\nA post is getting viral stating that soaking okra ends in water overnight and drinking the water the next day can cure diabetes. The post is getting viral across many social media platforms.\n\nVishvas News started its investigation by putting relevant keywords on Google and found that the various versions of the viral post is circulating online since 2013.\n\nDuring our investigation, we found that a 2012 textbook Bioactive Food as Dietary Interventions for Diabetes stated that, \u201cthere is anecdotal evidence for the amelioration of diabetes by dietary consumption of okra but what are lacking are controlled clinical trials. There are constituents of okra such as polyphenolic molecules that provide encouragement for such studies in the future.\u201c\n\nReports suggest that okra has certain health benefits but to validate whether the statement diabetes can be cured through soaking okra ends in water overnight and drinking the water next day is yet to be verified.\n\nWe further investigated and found a report at Centers for disease control and prevention which stated, \u201cthere isn\u2019t a cure yet for diabetes, but losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active can really help. Taking medicine as needed, getting diabetes self-management education and support, and keeping health care appointments can also reduce the impact of diabetes on your life.\u201d\n\nAs per Dr Avni Kaul, Nutritionist, \u201cDiabetes can be managed and cured with diet and lifestyle changes, it cannot be cured completely.\u201d\n\nVishvas News spoke to Dr. Sujit Jha, Director Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolic Disease at Max Health Care. He quoted: \u201cThis post isn\u2019t true. Diabetes cannot be cured using Okra water as mentioned in the viral message.\u201d\n\nVishvas News also contacted Dr. Piyush Juneja, Ayurveda Doctor, Ayurvedic Clinic. He said: \u201cDiabetes is not cured using Okra water. However, it can be managed and controlled using certain home remedies and lifestyle changes.\u201d\n\nThe post claiming that soaking okra ends in water overnight and drinking the water the next day can cure diabetes is misleading. Okra cannot cure diabetes, however, diabetes can be managed through certain diet and lifestyle changes.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
