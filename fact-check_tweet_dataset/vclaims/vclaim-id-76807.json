Do they really prefer root canals, traffic jams and colonoscopies over this branch of government? Really?\n\nThat\u2019s Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s colorful claim from a February 2017 video that went viral. He repeated the allegations in an April 12, 2017 post on Facebook.\n\nIn the video, he points out the deep disdain for Congress but also notes that nearly all members are re-elected due to what Schwarzenegger calls a rigged political redistricting system, or gerrymandering.\n\nHere\u2019s his claim in its raw form:\n\n\"Here are some of the things that are more popular than Congress: hemorrhoids, Nickelback, traffic jams, cockroaches, root canals, colonoscopies, herpes. Even herpes, they couldn\u2019t beat herpes in the polls.\"\n\nThe former California governor and movie star has vowed to raise awareness about gerrymandering now that\u2019s he\u2019s finished as host of The New Celebrity Apprentice and squashed rumors he might run for U.S. Senate.\n\nWhile we know approval ratings for Congress are low, we wondered if they\u2019re really as pathetic as Schwarzenegger wants us to believe.\n\nWe set out on a fact check.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve checked Schwarzenegger\u2019s claims on Congress and gerrymandering. In February, we rated as True his assertion that, \"The average margin of victory in the House of Representatives was 37%.\" He was referring to the average percentage point victory for both Democrats and Republicans in the 2016 election.\n\nWe asked Schwarzenegger\u2019s spokesman for evidence backing up his claim about Congress\u2019 pitiful popularity.\n\nHe pointed to results from surveys conducted by Public Policy Polling in January 2013 and October 2013. The polling company is known for conducting some tongue-in-cheek surveys and works with liberal clients. In the polls on Congress\u2019 popularity, it asked hundreds of registered voters if they have a higher opinion of either Congress or a series of unpleasant or disliked things.\n\nBefore we tackle those results, let\u2019s look at Congress\u2019 overall approval ratings in these recent PPP polls:\n\n-- January 2013: Congress\u2019s overall favorability rating among voters was just 9 percent favorable and 85 percent unfavorable.\n\n-- October 2013: Congress\u2019 overall favorability rating dipped slightly to 8 percent favorable with the same 85 percent unfavorable.\n\n-- March 2017: Congress\u2019 overall favorability rating nudged up to 11 percent with only 68 percent of voters disapproving of it.\n\n-- 53 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of hemorrhoids than Congress, which was favored by only 31 percent in this matchup, according to the October 2013 survey\n\n-- 39 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of the rock band Nickelback than Congress, which was favored by only 32 percent\n\n-- 56 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of traffic jams, than Congress, which was favored by only 34 percent\n\n-- 56 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of this dental procedure than Congress, which was favored by only 32 percent\n\n-- 58 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of this invasive procedure than Congress, which was favored by only 31 percent\n\nThe PPP surveys didn\u2019t ask about herpes. It did ask, however, about gonorrhea. And Congress was still less popular than that venereal disease. A spokesman for the company that produced Schwarzenegger\u2019s video pointed to a 2011 CNN op-ed where comedian and radio show host Dean Obeidallah claimed Congress was less popular than herpes, without citing evidence.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger recently claimed: \"Here are some of the things that are more popular than Congress: hemorrhoids, Nickelback, traffic jams, root canals, colonoscopies, herpes. Even herpes, they couldn\u2019t beat herpes in the polls.\"\n\nSurveys by the Public Policy Polling mostly back-up Schwarzenegger\u2019s dramatic claim. It should be noted, however, that the polls were conducted about four years ago and don\u2019t include a comparison of Congress to herpes. Congress\u2019 overall approval rating has remained in the dumps since that time, rising only slightly from 8 percent to 11 percent. It\u2019s disapproval rating has, however, shrunk somewhat from 85 percent to 68 percent.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
