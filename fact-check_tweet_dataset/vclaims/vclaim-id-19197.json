The message claims that two women were caught by locals in Pali\u2019s Housing Board, Rajasthan. They had kidnapped three children but people intervened and handed one of the kidnappers to the police. The other one fled. The message warns this gang is named \u2018Mummy Mido\u2019 and they are scattered across Pali.\n\nA Facebook user Shubham Badgujar shared a photograph of the same girl.\n\nAlt News performed a Google search with the keywords \u201c\u0939\u093e\u0909\u0938\u093f\u0902\u0917 \u092c\u094b\u0930\u094d\u0921 \u092c\u091a\u094d\u091a\u093e \u091a\u094b\u0930\u201d and found an August 20 report by Dainik Bhaskarwhich said that the incident took place on August 18 when a minor girl was interrogated by locals in Pali, Rajasthan on false suspicions of being child kidnapper.\n\nAccording to Dainik Jagran, the girl hails from Madhya Pradesh and her father was married to two women. After his death, the girl\u2019s birth mother married another man and left the child with the stepmother. A friend of the stepmother, Deepika, who used to conduct illegal marriages, entrapped the girl and got her married to two different men \u2013 one from Jodhpur and the other from Ratlam. Deepika was taking the girl to get her married a third time \u2013 to a man from Housing Board, Pali \u2013 when they lost their way and were unable to find the man\u2019s house. This was late in the evening and a few men spotted unidentified women roaming in their locality. Suspecting them to be child-kidnappers, the men surrounded them. Deepika and the others accompanying her fled in the middle of the commotion while the minor girl was left behind. Later, the police searched for Deepika and her accomplices in hotels and bus and railway stations but were unable to find them.\n\nHousing Board police inspector Govindan and his team rescued the girl and a case of kidnapping and human trafficking has been registered at the direction of the child welfare committee.\n\nIn a conversation with Alt News, inspector in-charge Govindan said, \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a child kidnapper. She was a 17-year-old who was trapped by a middleman who had brought the girl to the area to wed her off. She is from Bhopal, MP. We have informed her mother but she hasn\u2019t come to take her yet. The girl is lodged at a child welfare home in Jodhpur. We are on the lookout for the woman who brought her here. A case has been registered against the woman under JJ Act.\u201d\n\nA minor, who was a victim of trafficking, was hounded by a group of men on false suspicions of being a child-lifter.
