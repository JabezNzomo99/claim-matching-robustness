If you include money given to super PACs backing Clinton, the fossil fuel industry has given more than $4.5 million in support of Clinton\u2019s bid.\u201d\n\nThis all started when a Greenpeace activist approached Clinton on a rope line to ask her to \u201creject fossil-fuel money in the future\u201d in her campaign. As a matter of law, campaigns are prohibited from taking money directly from corporations, though the Clinton campaign has not received money from oil-industry PACs either.\n\nAs Clinton noted in her angry response, she does get money from people who work at oil companies. (These calculations involve people who contribute at least $200 and provide an occupation or employer.) According to the Center for Responsive Politics, as of March 21, the Clinton campaign has received nearly $308,000 from individuals in the oil and gas industry. The Sanders campaign has received nearly $54,000.\n\nIf you include contributions from outside groups supporting a candidate, Clinton\u2019s total increases slightly to $333,000, compared to Sanders\u2019 $54,000. Compared to Republicans, Democrats have received just a pittance from the fossil-fuel industry: 2.3 percent of oil and gas contributions in this election cycle. That should be no surprise, given that both Clinton and Sanders have been critical of the oil and gas industry \u2014 and have targeted it for higher taxes or reduced loopholes.\n\nBut the Sanders campaign has its own math, which is borrowed from a Greenpeace analysis. As noted in the campaign statement, the Sanders campaign is counting money raised by lobbyists with ties to fossil-fuel companies. Greenpeace tracked nearly $1.5 million in bundled and direct donations from lobbyists currently registered as lobbying for the fossil-fuel industry. (Lobbyists who directly work for such companies would have been counted in the direct contributions of $308,000.)\n\nThen another $3.25 million in donations were directed by such lobbyists to Priorities USA, a Super PAC backing Clinton, Greenpeace claimed. We should note that under the law Clinton cannot coordinate with the Super PAC so she has no control over these donations. (Apparently, this figure reflects funds provided by just two individuals with somewhat tenuous links to fossil fuels.)\n\nSo that adds up to more than $4.5 million. That\u2019s certainly a bigger number than $333,000, but it\u2019s still only 2 percent of the total contributions received by Clinton and outside groups backing her. Indeed, the Center for Responsive Politics does not list oil and gas as one of top 20 industries contributing to Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nThere\u2019s a further problem with this calculation. Greenpeace counts all of the money raised or contributed by lobbyists as \u201coil/gas industry\u201d funds, but these lobbyists have many other clients besides the oil industry. Ben Klein, one of the lobbyists highlighted in the Greenpeace report, also lobbies for American Airlines, Cigna, and Hearst, according to the lobbying disclosure database, so in theory his contributions to the Clinton campaign could also be labeled as funds for airline, insurance or media industry.\n\nCRP is generally considered the gold standard for tracking campaign contributions, but the Sanders campaign rejects its method of counting. \u201cWhen it comes to looking at how much a campaign has received from the fossil fuel industry, we believe that Greenpeace is the gold standard,\u201d said senior adviser Warren Gunnels.\n\n\u201cSen. Sanders made a pledge with Greenpeace to return any fossil fuel money from their PACs, their executives, and their lobbyists if it is brought to our attention,\u201d Gunnels added. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to receive a small donation from an office clerk at a fossil fuel company. It\u2019s quite another to have fossil fuel lobbyists who are fighting for legislation to advance their interests bundle money for her campaign.\u201d\n\nGenerally, the Sanders campaign has suggested, without quite saying it, that Clinton\u2019s votes and actions as a lawmaker and secretary of state have been influenced by campaign contributions. But Gunnels provided a list of examples that he said showed the \u201cundue influence fossil fuel money has on the political process.\u201d\n\nThe Sanders campaign is exaggerating the contributions that Clinton has received from the oil and gas industry. In the context of her overall campaign, the contributions are hardly significant. It\u2019s especially misleading to count all of the funds raised by lobbyists with multiple clients as money \u201cgiven\u201d by the fossil-fuel industry.", "lang": "en"}
