The picture is actually a screengrab from a video of a Koran recitation contest organized by the Islamic State organization that has been circulating since at least 2013.\n\n\u201cTo all you misguided, uninformed liberal \u2018women\u2019 demonstrating in favor of embracing Islam, this young lady is being sold into sexual slavery as a child bride. She is a Christian. She watched her father beheaded and her mother raped. Where is her safe place?,\u201d says the text written on the picture shared 17,000 times on Facebook.\n\nThe video from which the screengrab has been taken is also available on Facebook and an Arabic-speaking AFP journalist reviewed the footage and confirmed that the girl is reciting chapter 112 of the Koran in a competition.\n\n\u201cShe made some errors so the man helps her, and he says, \u2018Ma sha Allah (Bravo), can you give me two other chapters?\u2019. She recites the chapter 113 and the man asks the crowd, \u2018Who is the winner?\u2019 Apparently the girl wasn\u2019t happy after the crowd's answer, so she started to cry,\u201d the AFP journalist said.\n\nHere is a screengrab from earlier in the video, before the girl made the mistake.\n\nHere is a screengrab from later in the video, after she made the mistake.\n\nSimilar videos featuring the same man can be found on YouTube and were presumably shot in Aleppo, Syria in 2013.\n\nAlthough this specific image does not portray a young girl being sold as a child bride, one in five girls aged 20-24 in the world have been married before the age of 18, according to UNICEF.", "lang": "en"}
