An analysis by the Parliamentary Budget Office on the 2016 budget changes for families, including the child benefit, found that families with two kids and a combined income of $74,000 or $89,000 will have around $2,000 to $850 more in disposable income, respectively. Those in lower income brackets can receive more, up to a maximum of $6,400 per child under the age of six.\n\nAsked what the money should buy, Trudeau told the CBC, \u201cwe know that people are going to spend it on healthier groceries, on school supplies, on summer camp for kids.\u201d\n\nDo we know what they\u2019ll spend it on?\n\nCanadians might spend tax benefit money on intended things like healthy groceries. Or they might spend it on unintended things like beer and popcorn. It\u2019s also possible that we don\u2019t know anything about spending habits and Trudeau is only talking about what he wants to see happen.\n\nThe first scenario is mostly correct. There is research providing evidence on how Canadian families spend income from tax benefits. It shows they buy things that contribute to children\u2019s wellbeing.\n\nA 2015 study, published by the University of Toronto\u2019s Rotman School of Management, looked at how Canadian families spend additional income from tax benefits. Researchers analyzed 12 years of family spending in four main areas of education, health care, \u201cstability\u201d spending like rent and food, and \u201crisky\u201d spending like alcohol and tobacco. They looked at income received from the old National Child Benefit and Canadian Child Tax Benefit, both replaced by the new Canada Child Benefit.\n\nThe evidence tells the same story as Trudeau. Researchers of the study write, \u201cfamilies appear to be quite sophisticated in the way they spend their benefit income. They are purchasing more basic necessities, and as their resources increase, they are directing increasingly more of the money towards those items that directly affect learning, such as educational tools.\u201d\n\nKevin Milligan, one of the study\u2019s three authors and an economics professor at the University of British Columbia, said that in particular, the evidence suggested higher spending on computers, food, recreation, transportation, and rent. It found lower spending on alcohol and tobacco.\n\nThere are not many other studies in Canada to back this one up. However, the same authors are behind complementary studies, and research from other countries arrives at similar conclusions. One US-based study found higher family income from tax credits contributed to higher reading and math achievements. As one possible explanation why, the authors wrote that because tax credit payments \u201cdepend explicitly on having children in the household, families may feel some obligation to spend it on their children.\u201d\n\nTrudeau could be accused of being creative with the purchase details (summer camp versus general recreation), but overall, he\u2019s right. The claim that families spend their payments in intended ways fits the evidence.\n\nSee how we score.", "lang": "en"}
