This time on free school meals. That was the right thing to do, and it is vital to the 1.3 million children who will benefit. \u201cA report last week from the government's Social Mobility Commission concluded that there are now 600,000 more children living in relative poverty than in 2012. The report went on to say child poverty rates are projected to increase to 5.2 million by 2022.\u201d Boris Johnson: \u201cHe's completely wrong in what he says about poverty. Absolute poverty, relative poverty have both declined under this government and there are hundreds of thousands, I think 400,000 fewer families living in poverty now than there were in 2010.\u201d\n\nAt this week\u2019s Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson and Labour leader Keir Starmer appeared to quote contradictory figures about poverty in the UK.\n\nWhile it\u2019s clear from the exchanges what source Mr Starmer was using, it\u2019s unclear what measure of poverty the Prime Minister was referring to when he said that it was down 400,000 since 2010, or whether he was talking about child poverty\u2014as Mr Starmer had been\u2014or overall poverty. We\u2019ve asked Downing Street for more information.\n\nKeir Starmer correctly quotes poverty figures from a government report\u2014but they don't reflect the whole picture\n\nMr Johnson is incorrect to say that Keir Starmer is completely wrong about poverty. Mr Starmer\u2019s figures are taken directly from a report by the government\u2019s Social Mobility Commission (SMoC).\n\nThe SMoC uses government data on people living in low-income households as a measure of poverty, which shows that, since 2011/12 and up to 2018/19, the number of children in relative poverty has risen by about 600,000.\n\nThis is the number of children living in households where the income after housing costs is less than 60% of the national median average.\n\nIt\u2019s worth saying that there are a lot of different measures of poverty and this is not necessarily the best one. For example, it doesn\u2019t consider costs not related to housing that might affect a household\u2019s income, such as childcare. In other words, it\u2019s not a definitive figure for what\u2019s been happening to child poverty, regardless of the fact that the SMoC and Labour have chosen to highlight it.\n\nWe\u2019ve written about the different ways you can measure poverty before.\n\nMr Starmer also claimed that child poverty was projected to rise to 5.2 million by 2022. This is also from the SMoC report, which seems to quote estimates based on projections made by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) in 2017. The IFS projected that child poverty would rise from 30% in 2015/16 to 37% in 2021/22. But if the projections had played out for real, then we\u2019d expect child poverty to be at around 35% by now. Given that relative child poverty is still 30% (unchanged since 2015/16), we don\u2019t think these projections are still valid.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s figures don\u2019t refute Mr Starmer\u2019s, but there are measures which back the government up\n\nAfter saying Mr Starmer was wrong, Mr Johnson said that absolute poverty and relative poverty are both down \u201cunder this government.\u201d By this we presume the Prime Minister was either talking about the change since 2009/10 (the last year of the Labour government) or the change since 2010/11 (the first year of the Coalition government).\n\nThe exact picture depends on the measure you look at.\n\nGovernment figures show that relative low income was at the same rate in 2018/19 (22% of the population) as in 2009/10 and slightly higher than it was in 2010/11. Meanwhile absolute low income fell by one percentage point (to 20%) comparing to either 2009/10 or 2010/11. All these figures are after taking housing costs into account.\n\nIn terms of numbers of people, relative low income was higher by about one million compared to 2009/10, or 1.5 million comparing to 2010/11. Absolute low income was at very similar levels.\n\nRelative poverty as measured by the Social Metrics Commission (an independent research body set up to create a new measure of poverty, not to be confused with the Social Mobility Commission we mentioned above), shows about 600,000 fewer people are in poverty in 2017/18 (the latest year\u2019s data) compared to 2009/10. Measuring since 2010/11, the fall is closer to 300,000.\n\nMr Johnson also claimed that there are 400,000 fewer families living in poverty than in 2010. The Labour shadow minister for child poverty strategy said after the session that the Prime Minister was wrong about child poverty, seemingly referring to this exchange. This is also how the Independent appeared to interpret this exchange.\n\nMr Johnson didn\u2019t actually specify he was talking about \u201cchild poverty\u201d though, even though this is what Mr Starmer had been asking about.\n\nWe\u2019ve already fact checked a similar claim Mr Johnson made before when he explicitly claimed that child poverty is down 400,000, and found this to be incorrect. At the moment, the main measures of child poverty or children in low income households show anything from a fall of about 100,000 to a rise of 600,000 since 2009/10 or 2010/11 (the same figure that the SMoC featured in their report).\n\nIf Mr Johnson is talking about overall poverty here, then this claim is a fair one, on balance, although it still only gives part of the picture. The figures from the Social Metrics Commission which we mentioned above roughly back him up, though the government\u2019s low income figures don\u2019t.\n\nThe Social Metrics Commission\u2019s measure is probably a better measure of poverty, as we\u2019ve discussed before.We\u2019ve assumed Mr Johnson is talking about individuals in poverty rather than \u201cfamilies\u201d as he specified during exchanges, as these are usually how poverty figures are provided.\n\nIt\u2019s correct that at least 1.3 million children will benefit from the government\u2019s new policy on free school meals\n\nKeir Starmer also said during the exchanges that 1.3 million children will benefit from the government\u2019s recent u-turn over giving free school meals to children over the summer holidays, off the back of a campaign by England footballer Marcus Rashford.\n\n1.3 million children in England were eligible for and claiming free school meals, in 2019. Additionally the government has extended eligibility for its voucher scheme to children of groups that have \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d, people in the UK with temporary immigration status. So the potential beneficiaries of the government\u2019s decision to continue the scheme over the summer may be higher than 1.3 million.\n\nThere additionally may be some children who are eligible for free school meals but do not claim them.", "lang": "en"}
