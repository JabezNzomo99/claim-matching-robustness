Some social media users are applauding what they claim to be a historic and groundbreaking decision by Iceland. Netizens are also praising the country's parliament for voting to classify \"all religions as weapons of mass destruction\".\n\nFacebook user Rajiv Tyagi is among many others who shared the article captioned: \"By and by, more nations will see the light... The last to see the light will be the jaahil followers of Islam and Hinduism...\"\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this claim to be wrong. The story is a satire that social media users have mistaken for real news.\n\n\n\nTyagi claims to be a former fighter pilot of the Indian Air Force and has around 67,000 people followers on Facebook.\n\nThe post was circulated on other social media platforms too.\n\nAll of them have quoted and shared an article posted by website patheos.com.\n\nThe introductory paragraph of the article says, \"Iceland's parliament voted to classify all religions as weapons of mass destruction. Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, and Buddhism are now in the same category as nuclear weapons, mustard gas, and weaponized biological agents.\"\n\nIn the first line itself, the word 'voted' is hyperlinked. When you click on it, another page opens which clearly states that the story is a satire.\n\nDespite an extensive search, we couldn't find any such news report in mainstream media.", "lang": "en"}
