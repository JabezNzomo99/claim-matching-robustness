Meanwhile tax payers contribute \u00a34m to subsidise food and drink in the houses of Parliament for MPs.\u201d\n\nAnother, shared over 2,000 times, carries a picture of Boris Johnson and says \u201cAs a big thank you to the senior citizens who voted for me, I\u2019m going to cut \u00a370 per week from your state pension. The \u00a370 per week allowance for adult dependents is being scrapped from April.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that a benefit received by around 11,000 pensioners, which is worth up to \u00a370 a week, is being abolished. But the law was passed under Labour over a decade ago. It\u2019s accurate that the total cost of the indirect subsidy to both the House of Commons and Lords catering services is just under \u00a34 million.\n\nWhat benefit is being abolished?\n\nFrom 6 April 2020, adult dependency increase (ADI) payments, which some get as part of their pension, will end. In May 2019 this was paid to just under 11,000 pensioners with financially dependent partners and was worth up to \u00a370 a week .\n\nAbolishing ADI was not introduced by Mr Johnson, but was part of reforms set out in the Pensions Act 2007, signed into law under Labour.\n\nADI payments are paid in addition to the state pension, to people with partners who are financially dependent on them, and who are often not yet of pension age.\n\nThe payments originated in the post-war period, when households with single breadwinners were more usual. The Pensions Act 2007 abolished these payments, and since 6 April 2010 no new claims have been accepted for the payment. Those already in receipt of the money were given another 10 years of the scheme, before it finishes on 6 April 2020.\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) confirmed to us that there were 10,817 people in receipt of ADI payments in May 2019 worth up to \u00a370 a week.\n\nA DWP spokesperson said that once ADI payments end, those already in receipt of means-tested benefits like Universal Credit or Pension Credit will receive an increase to off-set the loss, while those who do not receive benefits may become eligible to apply for them when they no longer receive ADI.\n\nBut there are reasons to believe that at least some pensioners who were in receipt of ADI payments may struggle to claim the money in other ways once the payments end.\n\nFrom 15 May 2019, couples who aren\u2019t both over the State Pension age cannot make a new claim for pension credit, unless one is receiving housing benefit for pensioners.\n\nChanges to Universal Credit mean a couple where one person is below the State Pension age are considered working-age and will share a standard monthly allowance of \u00a3498.89. It can only be claimed if the younger partner is eligible.\n\nSteve Webb, who was minister for pensions in the Coalition government from 2010 to 2015 and is a former Liberal Democrat MP, told Full Fact he was \u201cdeeply sceptical\u201d that the loss of ADI payments would be offset with other benefits.\n\nHe said recent changes to pension credit mean any mixed-age couples who were not already receiving the payment \u201chave little chance of claiming it when their income drops \u00a370 a week\u201d, while the Universal Credit rate is \u201cso low\u201d that that they may not \u201cget much even if they qualified\u201d.\n\nHowever, it is not right to suggest all pensioners will be \u00a370 per week worse off, given how few receive this benefit.\n\nHow much is spent on catering in Parliament?\n\nOne of the Facebook posts also claims that \u201ctax payers contribute \u00a34 million to subside food and drink in the Houses of Parliament for MPs.\u201d This is broadly accurate.\n\nWe have written before that Parliament\u2019s catering services are not directly subsidised, but they do run at a loss and so public money is effectively spent to subsidise catering overall. (Although this catering is not exclusively for MPs: it is for all parliamentary staff, pass-holders and visitors. In addition to the 650 MPs, there are about 14,500 other pass-holders and an unknown number of visitors who can use the House of Commons catering facilities.)\n\nIn 2018/19, the House of Commons spent \u00a32.6 million on catering and retail services, while the House of Lords spent \u00a31.2 million, totalling \u00a33.8 million.", "lang": "en"}
