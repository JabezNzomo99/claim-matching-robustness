The field hospital only helped treat New York City coronavirus patients.\n\nThe long text post credits President Donald Trump with the alleged rescue of the abused children from underground captivity, where they had purportedly been \u201ckept as sex slaves\u201d since birth.\n\n\u201cThese precious children have been kept there as sex slaves from birth. For sexual satanic abuse rituals and for human doping to use their blood for drinking in satanic rituals for the very elite,\u201d reads the post, in all capital letters. \u201cThe pedophile rings are being brought down across America now as we speak, where hundreds of these underground tunnels have been found and blown up after all the children have been taken out.\u201d\n\nIt further claims the Central Park tent hospital run by nonprofit Samaritan\u2019s Purse housed the rescued children.

The Daily Caller News Foundation found no news reporting to corroborate any of the claims made in the post. Kaitlyn Lahm, a Samaritan\u2019s Purse spokeswoman, told PolitiFact that \u201cthese are totally false rumors.\u201d\n\nThe Central Park field hospital received extensive media coverage during its roughly one month of operation. The facility treated nearly 200 coronavirus patients, who have all since been discharged, in partnership with the Mount Sinai Health System, according to the Samaritan\u2019s Purse website.\n\n\u201cWe worked hand-in-hand with Mount Sinai Hospital to bring desperately needed surge capacity,\u201d Lahm told PolitiFact. \u201cAll patients treated at the Emergency Field Hospital were transferred from Mount Sinai to Samaritan\u2019s Purse.\u201d\n\nThe field hospital would have been logistically incapable of housing \u201cthousands of babies and children,\u201d as it was a \u201c14-tent, 68-bed respiratory care unit,\u201d per the Samaritan\u2019s Purse website.\n\nThe claims made in the Facebook post appear to reference a QAnon conspiracy theory, which \u201ccenters on the baseless belief that Trump is waging a secret campaign against enemies in the \u2018deep state\u2019 and a child sex trafficking ring run by satanic pedophiles and cannibals,\u201d according to The Associated Press.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
