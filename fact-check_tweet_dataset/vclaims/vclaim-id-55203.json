The original shows de Rothschild standing in front of a painting depicting horses.\n\nDe Rothschild runs a private investment firm with her husband, Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, a member of the Rothschild banking family. The wealthy family has long been the subject of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, including those that baselessly link them to satanism.\n\nThe viral image seems to reference such theories. In the photo, de Rothschild appears to pose by a painting of a demonic creature eating people. The caption reads, \u201cLynn Rothschild and her eating babies decor.\u201d\n\nBut a reverse image search reveals the image has been digitally altered. The original photo can be found in a 2014 photo gallery that accompanied a Harper\u2019s Bazaar profile of de Rothschild and the Ascott Estate, the \u201ccountryside residence of the de Rothschild family\u201d in England, according to its website. The painting shows five horses, not a demonic creature eating people.\n\n\u201cThe main house at Ascott contains Rothschild family heirlooms and art, including the painting Five Brood Mares at the Duke of Cumberland\u2019s Stud Farm, by George Stubbs,\u201d reads the Harper\u2019s Bazaar caption.

For instance, a Twitter user shared a doctored version that showed a red devil sticking its tongue out in 2018. Another edited version showed President Donald Trump.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
