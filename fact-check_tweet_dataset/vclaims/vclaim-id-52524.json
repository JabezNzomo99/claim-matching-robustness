And I think they told me yesterday a number -- if you add up the rest of the world, we\u2019ve done more testing,\u201d Trump said during a meeting with New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy on April 30, 2020.\n\nTrump repeated the claim on Twitter on May 4, writing: \u201cWe have great testing capacity, and have performed 6.5 million tests, which is more than every country in the world, combined!\u201d\n\nThe same claim has been made elsewhere on Twitter.\n\nTrump\u2019s figure was lower than that from Johns Hopkins University, which put the number of test results at more than seven million at the time.\n\nBut as of May 4, Germany had conducted more than 2.7 million tests, Italy nearly 1.5 million, Spain more than 1.3 million and Turkey more than 1.1 million, while Britain had tested around one million people, combining for a total of more than 7.6 million -- above that given for the United States by Trump and Johns Hopkins.\n\nAnd other countries whose citizens have been hit by the virus -- such as India and South Korea -- are carrying out testing as well.\n\nCOVID-19 -- which is caused by the novel coronavirus -- has killed more than 257,000 people and devastated the global economy.\n\nWhile Trump has routinely praised his administration\u2019s handling of the crisis, he has been criticized for statements he made that downplayed the danger of the virus, such as comparing it to the common flu or saying that the risk it posed to the American people was \u201cvery low.\u201d\n\nTrump also claimed during the meeting that \u201cthe last administration left us nothing\u201d and that \u201cwe started off with bad, broken tests and obsolete tests.\u201d\n\nHe repeated this claim when pressed by a journalist on how this could be true since the virus is new, saying: \u201cWe had tests that were obsolete. We had tests that didn\u2019t take care of people.\u201d\n\nBut the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 \u201cwere unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019,\u201d according to the World Health Organization.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 410 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus crisis.
