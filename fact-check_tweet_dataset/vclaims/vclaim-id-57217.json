PolitiFact New Jersey has found legal documents that say otherwise.\n\n \n\n The ACLU on Sept. 9, 2010, filed a petition with the Justice Department. The document\u2019s first sentence reads \"The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey of New Jersey (\"ACLU-NJ\" or \"Petitioner\") respectfully requests that the Special Litigation Section, acting pursuant to its authority under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14141, commence an investigation into the Newark, New Jersey Police Department (\"NPD\").\"\n\n \n\n After seven paragraphs summarizing alleged abuses by the Newark Police Department, the petition then states \"On behalf of the people who live in, work in, and visit the City of Newark, New Jersey, we implore the Civil Rights Division to investigate the NPD.\"\n\n \n\n Use of a federal monitor is mentioned as an option in addition to an investigation, in the final pages of the petition:\n\n \n\n \"For all of the foregoing reasons, the Petitioners respectfully ask the United States Department of Justice, Special Litigation Section, to forthwith commence an investigation into the Newark, New Jersey Police Department. Thereafter, DOJ should impose remedial steps upon the NPD, including but not limited to: (a) alterations to the citizen complaints and internal affairs processes; (b) an enhanced risk management system; (c) enhanced training; (d) alterations to the disciplinary process; and (e) an independent monitor to oversee compliance.\"\n\n \n\n PolitiFact New Jersey asked the ACLU about Booker\u2019s comments on the radio broadcast.\n\n \n\n \"It\u2019s simply not true,\" said Alexander Shalom, the ACLU\u2019s policy counsel. \"The petition is pretty clear in its language. The first page of the petition requests the Special Litigation Section commence an investigation into the police department.\"\n\n \n\n So what does Booker have to say about this? He declined to comment to PolitiFact New Jersey, according to spokeswoman Anne Torres.\n\n \n\n To review: The mayor tried to downplay the controversy by saying the ACLU called for a federal monitor of the Newark Police Department instead of requesting an investigation. Yet the first sentence of the ACLU\u2019s petition to the Department of Justice requests an investigation.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "lang": "en"}
