The result has been a cascade of competing assertions, estimates and statistics about the costs and effects of what would amount to a fundamental overhaul of the size and role of the government and the way Americans receive care. Here\u2019s a fact check of some of these claims. Studies diverge on the cost of Medicare for all because of different assumptions. \u201cShe\u2019s making it up. Look, nobody thinks it\u2019s $20 trillion. It\u2019s between $30 trillion and $40 trillion, every major independent study that\u2019s gone out there that\u2019s taken a look at this\u201d \n\n\u2014 Joseph R. Biden Jr., in a November interview on PBS \u201cBernie has said that it will cost $31 trillion, he\u2019s come up with 16 of that $31 trillion, and that\u2019s half.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, in an October interview on CNN The Medicare for all proposal released by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts last week would cost the federal government an additional $20.5 trillion over a decade, and she would fund it in large part through new taxes on business and the wealthy. Unlike Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders has not committed to funding proposals, but he has released several \u201coptions to finance Medicare for all\u201d \u2014 characterized as discussion starters \u2014 that would generate about $16.2 trillion over 10 years.\n\nMr. Biden and Mr. Bennet have a point that several major studies have found higher additional federal expenditures than Ms. Warren\u2019s estimate or Mr. Sanders\u2019 revenue options: $34 trillion over a decade, according to the liberal Urban Institute; $32.6 trillion, according to the conservative Mercatus Center; and $24.7 trillion, according to an estimate by Kenneth E. Thorpe, a health care economist at Emory University. And the RAND Corporation, a research group, projected an increase of $2.4 trillion in 2019 alone . \n\n\n\nBut lower estimates exist as well. A University of Massachusetts at Amherst study suggested the number was $13.5 trillion while Gerald Friedman, a health economist at the same university who did not contribute to that study, said that a single-payer system would need to come up with about $9.6 trillion more. Apart from examining different time frames, such diverging estimates result from the unpredictable nature of projecting how Medicare for all would work in practice. How much fees paid to doctors and hospitals, prescription drugs prices and administrative costs could be reduced \u2014 and how many more people would become insured and use health care services \u2014 will all affect a single-payer system\u2019s bottom line. Ms. Warren assumes, for example, cuts of 70 percent in prescription drug prices and 2.3 percent in administrative costs while the Urban Institute projected reductions of 40 percent in drug costs and 6 percent administrative costs. \u201cFirst of all, if we do nothing in terms of the health care, I think the estimate is, we will be spending as a nation $50 trillion.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Mr. Sanders, in an October interview on PBS The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projects that under the current system, total health care spending, including both private insurance and government programs, will reach a little over $47 trillion from 2018 to 2027. But that number is not completely comparable to the $30-some trillion estimates for Medicare for all. That is because those estimates reflect federal government spending, not total health care spending, under Medicare for all.\n\nMr. Sanders\u2019s broader point \u2014 that a such a system is less expensive than the status quo \u2014 is up for debate. The Urban Institute found that total health spending would reach $52 trillion from 2020 to 2029 under existing law versus $59 trillion under Medicare for all. The RAND Corporation estimated the status quo costing $3.8 trillion versus $3.9 trillion for single-payer in 2019. On the flip side, the University of Massachusetts study projected that national health expenditures would be $5.1 trillion lower over 10 years under Medicare for all. Mr. Friedman estimated $5.5 trillion to $12.5 trillion in savings. Claims about cost or savings for consumers can obscure details that complicate the argument. \u201cIf a fireman and a schoolteacher are making 100,000 bucks a year, their taxes are going to go up about 10 grand.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Mr. Biden, at a Democratic debate in October\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd he does that by taxing people that are making less than $30,000 a year.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Mr. Bennet, in the interview with CNN These statements refer to a 7.5 percent payroll tax and a 4 percent premium tax based on income, two financing mechanisms listed by Mr. Sanders. But these taxes are merely options. Moreover, the statements omit key details about how these potential taxes could work. A $7,500 payroll tax and a $4,000 premium tax for Mr. Biden\u2019s hypothetical household making $100,000 a year would still lower be than the $20,576 average annual family premium on employer-sponsored plans in 2019. (Employers picked up the bulk of the tab, $14,561 on average.) Economists generally agree that employers pass on the cost of health benefits to workers in the form of lower wages, and payroll taxes also come out of paychecks. So it is theoretically possible that under Medicare for all, a family would get a $20,000 raise as they and their employers no longer had to pay for premiums, while their additional health care taxes would amount to less than $20,000, said Gerard F. Anderson, a professor of health policy at Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\u201cBut it is also likely that the company would not give them a $20,000 raise,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile the average is $20,000, not everyone receives this in benefits. We simply cannot make that projection without a fully fleshed out financing plan.\u201d Under a single-payer plan, said Linda J. Blumberg of the Urban Institute, the wages for workers who currently do not receive employer-sponsored health care, however, may decrease. \u201cIt puts $11 trillion back in the pockets of American families, and doesn\u2019t raise taxes on the middle class by even a cent.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Ms. Warren, in a Twitter post in November\n\n\n\n\u201cThe average American will pay less for health care under Medicare for all.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Mr. Sanders, in the PBS interview Whereas Mr. Sanders has said taxes will increase for average families under Medicare for all and Ms. Warren has based her plan on a promise to avoid additional taxes on the middle class, their statements make a similar point: Most Americans would see savings under Medicare for all. But both of their claims require additional context. Ms. Warren does not include any middle-class tax increases in her plan but would charge employers a tax equal to 98 percent of what they were previously paying for employee health care. Unlike Mr. Sanders\u2019s suggested payroll tax, this tax is not proportional to workers\u2019 pay and thus would have regressive effects, Howard Gleckman of the Tax Policy Center and Matt Bruenig of the progressive People\u2019s Policy Project have argued. Since employers would essentially pay the same amount for health care under Ms. Warren\u2019s plan than under the status quo, that hypothetical household making $100,000 is also theoretically less likely to see a pay raise under the employer tax than under a payroll tax. (Nonetheless, Ms. Warren assumes that higher take-home pay is guaranteed, because employees would no longer be paying a share of health premiums or contributing to health savings accounts, and includes $1.15 trillion in additional tax revenue in her calculations.) While Mr. Sanders does not commit to specific financing mechanisms, those proposed by his 2016 campaign would leave the program $16.6 trillion short, according to the Urban Institute, raising the possibility of additional costs to families. Mr. Thorpe found that 72 percent of families would see savings under that 2016 plan. But when Mr. Thorpe modeled higher taxes to achieve a deficit-neutral plan, it resulted in 71 percent of families paying more.\n\nOther researchers have been more optimistic that finding ways to pay the full cost of the program and savings to families are both achievable. The University of Massachusetts study determined that low- and middle-income families would pay less for health care. Under Mr. Friedman\u2019s proposal, households with incomes of $30,000 to $130,000 would receive the greatest savings. Claims that single-payer would lead to the widespread collapse of hospitals or would cause seniors to lose their care are unsupported. \u201cGovernment programs \u2014 Medicaid and Medicare \u2014 don\u2019t pay the cost of health care. So if we only had those as our payers, most of the hospitals in this country would close because the reimbursement rates are too low to support the operations in the hospitals.\u201d\n\n\u2014 John Delaney, the former congressman from Maryland and a Democratic presidential candidate, in an October interview on C-SPAN A spokesman for Mr. Delaney cited three sources for his assertion: a report from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services noting that two-thirds of hospitals lose money on Medicare services; a New York Times article on the financial toll Medicare for all would place on some hospitals, and Mr. Delaney\u2019s personal experiences visiting rural hospitals. While the evidence suggests that Medicare for all would adversely affect some hospitals, it does not prove Mr. Delaney\u2019s claim that \u201cmost\u201d in the United States would close under a single-payer system. The impact on hospitals also depends on what rates the new system would pay. If current reimbursement levels were maintained, annual revenue for hospitals could have a net decrease of 16 percent, or about $151 billion, in a Medicare for all system, estimated a 2019 article in JAMA; that could possibly lead to job losses of 800,000 to 1.5 million. Kevin Schulman, a physician and economist at Stanford University who helped write the article, cautioned that these findings did not reflect performance at individual hospitals. \u201cPredicting hospital closures from operating losses would be difficult because many hospitals have endowments that they can use to support themselves for some period of time despite a financial loss,\u201d he said. \u201cHospitals that do not have endowments would be at greater risk, but may still be able to operate despite financial losses.\u201d\n\nAnd if Medicare for all were phased in over time, the impact would be more blunted. \u201cThe hospitals would revise their cost structures,\u201d said Sherry Glied , a health economist at New York University. \u201cThat means that they would probably reduce some staffing \u2014 both administrative and clinical \u2014 slow investments in new technology, and stop building marble-paneled lobbies. Would that be terrible? Not sure.\u201d Moreover, a Medicare for all system would more likely pay hospitals at higher rates than current Medicare levels, said Mr. Anderson of Johns Hopkins. As an example, he pointed to Washington State\u2019s public option, which pays 60 percent more than Medicare rates. Legislation introduced in the House replaces existing Medicare payments with a new negotiated lump sum for each provider. Ms. Warren proposes to pay hospitals at about 10 percent more than current Medicare rates. \u201cUnder my Administration, Medicare Advantage premiums next year will be their lowest in the last 13 years. We are providing GREAT healthcare to our Seniors. We cannot let the radical socialists take that away through Medicare for All!\u201d \n\n\u2014 President Trump, in a tweet in October Medicare Advantage is a private alternative to traditional Medicare, run by companies but funded with government subsidies. They cover the same services as Medicare and often additional benefits. About a third of Medicare enrollees opt for this type of plan. Though Mr. Sanders\u2019s legislation would eliminate Medicare Advantage, current enrollees would receive more benefits under a single-payer system \u2014 contrary to Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that they would lose their coverage. On average, Medicare Advantage premiums cost $29 a month while Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan eliminates premiums and covers dental, vision and long-term care and hearing aids. Wealthier seniors may end up paying more under single-payer, Ms. Blumberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s all a matter of how the new taxes fall.\u201d Curious about the accuracy of a claim?
