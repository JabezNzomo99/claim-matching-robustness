We can settle it easily. Let\u2019s have a debate between the two of us. The two presidents. Let Nana Akufo-Addo come and sit down. Let me sit down and let\u2019s debate our records,\u201d he said.\n\nThe engagement was live-streamed on John Mahama\u2019s verified Facebook page and has 29,000 views with 1,200 comments at the time of publishing this report.\n\nVice President Mahamudu Bawumia has been making a strong case for government\u2019s investment in infrastructural development and why Ghanaians should renew their mandate in the upcoming December polls.\n\nAccording to him, the government has initiated 17,334 infrastructure projects in various parts of the country, 8,746 of them have been completed while the remaining are ongoing and citizens can independently track the progress of work on a dedicated website.\n\nGhana\u2019s Information Minister, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah and his deputy, Pius Enam Hadzide both labelled the letter as \u201cfake\u201d when contacted by GhanaFact.\n\nMeanwhile attempts to reach the Director of Communications at the Jubilee House, Eugene Arhin proved futile.\n\nGhanaFact rates the claim as false and the letter as fake.", "lang": "en"}
