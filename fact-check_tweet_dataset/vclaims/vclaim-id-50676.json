Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez say that images of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States \"incite violence against women of color.\" No, that's not true: The New York congresswoman, known in the media as AOC, did tell reporters in April 2019 that an \"incredibly upsetting\" front page image in the New York Post attacking Rep.
