There are 10 names from the period of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency:\n\nGoing down the list, one can see that three of the victims are not actually \u201cdiplomatic personnel,\u201d but worked for the Army, Navy or the Forest Service. But they are on the AFSA plaque so perhaps that\u2019s a debatable point. Two of the deaths resulted from the same attack, so the number of \u201cinstances\u201d total nine, not 10.\n\nBut that\u2019s obviously a bit nitpicky. There are two larger questions to consider: Were there actually \u201czero\u201d Republicans who expressed outrage? And is this even a relevant comparison?\n\nBut Green\u2019s death in a Pakistani church did prompt a congressional investigation and also resulted in a Government Accountability Office report that said the State Department had inadequate safeguards to protect officials when they were outside the embassy perimeter, such as in houses of worship. \u201cDespite recommendations by several panels since the late 1980\u2019s, programs to enhance security outside the embassy walls remain a porous patchwork,\u201d said Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), who presided over the hearing into the matter.\n\nThe other question is whether Clinton is comparing apples and oranges. He compares Benghazi to \u201cten different instances\u201d during Bush\u2019s presidency. Benghazi was a single event\u2014an attack on a diplomatic post in which four Americans died. Most of the deaths during Bush\u2019s presidency took place away from the embassy grounds.\n\nMoreover, to make an apples-to-apples comparison, one must look at all deaths from attacks during Obama\u2019s presidency. Besides the four killed in Benghazi (Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, Foreign Service Officer Sean Smith, CIA operatives Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods), these are names on the memorial plaque who did not die overseas from natural causes (heart attack) or events such as an earthquake or car accident:\n\n5. Terrence Barnich, deputy director of the State Department office that oversees U.S. reconstruction projects, killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq, 2009. (A Defense Department official working in the U.S. Embassy was also killed in the same attack, but there is no name on the plaque.)\n\nSo that adds up to at least eight dead in five instances. At this point in Bush\u2019s presidency, there was also eight dead, in seven different instances, as two of the deaths took place in the later half of Bush\u2019s second term.\n\nMatt McKenna, a spokesman for the former president, issued the following statement: \u201cWhat\u2019s most important is we learn from these losses rather than use them to score cheap political points or as a vehicle for gotcha journalism, as you\u2019re doing today.\u201d\n\nAt least one of the deaths led to congressional hearings and a government report. That\u2019s not the same level of attention as the myriad Benghazi probes, but it is more than zero. Moreover, in making his claim, Clinton ignores the similar one-off attacks that have killed diplomatic personnel during Obama\u2019s presidency, making it an unbalanced comparison.", "lang": "en"}
