Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said he was \u201cashamed to be a part of a task force that has become nothing more than an arm of the Trump Administration\u2019s propaganda machine,\u201d the article claims.\n\n\u201cI am resigning from my position as a member of the COVID-19 task force,\u201d Fauci allegedly said. \u201cAs I have done for decades, continue to work with the segments of our government that still prioritize the safety of Americans.\u201d\n\nWhile Fauci has been criticized by White House trade adviser Peter Navarro and others, there is currently no evidence he has resigned. Had the top White House coronavirus adviser resigned from the task force, major news outlets certainly would have covered it, yet none have.\n\nWhen asked if he would resign in an interview published July 15 by The Atlantic, Fauci said, \u201cNo. I think the problem is too important for me to get into those kinds of thoughts and discussions. I just want to do my job. I\u2019m really good at it. I think I can contribute. And I\u2019m going to keep doing it.\u201d\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who leads the coronavirus task force, also said that Fauci was a \u201cvalued member\u201d during a campaign press call, The Hill reported on July 15.
