The claim adds that the girl\u2019s naked corpse was found in a drain connected to his house. \u201cShe has been identified,\u201d it alleges.\n\nIn order to protect the identity of the minor, Alt News has not attached the screenshots of the viral posts.\n\nSeveral right-wing media websites such as Hindu Post (archive link), Sirf News (archive link), Best Hindi News (archive link) and National Dunia (report deleted) also shared the viral image of the minor claiming that she was found in the drain near Hussain\u2019s house.\n\nAlt News performed a reverse image search of the girl\u2019s photograph on Google along with appropriate keywords and found a February 21 report by Dainik Bhaskar.\n\nAccording to the report, a class 12 student was killed in a fire that broke out in her house when she was alone. The police speculated suicide after matchsticks were allegedly recovered from her residence. The girl\u2019s family members however refuted the suicide angle. The incident took place in Parsuliya Kalan, a village in Susner tehsil of Madhya Pradesh.\n\nAs per the article, the house burned down on February 20 however, SHO Susner Vivek Kanodi informed Alt News that the incident took place on February 19.\n\nAlt News performed another keyword search on YouTube and found a February 25 video by one Nitesh Sharma. At the 1:19 mark, Manish Jain, SDM Susner, stated that suspects named by the girl\u2019s father are being interrogated and the forensics team is analysing if the victim was raped or not.\n\nIn a telephonic conversation with Alt News, Sub Divisional Police Officer JP Rawat, who is a part of the special investigations team, said, \u201cAs per our investigation, the door was locked from inside. As a result, we suspect a case of suicide. However, the parents have named the boy next door as a suspect. We have arrested him and registered the case under abatement of suicide, section 306 of the Indian Penal Code. We are now waiting for forensic reports for further investigation.\u201d\n\nWhen questioned if the case has any links with Tahir Hussani, the officer said, \u201cClearly there is no link with Delhi riots. There is no Hindu-Muslim angle to this case whatsoever.\u201d\n\nTherefore several right-wing media outlets and social media users published a false and misleading claim about an incident from Madhya Pradesh and linked it with Delhi riots.", "lang": "en"}
