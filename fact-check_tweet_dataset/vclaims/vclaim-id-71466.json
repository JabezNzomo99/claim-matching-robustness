A spokesperson for the Madagascan president has refuted the claim.\n\nThe Instagram post features a photo of Rajoelina holding a Covid Organics bottle above text that reads, \u201cWHO Offered $20M Bribe To Poison COVID-19 Cure, Madagascar President Alleges.\u201d The post credits the Tanzania Perspective newspaper.\n\nRajoelina launched in April an herbal drink, Covid Organics, that he has claimed can prevent and cure COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. In response to the drink\u2019s launch, the WHO told BBC News in a statement that it does not recommend \u201cself-medication with any medicines \u2026 as a prevention or cure for COVID-19.\u201d\n\nSeveral African news websites, including The Zambian Observer, Elombah News and KanyiDaily.com, wrote about the alleged bribe, citing a May 14 print article from the Tanzania Perspective. Fahari Yetu, a Tanzania newspaper, claimed the Madagascan president made the allegation during a recent interview with the French media outlet France 24.\n\nRajoelina did have an interview with France 24 earlier in May. The Daily Caller News Foundation reviewed the entirety of the roughly 17-minute exclusive interview, which was translated into English and posted on France 24\u2019s official YouTube Channel, and found no mention of a bribe.\n\nBBC News, which wrote about the interview, did not mention the Madagascan president saying the WHO had offered him a bribe in its reporting.

Lova Ranoramoro, director of the presidential office, told AFP Fact Check, \u201cThe Madagascan presidency absolutely denies all these allegations.\u201d\n\nThe Tanzania Perspective has previously published inaccurate claims, according to Africa Check and AFP Fact Check.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
