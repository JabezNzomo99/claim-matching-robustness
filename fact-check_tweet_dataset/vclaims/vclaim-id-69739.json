This happened numerous times since 1918, and more recently in early 2006.\n\nThe current president, who regularly boasts his track record at a time when the American economy is in good shape, asserts that the GDP rate is \u201chigher\u201d than the unemployment rate in the country \u201cfor the first time in over 100 years.\u201d\n\nBy analyzing M. Trump\u2019s comparison of a quarterly data (GDP growth at an annual rate) with a monthly data (unemployment rate), we can see that his statement is still false, as shown by this AFP chart based on data by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, two reference institutions on employment and the economy.\n\nIn this chart, all red dots located above the blue curve represent quarters when the annual rate of GDP growth exceeded the monthly unemployment rate.\n\nThis scenario is currently happening for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis. Last time, throughout the first three months of 2006, the US unemployment rate swayed between 4.7 percent and 4.8 percent of the active population, while the GDP growth had reached 5.4 percent at a yearly rate.\n\nThis also occurred on several occasions during Bill Clinton\u2019s terms (1992-2000), and many times between 1948 and the early 1980s.\n\nOver the course of 1950, for instance, the quarterly growth rate of the American GDP swayed between 7.9 percent and 16.7 percent. Throughout the same time period, the unemployment rate decrease from 6.5 percent of the active population to 4.3 percent. Therefore, during that year, the US GDP growth was consistently higher than the unemployment rate in the nation.", "lang": "en"}
