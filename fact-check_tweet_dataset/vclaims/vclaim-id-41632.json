Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Brahma Kamal flowers bloom after many years due to less pollution during the lockdown. Fact: It is an old video. It was found to be on the internet at least since December 2017. Also, Brahma Kamal flowers usually bloom every year during June \u2013 September, and the flowers can be seen till mid-October. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched with the keywords, the same video was found in the search results. The video was found to be uploaded on YouTube in December 2017. So, the video was taken before the lockdown came into effect.\n\nBrahma Kamal (or Saussurea obvallata) is the State flower of Uttarakhand. On the \u2018ENVIS Centre on Floral Diversity\u2019 website, it can be read that \u2018it occurs in alpine meadows of the Himalayas, extending from Jammu and Kashmir to Arunachal Pradesh. It is also distributed in Bhutan, China, Nepal and Pakistan, at altitudes between 3700 and 4600 m\u2019. The Brahma Kamal flowers usually bloom every year during June \u2013 September. So, it is not true that the video shows flowers blooming after many years. More information regarding the flower can be read here, here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, an old video falsely shared as \u2018Brahma Kamal flowers bloom after many years due to less pollution during the lockdown\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
