Obamacare, as he met with representatives of the health-insurance industry.* Are 20 million Americans actually refusing to buy health insurance and instead pay a penalty?\n\nTrump often speaks without much nuance, but notice that he slipped in the qualifier \u201cor received an exemption.\u201d It\u2019s the kind of sly maneuver former president Barack Obama would do when he wanted to use a fishy number. (See this example when Obama earned Three Pinocchios for talking like a used-car salesman.)\n\nAccording to a Jan. 9, 2017, letter from IRS Commissioner John Koskinen to Congress, only 6.5 million taxpayers paid the so-called \u201cshared responsibility\u201d payments in 2015. That\u2019s actually a decrease from 2014, when 8 million taxpayers made a payment. The payments in 2015 totaled about $3 billion, with the average payment about $470.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that many people likely only paid a penalty for some months, not an entire year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that on average, about 3 million people will pay the penalty for being uninsured in any given month in 2016.\n\nSo how does Trump get up to 20 million? He\u2019s adding in people who received an exemption; that totaled 12.7 million taxpayers. That only adds up to 19.2 million, but Trump did say \u201cnearly 20 million.\u201d\n\nExemptions are granted for a number of reasons, but the most common one is that an individual has income below a certain threshold and lives in a state that did not expand the eligibility for Medicaid. (The law offered Medicaid to nearly all low-income individuals with incomes at or below 138 percent of poverty, or $27,821 for a family of three in 2016). The second most common exemption is if a citizen lives outside of the United States. People also do not need to pay a penalty if they would have had to pay more than 8.13 percent of their income (in 2016) to obtain health insurance.\n\nThis is where Trump\u2019s rhetoric gets misleading. \u201cThat\u2019s something that nobody has ever heard of or thought could happen, and they\u2019re actually doing that rather than being forced to buy insurance,\u201d he told the governors.\n\nBut comparing the exemptions expected under the original 2010 Congressional Budget Office estimate for the law and today is apples and oranges because the Supreme Court made the Medicaid expansion optional for states. As of September 2016, 19 states had not expanded their programs; the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates more than 2.5 million adults fall into the \u201ccoverage gap,\u201d especially in states like Texas, Florida, Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nIndeed, the $3 billion raised from the penalties in 2015 is the same as CBO\u2019s 2016 estimate for 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. In other words, little or no growth is expected. In fact, the CBO has progressively decreased its estimates of the penalty payments that would be collected. The 10-year estimate in May 2013 was $52 billion; that dropped to $38 billion in March 2016. That indicates that fewer people than expected are paying penalties.\n\nNormally, this kind of slippery language would be worth Two Pinocchios. The 20 million figure does include people paying a penalty and people claiming an exemption. While Trump slipped in \u201creceived an exemption,\u201d he strongly suggests the figure is really about people paying a penalty \u2014 \u201cthey\u2019re actually doing that rather than being forced to buy insurance\u201d \u2014 and so the number lacked significant context.\n\nBut Trump tips this number into Three Pinocchio territory when he further claims that is \u201csomething that nobody has ever heard of or thought could happen.\u201d Actually, the number of people paying the penalty is declining, not increasing, while the number of exemptions grew because states led by Republicans refused to accept funds to expand Medicaid for their citizens. So the number really does not show what Trump claims it does.", "lang": "en"}
