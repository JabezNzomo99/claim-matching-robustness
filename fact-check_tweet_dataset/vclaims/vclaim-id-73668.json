The text over the images reads, \u201cZap. Obey. Shot of radiation to the pineal gland !\u201d\n\nThe August 16 Facebook post by a New Zealand user has been shared more than 70 times and generated more than 90 reactions. The Instagram post has been liked by more than 240 users.\n\nThe Facebook post inaccurately claims scanning a person\u2019s forehead using an infrared thermometer poses a risk to the pineal gland. Infrared thermometers do not emit an infrared ray towards the pineal gland, instead they detect emitted radiation, according to two experts contacted by AAP FactCheck and advice from Johns Hopkins University in the US.\n\nThe post\u2019s video features a man reading a copied post in which \u201can Australian nurse\u201d says she had a sudden realisation: \u201cAre we being desensitised to be targeted at the head and also causing potential health issues by aiming an infrared ray to the pineal gland?\u201d\n\nThe \u201cAustralian nurse\u201d goes on to say (1min 25sec) that when it was her turn to be checked she, \u201ctook the gun that was being directed at my forehead and redirected it to my wrist. I\u2026 told the employee that an infrared thermometer must never be pointed at someone\u2019s forehead, especially babies and young children\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs a medical professional, I refuse to directly target the pineal gland which is located directly in the centre of the forehead, with an infrared ray\u2026 Our pineal glands must be protected as it is crucial for our health both now and in the future,\u201d she says in the post (video mark 2min 12sec).\n\nRegarding the post\u2019s claims, Professor Greg Anderson from the Centre for Neuroendocrinology at New Zealand\u2019s University of Otago told AAP FactCheck in an email that infrared thermometers do not target the pineal gland, nor do they pose a risk to it.\n\n\u201cThe non-contact infrared thermometer doesn\u2019t emit so the pineal gland is unaffected,\u201d said the professor, a research scientist and lecturer with expertise in neuroscience.\n\nProf Anderson explained the pineal gland is \u201cembedded centrally in the skull, between the two hemispheres of the brain\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s functions all boil down to regulating sleep/wake cycles, because it secretes the hormone melatonin only during the hours of darkness which sends a light/dark signal to many different organs in the body to regulate their activity levels.\u201d\n\nRegarding the claim \u201can infrared thermometer must never be pointed at someone\u2019s forehead, especially babies and young children\u201d, Prof Anderson told AAP FactCheck: \u201cNot correct. The forehead is a convenient location to take these measurements, and since it is totally passive (just as is holding a mercury thermometer near someone\u2019s head), the age of the person makes no difference.\u201d\n\nProf Anderson also rejected the claim that infrared thermometers emit radiation, saying they detect the body\u2019s emitted radiation.\n\nPeter Saunders, a radiation thermometry research scientist at the Measurement Standards Laboratory of New Zealand, agreed and told AAP FactCheck via email: \u201cAn infrared thermometer\u2026 is a passive device that measures infrared radiation that is naturally emitted by all objects. It does not direct or emit any infrared ray at the target.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a comparison, it works in a similar way to a camera \u2013 collecting and focusing infrared energy emitted by the target onto a detector inside the device. In this respect, an infrared thermometer is no more dangerous than any other everyday room-temperature item you would find in your surroundings,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Haris Sair, director of neuroradiology at Johns Hopkins University previously said the claims that infrared thermometers target the pineal gland and emit radiation were both false.\n\n\u201cThis thing is smack dab right in the middle of the head,\u201d Dr Sair said. \u201cNothing is happening between the thermometer and the pineal gland.\u201d\n\nSimilar posts regarding infrared thermometers have been debunked here, here, here, here, here and here.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the Facebook post to be false. Infrared thermometers do not emit infrared rays and radiation, they measure the infrared radiation emitted by a person or an object. They also do not target the brain\u2019s pineal gland, two experts told AAP FactCheck. False \u2013 The claims in the post are factually inaccurate.
