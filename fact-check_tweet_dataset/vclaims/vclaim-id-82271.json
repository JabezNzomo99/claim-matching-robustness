It asserts that people on welfare \u2014 the broad term used to describe a range of public assistance available for low-income Americans \u2014 earn more through the benefits than salaries of entry-level positions in 35 to 38 states.\n\u2022 None The biggest welfare package was in Hawaii, at $49,175. (Hawaii\u2019s data may be distorted because of the high cost of living, researchers wrote.) The lowest was in Mississippi, at $16,984.\n\u2022 None Welfare paid more than the average pre-tax first year wage for a teacher in 11 states, more than the starting wage for a secretary in 39 states, and more take-home money than an entry-level computer programmer in the three most generous states.\n\u2022 None The pre-tax wage equivalent for welfare recipients exceeded the median salary in the state in eight states. (That is far from 35 states.)\n\u2022 None In 35 states, welfare paid more than a minimum wage job, even after accounting for the Earned Income Tax Credit, and paid more than $15 per hour in 13 state. (This appears to be the misconstrued point in the latest viral claims.)\n\nA minimum wage job is not necessarily the same as \u2014 and could pay lower than \u2014 an entry-level job. The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Occupational Outlook Handbook\u2018s latest data from 2012 shows that the median pay for entry-level positions across various sectors could be as high as $75,000. The median 2012 salary for workers with a high school diploma or equivalent was between $25,000 and $74,999.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that when you compare [welfare packages] to an entry level job, it\u2019d be the same as a minimum wage job. I think that we said it could pay more, not necessarily that it would for everybody [at entry level jobs],\u201d said Michael Tanner, the study\u2019s author.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a point in here, which is essentially that welfare can provide benefits that exceed what a person would end up taking home from their job, which is a problem in getting people into full-time work,\u201d Tanner said. But he also added that he \u201ccertainly wouldn\u2019t phrase\u201d the findings as the current viral claims about his study are phrased.\n\nThe amount of assistance varies by state, and that not all eligible recipients receive all the benefits they can. Housing assistance, such as Section 8, was not included in this report for states where less than 10 percent of the welfare population received the benefit. When you start factoring in these differences, and how the phase-out of benefits once someone starts working at a minimum-wage job, the comparisons start to change.\n\nPlus, as the Cato report notes, \u201cmost welfare recipients today are required to either work or participate in some form of job search activities.\u201d So their eligibility for benefits often is contingent on searching for a job \u2014 though, the report also notes that \u201cactual work participation under this requirement varies widely by state.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal of public assistance is to provide a baseline level of support for those with little or no income. In an environment in which entry level jobs don\u2019t pay much, it can be a challenge to make work pay more than welfare,\u201d said Gregory Acs, director of The Urban Institute\u2019s Income and Benefits Policy Center. One way to address this challenge is to provide supports like the earned income tax credit to low-income families, but not available to non-working families. Another is to phase out benefits that a family can receive as its earned income rises, Acs said.\n\nBut comparing a welfare package to earned income in a job overstates the disincentive, Acs said: \u201cIf you want to talk about disincentives, you really shouldn\u2019t be comparing \u2018welfare only\u2019 to \u2018earnings and taxes,\u2019 because \u2018welfare\u2019 benefits extend to low-income working families \u2014 and they do that so that work pays better than welfare.\u201d\n\nWe examined the headlines (\u201cWelfare is the Best Paying Entry Level Job in 35 States!\u201d), the corresponding articles and the underlying study. This is an example of how the findings of a report with many caveats and structured within specific parameters got misconstrued in an article and spun out of context with a poorly written (and click-bait) headline. It\u2019s easy to jump to the conclusion that collecting welfare is easier than working in 35 states, but this report \u2014 and the issue \u2014 is much more nuanced and complicated than that.\n\nHowever, it captures the underlying conclusion the researchers arrived at through this study: \u201cFor many recipients \u2014 especially long-term dependents \u2014 welfare pays more than the type of entry level job that a typical welfare recipient can expect to find. As long as this is true, many recipients are likely to choose welfare over work.\u201d The researchers determined the benefits in a typical welfare package and found it paid more than a minimum wage job in 35 states, even after taxes. Minimum wage jobs are not the same as entry-level jobs.\n\nPlus, not all people eligible for welfare collect benefits. When they do, many of the benefits are contingent on some level of work-related requirement. And even low-income families receive some level of public assistance. These are all points that are clear once you actually read the study.", "lang": "en"}
