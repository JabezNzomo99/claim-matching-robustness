The claim is misleading; health experts say there is no scientific evidence boiled ginger can definitively relieve people of the viral infection, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) advised those showing symptoms to seek immediate medical help, instead of testing home remedies.\n\nThis Facebook post was published February 1, 2020, as the death toll and number of infections of COVID-19 continued to surge in and outside mainland China.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post, which has been shared more than 38,000 times:\n\nPublished alongside a stock photo of a ginger root, the lengthy post states in part: \u201cCure for coronavirus\n\n In case you contract this.. don't eat for 24 hours. And boil ginger and drink it like water but it has to be hot... You will drink it for 3 days continuously.\n\n\u201cWays to boil ginger\n\n Boil according to your taste because this is pungent. But better if you boil a lot so the virus dies faster.\u201d\n\nThe post says that drinking hot liquid works because \u201ccoronavirus is a virus that lives only in cold weather... It is unlikely they'll live in warm weather\u2026 Remember that all kinds OF coronavirus only live in cold weather.\u201d\n\nSimilar claims have also been shared here, here and here on Facebook.\n\nThese claims are misleading; health experts say there is no scientific evidence boiled ginger can definitively cure people of the viral infection, and advised those showing symptoms to seek immediate medical help, instead of testing home remedies.\n\nIn response to the claim, Dr. Mark Kristoffer Pasayan, a fellow at the Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, told AFP on February 12, 2020: \u201cFor all coronaviruses, there is no evidence pointing to the efficacy of this method to prevent and even cure viral infections.\n\n\u201cHaving low humidity and cold environments makes it easy for one pathogen to be transmitted from one person to another... but it is not connected with the intake of any hot food or item.\u201d\n\nPasayan also said the claim was a \u201cfalse report\u201d, like many circulating online, including drinking boiled garlic. Here is an AFP report on prominent online misinformation on false virus cures.\n\nThe WHO also told AFP that there is not enough evidence to suggest a connection between temperature and the novel coronavirus.\n\nIn an email to AFP on February 12, 2020, a spokesperson for the WHO said: \u201cThe virus is too new for us to know how weather could affect transmissibility.\n\n\u201cThe virus has affected people in cold/dry and warm/wet climates.\u201d\n\nThe WHO\u2019s latest guidelines do not advise of a specific medicine \u2013 herbal or otherwise \u2013 to prevent or treat the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe report reads, in part: \u201cIf you want to protect yourself from getting infected with the new coronavirus, you should maintain basic hand and respiratory hygiene, and safe food practices and avoiding close contact, when possible, with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.\n\n\u201cIf you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your healthcare provider.\u201d\n\nMore than 1,350 people have died from COVID-19 in mainland China, while nationwide infections have risen to nearly 60,000 since late 2019, according to this AFP report dated February 13, 2020.\n\nThe WHO said that despite assurances from the Chinese government that the outbreak would peak in weeks, it remains too early to predict the stage of the epidemic.", "lang": "en"}
