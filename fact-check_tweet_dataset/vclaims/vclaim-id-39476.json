That and almost all of his other assertions were inaccurate, misleading or incomplete.\n\n\u201cSadly, it looks like Mexico\u2019s Police and Military are unable to stop the Caravan heading to the Southern Border of the United States. Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in.\u201d There is no evidence that \u201cunknown Middle Easterners\u201d have infiltrated the migrant caravan heading toward the United States\u2019 southern border. Reporters with The New York Times and other news media outlets traveling with the caravan say they have not seen any Middle Easterners in the group. No government agency has confirmed Mr. Trump\u2019s claim. \u201cTrump said there are terrorists here,\u201d said Irineo Mujica, the director of Pueblo Sin Fronteras, a transnational group that has organized the caravans for years. \u201cDoes he mean women? Children? The bombs must be diapers.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet came soon after a \u201cFox & Friends\u201d segment in which Pete Hegseth, a co-host, cited a claim from the president of Guatemala, Jimmy Morales, that his government had arrested \u201cover 100 ISIS fighters.\u201d Mr. Hegseth floated the possibility that terrorists could have infiltrated the caravan. Asked by a co-host whether he was sure that was true, Mr. Hegseth conceded that \u201cit hasn\u2019t been verified.\u201d This month, Mr. Morales said at a conference in Washington that Guatemala had arrested \u201calmost 100 people highly linked to terrorist groups, specifically ISIS\u201d and \u201cthey have also been deported to their countries of origin.\u201d\n\nAmerican agencies have yet to verify this claim, as Mr. Hegseth said. But even taking Mr. Morales\u2019s words at face value, these fighters have been deported and could not be traveling as part of the caravan. Official data shows that a small number of people from the Middle East were apprehended along the southern border in the 2017 fiscal year, the most recent year of publicly available data. Of the more than 300,000 people apprehended at the southern border in the last fiscal year, 61, or 0.02 percent, were from countries the State Department deems the Middle East or Near East. Of those, 14 were citizens of the four Middle Eastern countries \u2014 Libya, Iran, Syria and Yemen \u2014 included in Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban. The Department of Homeland Security had \u201c2,554 encounters with individuals on the terrorist watch list\u201d traveling to the United States, according to a January government report. The vast majority \u2014 2,170 \u2014 were trying to enter by air. Just 335 were trying to enter by land, and the report does not note whether those encounters occurred at the southern border. Nowhere in the White House\u2019s newly released 25-page counterterrorism policy or in testimony this month by Homeland Security Department and National Counterterrorism Center officials was the threat of terrorists infiltrating the nation\u2019s southern border raised.\n\nThat is because there is no such credible threat, current and former officials said on Monday. \u201cWe do not see any evidence that ISIS or other Sunni terrorist groups are trying to infiltrate the southern U.S. border,\u201d said an American counterterrorism official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about confidential government threat assessments. Asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet, a spokeswoman with Customs and Border Protection referred questions to the White House. The White House did not respond. A State Department spokeswoman said that \u201cwe understand there are several nationalities in the caravan\u201d and referred additional questions to the Department of Homeland Security. A spokeswoman for the department said that in the 2018 fiscal year, Customs and Border Protection apprehended 17,256 criminals, 1,019 gang members and 3,028 \u201cspecial interest aliens\u201d from countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria and Somalia. None of those countries are in the Middle East. \u201cGuatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S. We will now begin cutting off, or substantially reducing, the massive foreign aid routinely given to them.\u201d The three Central American countries will receive a fraction of the $27.7 billion in foreign aid the United States plans to provide in the 2019 fiscal year. Some of the aid is earmarked to address issues that fuel migration into the United States. Guatemala is set to receive $69.4 million, Honduras $65.8 million and El Salvador $45.7 million. All together, that is just over $180 million, or about 0.6 percent of the total aid.", "lang": "en"}
