If you come illegally, you are an illegal migrant, and I\u2019m afraid the law will treat you as such.\u201d\n\nIn reference to migrants attempting to cross the Channel to get from France to the UK, Boris Johnson said \u201cIf you come illegally, you are an illegal migrant, and I\u2019m afraid the law will treat you as such.\u201d\n\nThis is not correct in all cases.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s certainly true that crossing the Channel without authorisation isn\u2019t a legal way to enter the UK, Article 31 of the UN Refugee Convention states that refugees cannot be penalised for entering the country illegally to claim asylum if they are \u201ccoming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened\u201d provided they \u201cpresent themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence\u201d.\n\nA lot depends here on how to interpret which country people are \u201ccoming directly from\u201d. It could be argued, for instance, that as the people crossing the channel are coming directly from France\u2014which is not the country they initially fled\u2014they don\u2019t have the right to claim asylum in the UK.\n\nHowever, in 1999 a UK judge ruled that \u201csome element of choice is indeed open to refugees as to where they may properly claim asylum.\u201d The judge specified that \u201cany merely short term stopover en route\u201d to another country should not forfeit the individual\u2019s right to claim refugee status elsewhere.\n\nThis means people who enter the UK by illegal means can legitimately make a claim for asylum, even after passing through other \u201csafe\u201d countries, provided they do so directly after arriving.\n\nWe\u2019ve written about the rights of refugees in greater detail here. When Mr Johnson first made his statement on Friday, the Guardian politics liveblog called his statement misleading, after a reader alerted them to our original article.", "lang": "en"}
