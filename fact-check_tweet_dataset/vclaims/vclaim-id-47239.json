The video is being shared in the context of the recent border clash between India and China in the Galwan valley (Ladakh). FACTLY has found that the posted video is being circulated on the internet at least from July 2017. A YouTube user has posted a longer version of the same video with the title \u2013 \u2018BNSF Military (Abrams Tanks) Train over Tehachapi\u2019. The name \u2018BNSF\u2019 can be also seen on the railway engine (\u2018BNSF Railway operates one of the largest railroad networks in North America\u2019). So, the video is not related to India and has nothing to do with the recent incident.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
