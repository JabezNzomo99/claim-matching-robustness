Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nWhen we searched for the information regarding the claim made in the post, we did not find any such announcement made by the central government. According to Embassy of India in Beijing, China website, anyone who pursued MBBS or any other equivalent course elsewhere in the world (including China) apart from India, has to pass \u2018Foreign Medical Graduates Exam\u2019 to start medical practice in India. Also, according to the website, those who want to study MBBS in China had to clear \u2018NEET-UG\u2019\n\nAs per the information provided on the embassy website, every year the PRC Ministry of Education (MOE) issues a list of Institutions and scale of enrolment in China that are authorized to enrol international students for undergraduate clinical medical programs in English medium and MCI will issue eligibility certificates to only those who studied in these institutions and only those students are eligible to write FMGE exam.\n\nList of accredited institutions/universities can be seen on Medical Council Of India website. For the academic year 2019-2020, 45 Chinese colleges have been listed on the website.\n\nEven in the recently released FMGE exam bulletin there is no mention about the invalidity of the MBBS degree obtained in China. Also according to the embassy website, the pass percentage of students appearing for the FMGE has been very low and continues to be below 20%. For the year 2018-19 among the students who appeared for the FMGE exam, most number of students had pursued MBBS degree from China, the data of which can be seen here. Further information regarding FMGE exam can be found in this article by FACTLY.\n\nAccording to The National Medical Commission Act, 2019 within three years from the act came into effect, \u2018National Exit Test\u2019 should be conducted for those undergraduates who are studying MBBS final year in India and also those who graduated in foreign countries to obtain a license to start medical practice in India.\n\nTo conclude, the post claiming MBBS degree obtained from China is not valid in India is FALSE.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
