Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Cory Booker (N.J.) used early questions about the economy to take aim at pharmaceutical and insurance companies. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) emphasized the difficulties many Americans face in paying premiums.\n\nBut candidates broke ranks on the details, and not all of their claims stayed strictly within the lines.\n\nOnly two candidates \u2014 New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio and Warren \u2014 raised their hands in favor of banishing private insurance in favor of a government-sponsored Medicare for All approach.\n\nKlobuchar, a single-payer skeptic, expressed concern about \"kicking off half of America off their health insurance in four years.\" (That\u2019s correct: In 2017, a majority of Americans had private coverage, with 49% getting that insurance through work, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.)\n\nFormer Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who also supports maintaining a private insurance system, outlined his own universal health care plan, based on a so-called \"Medicare for America\" bill in Congress.\n\nThe single-payer talk set off other discussion about the role of health insurance and the cost of care. We fact-checked some of the biggest claims.\n\nElizabeth Warren: \"The insurance companies last year alone sucked $23 billion in profits out of the health care system. $23 billion. And that doesn't count the money that was paid to executives, the money that was spent lobbying Washington.\"\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign directed us to a report from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a nonpartisan group of industry regulators. It supports her assessment.\n\nThe report says that in 2018, health insurers posted $23.4 billion in net earnings, or profits, compared with $16.1 billion a year prior.\n\nThis came up in the context of Warren\u2019s support for eliminating private insurance under a Medicare for All system. However, the financing and price tag of such a system is unclear.\n\nCory Booker: \"The overhead for insurers that they charge is 15%, while Medicare's overhead is only at 2%.\"\n\nThis is a flawed comparison. Booker said administrative overhead eats up much more for private carriers than it does for Medicare, the government insurance program for seniors and the disabled. But Medicare piggybacks off the Social Security Administration, which covers costs of enrollment, payments and keeping track of patients.\n\nAlso, Medicare relies on private providers for some of its programs, and overhead charges there are higher. Medicare\u2019s overhead is less than that of private carriers, but exact figures are elusive.\n\nThe Association of Heath Care Plans, the insurance company trade group, reported in 2018 that 18.1% of private health care premiums went to non-health care services. That includes taxes of 4.7% and profits of 2.3%. The Medicare trustees reported that in 2018, total expenses were $740.6 billion, with administrative expenses of $9.9 billion. That comes to 1.3%, less than Booker said.\n\nElizabeth Warren: \"I spent a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke, and one of the number one reasons is the cost of health care, medical bills. And that\u2019s not just for people who don't have insurance. It's for people who have insurance.\"\n\nA 2005 study Warren co-authored and a 2009 paper both found that health care expenses were a leading cause of personal bankruptcy. But these claims have come under dispute, in particular from academics who suggest that people may overstate the role medical bills play in their financial problems. Other research suggests a far narrower impact, though that in turn has been criticized for focusing only on adult hospitalizations.\n\nThat said, research from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found that medical bills are a leading cause of personal debt \u2014 in 2014, the CFPB found that nearly 20% of credit reports included a medical debt tradeline.\n\nBut Rep.Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii) drew on examples of universal health coverage in other countries to explain why she still supported some private insurance options.\n\nGabbard: \"If you look at other countries in the world who have universal health care, every one of them has some form of a role of private insurance.\"\n\nThis is correct. Virtually every country with universal health care includes a role for private insurance. Some allow it to cover services not addressed by the national plan. Others allow it as a means to get care faster. Others heavily regulate it as a principal source of coverage.\n\nFor instance, Canada, the model for the principal Medicare For All bill, allows private insurance to address prescription drug coverage, private rooms in hospitals and vision and dental care. (It is not allowed to compete with the government plan.) In England, about 10% of people \u2014 mostly wealthier people \u2014 elect for private coverage, which can yield faster access to care. Countries such as the Netherlands and Switzerland heavily regulate private coverage.\n\nBeyond Medicare for all, candidates also touched on strategies to bring down drug prices and a number of other issues.\n\nAmy Klobuchar: \"2,500 drug prices have gone up in double digits since (Donald Trump) took office.\"\n\nThis is accurate, per a report from Pharmacy Benefits Consultants, an industry group, which listed a number of pharmaceutical products experiencing price increases as high as 1,467.73%.\n\nAnd the numbers are even less flattering than Klobuchar would suggest.\n\nAn analysis by the Associated Press found that, between January and July 2018, more than 4,400 branded prescription drugs experienced price increases. Meanwhile, data compiled by Rx Savings Solutions found that the list price of more than 3,000 drugs went up this year.\n\nO\u2019Rourke: \"In Texas, the single largest provider of mental health care is the county jail system.\"\n\nTexas jails are the largest mental health care systems in the state, according to a report from the University of Texas at Austin. The Harris County jail, which includes a 108-bed unit, identifies itself as the largest mental health care facility in Texas.\n\nThis is not a Texas-specific issue. According to a 2011 NPR report, it is more common to see Americans getting mental health care in jails and prisons than hospitals or other dedicated treatment facilities.", "lang": "en"}
