This is false; the pictures show a second-grader who was involved in a sledding accident in the US city of Chicago last year. We\u2019ve spoken to the girl\u2019s mother, who confirmed that her daughter is alive and well.\n\nWe've archived the misleading post here. The photo collage has been shared 56,000 times since it was published by the Facebook page Gist Arena.NG in April 2018 with the caption: \u201cMy sister Marian who was beaten by her class teacher has died this morning. PLEASE share this to campaign against child abuse.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the girl is named as \u201cMaryam\u201d in the collage and \u201cmy sister Marian\u201d in the text of the post provides the first warning sign that the post may be incorrect.\n\nNonetheless, the comments posted below the photos suggest that many readers believe this little girl was really beaten to death by her teacher -- some of them calling for the prosecution of the teacher in question.\n\nHowever, a simple reverse image search on Google led us to articles, some of which we\u2019ve archived here, here and here, about a little girl who was injured during a sledding outing with her school in Chicago in January 2018. The articles reported that the girl's mother Monica Jefferson was furious with the school for failing to tell her that her child had been injured.\n\nThe reverse image search also revealed that the pictures had been picked up a few months after the incident, in April 2018, in a post on the popular Nigerian social network Nairaland. \u201cThis is handwork of a teacher....me I will make sure the teacher suffer.. what of you? I saw the post on Facebook.. very annoying\u201d.\n\nWe ran a Facebook search for Monica Jefferson and found her original January 2018 Facebook post, which recounted what happened to her daughter and included the two pictures that were later used in the misleading Nigerian post, along with two others showing her injuries.\n\nIn the post, Monica shared her anger over how her daughter\u2019s school treated the incident.\n\n\u201cNobody call me and let me know how she hurt her face or what was going on... The school didn't call me or the principal didn't call,\u201d she wrote in the original post, which was shared some 20,000 times.\n\nWe reached out to Monica on Facebook. She confirmed that her daughter Maya is now doing fine and about to start the fourth grade.\n\n\u201cI wish people stop sharing her pictures,\u201d she told AFP. Monica said it has been over a year since this happened \u201cto my baby [but] people still want to share it or write negative things on it.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
