Police have deemed his death an accidental drowning.\n\nAn eight-year-old Palestinian boy named Qais Abu Ramila went missing in East Jerusalem on Jan. 24, reported The Jerusalem Post. Police found his body the next day in a reservoir of rainwater, where authorities said he drowned after accidentally falling in.\n\nThe boy\u2019s disappearance and death, some noted, caused increased tensions among Palestinians and Israelis, with some social media users claiming he was kidnapped and murdered by Israeli citizens. Some saw similarities between Abu Ramila\u2019s disappearance and the 2014 kidnapping and murder of 16-year-old Mohammed Abu Khdeir by three Israeli citizens. Abu Khdeir\u2019s murder was one of several events that precipitated a period of protracted violence across Israel and Palestine that led to the 2014 Gaza War, according to The Associated Press.\n\nEast Jerusalem, where both Abu Ramila and Abu Khdeir lived, is home to many Palestinians but is controlled by the Israeli government, who captured it in 1967. The Israel government considers the city legally in their domain, but many people around the world consider it to be illegally occupied, according to NPR.\n\nSpeculation that Abu Ramila had been kidnapped and murdered hinged on footage that the boy\u2019s relatives initially claimed to show him getting into an unknown car. But the boy\u2019s father later clarified it was not Abu Ramila in the footage, negating the evidence of the alleged kidnapping.\n\nPolice who investigated the incident deemed it an accidental drowning and found no evidence of foul play, reported The Jerusalem Post.

Democratic Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib shared a similar claim from Palestinian activist Hanan Ashrawi, after Ashrawi retweeted user @realSeifBitar alleging the boy had been \u201ckidnapped & executed\u201d by a \u201cHerd of violent Israeli settlers.\u201d\n\nTlaib, the first Palestinian-American woman elected to Congress, drew criticism for sharing the story. Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish nonprofit organization, described Tlaib\u2019s promoting of the false narrative as \u201cblood libel,\u201d a term defined by Merriam-Webster as the \u201cfalse and maliciously perpetuated accusation that Jews have murdered non-Jews (such as Christian children) in order to use their blood in rituals.\u201d\n\nAshrawi eventually deleted the tweet and apologized for sharing \u201csomething that\u2019s not fully verified.\u201d (RELATED: Does Airbnb \u2018Blacklist\u2019 Israeli Apartments In The West Bank While Still Doing Business In Other Disputed Regions?)\n\nThe Michigan congresswoman also deleted her retweet and addressed that decision, tweeting, \u201cIn this era of inaccurate and manipulative news, I will also strive to hold myself to the highest standards for what I share.\u201d Her office did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation\u2019s request for comment.\n\nBecause there is no evidence Abu Ramila was kidnapped and murdered by Israeli citizens, and the police have ruled his death an accidental drowning, we rate the claim false.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
