A portion of the lengthy post reads:\n\n\"... TRUMP JUST ENDED OBAMA\u2019S VACATION SCAM! Before Obama left office, he arranged with the State Department for a series of \u2018official visits\u2019 to foreign countries spanning the next 20 years. Using discretionary funds from the Office of Presidential Visits and Vacations, Obama was planning to weasel what would have been another $2.1 billion in free vacations for him and up to 24 members of his family plus staff and even a dog sitter until the year 2036\"\n\nThe post continues, saying that Trump canceled the Obamas\u2019 plans, recalled Secret Service agents and sent the Obamas a $214 million bill for vacations they took that weren\u2019t \"official state business.\" It claims the Obamas spent 692 days on vacation.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nNo, President Obama didn\u2019t take $2.1 billion from the \"Office of Presidential Visits and Vacations\" \u2014 an office that does not exist \u2014 to pay for family vacations for the next 20 years, and President Trump didn\u2019t end the \"vacation scam\" and bill the Obamas to repay a portion of the money.\n\nNone of this is true. The entire story was fabricated and originated from satirical website, \"The Resistance: The Last Line of Defense,\" which is a part of a network of satire and parody sites.\n\nWe were able to track down the article, which was posted in February 2017, using the internet archive tool Wayback Machine.\n\n\"All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney. Pictures that represent actual people should be considered altered and not in any way real.\"\n\nAccording to CBS News White House reporter Mark Knoller, who keeps records of presidential travel, President Obama took 29 vacation trips over his eight years in the White House. The trips spanned all or part of 235 days (not 692). He also made 39 visits to Camp David, totaling around 93 days.\n\nEven though the original story was published with a disclaimer, versions of the account were copied and pasted in social media posts with no such explanation and circulated as real news.\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
