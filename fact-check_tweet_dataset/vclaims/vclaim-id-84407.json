Another image is of a leopard photographed from a nearby tree, sitting amidst motorbikes lying on the ground. In the next image, men can be seen taking shelter on a tree, possibly to save themselves from the leopard.\n\n\u201cDo not go towards Shivpuri on the bike. Two tigers have escaped from the national park and they are attacking and injuring people crossing that area.

There are leopards, but no such incident has happened in the last few years.\"\n\nThe graphic image of a tiger eating its kill is originally from Shajapur, Madhya Pradesh.
