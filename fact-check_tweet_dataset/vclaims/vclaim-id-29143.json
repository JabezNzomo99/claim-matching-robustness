It claims that \u201ccancer is Candida/fungus and can be cured\u201d. Similar or identical claims have been published on numerous other \u201calternative medicine\u201d websites.\n\nThe claim originates from Tullio Simoncini, a former physician who was struck off Italy\u2019s medical register and convicted of manslaughter after attempting to treat a patient\u2019s brain tumor with sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), which ultimately resulted in the patient\u2019s death. According to the American Cancer Society, \u201cSome people with cancer have other health conditions for which sodium bicarbonate is used. But \u2026 there is no evidence that sodium bicarbonate has caused their tumors to shrink.\u201d Sodium bicarbonate has demonstrated no clinical efficacy against cancer in humans.\n\nThe statement that cancer cells are actually cells of the Candida fungus or another type of fungus is false. Cancer results from genetic mutations, or occasionally inherited genetic anomalies, within the body\u2019s own cells that lead to uncontrolled cell growth[1]. Scientists can easily distinguish between human and fungal cells in many ways, for example by examining the cells\u2019 physical characteristics using microscopy, as well as by sequencing their genomes.\n\nCandida albicans is the most common Candida species colonizing the human body and a significant member of the skin and gastrointestinal microbiota[2,3,4]. This species is present in approximately 30 \u2013 70% of healthy people at any given time[3]. C. albicans does not typically cause problems in colonized individuals, although an overgrowth can result in superficial, localized infections such as thrush and vulvovaginal candidiasis\u2014commonly known as a yeast infection\u2014in otherwise healthy people[5].\n\nPatients with weakened immune systems, such as those with cancer[6] or AIDS[7], can suffer more serious and potentially lethal infections called systemic candidiasis. Crude mortality rates for systemic candidiasis is relatively high, ranging between 30 \u2013 40%[8,9,10,11].\n\nThe claim article further states that both cancer cells and Candida cells are white and that this proves that cancer is a Candida fungus. Colonies of C. albicans cells can indeed appear white in color, and on rare occasions, gray. Yet the article\u2019s assertion that \u201ccancer cells are white\u201d is false. The cells of the human body, including cancer cells, are typically colorless and transparent, with few exceptions such as red blood cells.\n\nSome fungal species, although not Candida, have been found to produce carcinogenic mycotoxins, such as aflatoxins. However, aflatoxins are only produced by Aspergillus fungi, which belong to a different genus from C. albicans. The only toxin C. albicans has been definitively shown to produce is candidalysin[12,13]. Although candidalysin is a crucial component for initiating infection, it is not a known carcinogen.\n\nIn summary, the article\u2019s claim that cancer cells are cells of Candida fungi or other types of fungi is false. Finally, there is no evidence in the scientific literature to support the article\u2019s claim that sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) can cure cancer.\n\u2022 1 \u2013 Hanahan and Weinberg.
