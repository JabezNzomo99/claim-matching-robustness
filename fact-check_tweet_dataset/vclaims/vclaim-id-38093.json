And it all adds up,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no nefarious plot.\u201d\n\nKandlikar said the actual sources of air pollution are myriad, with roughly two-thirds of it coming from \u201cbiomass burning of various forms,\u201d including fuelwood for cooking/heating and agricultural waste burning.\n\nIndustry, power plants and traffic account for the rest.\n\nKandlikar said winter exacerbates the problem because of \u201cspecific meteorological conditions\u201d which result in pollutants lingering for greater lengths of time.\n\nThat said, there is always the possibility some pollution (and not \u201cpoison\u201d) can reach New Delhi from Pakistan, and vice versa.\n\n\u201cIndustrial pollution and again burning from Pakistan could contribute a bit to the overall pollution of the entire airshed, I suppose,\u201d Kandlikar said. \u201cBut, of course, it could work both ways. Pollutants know no boundaries.\u201d Still, he said, to suggest that a \u201cpoison\u201d released from Pakistan could affect New Delhi is a \u201cfar-fetched idea.\u201d\n\nA \"poison\" released hundreds of kilometers (over 400 Km) away has little chance of affecting people in Delhi. \u201cThe \u2018poison\u2019 is from within and entirely quotidian,\u201d Kandlikar said.\n\nChina is even farther away from India, with the Himalayan mountain range forming a border between the two countries.\n\nNew Delhi has long suffered from air pollution woes.\n\nThe city was ranked the world\u2019s most polluted capital last year, with nine of the world\u2019s 10 most polluted cities being located in India.\n\nIn 2014, a World Health Organization (WHO) study of 1,600 cities across 91 countries found that New Delhi at that time had the world's highest annual average concentration of small airborne particles (PM2.5) of 153 micrograms per cubic meter.\n\nBy 2016, New Delhi dropped to 11th place worldwide, which was attributed to government and industry efforts to curb air pollution.\n\nThus, while Sharda has attempted to shift blame to a neighboring state for New Delhi\u2019s air pollution crisis, Polygraph.info finds his assertion that Pakistan may have released a poisonous gas targeting the Indian capital to be false.", "lang": "en"}
