Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of the claim in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Image of a male student disguised himself as a female during the protests at Jamia Milia Islamia University in New Delhi. Fact: The image is that of a man who disguised himself as a woman to kidnap children in New Cairo (Egypt). He was caught and handed over to the police. The incident took place in August 2017. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFor a few days, students of Jamia Millia Islamia University have been holding protests in the campus against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019.\n\nWhen the image in the post is subjected to reverse image search technique, many search results of it were obtained. Among them, the search result of \u2018Kayan News\u2019 had the same image in its article along with many other images of that man. From that article, it was found that people have caught the man who dressed as a woman when he tried to kidnap a child in \u2018Fifth Settlement\u2019 (a district of New Cairo, Egypt). The same image can also be seen in the tweet of Egyptian news agency \u2018Youm7\u2019, that reported about the incident.\n\nTo summarize, an image from Egypt is being shared as \u2018male student disguised himself as a female during the protests at Jamia University\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
