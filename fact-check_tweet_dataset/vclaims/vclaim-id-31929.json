No Democratic leader is on the record making such a demand. There are no proposals by any Democrat to amend the U.S. Constitution to repeal the First Amendment's freedom of religion protection, which would be required if they are to impose a requirement that all American citizens \"MUST\" accept Islam and \"all their beliefs.\"\n\nAlso, the photograph used in the meme to make the point that Democrats are demanding everyone accept Islam or die is actually an image captured by news photograper Sam Panthaky during a protest in Ahmedabad, India on October 2, 2012. Getty Images caption for the photo said:\n\nNone of the protesters in the photo have been identified as U.S. Democrats.", "lang": "en"}
