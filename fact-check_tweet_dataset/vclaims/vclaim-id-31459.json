A few days ago, a picture of used condoms dumped in heaps is being circulated with the claim that they were found at the protest site.\n\nFacebook user Prabhu Sagar, who is a member of Hindu Samaj Party (as per bio), posted the viral picture and said, \u201d If you want evidence, comment below. I will send the proof in abundance. Municipality employees found this scene in the drain behind Shaheen Bagh while cleaning.\u201d His post received over 1,400 shares before it was taken down.\n\n@pokershash, the co-founder of Fact Hunt, tweeted (archive link) the viral image and said, \u201cSomeone send me this pic of back stage of Shaheen Bagh and told Kudrati Khana yaha se aata.\u201d\n\nAlt News performed a reverse image search on Yandex and found the viral image in an article by lanhmanh.com, a Vietnamese website. According to the website, the condoms were found in the garbage of male students. The article\u2019s headline when translated to English reads, \u2018Stunned at the shocking revelations about the \u201cpink\u201d life inside the male dormitory.\u2019 The article is from three years ago.\n\nUsing this as clue, Alt News did another reverse image search on Google along with the Vietnamese keywords \u2018bao cao su nam k\u00fd t\u00fac x\u00e1\u2019 [Translates to male dormitory condoms]. We found the viral image on two more Vietnamese websites \u2013 baomoi.com and doisongphapluat.com . The former website republished the latter\u2019s article which was published on December 13, 2016. Thus, the viral image isn\u2019t recent. Alt News couldn\u2019t independently verify the location of the image but its existence on the internet since 2016 proves that it cannot be from Shaheen Bagh.\n\nThe picture has been shared on social media with false claims to target the ongoing CAA protests in Shaheen Bagh. Prior to this misleading claim, several false claims have been shared to target the protests in Shaheen Bagh.", "lang": "en"}
