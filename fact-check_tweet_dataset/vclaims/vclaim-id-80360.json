But did the Indian govt invite Zaeef, as claimed by Times Now?", "author": "www.boomlive.in", "date": "2017-12-11T21:02:35+05:30", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-80360", "url": "https://www.boomlive.in/upa-government-invited-taliban-leader-in-2013-claims-times-now-a-factcheck/", "vclaim": "Did former Finance Minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram meet a Taliban leader in Goa in 2013? A photograph of Chidambaram and Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Zaeef went viral today. The picture taken during ThinkFest 2013 organised by Tehelka shows Chidambaram and Zaeef in the same frame but not facing each other.\n\nNews channels revived this image first tweeted by Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in 2013. Times Now's Exclusive story claimed that \"UPA invited Taliban leader to speak at the Think Fest 2013\". They also had a hashtag #CongTalibanTango as part of their tweets.\n\nDuring election season, any old image is good enough to create a fresh controversy. BJP leaders could be seen tweeting the image.\n\nBut contrary to claims by Times Now, it was not at UPA's invite that the Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Zaeef came for Think 2013. Zaeef was invited by Think 2013 organisers, Tehelka magazine. Think is \"Tehelka\u2019s signature annual event, hosted in partnership with Newsweek magazine,\" according to the About section on the event's website.\n\nZaeef was invited as one of the 80 speakers that year and he participated in two different sessions on the 2nd and 3rd day of the event.\n\nWe spoke to Tehelka's then managing editor Shoma Chaudhury who moderated the sessions and she confirmed that Zaeef was invited by her as the event was known to bring diverse voices from all sections of society including politics and international diplomacy on a common platform.\n\nOn Think's website, we found the sessions list where Zaeef was listed on a panel with Choudhary and America\u2019s former counterterrorism head with the Central Intelligence Agency Robert Grenier. Chaudhury said the man seen speaking to Zaeef in the picture is none other than Grenier. \"This picture was shot in the Speaker's lounge as they got ready to take the stage and if you look at the image, Mr Chidambaram is looking in front while Mr Zaeef is speaking to the former CIA counter terrorism chief Robert Genier. It is a ridiculous conspiracy theory ahead of the elections,\" said Shoma Chaudhury to BOOM.\n\nGiven below is the session moderated by Shoma Chaudhury on November 9, 2013.\n\nBOOM is not able to verify independently whether Chidambaram and Zaeef had any interactions with each other. It is highly unlikely for the media to miss such an interaction if it happened in public view.\n\nChaudhury's claims can be easily verified as the sessions list on Think's website shows that both her sessions with Chidambaram and the Taliban leader were scheduled close to each other.\n\nInterestingly, Think2013 was also sponsored by several companies with Essar as the principal sponsor and Adani being one of the associate sponsors.\n\nChidambaram did not offer any specific comment on the controversy but retweeted Chaudhury's tweet where she clarified the context of the image.\n\nWhile it is clear the photograph is circulating once again 4 years after the event took place due to the pitched political battle between the Congress and the BJP ahead of the second phase Gujarat polls, Zaeef's invitation to Tehelka's event had generated quite a bit of controversy in 2013 itself.\n\nUnion Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman who was one of BJP's spokespersons in 2013 had tweeted the image, thus generating a lot of conversation on Twitter on whether it was appropriate for the country's finance minister to share the same room with Taliban's leader.\n\nThough the invitation was not from the Indian government, Tehelka's own report on Zaeef's visit to India titled, \"Can a Talib Change His Spots?\" , written. by journalist Revati Laul detailed how the \"founder member of the Taliban, ambassador of the Taliban regime to Pakistan and prisoner in Guantanamo Bay for six years, nearly didn\u2019t make it to THiNK. In the end, the Indian government relented, reasoning that it is perhaps time to start talking to the Taliban and stamped his visa at the last minute.\"", "lang": "en"}
