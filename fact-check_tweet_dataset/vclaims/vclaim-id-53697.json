Time for golf.\n\nThe text of this Facebook post does not relay a genuine quote from Trump.\n\nTrump did not claim that Obama wrote the emoluments clause of the Constitution during an appearance on Fox News, nor does this quote appear in the linked op-ed story published in The Washington Post.\n\nTrump appeared on Fox News on Oct. 21, 2019, for an interview with Sean Hannity. While Trump mentioned Obama a number of times during that interview, he didn\u2019t accuse his predecessor of writing the Constitution, which was written more than 200 years ago.\n\nSome readers may have been taken in by the fake quote because it was published a day after Trump described the emoluments clause as \u201cphony.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump is still defending the White House\u2019s decision to host next year\u2019s G7 summit, a gathering of seven world leaders, at a Miami resort owned by Trump\u2019s business \u2014 even though he abandoned the plan after it was widely criticized. At a Cabinet meeting on Monday, he blamed the backlash against his attempt to profit from the G7 on \u201cyou people with this phony emoluments clause,\u201d referring to a provision of the Constitution which prevents federal officials from being compensated by foreign governments.\n\nWhile Trump may have called the emoluments clause \u201cphony,\u201d he did not claim Obama wrote it. We therefore rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
