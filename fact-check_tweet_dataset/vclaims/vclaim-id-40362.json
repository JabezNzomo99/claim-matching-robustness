The claim is false; the photo of Khan has been doctored to include the turban.\n\nThe doctored photo was published on Facebook here on November 9, 2019.\n\nIt has since been shared more than 45,000 times. The photo shows Imran Khan sitting next to Navjot Singh Sidhu, an Indian politician who, like Khan, is a former professional cricketer. Both men are shown wearing yellow Sikh turbans.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post's Urdu-language caption translates to English as: \u201cWow Mr Niazi wow :( You did not carry the flag of Kashmiris, but wore Sikh's turban.\u201d\n\nHere is an AFP report about the Sikh ceremony that Khan attended.\n\nThe caption\u2019s mention of the Kashmiri flag refers to an incident on August 30 in which Khan allegedly declined to hold the flag during a protest in Islamabad, Pakistan\u2019s capital. The rally was held to protest India\u2019s recent move to exert greater control over part of the region. Khan can purportedly be seen here declining to hold the flag in a video published by Indian news channel NewsX.\n\nAn AFP report here provides greater detail about the issue.\n\nThe same photo was also published on Facebook here, here and here, with a similar claim; and on Twitter here.\n\nThe claim is false; a reverse image search on Google found the original photo showed Khan wearing a white headscarf.\n\nThe photo was published on Khan\u2019s verified Facebook and Instagram accounts here and here. It was also published on the verified Twitter and Instagram accounts here and here of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party.\n\nThe photos published on Khan's Facebook page have been embedded below.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of PTI\u2019s Tweet:\n\nBelow is a comparison of the photo in the misleading posts (L) and the original photo (R):", "lang": "en"}
