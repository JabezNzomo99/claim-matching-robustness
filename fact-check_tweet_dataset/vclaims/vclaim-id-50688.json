The census that year found that roughly 9 in 10 of the nation\u2019s 3.6 million black people were enslaved. By contrast, 1 in 11 black people is under correctional supervision today, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nBut the study doesn\u2019t establish that all 530,000 bankruptcies were caused by medical bills or illness, as Sanders describes it. The lead researcher behind the study says Sanders\u2019s claim might be on target when measuring only the share of respondents who said medical bills or illness \u201cvery much\u201d contributed to their bankruptcies. But those estimates are not in the study itself.\n\nA different study published in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at the same question of medical bankruptcies and found that the rate was far lower: 30,000 to 50,000 a year. However, this study was limited to non-elderly people in California who were admitted to the hospital for non-birth-related reasons, so it covers only a subset of all people facing medical debt.\n\n\u201cWe have a Congress that is beholden to the gun industry. And unless we\u2019re willing to address that head on and roll back the filibuster, we\u2019re not going to get anything done on guns. I was in the United States Senate when 54 senators said let\u2019s do background checks, let\u2019s get rid of assault weapons, and with 54 senators, it failed because of the filibuster.\u201d\n\nThe bill on background checks got 54 votes, as Warren said during the debate, and fell prey to the filibuster. But the assault weapons ban received 40 votes from Democrats at a time when they held 55 seats in the Senate (counting the independents in their caucus), so the filibuster was not a factor in this case.\n\nSanders is right that the United States pays far more than per capita on health care than any other major country in the world ($9,892 in 2016) \u2014 and that it\u2019s twice as much as Canada ($4,753). Moreover, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) median was $4,033. But Switzerland is a major developed country, and U.S. costs are 25 percent higher than Switzerland ($7,919). These figures come from a study by a team led by a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health researcher.\n\nKlobuchar is referring to a recent estimate by Moody\u2019s Analytics that Trump\u2019s tariffs on imports from China have reduced U.S. employment by 300,000. The number reflects jobs eliminated by firms struggling with tariffs and jobs that were not created because of reduced economic activity. Without a change in policy, Moody\u2019s said, the job toll will hit 450,000 by the end of 2019 and 900,000 by the end of 2020.\n\nThis is a favorite line of Sanders\u2019s. And one can make a case that it\u2019s accurate. The Pew Research Center, in a report titled \u201cFor most U.S. workers, real wages have barely budged in decades,\u201d said that \u201cAfter adjusting for inflation, however, today\u2019s average hourly wage has just about the same purchasing power it did in 1978, following a long slide in the 1980s and early 1990s and bumpy, inconsistent growth since then. . . . The $4.03-an-hour rate recorded in January 1973 had the same purchasing power that $23.68 would today.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
