He\u2019s a career official and legendary in the department, having held the same job for secretaries Condoleezza Rice, Hillary Clinton and John F. Kerry. And second, Brian McCauley, at the time deputy assistant FBI director for international operations, now retired. McCauley is unidentified in the FBI documents, but he gave an interview on Oct. 18 to our colleague Matt Zapotosky.\n\nThe statement about \u201cquid pro quo\u201d comes from an FBI summary of an interview (known as a 302) with a third, unidentified FBI official during the criminal investigation of Clinton\u2019s private email account. But there are other interviews as well, including with McCauley and Kennedy. Moreover, even the summaries with the unnamed official shows that whatever was said in the conversation, nothing happened to change the classification of the emails.\n\nThe reference to a \u201cB9\u201d classification is a mystery, as it refers to a Freedom of Information Act redaction relating to geological information. The State Department says Kennedy referred to \u201cB7,\u201d which concerns law enforcement information. That makes more sense, though given the context of the conversation as described in the FBI interview, the phrase \u201cbenign\u201d \u2014 instead of \u201cB9\u201d \u2014 also seems possible.\n\nKennedy then explained that he wanted the FBI to change its determination that an email found on Clinton\u2019s server contained classified information. McCauley said he offered to do a favor in exchange for another favor before he had any idea of what Kennedy wanted. In the end, the FBI did not get additional people in Baghdad and Kennedy did not get the classification changed. The email was released with a notation that material was classified and redacted because it would reveal confidential sources or information from a foreign government.\n\nIn a statement, Kennedy said: \u201cThere was no quid pro quo, nor was there any bargaining. At no point in our conversation was I under the impression we were bargaining.\u201d Kennedy also noted whether or not the material was deemed to be classified \u201cthe document would have been released on our FOIA website with the exact same material redacted.\u201d The only difference would be the notation for why the material was redacted.\n\nMcCauley, for his part, said \u201cthere was no collusion, there was absolutely no collusion. That\u2019s illegal. Something that was underhanded, illegal, I would not do it. No one in the FBI would do it. It\u2019s a matter of integrity.\u201d (Note: It might even be considered a potential crime if Kennedy, in his official capacity, had offered to do something of benefit for the FBI in exchange for something that was legal.)\n\nThere is no evidence Clinton was ever aware of this conversation. As we have noted before, even before Clinton\u2019s tenure, there have been tensions between the State Department and intelligence agencies over the handling of classified information. The State Department has a retroactive process, in which unclassified email that is subject to a Freedom of Information Act request will be retroactively classified to protect foreign and diplomatic communications.\n\nBut in the view of intelligence officials, State Department officials have been sending highly sensitive information on the unclassified system \u2014 with the expectation that if a FOIA request is made, department officials could then redact the emails and prevent any classified information from becoming public. Some intelligence officials thought that was backward \u2014 that the information should be protected on the front end.\n\nKennedy, as a career official for four decades, knew how much the day-to-day business of diplomacy would be upended if suddenly many of Clinton\u2019s emails were deemed to be classified. In one of the FBI interviews released on Oct. 17, an unidentified State Department official was quoted as saying that under the review process overseen by Kennedy, officials \u201cfelt immense pressure to complete the review quickly and to not label anything as classified.\u201d\n\nTo sum up, \u201cquid pro quo\u201d was a secondhand description of a conversation \u2014 and both people who engaged in the conversation insist there was no collusion. Moreover, there is no evidence that anything happened as a result of the conversation. The FBI did not back down from its contention that the email should be labeled as classified. Indeed, because so many emails were determined to have contained classified emails, the FBI in the end determined that Clinton and her staff were \u201cextremely careless\u201d in their handling of classified information in email exchanges.\n\nOrdinarily, Trump\u2019s over-the-top rhetoric about collusion would merit yet another Four-Pinocchio rating. But we are going to keep it to Three because Kennedy was certainly on a quest to limit the number of emails that were deemed classified. There\u2019s no evidence he was doing this for the benefit of Clinton, but we don\u2019t want to jump the gun in case new, more damning information is released.", "lang": "en"}
