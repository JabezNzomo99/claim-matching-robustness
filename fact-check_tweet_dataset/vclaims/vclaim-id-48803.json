He applauded the \u2018stringent measures\u2019 taken by Putin and opined that this will \u201cpush people to stay home.\u201d\n\nThe photograph of the lion strolling across a road was posted by another Twitter user with the same claim. Facebook page Hamra TV shared the image and said, \u201cPresident Vladimir Putin has dropped 800 Tigers and lions across the country to push people to stay home.\u201d While the Facebook post has garnered close to 1,200 shares, the tweet has amassed over 34,000 retweets.\n\nLord Sugar, the chairman of Amshold Group, too tweeted the image with the text, \u201cIs this a wind up\u201d. Along with his tweet, Sugar posted a supposed screengrab of a news channel which claimed, \u201cRussia has unleashed more than 500 lions on its streets to ensure that people are staying indoors during the pandemic outbreak\u201d. It was retweeted more than 5,500 so far. Multiple other users on Facebook and Twitter shared the image with an identical claim.\n\nAlt News has received several requests on its official Andriod application to fact-check this image.\n\nWith a reverse search on Google, Alt News traced the image back to April 2016. The image is from South Africa\u2019s Johannesburg and has nothing to do with the recent pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s almost old news already, but if you didn\u2019t see it yet, here is the lion that was roaming around Johannesburg CBD in Braamies last night,\u201d reads the caption attached to the image shared by Facebook page CICA \u2013 Crime Intelligence and Community Awareness \u2013 South Africa on April 13, 2016.\n\nThe lion was seen prowling in a residential area of Johannesburg. According to a report by UK\u2019s Daily Mail, residents of the area were later reassured that a lion named Columbus was not on the loose and had been brought in for filming by a production crew. \u201cColumbus had been borrowed from a nearby lion park and the area was fenced off while the animal, which has starred in a number of films and advertising campaigns, is tame,\u201d stated the report published on April 15, 2016.\n\nMoreover, the screengrab of a news channel reporting the same claim, which was posted by Lord Sugar, can be easily created on this \u201cbreaking news\u201d generator website.\n\nAccording to a recent article by Independent media outlet The Moscow Times, the total number of patients who have tested positive for coronavirus has jumped to 367 in Russia. On March, the outlet reported, \u201cMoscow authorities again ruled out the possibility of a citywide lockdown. Meanwhile, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said the city\u2019s metro will not close down.\u201d Thus, the claim about the Russian government restricting the movement of its citizens inside the country by imposing a lockdown itself is untrue. Journalist Bryan Macdonald informed that while most of the European countries are under lockdown, bars and clubs still open in Russia.\n\nIn conclusion, an old image of a tamed lion strolling in South Africa\u2019s Johannesburg was shared with the false narrative that Russia is restricting the movements of its citizen leaving 800 tigers and lions across the country.", "lang": "en"}
