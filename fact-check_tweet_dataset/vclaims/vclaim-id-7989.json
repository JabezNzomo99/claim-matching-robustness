We found that the headline distorts what Winfrey said \u2014 and where she said it.\n\nWhile the headline said that Oprah made the comment about white people on Fox News, Winfrey\u2019s comments came in an interview with the BBC.\n\nWinfrey was interviewed by the BBC\u2019s Will Gompertz on Nov. 13, 2013, to coincide with the release of her film The Butler in which she played Gloria Gaines, the wife of a White House butler.\n\nGompertz asked Winfrey to weigh in about whether racism still exists.\n\nWinfrey said that society has evolved on race relations, but there are still places where people are terrorized because they are black.\n\n\"As long as people can be judged by the color of their skin, the problem is not solved. There is a whole generation -- I said this for apartheid South Africa, I said this for my own community in the south -- there are still generations of people, older people, who were born and bred and marinated in that prejudice and racism and they just have to die.\"\n\nWinfrey\u2019s overall point during the interview is that race relations have improved from decades ago, but there are older people in the United States and other countries who grew up surrounded by racism. The inference of her comments is that when older racists die out, that particular type of racism will die out.\n\nNote that Winfrey didn\u2019t say \"all white people have to die\" \u2014 she didn\u2019t say \"white people\" at all.\n\nWhile some on the left have shown some support for Winfrey\u2019s 2013 statement, her comments drew criticism from conservatives.\n\nAbout a week after her BBC interview, her comments were criticized on Fox News' The Kelly File by former U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., a Fox News commentator.\n\nWest criticized Winfrey and Obama for trying \"to use the race card to talk about the failures and the faults not in his racial content but in the content of his character and the failure of his policies.\"\n\nWe emailed American News and did not get a reply.\n\nA headline on American News said that \"Oprah tells Fox News host \u2018all white people have to die.\u2019\" We found multiple versions of this story circulating with similar headlines.\n\nThe headline gets key details wrong and twists Winfrey\u2019s words. She did not say that all white people have to die. What Winfrey actually told a BBC interviewer in 2013 was that some older people grew up surrounded by racism. When she said \"they just have to die,\" she seemed to be suggesting that a certain type of racism will have to die out when this generation dies.", "lang": "en"}
