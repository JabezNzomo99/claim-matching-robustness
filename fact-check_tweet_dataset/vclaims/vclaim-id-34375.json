The claim is false; the video was shot during a rally against Denmark\u2019s face-veil ban in August 2018.\n\nThe 10-second clip that shows a police officer embracing a niqab-wearing woman was posted on Facebook on November 8, 2019, here.\n\nIt has been viewed more than 49,000 times and shared more than 1,700 times.\n\nThe Indonesian-language and Sundanese-language caption translates to English as: \u201cThe information is\u2026 a Danish police officer told a woman who wore a face veil that the parliament has decided to approve the use of face-veil/niqab for Muslim women in Denmark.\n\n\"The condition is the opposite in Indonesia which (is said) to have Muslim-majority populations. What\u2019s wrong with this country?\u201d\n\nThe Islamic garment shown in the video is a niqab, which\n\n leaves space for the wearer\u2019s eyes, according to this explainer published by Australian public broadcaster SBS.\n\nIndonesian Religious Affairs Minister Fachrul Razi on October 30, 2019, announced a plan to ban the niqab from government institutions, citing security reasons.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe video with similar claims has been viewed more than 100,000 times and shared thousands of times here, here and here on Facebook, and here and here on Twitter.\n\nThe claim, however, is false; the video shows a policewoman embracing a niqab-wearing protester during a demonstration against Denmark\u2019s face-veil ban in August 2018.\n\nA reverse image search on Google followed by a subsequent keyword search found two identical 10-second videos uploaded on YouTube and Twitter.\n\nThe first video was uploaded on YouTube here on August 3, 2018, with the title: \u201cDenmark face veil ban.. Police officer embraces a niqabi during demonstration woman weeps..\u201d\n\nThe second video was published here on Twitter by news site Middle East Eye on August 7, 2018. The caption of the video reads: \u201cThis police officer hugged a Muslim woman wearing the face veil instead of fining her after a ban was implemented in Denmark last week.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the clip in the misleading post (L) and the one published by Middle East Eye (R):\n\nOn May 31, 2018, Danish legislators passed a law banning full-face veils in public spaces, AFP reported on the day here.\n\nA protest took place on August 1, 2018, the first day of the niqab ban, according to this Reuters report titled \u201cDanes march in Copenhagen to protest ban on wearing face veils in public\u201d.\n\nThe report included a photo of a police officer hugging a niqab-wearing woman during the rally.\n\nThe caption of the photo reads: \u201cAyah, 37, a wearer of the niqab weeps as she is embraced by a police officer during a demonstration against the Danish face veil ban in Copenhagen, Denmark, August 1, 2018.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Reuters photo:", "lang": "en"}
