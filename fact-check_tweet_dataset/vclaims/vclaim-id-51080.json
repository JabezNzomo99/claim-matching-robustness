Qasem Soleimani in a Jan. 3 drone strike.\n\nThe Jamkaran mosque has flown the red flag on several occasions over the past three years.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Iranians participated in processions in Tehran, Qom, and other major Iranian cities to mourn the death of Soleimani, the leader of Iran\u2019s elite Quds Force. Some Iranians also carried red Shiite flags that traditionally symbolize vengeance and unjustly spilled blood, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Jamkaran mosque, a prominent Shiite pilgrimage site the Iranian city of Qom, hoisted a red flag above its turquoise dome Jan. 4, the day after the U.S. killed Soleimani in a drone strike, according to the Times of India. The flag, which bears an Arabic statement roughly translating to \u201cThe Avengers of Hussein,\u201d refers to Hussein ibn Ali, Prophet Muhammad\u2019s grandson who died in battle against Sunni Muslims during the 7th century.\n\n\u201cIt is the first time in history that the red flag has been hoisted on top of the Jamkaran mosque in the Iranian city,\u201d claims the Metro.co.uk article. ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos made a similar claim during a Jan. 5 broadcast of \u201cThis Week with George Stephanopoulos.\u201d\n\nBut, according to a mosque administrator, the Jamkaran mosque has unfurled the red flag on previous occasions.
