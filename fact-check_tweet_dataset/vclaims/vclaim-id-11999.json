No, that's not true: the story was made up by a Canadian entertainment website that makes a living by publishing fictional stories often involving weird crimes, bizarre sex acts or strange accidents. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on January 23, 2019 titled \"Homeless man's penis 'snapped in half' during frantic sex with manhole cover\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA San Diego homeless man was hospitalized and later arrested for indecent exposure and lewd act after he was seen in public having sex with a manhole cover. The incident occurred on University Avenue around twelve in the afternoon when nearby high school students on lunch break alerted local police. San Diego Police and paramedics were forced to separate the man's genitals from the manhole cover which resulted in hospitalization after it was revealed he had suffered from a severe penile fracture. Steven Wood, 43, claims he was drunk and passed out when he later woke up and found that his genitals were stuck inside the gap of a manhole cover and, unable to free himself, asked passersby for help in vain.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nBut the picture of the man illustrating the article actually shows a sexual predator who attacked a woman in a Seattle park:\n\nSexual predator who attacked Seattle woman in park sentenced to prison time The Seattle woman who fought off a sexual predator in a Ballard park bathroom faced him again Friday to see him sentenced in a King County courtroom. Gary Steiner was sentenced to 36 months of an indeterminate sentence, meaning after he serves his time, he will appear before a state sentence review board, which could assign him more time behind bars.\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories.
