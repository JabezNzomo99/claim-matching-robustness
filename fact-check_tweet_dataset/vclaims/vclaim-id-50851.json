He did, however, donate to relief efforts in 2017 after Hurricane Harvey.\n\nSaw a FB post saying Trump personally donated a million dollars to Bahamas Hurricane Dorian relief. True or false?\n\nThe U.S. government has assisted the Bahamas through more than $25 million worth of humanitarian relief since Hurricane Dorian hit the islands earlier this month, killing at least 51 people. The Walt Disney Co., Michael Jordan and others pledged money to assist, too.\n\nSocial media users, however, have spread an unsupported claim that President Donald Trump has personally donated $1 million to hurricane relief efforts in the Bahamas.\n\n\u201cTrump, in his hurtful, hateful, racist, Nazi fashion, just donated $1 MILLION of his own money to the Bahamas Relief Fund,\u201d one post reads.\n\nSome commenters praised the supposed news. \u201cThat\u2019s my wonderful President!\u201d one woman wrote. But others rightfully questioned the posts \u2014 including several readers who inquired with FactCheck.org about the matter.\n\nThe White House has made no such announcement, and we could find no evidence to support the claim.\n\nTwo years ago, in September 2017, following Hurricane Harvey\u2019s devastation in Texas, Trump personally pledged to donate $1 million for relief efforts there. The White House at the time officially announced a list of organizations that would receive donations and the amounts for each. Several organizations later confirmed that they had received the money.\n\nAlso in September 2017, Trump\u2019s inaugural committee announced that it would donate $3 million divided evenly to three organizations involved in hurricane relief efforts \u2014 a pledge that was reflected in the committee\u2019s subsequent tax filings.\n\nPrevious hoaxes have falsely claimed that Trump and his family donated $1 billion to a fund for a wall at the southern border (they didn\u2019t) and that the president donated a whole year\u2019s salary to \u201crepair military cemeteries\u201d \u2014 which is false, though he does donate his salary to various causes in quarterly increments, as we\u2019ve explained.\n\nBut there is no proof to support the assertion that Trump has personally donated $1 million to fund hurricane relief in the Bahamas.\n\n\u201cStatement on President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump\u2019s Personal Donation to Hurricane Harvey Relief Efforts.\u201d White House. 6 Sep 2017.\n\n\u201cVirginia-Based Sailors, Marines Return After Supporting Relief to Bahamas.\u201d Press release, U.S. Navy. 18 Sep 2019.", "lang": "en"}
