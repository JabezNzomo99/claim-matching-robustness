It was falsely repurposed for this claim posted December 2019.\n\nThe Pope led the mass during the 1,050th anniversary of the baptism of Poland in 2016. The pontiff was in Poland at that time to also celebrate World Youth Day from July 27 to 31.\n\nAccording to New York Post's article dated August 1, 2016, the pontiff said he was looking at the image of the Black Madonna, a Virgin Mary icon, when he missed a step and stumbled to the floor. The priests rushed to help him stand after his fall.\n\nThe edited photos used in the false claim came from different sources. The photo in the bottom left was taken from a tweet posted by @TheStarKenya, the Twitter account of Kenya-based daily newspaper The Star, Kenya while the photo in the bottom right was from AFP photojournalist Filippo Monteforte.\n\nRappler also searched for another event when the Pope fell in July 2016. Using Google search filters, there were no results shown except for the mass in Poland. We also searched if the same incident had happened anytime in 2019, but there were no official reports.\n\nAs for his health condition, Pope Francis indeed has only one lung after the other was removed due to an infection when he was a teenager.\n\nRappler asked the Facebook page for their source of the image they have posted. According to them, they got it from another page but could not remember what specific page it was. - Glenda Marie Castro/Rappler.com\n\nIf you suspect a Facebook page, group, account, a website, or an article is spreading false information, let Rappler know by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
