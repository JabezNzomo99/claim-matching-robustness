The site is the creation of a man named Christopher Blair, a liberal troll who has told PolitiFact that he created the fake news outlet in order to post absurd stories that would trick conservative readers.\n\nA note at the bottom of the website revealed that \"everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction.\" Its About Us page carried a disclaimer that read, \"We present fiction as fact and our sources don\u2019t actually exist.\" The site has been the source of dozens of claims that get reposted on other sites with no indication the articles are fake.\n\nThe hook to the story is the real news that Rice had asked the National Security Agency to reveal the names of several senior Trump officials in intelligence reports about the presidential campaign and transition.\n\nRice told U.S. House of Representatives investigators she did so to determine why Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the crown prince of of United Arab Emirates, had visited New York in December 2016, CNN reported. The prince met with former national security adviser Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner and former strategist Steve Bannon at Trump Tower.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates officials did not tell President Barack Obama\u2019s administration the prince was visiting, which broke with diplomatic practice. The country later tried to set up back-channel communications between the Trump White House and Russia.\n\nTrump in April had accused Rice of possibly committing a crime by seeking the names of the Trump officials involved, but there\u2019s no evidence that\u2019s the case.\n\nIn any event, the post about Rice\u2019s arrest is a bogus report concocted by a prolific online troll.\n\nWe rate the statement Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
