{"title": "Mohan Bhagwat Never Said He Lost Faith in Religion Amid COVID-19", "subtitle": "A clipping of a Hindi newspaper article which reports that Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat has lost faith in religion over the coronavirus crisis across the world has been going viral on social media. However, this claim is false.", "author": "www.thequint.com", "date": "2020-05-22T12:56:30+05:30", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-63061", "url": "https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/mohan-bhagat-didnt-say-hes-lost-faith-in-religion-amid-covid-19-fact-check", "vclaim": "We noticed that while the article mentioned that Bhagwat had said these things in the headline, the article itself seemed to be written in first person, rather than a report of what Bhagwat had said. Quotes or attributions were missing completely, which seemed unlikely for a newspaper report.\n\nFurther, there were no distinguishing marks to tell which newspaper the report belonged to\n\nOn running a thorough Google search, we found no reports of Bhagwat having made any such statement about religion. A search on Twitter too, yielded no results.\n\nFurther, we came across several tweets by RSS and related political leaders who had taken to Twitter to debunk the article as fake.\n\nRSS leader Narender Kumar tweeted that Mohan Bhagwat had made no such statement.", "lang": "en"}
