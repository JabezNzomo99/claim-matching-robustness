Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Manmohan Singh: \u201cBy Electrifying every Indian Village, Modi Government has increased the risk of deaths due to electrocution. Villagers have never seen electricity & also don\u2019t know how to use them, if any mishaps happen, who will be responsible?\u201d Fact: Manmohan Singh did not make those comments. The comments were posted on a parody account \u2018Times How\u2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image in the post is run through Google Reverse Image Search, it can be found that it was originally posted by the \u2018Times How\u2019 Twitter account. It is a parody Twitter account (with the name similar to \u2018Times Now\u2019 news channel) which has been suspended now by the Twitter. As the account is deleted, the original tweet cannot be found but the same parody news can be found on its Facebook page. The \u2018About\u2019 section of the page describes the posts as \u201cNews Delivered Straight from Source. No Manipulation. Satire. Parody.\u201d So, the news posted by this page should not be taken seriously.\n\nFinally, Manmohan\u2019s comments on electrification increasing the risk of deaths were posted by a parody account.", "lang": "en"}
