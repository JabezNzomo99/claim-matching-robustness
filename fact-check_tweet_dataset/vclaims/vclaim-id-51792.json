The article originated on a satire website.\n\nThe website Patriots Again published an article titled \u201cFour Southern States Ban NFL Games: If They Hate America They Should Leave.\u201d It claims four states \u2013 Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas and Idaho \u2013 have banned NFL games from being played within their borders until the league \u201cdecides to be American again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis could be months or it could be years,\u201d Joe Barron, the supposed spokesperson for the \u201cQuadstate\u201d coalition, is quoted as saying. \u201cIt\u2019s up to them. This will have a large financial impact on the league, and force them to reconsider their leftist stance.\u201d\n\nHowever, Check Your Fact didn\u2019t find any credible media reports about Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas or Idaho banning NFL games. No announcement to that effect appears on the states\u2019 respective websites. The four states do not have NFL teams, the NFL website shows.
