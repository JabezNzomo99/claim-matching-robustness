In the video, a lane is visible where dogs can be seen loitering around the \u201cpieces of meat\u201d. The tweet also had a rhetorical question \u2013 \u201chow long will Hindus be treated like this?\u201d Gautam\u2019s tweet was retweeted over 2,700 times and watched over 38,000 times.\n\nMany other users on Twitter and Facebook shared the video with the same claim. A website named \u2018Haryana Ab Tak\u2019 also reported the incident claiming that people are furious over meat thrown near a temple in Hathras.\n\nHathras Police tweeted a graphic in response to Gautam\u2019s tweet and informed that a local municipality official visited the place where the said incident took place. It was found that things lying on the ground outside the temple were not pieces of meat but feathers of a chicken and other waste material that was thrown by a shopkeeper in a dustbin near the temple. The police said that street dogs in the locality pulled out the waste and spilt it all across the lane outside the temple. \u201cHathras police didn\u2019t get any information about Muslims throwing pieces of meat near the Hindu religious place -translated,\u201d states the clarification.\n\nDespite the police statement, Gautam has not taken down his tweet.\n\nThe bits and pieces lying on the lane are remains of chickens, meaning leftovers. This is clearly visible if one watches the video frame-by-frame. You can spot feathers and bones, not chunks of meat.\n\nMoreover, at one point, a pile of garbage can be seen. After watching the video closely, it is observed that dogs must have torn open the pieces of meat placed inside a plastic bag from one place to another while pulling it out. A trail of garbage from that pile can be seen in the slow-downed version of the video attached below. The garbage spilt over in circular shape further indicates the manner in which the garbage was tron out of a plastic bag.\n\nAlt News found that the claim about Muslims in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Hathras throwing pieces of meat outside a Hindu religious place is false. The claim was rubbished by the Hathras police. We were also able to visually corroborate the police\u2019s statement.", "lang": "en"}
