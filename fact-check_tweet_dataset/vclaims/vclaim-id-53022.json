It shows Brian Cash, a local Michigan flooring installer.\n\nSocial media users started sharing the image last month after a protest against coronavirus restrictions at the Michigan Capitol building. In the photo, a bearded man appears to be yelling while standing in close proximity to two masked police officers.\n\n\u201cThis is Rob Cantrell,\u201d claims the caption. \u201cHe lives in Los Angeles. He is a white supremacist who is being paid to attend the protests such as the one in Michigan yesterday. Trump says these are good people. This is the face of MAGA. Spread their shame.\u201d\n\nRob Cantrall led an Oregon chapter of Proud Boys, an organization of self-proclaimed \u201cwestern chauvinists,\u201d according to BBC News. The Southern Poverty Law Center has called the men\u2019s organization a \u201chate group.\u201d But the man pictured is not Cantrall. (RELATED: Did Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Authorize \u2018Lethal Force\u2019 To Enforce Michigan\u2019s Stay-At-Home Order?)\n\nThe photo actually shows Cash, a flooring installer from New Hudson, Michigan, according to the Detroit Free Press. Agence France-Presse photographer Jeff Kowalsky took the photo of Cash, who described himself as a marijuana activist, on April 30.\n\nCash told the Detroit Free Press that he didn\u2019t know who Cantrall was at first, but became upset with being associated with someone he called a \u201cracist\u201d after doing research.", "lang": "en"}
