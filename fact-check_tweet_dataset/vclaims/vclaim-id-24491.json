If we lose our freedoms it will be because we have destroyed ourselves from within.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That\u2019s because he never said that. But it\u2019s not too far afield of a real Lincoln quote.\n\nChristian McWhirter, a Lincoln historian at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, told PolitiFact, \"it is not accurate in that Lincoln never spoke or wrote it, but it is not totally fabricated either.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a corruption of something Lincoln said in one of his first major speeches, McWhirter said.\n\nOn Jan. 27, 1838, Lincoln spoke before the Young Men\u2019s Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois, about \"the perpetuation of our political institutions.\" During that address, he said: \"At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.\"\n\nMichael Burlingame, a chair in Lincoln studies at the University of Illinois Springfield, told us Lincoln \"was denouncing mob violence which would lead to chaos, provoking the public to demand law and order, which would be provided by an ambitious leader who would rule tyrannically.\"\n\nThe Facebook post contains an element of truth. But the quote published on the social media platform is not something Lincoln said. We rate it Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
