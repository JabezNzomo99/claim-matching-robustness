Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., was appointed head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation appeared to be another instance of a fake headline placed atop an old story only advocating for the move.\n\n\"Just in today: Trey Gowdy is the new director of the FBI!\" read the headline on a June 23, 2017, post on Snoopack.com. Facebook users flagged the post as possibly being fake, as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to fight fake news.\n\nThe post touts that Gowdy, the new head of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, had been noted as a potential replacement for ousted FBI Director James Comey. But it didn\u2019t mention anything about that being a done deal, as the headline said.\n\nIndeed, there was talk in May that Gowdy was a potential candidate to replace Comey, but Gowdy took himself out of the running on May 15. He tweeted that he \"would not be the right person\" to take the job.\n\nThe Snoopack.com post is an uncredited copy of a March 29 post from AngryPatriotMovement.com, which initially carried the headline, \"Petition: Appoint Trey Gowdy as director of the FBI.\"\n\nThat original post went on for longer than the Snoopack.com version, and asked readers to share the post on Facebook to show support for Gowdy. TeaParty.org also copied the AngryPatriotMovement.com post, crediting the site and adding an online petition form.\n\nThere\u2019s no indication why the post about Gowdy, who has been the target of fake news before, was resurrected on June 23. Snoopack.com did not reply when we sent them an email via their online submission form.\n\nOn June 7, President Donald Trump nominated Christopher Wray to head the FBI. Wray must be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nFake news websites often put fake headlines on out-of-context news or opinion posts that aren\u2019t bogus, leading to serious confusion for readers. This is just such an example.\n\nGowdy isn\u2019t in charge of the FBI. We rate this headline Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
