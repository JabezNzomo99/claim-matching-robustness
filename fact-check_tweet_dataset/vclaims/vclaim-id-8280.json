But it was very careful not to say this was caused by low staffing, or indeed anything else:\n\n\"It is not possible to ascertain the extent to which these excess deaths may be preventable; to assume that they are avoidable would be rash and misleading.\"\n\nSo the research doesn't support the idea that understaffed hospitals are to blame for 11,000 deaths. The researchers did say the deaths raise \"challenging questions about reduced service provision at weekends\", but those questions needn't just be about hospital staffing.\n\nCommunity care services are often shut or reduced at the weekends, for instance.\n\n\n\nThe 11,000 figure itself has its critics. This sort of research tries to account for differences in the types of patient admitted at weekends, but it's been argued it's not possible to control for everything.\n\nWe're going to pursue a correction from the Secretary of State.", "lang": "en"}
