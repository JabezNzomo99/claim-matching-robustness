The photo portraying Illhan Omar's potential Republican contender has been shared over 100,000 times in different pages as of February 14, 2020 (example here).\n\nThis is partly false. Twitter did suspend the account of Danielle Stella, Minnesota\u2019s 5th Congressional District candidate, but it was not \u201cfor no reason\u201d as claimed.\n\nOn the morning of November 26, 2019, Stella (@2020MNCongress) made a reference to an unsupported claim, that Ilhan Omar has denied (see here), suggesting she passed sensitive information to Iran. Stella tweeted: \u201cIf it is proven ____ passed sensitive info to Iran, she should be tried for #treason and hanged,\u201d as she later explained on a Facebook post, visible here. According to The Washington Times' report on the incident here, she later tweeted a link relating to the allegation and the image of a stick figure hanging from gallows. After her statements, both her personal and campaign Twitter accounts were suspended. Reuters was unable to find an archived version of Stella\u2019s tweet, likely as it would have been taken down shortly after publication.\n\nAccording to Twitter, Stella\u2019s account repeatedly violated their social media policy, visible here . \u201cThe account you referenced was permanently suspended for repeated violations of the Twitter Rules\u201d, a Twitter spokesperson told Reuters.\n\nWhile the company statement did not refer to any specific tweets, screenshots reported by The New York Times in the article here indicate that Stella\u2019s account was suspended on November 26, 2019 (in U.S. time zones), the same day she tweeted these claims on her profile.\n\nAmong the Twitter Rules on Safety, the company establishes parameters both for Violence and Hateful Conduct. The policies include:\n\n\u201cViolence: You may not threaten violence against an individual or a group of people. We also prohibit the glorification of violence.\n\nHateful conduct: You may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. We also do not allow accounts whose primary purpose is inciting harm towards others on the basis of these categories.\u201d\n\nAfter the incident, Ilhan Omar tweeted here that \u201cthis was the natural result of a political environment where anti-Muslim dog whistles and dehumanization are normalized by an entire political party and its media outlets\u201d.\n\nThe post is therefore partly false. Danielle Stella\u2019s Twitter accounts were permanently suspended, but it was not \u201cfor no reason\u201d as claimed. According to Twitter, Stella\u2019s account repeatedly violated the company\u2019s rules.\n\nPartly false: Twitter suspended Danielle Stella\u2019s account because of repeated violations of the company\u2019s rules", "lang": "en"}
