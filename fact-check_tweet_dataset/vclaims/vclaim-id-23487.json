President Trump on Thursday unveiled a $16 billion bailout for farmers hurt by his trade war with China.\n\nPresident Trump, at a news conference with farmers and ranchers on Thursday, made misleading or false statements about agricultural data, union support of a renegotiated trade deal and his approval ratings.\n\n\u201cNet farm income, because our economy is doing so well, is forecast to be nearly $8 billion higher than in 2016.\u201d The Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service recently forecast that net farm income would reach $69.4 billion in 2019, compared with $61.5 billion in 2016. Yet President Trump is omitting that farm income reached $75.2 billion in 2017, before falling to $63.1 billion in 2018. After adjusting for inflation, net farm income in 2019 will still be among the lowest 25 percent since 1929, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. The group noted that \u201cmuch is up in the air\u201d and that farm income could fall with additional tariffs. \u201cAgricultural exports expected to be $10 billion more than in 2016.\u201d While that figure is accurate \u2014 agricultural exports are projected to be $141.5 billion in 2019, compared with $129.6 billion in 2016 \u2014 the president is omitting that exports are expected to decline from 2018, when they totaled $143.4 billion. Moreover, agricultural imports are expected to increase in 2019, and the balance in agricultural trade is forecast to be the lowest in seven years. \u201cPelosi does not understand the bill. She doesn\u2019t understand it, even though unions are in favor of it. Farmers, manufacturers, everybody, just about, is in favor of it.\u201d The president, referring to a broader free trade deal, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, said that unions favored the pact, but most major unions have not actually voiced support for it.\n\n\u201cA strange thing is happening: My numbers are going up. Someday, you\u2019ll explain that to me.\u201d Mr. Trump did not specify any poll or time period, but his approval ratings have largely remained unchanged throughout his presidency. During his news conference on Thursday, Mr. Trump complained of Democrats trying to \u201cdemean the Republican Party and demean the president of the United States\u201d to sink public opinion of him, which could refer to investigations started in the House or recent chatter about impeachment. But there is little evidence that these actions have caused the president\u2019s poll numbers to rise. House Democrats began inquiries into a variety of topics in January. At that time, about 54 percent disapproved of him and about 41 percent approved, according to aggregated polls from FiveThirtyEight. Discussions of impeachment increased after a redacted version of the special counsel\u2019s report was released in April. Still, about 53 percent disapproved of Mr. Trump, compared with about 41 percent who approved. On Thursday, Mr. Trump\u2019s disapproval ratings were around 54 percent. In addition, Mr. Trump repeated several claims that The New York Times has previously fact-checked:\n\u2022 None He falsely claimed assistance provided to farmers is paid for by China through tariffs. (The cost of tariffs are largely passed onto American companies and consumers.)\n\u2022 None He falsely claimed \u201cwe never saw 10 cents from China\u201d before he enacted tariffs. (The United States has collected tariff revenue on imports since the 1700s.)\n\u2022 None He exaggerated when he said that the special counsel\u2019s investigation cost $40 million. (The investigation has cost about $25 million as of September, and half of those costs would have occurred even without a special counsel.)\n\u2022 None He exaggerated when he said that his administration was on track to complete 400 miles of his border wall by the end of next year. (The mileage is inflated and relies on counting replacement projects as new wall, and on tenuous funding.)\n\u2022 None He falsely claimed the military was \u201cdepleted\u201d before he took office. (Top military brass raised questions about readiness, but spending was higher than the next seven nations combined.)\n\u2022 None He falsely claimed that a mass exodus of auto companies leaving the country \u201call stopped\u201d since he took office. (Announcements from automakers to increase investment or move companies back to the United States peaked in 2016.)", "lang": "en"}
