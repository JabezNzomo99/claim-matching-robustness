A spokeswoman for Dollar Tree confirmed the company is not affiliated with the offer.\n\nThe post, which has been shared over 1,600 times, masquerades as a promotion from Dollar Tree, saying, \u201cTo help our loyal Customers \u2013 We are going to select 100 Lucky families who can shop as much as they could for up to 1 hour and we will cover all the costs \u2013 To Win It Simply Share This Post & Comment \u2018Thanks\u2019 We Will Announce The Winners Within Next 24 Hours.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Dollar Tree is offering this promotion. The company hasn\u2019t mentioned any offer to that effect on its website, nor has it posted anything on its social media accounts. It appears to be a scam. (RELATED: Did Goodwill Fire All Its Employees Amid The Coronavirus Pandemic?)\n\nKayleigh Painter, a spokeswoman for the Dollar Tree, confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that \u201cwe are not affiliated with the promotion/offer.\u201d\n\nDollar Tree has offered shopping spree promotions in the past. In early April 2019, the retail company held sweepstakes for one customer to win a $500 gift card and for 75 others to win $50 gift cards, for example. But, unlike the alleged promotion in the Facebook post, this offer did not allow customers to spend as much as they wanted on Dollar Tree\u2019s dime.\n\nThe Daily Caller recently debunked a fake shopping spree offer from the retailer Kohl\u2019s. The wording of that fake promotion matches the Dollar Tree shopping spree giveaway nearly word-for-word, indicating they likely come from the same source.", "lang": "en"}
