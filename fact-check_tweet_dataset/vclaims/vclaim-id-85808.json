During the early weeks of the lockdown, people could only leave their homes for a limited number of reasons.\n\nRestrictions are now slowly being\n\n. The sale of alcohol, which was banned during the first two months of lockdown, has been allowed since 1 June.\n\non 11 June that people who drink alcohol \u201cclog\u201d up the health system.\n\n\u201c34,000 beds are occupied in the Republic of South Africa as we speak,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why some of us, we felt very strongly ... that it was inappropriate to open alcohol now.\u201d\n\nDoes available data support the minister\u2019s claim? We checked.\n\nThe minister\u2019s spokesperson, Lirandzu Themba, told Africa Check that the minister was quoting information from\n\n. He is the director of the\n\ntrauma centre and professor of surgery at the\n\nBut Nicol was unfamiliar with the 34,000 number. He recently assisted with a modelling study on trauma admissions in South African hospitals. But it did not produce this figure, he said.\n\nThe study was conducted by Nicol together with Prof\n\n, epidemiologist and specialist scientist in the council\u2019s\n\n, specialist trauma surgeon at Groote Schuur Hospital. The study is still being peer-reviewed, the process where academic studies are evaluated and validated. It is yet to be published.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to come up with an estimate of how much trauma was decreasing because of the lockdown and how much would come back if alcohol sales were allowed to resume,\u201d Parry\n\nduring a presentation of the model on 23 June.\n\nfrom 1999 and adjusted them to account for the increase in South Africa\u2019s adult population.\n\nthat before the lockdown, there were approximately 42,700 trauma admissions per week across 350 secondary and tertiary hospitals. About 40% of those trauma admissions (17,000) were alcohol related.\n\nDuring the lockdown, the model suggests trauma admissions dropped to 15,000 per week. Of these,\n\nBut the drop cannot be solely attributed to the ban on alcohol. Parry\n\nthat during this time, people were also confined to their homes and there were less people on the road.\n\nThe model also looked at how these figures would change should the alcohol ban be lifted, as it was on\n\nParry and his colleagues estimated that, in addition to the 6,750 alcohol-related trauma admissions during lockdown, hospitals would see a further\n\nadmissions per week. This would bring the total number of alcohol-related admissions to 11,750.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see how the minister would get a number of 34,000 alcohol-related trauma admissions when alcohol sales resumed,\u201d Parry told Africa Check.\n\nHow do doctors decide which cases are alcohol related? And do all alcohol-related trauma cases require hospitalisation?\n\nFormal testing for alcohol levels can take the form of blood, breath or urine analysis, Matzopoulos told Africa Check.\n\nBut hospitals cannot test the alcohol levels of all patients because of financial and ethical reasons, said Prof\n\nin Cape Town and head of the academic surgical department at the\n\n. Tests are costly and the consent of the patient is required.\n\n\u201cWe only do tests if the answer will help us to make treatment decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the time the results of tests are available, the intoxication may have worn off.\u201d\n\nAlthough not all patients are tested, alcohol is \u201ceasily smelled by doctors on the breath of patients\u201d, Matzopoulos said, which will influence how cases are managed.\n\nNot all alcohol-related trauma cases will be admitted into a bed in the hospital, Steyn told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cHowever, if one defines a \u2018bed\u2019 as an emergency unit bed or trolley or stretcher, there could be a few thousand intoxicated patients all over the country, somewhere in an emergency room or trauma unit in South Africa.\u201d\n\nThe minister\u2019s claim was baffling, Steyn said. But she added that alcohol does affect a hospital\u2019s trauma case load.\n\n\u201cThere is the obvious increase in all mechanisms of injury at times when alcohol is bought and consumed in great volumes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition we see the obvious state of intoxication of the injured, drivers, perpetrators, passengers and victims. Many will not be admitted, but they cannot be discharged until sober, so they do indeed overload the system while they are in the emergency assessment areas.\u201d\n\nThose that do need to be admitted for surgery or intensive care then utilise resources that could be used for others, she said.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s minister of police, Bheki Cele, claimed that 34,000 hospital beds were taken up by alcohol-related cases. His spokesperson said the information came from Prof Andrew Nicol. But Nicol was not aware of the number or where it came from.\n\nA modeling study that Nicol participated in predicted South African hospitals would see approximately 11,750 alcohol related admissions per week when the lockdown alcohol ban was lifted. The study is still undergoing peer review and is yet to be published.\n\nExperts say alcohol does affect the trauma load of hospitals. But the minister\u2019s claim that 34,000 hospital beds were occupied by alcohol-related cases is unsubstantiated. We rate it unproven.", "lang": "en"}
