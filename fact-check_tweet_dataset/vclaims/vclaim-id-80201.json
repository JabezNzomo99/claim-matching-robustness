Authorities as well the politician\u2019s team told AFP he had not been arrested, and the report shows a misleading photo to support its claim.\n\nThis online report, which appeared on Facebook on July 17, 2018, says Aquino was arrested.\n\nWhen the report was shared on Facebook it had a headline in Filipino that translates to: \u201cNoynoy Aquino has been arrested, he is in jail for a graft case\u201d.\n\nClicking on the link that accompanies the Facebook post leads to a webpage that includes the same headline as above and a video.\n\nThe clip does not depict evidence of Aquino\u2019s arrest. Instead it shows a group of parents who allege their children died after getting anti-dengue fever vaccine Dengvaxia.\n\nThe photo of Aquino that was used is also the reversed or flipped version of the photo published by local news outlet GMA News on Feb.28, 2017. GMA said the photo showed Aquino arriving at an emergency caucus of his political party.\n\nUnder a government campaign approved by Aquino\u2019s administration, the vaccine was given to hundreds of thousands of Filipino children.\n\nAquino was president from June 2010 to June 2016. In the Philippines presidents are allowed to serve only a single term of six years. The current president is Rodrigo Duterte, who is from a rival party to Aquino\u2019s and easily won the 2016 elections.\n\nThe false article about Aquino has been shared multiple times by supporters of Duterte and attracted thousands of interactions.\n\nBelow is a snapshot of some of the Facebook groups that shared the article.\n\nInvestigators recommended graft charges against Aquino, former health secretary Janette Garin and former budget secretary Florencio Abad on July 12, 2018 for their role in the government\u2019s purchase of the vaccine.\n\nHowever, Mary Rawnsle Lopez, a spokeswoman for the nation\u2019s anti-graft prosecutor, told AFP no charges have been filed.\n\n\u201cIt is still in the fact-finding stage,\u201d Lopez said on July 23.\n\nPhilippine National Police spokesman Benigno Durana also told AFP that there was no arrest warrant for Aquino.\n\n\u201cNo warrant of arrest has been issued,\u201d Durana said on July 19.\n\nAbigail Valte, Aquino\u2019s spokeswoman, also said Aquino had not been arrested.\n\n\u201cIt is not true,\u201d she said on July 19.", "lang": "en"}
