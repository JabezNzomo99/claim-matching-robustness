According to the website, it\u2019s a 2007 image from Pakistan\u2019s Rawalpindi and it depicts the Bara Market located in the city.\n\nThe image was shot on April 15, 2007, which means that it\u2019s more than 12 years old.\n\nA reverse search of this image revealed that while the image is from Kolkata, it was clicked last year. We found this image was published along with a July 2019 Times of India report. \u201cVehicles moving towards the station from the north will be diverted along BB Ganguly street and asked go under Sealdah flyover to reach their destination,\u201d reads the text inscribed below the image.\n\nThe image too depicts Raja Bazar market in Pakistan\u2019s Rawalpindi.

Hence, the image is almost seven years old.\n\nThis image has a watermark, \u201cJaihoon.com\u201d. A Google reverse image search led us to the same website.
