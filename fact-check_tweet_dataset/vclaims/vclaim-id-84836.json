Kennedy. Part of the reason, he said, was because it had not been denied.\n\nThe claim was based on a photo image from a half-century ago and the Enquirer\u2019s assertion that it had found two photo analysts who thought a man passing out pro-Cuba leaflets with Oswald looked like Cruz\u2019s father. The man in the photograph has never been identified, but the Warren Commission said he had been hired by Oswald in 1963 to earn a few dollars by passing out pro-Cuba pamphlets. Cruz\u2019s father at the time was vehemently anti-Castro, making him an odd choice for taking such a job.\n\nNever mind that Cruz himself denounced Trump\u2019s claim, calling the businessman a \u201cpathological liar.\u201d Never mind that the Cruz campaign dismissed the story as garbage when the Miami Herald published an article on it on April 22 \u2014 11 days before Trump gave it national currency on Fox News.\n\nWe\u2019re are puzzled why Trump would not think those are denials. But here\u2019s a sampling of what other news organizations have said since he made the claim:\n\nWe\u2019re asked to believe, then, that Oswald ran into a Rafael Cruz at an employment office in a city where Cruz may not have been living. That Cruz then agreed to join Oswald in passing out flyers, despite their advocating a position that Cruz himself vehemently opposed. That he may or may not have been photographed doing so \u2014 and that a witness at the scene thought the other guy passing out flyers was a lot taller than Cruz.\n\nThe sole \u201cevidence\u201d for this claim is a grainy photograph that shows Oswald with a man who may bear a resemblance to Cruz. But experts tell PolitiFact that the image is too degraded to offer much confidence. At the same time, multiple experts about the world of early 1960s pro-Castro advocacy said they have never seen evidence of Cruz associating with Oswald and consider Trump\u2019s claim implausible at best and ridiculous at worst.\n\nTrump used a thinly sourced story from the tabloid National Enquirer to make the baseless claim that Ted Cruz\u2019s father \u201cwas with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald\u2019s being \u2014 you know, shot.\u201d The National Enquirer story hangs largely on comments from a photo expert who said a photo of an unidentified man handing out pro-Fidel Castro leaflets with Oswald has \u201cmore similarity than dissimilarity\u201d with a passport photo of Cruz\u2019s father, Rafael. But that same expert told us in a phone interview that he never claimed the man in the picture with Oswald was definitely Rafael Cruz, only that comparing the man in the photo with a photo of Cruz as a young man revealed \u201cmore similarities than dissimilarities.\u201d In fact, he called Trump\u2019s definitive proclamation \u201cstupid.\u201d\n\nI cannot believe I need to say the following, but here goes. There is no corroborated evidence that Ted Cruz\u2019s father ever met Lee Harvey , or, for that matter, any other presidential assassin. We in the media don\u2019t talk about it because there\u2019s no evidence of it. In fact, there is contrary evidence. Well before the picture was taken, Rafael Cruz\u2019s sister was brutally beaten by Castro forces and Rafael Cruz had denounced the regime. So, any suggestion that Cruz\u2019s father played a role in the Kennedy assassination is ridiculous and, frankly, shameful. Now, that\u2019s not an anti- position or a pro-Cruz position. It\u2019s a pro-truth position.\n\nTrump is once again making a ridiculous claim. The story he touted was denied in print \u2014 and then repeatedly debunked. By claiming that it was not denied, he continues to suggest there is some possible truth to a claim that is flat-out false.", "lang": "en"}
