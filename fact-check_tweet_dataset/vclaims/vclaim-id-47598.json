The image was shared as the city's residents continued to face stay-at-home orders during the novel coronavirus pandemic. Comments from some Facebook users on the misleading post indicated they believed the photo was taken during the lockdown restrictions, when in fact the photograph has circulated in reports since 2013 about people praying on a Sydney street during Ramadan. The same image has previously circulated with a misleading claim that it shows people praying on a street in the US.\n\nThe photo was published here on Facebook on April 29, 2020. It has been shared more than 100 times.\n\nThe text superimposed at the top and bottom of the image reads: \u201cTHIS IS A SUBURBAN STREET IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA / HOW DOES THIS IMAGE MAKE YOU FEEL?\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe claim circulated online as the Muslim holy month of Ramadan began in late April 2020 under unprecedented coronavirus lockdowns across the world.
