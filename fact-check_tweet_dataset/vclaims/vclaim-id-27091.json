A reverse image search found the two men in the photograph are actually impersonators of the two world leaders.\n\nThe photo, which has been shared more than 1,000 times since it was posted here February 4, 2019, purports to show Duterte and Kim eating chicken at Jollibee, the biggest fast food chain in the Philippines, which has branches worldwide.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe post\u2019s caption, when translated to English, says: \u201cTo the animals who are Yellows and are saying President Duterte is dead\u2026Here he is eating at Jollibee with the leader of North Korea who is Kim Jong Un\u2026Maybe you want them to shoot you, you sons of bitches!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cYellows\u201d is a reference to supporters of the Liberal party, the main opposition political party in the Philippines.\n\nOn February 3, Duterte dismissed rumours he was dead with a Facebook video, according to media reports.\n\nA reverse image search of the photographs used in the misleading Facebook posts traced them back to media coverage of the impersonators' recent outing in Hong Kong, for example this BBC report headlined \"In pictures: Rodrigo Duterte and Kim Jong-un impersonators cause a stir\".\n\nThe report is about Howard X and Cresencio Extreme, impersonators of Kim Jong Un and Duterte respectively, who visited Hong Kong February 3.\n\nThe photo used in the misleading post which claims to show Duterte and Kim at Jollibee was actually taken by the European Press Photo Agency on February 3, 2019 in Hong Kong.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the photo from the EPA website:\n\nAn AFP report on the two impersonators in Hong Kong can be seen here.\n\nBelow is an AFP video report on the two impersonators in Hong Kong, clearly showing it is the same two men as appear in the misleading Facebook post's photographs:\n\nComments like the one below indicate that some Facebook users believed the misleading posts\u2019 claims.\n\nWhen translated to English, this says: \u201cHahaha, son of a bitch, how can they say he is dead when he is devouring chicken, son of a bitch who said that news bury him alive hahaha\u201d.\n\nThe post has been shared more than 1,000 times by Facebook groups which support Duterte.", "lang": "en"}
