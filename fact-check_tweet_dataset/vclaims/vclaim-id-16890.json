I happen not to believe that`s the case,\" Sanders said at the Dec. 12, 2016 meeting, which was broadcast on MSNBC.\n\n\"I think what he did do is, he said, \u2018You know what, there is a lot of pain in this country; people are scared and people are worried.\u2019 One example: Right now, 50 percent of older workers, 55 to 64 -- you know how much money they have in the bank, as they enter retirement? Who wants to guess?\n\n\"Zero!\" the Vermont senator exclaimed. \"What do you think? People are scared to death of retirement.\"\n\nOn another haves and have-nots claim -- that \"the top one-tenth of 1 percent\" of Americans \"own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent\" -- we gave Sanders a Mostly True.\n\nBut, are half of Americans approaching retirement with nothing in the bank?\n\nTo support Sanders\u2019 statement, his campaign cited a May 2015 report on the financial status of retirees and workers approaching retirement from a gold-standard source, the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office.\n\nSanders had requested it in his role as ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security.\n\nThe report used data from the latest triennial Survey of Consumer Finances done by the Federal Reserve Board, in 2013. It is the premier survey of wealth in the United States, according to Wellesley College economics professor Courtney Coile, who is the associate director of the Retirement Research Center at the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nThe GAO found that 52 percent of households age 55 and over have no money in what the report defined as retirement savings -- an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) or a defined-contribution plan, such as a 401(k).\n\nBut that group includes people who are well into retirement.\n\nThe situation is somewhat less dire for the group that Sanders cited at the town hall, those ages 55 to 64. The report found that 41 percent of the people in that group have no money in defined-contribution plans or IRAs.\n\nThere\u2019s another point of clarification, however. The report did not consider in that statistic other savings that the 55 to 64 age group have.\n\nThe Center for Retirement Research at Boston College ran those numbers for us, using the same Federal Reserve survey data, although it expressed the statistic a little differently.\n\nThe center found that 38.5 percent of Americans ages 55 to 64 do not have a retirement account such as an IRA, traditional pension or 401(k), but nevertheless have some savings. With that group, the median amount of their savings is $1,000 -- in other words, half of them have savings of more than $1,000 and half have less.\n\nSo, it\u2019s not as though those people have \"zero\" in the bank, although many don\u2019t have savings that would last them very long in retirement.\n\nSanders said 50 percent of workers ages 55 to 64 have \"zero\" money \"in the bank as they enter retirement.\"\n\nHis claim is somewhat high, but doesn\u2019t give a misleading impression. A widely respected government report says 41 percent of Americans 55 to 64 have no savings in common retirement accounts such as an IRA or a 401(k).\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that some in that group have other savings not in retirement accounts, though for many of them it\u2019s less than $1,000.\n\nFor a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.", "lang": "en"}
