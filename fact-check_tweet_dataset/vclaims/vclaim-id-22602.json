It has been shared over 6,000 times.\n\nThe cost of the divorce bill is about right, but it is misleading to say that a no deal Brexit will \u201ccost us nothing\u201d, as there are a number of financial costs associated with no deal. It is also possible that the UK may still have to pay some or all of the \u201cdivorce bill\u201d in the event of no deal.\n\nThe \u201cdivorce bill\u201d was agreed upon together by both the UK and the EU as part of the withdrawal agreement negotiations, and the latest estimates suggest it will be just under \u00a340 billion . It covers the UK\u2019s outstanding financial commitments and liabilities to the EU, including annual contributions to the EU budget up to 2020.\n\nIf we left with no deal, it\u2019s uncertain how much of that we\u2019d have to pay, if anything.\n\nExperts at UK in a Changing Europe told us in February that, under international law, it\u2019s not clearly set out that the UK has to pay anything once it has left the EU. However, the EU would be within its rights to take the case to the International Court of Justice. The European Commission has said that in a no deal scenario, it would still expect the UK to \u201chonour all commitments made during EU membership\u201d.\n\nBut, divorce bill aside, there are other costs associated with a no deal Brexit.\n\nWe already know that the government allocated over \u00a31.5 billion to prepare for Brexit in 2018/19. Some of this was specifically for no deal preparations, but we don\u2019t know how much exactly.\n\nAn example of these costs are the (subsequently cancelled) ferry contracts, which the government signed in preparation for no deal, which could cost the taxpayer up to \u00a357 million, according to earlier estimates by the National Audit Office. The government says the cost is \u201cless\u201d than this.\n\nThere would also be costs associated with government agencies hiring extra staff. For example, HMRC has said that they would need to hire double the current number of customs officers in the event of no deal.\n\nAdditionally a no deal Brexit could lead to disruption, with overnight changes to how our borders and trade with the EU are regulated. According to experts at UK in a Changing Europe, estimates suggest that, in the longer term, UK economic output could be reduced by up to 10% in the case of no deal.", "lang": "en"}
