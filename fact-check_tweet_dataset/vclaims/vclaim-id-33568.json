So, I didn\u2019t tell her she is the queen mother of Ghana. No. I\u2019ve not given anyone that position. She cannot be the queen mother of Ghana. We have a lot of young girls in this area loitering about (idle) so we were hoping she would come and set up a vocational center to train them. That is the reason why we gave her that honor,\u201d he stated in one of Ghana\u2019s indigenous languages -Twi.\n\nThe honorary title of Nketesiahemaa, \u201cis conferred in recognition of the person\u2019s contribution to the development of the area, with special emphasis on the youth[women.] She is not a queen mother\u201d. Senior research fellow at the Institute of African studies of the University of Ghana, Dr. Ebenezer Ayesu stated in an interview with GhanaFact.\n\nSince the 1990s, hundreds of African Americans and some white Westerners have been honoured with various royal titles for contributing to bringing development to some communities in Ghana.\n\nThe Nkosuo stool was created in 1985 as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Restoration of the Asante Confederacy by the late Asantehene, Otumfuo Opoku Ware II, to promote development in Kumasi, the capital of the Ashanti Region and beyond.\n\nToday, other tribes have also created development chiefs in their regions and traditional areas to honour those who contribute to their traditional areas.\n\n\u201cHistorically we know at the peak of the Asante empire, it controlled the length and breath of the country[Ghana] and by extension some portions of present day Togo, some portions of present day Burkina [Faso], some portions of present day C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, but it was not a political entity that the king of Asante was overall King.\u201d Dr. Ayesu said in explaining the traditional political arrangements in Ghana.\n\nAccording to the University Lecturer who holds a Ph.D. in History from Indiana University, Bloomington, USA, never in Ghana\u2019s history has the country had an overall King and \u201cin the present day situation where western governmental structure are in place in what we call the nation state, we don\u2019t have King or Queen of Ghana.\u201d\n\nThe claim is rated Mixture, this means the content are a mix of accurate and inaccurate, or the primary claim is misleading or incomplete.", "lang": "en"}
