It has received 685 reactions, 86 comments, and more than 1,300 shares since it was posted.\n\nThe facts: The World Health Organization (WHO) has not said that temperature affects the spread of 2019-nCoV and they don't recommend exposure to heat as protection or a treatment for the virus.\n\nOn its website, the WHO said that there is no specific treatment for diseases caused by 2019-nCoV, but the symptoms can be treated. It added that \"supportive care for infected persons can be highly effective.\"\n\nAt a press briefing on January 29, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that the climate is not related to the spread of the 2019-nCoV. \"[There is] no report or advisory coming from WHO to that effect. Whether it is less infectious or the cool weather in China at this time is helping propagate [the virus] is pure speculation,\u201d Duque said.\n\nThe Philippines confirmed its first case of 2019-nCoV on January 30. The Department of Health is tracking the people that this patient came in contact with in Cebu and Dumaguete. (READ: Novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV: What we know so far) \u2013 Vernise L.
