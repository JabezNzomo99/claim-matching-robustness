In the meantime, Ryan is trying to garner support for a major overhaul of what he calls the United States\u2019 \u201cterrible tax system.\u201d On Sept. 13, Ryan sat down with the Associated Press to discuss his agenda. His main criticism of the tax code is that companies in the United States are taxed at a much higher rate than companies in other countries, which he says inhibits those companies from investing profits made overseas back into the United States. President Trump has made similar claims.\n\nAlthough many other countries have changed their tax systems and slashed corporate tax rates in recent years, Ryan argues, the United States has fallen behind. A study on international tax policy from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released Wednesday confirms that corporate tax rates in other economic powers declined over the past decade. \u201cOverall, the number of countries with a statutory rate above 30 percent decreased from 21 in 2000 to 7 in 2008 and to 5 in 2016,\u201d the report found.\n\nUpdate: An earlier version of this column failed to include a response from Ryan\u2019s office regarding statutory rates. \u201cEffective rates are irrelevant because that\u2019s just total taxes divided by total profits. What matters for the economy, investment decisions, and location decisions is the marginal rate \u2013 i.e., the rate on the next dollar of income earned. And the statutory rate is a useful measure of the marginal rate on the next investment decision, whereas the effective rate is not. For example, you could have a 90 percent statutory rate but hand out so many deductions and credits that the effective rate is 20 percent. But that means that the profits on a new investment will be taxed at 90 percent, and thus our tax system will not be competitive with other countries.\u201d\n\nPolitics aside, the 44.6 percent number is misleading. Ryan appears to understand this, as he carefully added the qualifier that the rate applied to \u201csuccessful small businesses.\u201d In other words, the 44.6 percent rate does not apply to all small businesses. Indeed, The Fact Checker previously reported that only 3 to 7.5 percent of small businesses pay the top rate. A 2013 study commissioned by the National Federation of Independent Businesses found that the average effective tax rate for small businesses was 21.3 percent.\n\nAdditionally, with respect to GDP, U.S. taxes are much lower than other in developed countries, according to an analysis from the Tax Policy Center. In 2014, revenue from all tax streams made up 26 percent of the U.S. GDP, compared with an average of 34 percent of GDP for the OECD countries. Denmark had the highest rate, with taxes at 50 percent of its GDP. Only three of the 34 member countries collect less taxes than the United States: South Korea, Chile and Mexico.\n\nHis 35 percent figure is the statutory rate, whereas the lower effective rate reflects the taxes that businesses actually pay. His 44.6 percent rate for small businesses is a number that more than 90 percent of small businesses do not pay; again, the effective rate is less than half the rate cited by Ryan. And Ryan\u2019s 22.5 percent figure is based on a simple average that assumes all countries are the same, whereas experts say a better measure takes the size of a country\u2019s economy into consideration.\n\nWe wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios. Many of the United States\u2019 economic competitors already have reduced their corporate rates. But Ryan ginned up his case for change in the United States in a misleading way. Two of his statistics are real numbers but used inappropriately. We were tempted to award a Three for Ryan\u2019s calculation of the average corporate rate for U.S. economic competitors. But again, that is not a made-up figure, just an inappropriate one. So we kept it at Two Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
