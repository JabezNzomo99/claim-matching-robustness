Bernie Sanders' health care plan proposes to raise the tax rate to 52% on incomes over $29,000.\n\nIn February 2020, a text meme concerning Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 health care plan and his proposal to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour was circulated on social media. The meme contained several arithmetic equations that supposedly showed how the pay increase for minimum wage workers would be negated by the hike in taxes needed to pay for Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan:\n\nBernie Sanders said at the debate last night he wants minimum wage to be $15 an hour. Bernie Sanders wants free healthcare for all and was asked how he would pay for it. His answer was to raise taxes 52% on anyone making over $29,000 per year. 52% of $31,200 = $16,224 in tax\n\n $31,200 \u2013 $16,224 = $14,976 is your pay\n\n $14,976 \u00f7 52 weeks = $288 per week\n\n $288 \u00f7 40 hr week = $7.20 per hour\n\nBut there\u2019s no need to check the arithmetic in this meme. The general claim here \u2014 that Sanders\u2019 health care plan would raise the tax rate to 52% on everyone making over $29,000 per year \u2014 is egregiously false.\n\nDoes Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All plan raise taxes to 52% on incomes over $29,000?\n\nIn short, no. One proposal offered by Sanders would raise the tax rate to 52% on earnings over $10 million. Sanders also proposed that the first $29,000 of a person\u2019s income would be exempt from taxes, and a 4% income-based premium would be applied to earnings over $29,000.\n\nThe meme asserts that Sanders made this claim \u201cat the debate last night.\u201d As this meme started circulating in mid-February 2020, we\u2019ll assume that timing refers to the Democratic presidential debate held in Las Vegas on Feb. 17, 2020. Although Sanders did say that he wanted to raise the minimum wage to $15 during that debate, he did not say that he would pay for his health care plan by raising \u201ctaxes to 52% on anybody making over $29,000 a year.\u201d\n\nFormer South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg did maintain that \u201ctaxes will go up on anybody making more than $29,000\u201d under Sanders\u2019 tax plan, but Buttigieg did not claim that the tax rate would increase to 52% for these individuals. Sanders disputed Buttigieg\u2019s claim during the debate, saying the latter was \u201cnot being honest\u201d and that any tax increase for low-wage workers would be offset by lower health care costs.\n\nHere\u2019s an excerpt of the exchange between the two men (a full transcript of the debate is available here):\n\nBUTTIGIEG: [Sanders] was a congressman at the time. And the qualities I admired then are qualities I still respect a great deal. I never said that I agree with every part of his policy views, then or now. But I appreciate that at least he\u2019s straightforward and honest about them. He\u2019s honest about the fact that taxes will go up on anybody making more than $29,000 to fund his health care plan, although, again, a little bit vague about how the rest of that gets \u2026 SANDERS: You\u2019re not being honest. Premiums would be eliminated. BUTTIGIEG: But you\u2019re still raising those taxes. And when you do it\u2026 SANDERS: But we\u2019re saving people money because they don\u2019t pay any premiums, out-of-pocket expenses, co-payments, or deductibles. They\u2019re going to be much better off. [applause] BUTTIGIEG: But where is \u2014 where is the other $25 trillion supposed to come from? At a certain point, you\u2019ve got to do the math. SANDERS: Well, we got it all up there on the internet. It\u2019s a payroll tax \u2014 a payroll tax\u2026 BUTTIGIEG: Well, no, but even after the payroll tax, you still have a hole. SANDERS: Because we have a wealth tax. Elizabeth [Warren] has a good one. Ours is a little bit tougher on Mr. Bloomberg than hers. We\u2019re going to raise it in a progressive way, which deals with income and wealth inequality, and makes certain, finally, that health care in this country is a human right, not a privilege.\n\nAlthough Sanders did not reference it during that debate, we did find mention of a 52% tax rate on a document he released to explain various \u201coptions to finance Medicare for All.\u201d That document stated that the 52% tax rate would be applied to earnings over $10 million, not $29,000 as claimed in the meme.\n\nHere\u2019s the relevant excerpt from that document (emphasis ours):\n\nSanders mentioned the $29,000 figure in another document entitled \u201cFinancing Medicare for All.\u201d This documented listed a few additional ways to pay for Medicare for All, including a 4% income-based premium on incomes over $29,000. Here\u2019s an excerpt from that document (emphasis ours):\n\nSanders elaborated on this portion of his plan during a September 2019 appearance on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d:\n\nSanders made a similar statement during a town hall in New Hampshire in November 2019. Sanders again said that the first $29,000 of an individual\u2019s earnings would be exempt from taxes and then a 4% tax rate would apply on earnings over $29,000:\n\nWe were unable to find any instance of Sanders\u2019 proposing a 52% tax rate on \u201canybody making over $29,000\u201d per year, something that appears to be an erroneous conflation of Sanders\u2019 proposing a 4% tax rate on earnings over $29,000 and a 52% tax rate on earnings over $10 million. A counter-meme offered a more accurate (although still not entirely accurate) look at Sanders\u2019 actual expressed plans:\n\nThis meme, too, makes a mistake. Sanders\u2019 tax proposal uses a marginal tax rate (or a progressive tax rate), which means that a different tax rate is applied to different portions of a person\u2019s income. The percentage taxed starts relatively small, but grows as income increases. In Sanders\u2019 case, the first $29,000 of a person\u2019s income would be exempt from taxes. When a person\u2019s income crosses the $29,000 threshold, a 4% tax will be applied to earnings OVER$29,000. This tax rate continues to grow as income increases. Income over $10 million, for instance, would be taxed at 52%.\n\nBut the above-displayed meme applies a 4% tax rate to ALL $31,200. Under Sanders\u2019 plan, however, the first $29,000 would be exempt and the 4% tax rate would only apply to the remaining $2,200.\n\nWe reached out to Sanders\u2019 campaign for comment on the claim that the candidate was planning to raise the tax rate to 52% on everyone making over $29,000 per year. A spokesperson told us \u201cthe meme is false.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
