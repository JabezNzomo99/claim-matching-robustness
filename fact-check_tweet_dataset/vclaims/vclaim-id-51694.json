Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nOn observing carefully, we found out that the person in the video is not Google CEO Sundar Pichai. His name is displayed as Ganesh Kohli at the beginning of the video in the bottom left corner. He also mentions his Maths teacher as Ms. Molly Abraham in the video. Using the keywords \u2018Ganesh Kohli visit to his Maths teacher Molly Abraham\u2019, we found the same video posted in the official website of Ganesh Kohli with the title \u2018A tribute to Molly Teacher-By Ganesh Kohli\u2019. The same video found was also found in the official YouTube channel of \u2018IC3 Movement\u2019.\n\nGanesh Kohli, a teacher, counsellor and is one of the key founding members of \u2018IC3 Institute\u2019 in India. He was inspired to become a teacher from his Mathematics teacher Ms. Molly Abraham and shared the video as a tribute to Molly Teacher.\n\nWhen his video went viral on social media as \u2018Google CEO Sundar Pichai visiting his Maths teacher\u2019, Ganesh Kohli clarified that his three-year-old video is falsely attributed to Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in social media platforms.\n\nTo sum it up, an old video of IC3 Institute founder Ganesh Kohli is now falsely shared as Google CEO Sundar Pichai visiting his Maths teacher after 27 years.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
