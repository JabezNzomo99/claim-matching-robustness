While the NHS still does not specifically suggest avoiding handshaking to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, far more widespread 'social distancing' measures are now recommended. You can read more about these here.\n\nThis article has been archived as a result. You can find our latest fact checks on the new coronavirus here.\n\nA headline in The Sun incorrectly said the NHS has warned people to ban handshakes to prevent the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus. The government has not issued any official advice on handshaking, although some doctors have suggested avoiding it.\n\nSince we first wrote this article The Sun corrected its headline to clarify that the advice actually came from a doctor rather than the NHS. The article later clarifies the suggestion came up in an interview on BBC Breakfast with GP Dr Rosemary Leonard and Leeds University virologist Stephen Griffin.\n\nA clip of the interview shows Dr Leonard saying: \u201cWhen we all walked into the BBC this morning, the charming people at the desk were all shaking our hands.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s very British and very polite, we probably ought to stop shaking hands.\u201d\n\nShe is not the only doctor to have suggested this. The manager of Newcastle United, Steve Bruce, told the BBC that the club has introduced a handshake ban at its training ground to avoid the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus on the advice of a doctor.\n\nAnd in February, virologist Professor John Oxford from Queen Mary University told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme: \u201cWhat we need to do is less of the handshaking, hugging, kissing, that sort of thing, because this virus looks like its spread by ordinary tidal breathing, not necessarily colds and coughing.\u201d\n\nHowever, Public Health England, which is in charge of giving health advice to the public, has confirmed to us last month that no advice around shaking hands had been issued by the government.\n\nThe NHS advice recommends covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve\u2014rather than your hands\u2014when you cough or sneeze and putting used tissues in the bin immediately. It also advises frequent hand washing with soap and water for 20 seconds, or hand sanitiser gel if soap and water aren\u2019t available, and avoiding close contact with people who are unwell. Since this article was first published the NHS has added two new pieces of advice to this list, it adds that you should always wash your hands when you get home or into work. It also says to try and avoid close contact with people who are unwell.\n\nThe NHS advises against touching your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean. It does not mention shaking hands.\n\nThe government has also launched a public information campaign with advice about the new coronavirus.\n\nUpdated NHS guidance says people should stay at home for seven days if they have a high temperature or a new, continuous cough. You should not go to GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. The government has also published new advice about staying at home.\n\nYou should only use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service if you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home, your condition gets worse or your symptoms do not get better after seven days. The government has asked that people only call 111 if they cannot get help online. You should still call 999 if it is a medical emergency, as you would normally.\n\nUnlike previous guidance, this advice stands regardless of whether or not you have recently visited an affected country.\n\nAll the latest government advice relating to Covid-19 can be found here.", "lang": "en"}
