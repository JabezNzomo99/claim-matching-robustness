Barbara Buono.\n\n \n\n The Middlesex County Democrat recently claimed that Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, created that new category of unemployed persons when he reformed the state\u2019s unemployment insurance law in 2010.\n\n \n\n \"A few years ago, the governor -- in so-called reform of the unemployment law -- created...this new category where you could get laid off and just be totally denied unemployment benefits forever,\" Buono said in an Oct. 1 interview on NJToday.\n\n \n\n Buono\u2019s statement is essentially correct. Based on Christie\u2019s recommendations, state officials in 2010 created a category where individuals fired for \"severe misconduct\" could be barred from receiving unemployment benefits for as long as they remain unemployed.\n\n \n\n But the Democrat-led state Legislature bears responsibility for signing off on Christie\u2019s proposed changes. Also, if someone gets another job after being fired for severe misconduct, it\u2019s possible for the wages from that first job to ultimately count toward unemployment benefits.\n\n \n\n Buono used the phrase \"laid off,\" but state regulations typically refer to such individuals as being \"discharged\" or \"fired.\"\n\n \n\n First, let\u2019s explain what severe misconduct means.\n\n \n\n The state originally had two categories of misconduct cases: misconduct and gross misconduct. Gross misconduct related to behavior that was criminal in nature. Misconduct applied to everything else.\n\n \n\n State officials created a third category of severe misconduct to recognize behavior that was worse than simple misconduct, but still fell short of being gross misconduct. Examples of severe misconduct include the use of drugs or alcohol on the job and the destruction or theft of company property.\n\n \n\n Christie recommended adding that category when he conditionally vetoed a bill passed by the Legislature to change the unemployment insurance tax rates paid by employers. Buono voted against accepting the governor\u2019s proposed changes, but most other legislators voted in favor of them and Christie signed the bill into law in July 2010.\n\n \n\n \"It was a bi-partisan effort to make it a fairer system,\" Harold Wirths, commissioner of the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, said in a statement.\n\n \n\n Christina Zuk, Buono\u2019s chief of staff, maintained that Christie created the category, pointing out that it didn\u2019t exist until he added it to the bill through his conditional veto.\n\n \n\n From July 2010 to August 2012, 15,961 unemployment benefit claims were denied for severe misconduct, according to labor department data.\n\n \n\n However, there\u2019s still a chance a person fired for severe misconduct could ultimately receive unemployment benefits based in part on wages from that job.\n\n \n\n Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n \n\n Employment benefits are based on wages earned during a 52-week period called a \"base year.\" Let\u2019s say that after being fired for severe misconduct, that person gets another job, meets certain employment criteria and then loses that job for reasons not related to misconduct.\n\n \n\n If both jobs occurred within the same base year, then the person could cite both sets of wages to calculate his unemployment benefits, according to department spokesman Brian Murray.\n\n \n\n But Zuk argued the new category still means individuals won\u2019t receive benefits after they first become unemployed due to \"severe misconduct.\"\n\n \n\n \"Therefore an individual who finds him or herself unemployed due to \u2018severe misconduct\u2019 will have no means of sustaining themselves until they find another job,\" Zuk said in an e-mail. \"The DOL spokesperson's statement only becomes relevant if the unemployed individual finds a new job and re-qualifies for benefits.\"\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n In a TV interview, Buono claimed Christie created \"this new category where you could get laid off and just be totally denied unemployment benefits forever.\"\n\n \n\n The senator\u2019s claim isn\u2019t far off. Based on Christie\u2019s recommendations, state officials created a \"severe misconduct\" category in which individuals could be denied unemployment benefits for as long as they remain unemployed.\n\n \n\n But the Legislature agreed to create that category as well. Also, there is a scenario in which a person fired for severe misconduct could later receive unemployment benefits based in part on wages from that job.\n\n \n\n We rate the statement Mostly True.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "lang": "en"}
