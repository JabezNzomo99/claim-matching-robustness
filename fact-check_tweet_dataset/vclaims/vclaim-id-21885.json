The Ramadan logo featured is not a legitimate Doodle and was instead created as part of a campaign to get Google to feature one for the holiday.\n\nThe tech giant Google routinely updates its logo with a \u201cDoodle\u201d to reflect anniversaries, birthdays, holidays and historical events. On April 21, Easter, many people noticed there was no Doodle \u2013 just the typical Google logo.\n\nThe meme is correct on that count, however, Google has released Doodles for neither Easter nor Ramadan in recent years. It did release a Doodle for Easter in 2000, featuring two eggs in the center of the logo, but has not released such a Doodle in recent years.\n\nBack in 2018, Google told Fox News, \u201cWe don\u2019t have Doodles for religious holidays, in line with our current Doodle guidelines. Doodles may appear for some non-religious celebrations that have grown out of religious holidays, such as Valentine\u2019s Day, Holi\u2019s Festival of Colors, Tu B\u2019Av and the December holiday period, but we don\u2019t include religious imagery or symbolism as part of these.\u201d\n\nFor Easter 2019, Google did create an interactive homepage, the first of its kind, which allowed users to explore the history of Easter traditions. The design of the page featured bunnies, flowers, candies and eggs.\n\nThe Ramadan Doodle pictured in the meme was not created by Google, but rather was created as part of an online campaign in 2010 that attempted to convince Google to feature a Doodle for the Muslim holiday. A search of the Google Doodles archives returns no such image.\n\nRecent Google Doodles have commemorated Election Day in Finland, Teacher\u2019s Day in Ecuador, Earth Day, Holi, St. Patrick\u2019s Day, Kuwait National Day and more.", "lang": "en"}
