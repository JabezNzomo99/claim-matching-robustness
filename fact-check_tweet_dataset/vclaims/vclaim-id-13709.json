In the post, it was written that voting for Congress was like voting for Pakistan. Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the picture posted.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be found here.\n\nClaim: Congress President Rahul Gandhi and his party leaders Shatrughan Sinha, Navjot Singh Sidhu and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee are in the same pic with Pakistan\u2019s PM Imran Khan and its Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa Fact: The original photo of the picture posted can be seen in the article of the news agency \u2018ARY NEWS\u2019. The photo is from the meeting of Pakistan Army Chief with its PM Imran Khan to discuss their country\u2019s security-related matters. No Indian political leader can be seen in the original pic. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn doing the Google reverse image search, the photo was found in the \u2018ARY NEWS\u2019 article dated Apr 4, 2019 with the title \u201cArmy Chief calls on PM Khan, discusses security-related matters\u201d. The image in this article is photoshopped to show as if Rahul Gandhi, Shatrughan Sinha, Navjot Singh Sidhu and Mamata Banerjee are with Pakistan\u2019s PM and its Army Chief.\n\nHence, the picture showing Rahul Gandhi, Mamata Banerjee, Navjot Sidhu and Shatrughan Sinha with the Pak PM and its Army Chief is a photoshopped one.", "lang": "en"}
