The report details how Hussein nurtured relationships with terrorist groups, especially Palestinian ones. (We explored this issue in a 2014 fact-check.)\n\nAmong its major findings was that there was no direct connection between Hussein\u2019s Iraq and al-Qaeda \u2014 calling attention to the premise of one of George W. Bush administration\u2019s justifications for invading Iraq. But the report found that at times, their short-term goals overlapped.\n\nAnsar al-Islam, linked to al-Qaeda, established in 2001 in a corner of the Kurdish northern part of Iraq. Hussein\u2019s government had no control over the area before the war and was not a sponsor of the group, which viewed Hussein\u2019s regime as an enemy. But he may have tolerated Ansar\u2019s presence in Iraqi territory because it fought against his Kurdish opponents, as we wrote previously.\n\nHussein dreamed of \u201cbeing the secular ruler of a United Arab nation,\u201d according to the IDA report, and in the 1990s, his regime fought internal religious extremist movements he viewed as a threat: \u201cThe Saddam regime was very concerned about the internal threat posed by various Islamist movements. Crackdowns, arrests, and monitoring of Islamic radical movements were common in Iraq.\u201d\n\nYet the report also says that despite the outwardly secular regime, it found \u201ccommon cause with terrorist groups who drew their inspiration from radical Islam. One could argue that keeping some of these extremist groups active outside of Iraq was a pragmatic defensive measure against them.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Hussein himself considered dissidents and co-conspirators against his regime as terrorists, said Stephen Biddle, George Washington University professor and international security expert. But prior to the invasion, Hussein had a pattern of supporting international terrorist groups that were active against his opponents, Biddle said.\n\nThe Associated Press noted that Hussein\u2019s use of poisonous gas on Kurdish villages in response to rebellion in the late 1980 \u201cunderscored Saddam\u2019s willingness to use any means to put down perceived opponents of any stripe, not just those he might have considered terrorists.\u201d\n\nHussein effectively suppressed dissent but at the cost of brutal deaths of civilians, widely condemned as a violation of human rights. Notably, in the early 1990s, tens of thousands of people died during Hussein\u2019s crackdown following the uprising by the Kurds and Shiites.\n\nThe AP wrote that in the uprisings, \u201cgroups carried out attacks that could fall under a broad definition of terrorism, and Saddam had many of the opponents killed. Some were linked to groups supported by the U.S., others to groups that Washington considered terrorist organizations.\u201d But the international security experts we consulted noted these were popular uprisings, not actions by \u201cterrorists.\u201d\n\nHussein was no opponent of terrorists, certainly in the eyes of the West. Perhaps Trump is referring to Hussein\u2019s fight against internal religious extremist movements that he viewed as a threat to his regime \u2014 a part of his overall suppression of dissent. But Trump\u2019s description \u2014 that Hussein \u201ckilled terrorists,\u201d and did it \u201cso well\u201d or was \u201cso good\u201d at it \u2014 is just not credible, especially given the overwhelming evidence of Hussein\u2019s long-standing record of supporting (financially and operationally) international terrorist groups.
