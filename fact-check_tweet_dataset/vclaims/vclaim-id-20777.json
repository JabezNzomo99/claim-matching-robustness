Is it really of immigrant children separated from their families? Sending you a photo, going around Facebook with immigrant children, supposedly removed from parents at US borders, posing at a detention facility, wearing orange prison jumpsuits. MOST posts are challenging as \u201cFake News\u201d, a lawyer friend says this is probably staged since PHOTOGRAPHS are not permitted in Homeland Security facilities nor the private prison contractors FOUR that we know of in TX. Church groups, lawyers, family can go, but cellphones & cameras are forbidden, so we\u2019re wondering how did THIS PHOTO get so posed with the kids? Perhaps you\u2019ve already seen this photo? NO source on any of the photos. YES, it\u2019s tragic that children are being separated from parents & being held in detention, like prison facilities, but I don\u2019t think we need to stage a photo. My church group friends, I know for a fact, distributed 670 backpacks Christmas week 2017, to CHILDREN LOCKED UP at Karnes County Detention Center, (Texas) Yes. 670 children, alone. There is a photo going around on Facebook of children dressed in orange prison jumpsuits. There is no attribution to the photo. It is being used as proof of children who have been taken from their parents crossing the border. I would Ike to know where this photo is from and when it was taken. I have a feeling it is not what it claims to be.\n\nSeveral included a link to a Facebook post shared by Occupy Democrats on 8 June 2018:\n\nNeither the caption nor the image text used any immigration-specific wording, but no source for the photographs was provided. A reverse image search shows that the image appeared online as early as 2014 (and possibly earlier):\n\nThe photograph was originally used to illustrate a claim that in the United States, prisons are constructed more frequently than schools:\n\nIn 2014, the photograph accompanied an article about schools and prisons. It appears to be a still from the following video from Californians for Safety and Justice:\n\nThe image likely caught on because of a real photograph that was leaked from a Texas courtroom which shows the mass trials that result from the Trump administration\u2019s so-called \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy, along with a story that appeared in The Intercept:\n\nA very small, very young woman with chiseled features and disheveled hair spoke. She had been apprehended two days earlier after rafting across the Rio Grande near a county park with big trees and picnic tables that abuts the international line. She wept as she told Morgan, \u201cI\u2019d like to apologize, but the circumstances in my country made me do it.\u201d She said she\u2019d been almost raped and killed there, and she had come to the U.S. for protection and to see if she could help her sisters escape the danger. \u201cYou are going to be sent to one of the immigration camps,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cYou can try and request asylum.\u201d By May 10, Morgan was starting to get rattled by the increasingly disturbing content of the allocutions. By then, the government had begun systematically separating mothers and fathers from their children, including children who are preschoolers. A week later, the government announced plans to house the children on military bases.", "lang": "en"}
