(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nLet\u2019s take it piece by piece. First, consider the time period. The past 12 months is approximately February 2018 to January 2019 but the most recent data available from the Metropolitan Police Service, London\u2019s police force, is December 2018.\n\nDuring the calendar year of 2018, there were 14,700 recorded knife crimes, according to the service. That\u2019s more than the Facebook post claims.\n\nKnife crime was on the rise in London prior to 2018. In a foreword to \"The London Knife Crime Strategy,\" published in 2017, Mayor Sadiq Khan said, \"Our communities are sick and tired of the damage being done by knife crime,\" singling out the city\u2019s \"most troubled young people\" as both potential victims and offenders. Seventy-five percent of victims of knife crime are males younger than 25, according to police data from 2016 and 2017. Among male offenders, more than half were described as black males younger than 25. \"There is a huge overlap between victims and offenders,\" according to the knife crime plan.\n\nNext, let\u2019s look at who the offenders might be. The 80-page document makes no mention of Muslims or immigrants. Rather, in a section titled, \"Who are the offenders and who are the victims,\" the plan cites a police analysis that found almost 90 percent of offenders were male in 2016 and 2017, and of those, 62 percent were people described as having black, Asian and other minority ethnic backgrounds\n\nA public information request PolitiFact sent to the Metropolitan Police Service on Feb. 5 seeking information about the 2018 offenders\u2019 religion, ethnicity and immigration status was not immediately answered.\n\nThe service doesn\u2019t release information about the religion or immigration status of criminal suspects, said Callum Jones, a spokesman for the service.\n\n\"There is no way that police or any other agency would have released statistics based on the religion and/or immigration status of offenders, so the information is clearly false,\" he said of the Facebook post.\n\n\"We don\u2019t normally give out ethnic breakdown of perpetrators/victims,\" Jones also said. But he added that \"knife crime disproportionately affects boys and young men of African-Caribbean heritage.\" In the 12 months through November 2018, 94 percent of offenders were male.\n\nIt\u2019s relatively unusual for a violent incident to involve a knife in England, according to a BBC story from Nov. 5, 2018. \"Most violence is caused by people hitting, kicking, shoving or slapping someone, sometimes during a fight and often when they\u2019re drunk.\"\n\nKnife crime is more prevalent in large cities, like London, the BBC reported, saying that the reasons cited range from police budget cuts to gang violence.\n\nFinally, lacking hard numbers proving the claim true, we turned to some experts.\n\nStephen Case, a criminology professor at Loughborough University in England called the Facebook post \"absolute nonsense.\" He said he hasn\u2019t seen any police statistics that substantiate it. \"I would doubt that the police collect stats on immigration status or religion at point of arrest,\" he said.\n\n\"This one\u2019s pretty outlandish!\" said Iain Brennan, a psychologist who studies criminology at the University of Hull in England. The claims about the religion and immigrant status of offenders are unlikely to be verifiable, he said, because they\u2019re not official categories that the country\u2019s Ministry of Justice would include in their statistical releases.\n\n\"At the very minimum,\" he continued, \"it\u2019s false because the date of posting means it would be impossible for the fact to be verified as any claim would have to be based on convictions, which take a long time to occur.\"\n\nWhere does that leave us?\n\nWe could find no data showing that Muslim immigrants are responsible for most knife attacks in London. A spokesman for the city\u2019s police service denied that the claim was true, and academics we reached out to concurred. The burden of proof is on the Facebook post, and discovering no evidence to corroborate its claim, we rate this statement False.", "lang": "en"}
