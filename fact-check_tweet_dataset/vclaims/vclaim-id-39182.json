The claim is misleading; the notes contain several inaccuracies about COVID-19; the Thai doctor named in the posts as the source of the notes denied writing them.\n\nThe photos were published on Facebook here on March 1, 2020. The post has since been shared more than 2,800 times.\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Thai-language caption translates to English as: \u201cA doctor has written an objective summary of \u2018COVID-19\u2019 in an easy way to read. I want you to read and understand it, to prepare for any circumstance that might happen. #FightTogetherThaiPeopleWhoAreResponsibleForTheSociety\n\n\"Source: It was shared, I see the information is not far beyond the truth. There is a foundation method that we can do, so I shared it for everyone\u2019s benefits\n\n\"It\u2019s identified as the handwriting of Doctor Thoranin Kongsuk\u201d.\n\nThe first photographed document is titled \u201cAbout COVID-19\u201d. It claims that coronavirus symptoms emerge only after the virus has entered a person\u2019s bloodstream.\n\nThe second document is titled \u201cThe Danger of COVID-19\u201d. It claims COVID-19 can cause permanent damage to a patient's lungs.\n\nThe third photo is titled \u201cPrevention Methods\u201d and details various coronavirus precautionary measures.\n\nThe photos were also posted alongside a similar claim on Facebook here, here, here, here, here, here and here.\n\nHealth experts in Thailand refuted the claim that coronavirus symptoms emerge only after the virus has entered one\u2019s bloodstream.\n\nDr. Thiravat Hemachudha, the head of the Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Center at Chulalongkorn University, explained that while the coronavirus could enter a person\u2019s bloodstream, it is not a factor that will influence respiratory symptoms.\n\n\u201cRespiratory illness symptoms such as coughing or sore throat are the human body\u2019s reactions when it is exposed to coronavirus. These symptoms are signals that there is something abnormal happening in the body,\u201d Hemachudha told AFP by phone on March 5, 2020.\n\nDr. Hemachudha added that \u201c20 percent of patients who are infected with coronavirus will have severe symptoms, while the other 80 percent will not. However, this group of patients can still spread to others\u201d.\n\nHemachudha also said that while the coronavirus can cause permanent lung damage in very severe cases, in many other cases the virus will never reach a patient\u2019s lungs.\n\nOnly in the most acute cases, Dr. Hemachuta said, would a patient ever see lung deterioration and subsequent long-term damage.\n\n\u201cLung infection is the sign that the body has fought with the virus more than necessary, causing the blood vessels to release fluid,\u201d he said.\n\nThe photographed document detailing precautionary measures do partially align with official guidelines released by the World Health Organization (WHO), namely washing your hands frequently and not touching your face.\n\nDr. Thoranin Kongsuk, the doctor cited as the source of the handwritten notes in the misleading posts, denied he wrote the notes in a Facebook post on March 2, 2020.\n\n\u201cI hereby wish to inform your understanding that these documents are not mine,\u201d Dr.Kongsuk posted.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of Dr. Kongsuk\u2019s post:\n\nDr. Kongsuk also told AFP by phone on March 9, 2020: \u201cI didn\u2019t write the document. First of all, that is not my handwriting and that information contains factual inaccuracies.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
