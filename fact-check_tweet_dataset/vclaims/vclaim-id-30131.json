As lawmakers in Washington and allies around the world grappled with President Trump\u2019s decision to launch a strike that killed Iran\u2019s most important general, an Arizona Republican, Representative Paul Gosar, shared a fake image from his personal Twitter account on Monday purporting to show President Barack Obama shaking hands with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran. The two men have never met in person.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Mr. Rouhani is still the president, contradicting Mr. Gosar\u2019s suggestion that he is no longer \u201cin power.\u201d The Iranian flag in the background of the photoshopped image also appears to be incorrect, as it is missing the white Arabic script on its top green bar and a red emblem of a tulip in the central white bar.\n\nThe original photograph was taken in 2011 and showed Mr. Obama meeting with Manmohan Singh, then India\u2019s prime minister.\n\n\u201cNo one said this wasn\u2019t photoshopped. No one said the president of Iran was dead. No one said Obama met with Rouhani in person,\u201d Mr. Gosar tweeted after an outcry over his post, arguing that his point was that \u201cObama coddled, appeased, nurtured and protected the worlds No. 1 sponsor of terror.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
