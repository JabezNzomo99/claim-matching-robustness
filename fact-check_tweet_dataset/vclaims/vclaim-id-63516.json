Many Americans have already received their electronic coronavirus stimulus payments.\n\nA viral Facebook post falsely alleges in an image that Pelosi said, \u201cIf you accept a check from Trump, you might as well vote for him,\u201d despite no record of her ever saying the statement. (RELATED: No, Coronavirus Stimulus Payments Are Not Tied To The 2020 Census)\n\nSearching Pelosi\u2019s verified social media accounts and ProPublica\u2019s archive of her deleted tweets turned up no matches. It also does not appear in any press releases put out by the House speaker\u2019s office.\n\nIn mid-April, Pelosi criticized Trump after media reports said the payments could be delayed to add his name to the checks, saying, \u201cDelaying direct payments to vulnerable families just to print his name on the check is another shameful example of President Trump\u2019s catastrophic failure to treat this crisis with the urgency it demands.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury Department denied that printing Trump\u2019s name was causing a delay, according to The Hill.", "lang": "en"}
