{"title": "Would Labour borrow a trillion pounds?", "subtitle": "The claim that Labour's manifesto promises would cost a trillion pounds is not a fully costed estimate, and we don't know if it refers to spending increases or total spending.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-11383", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/would-labour-borrow-trillion-pounds/", "vclaim": "This claim has a fairly roundabout origin: it was originally that Labour would spend, not borrow, one trillion pounds. It originates from reports of Labour Party insiders saying that there were significant spending commitments in its last manifesto that weren\u2019t fully costed.\n\nBut the meaning of the figure is ambiguous. We don\u2019t know if the claim refers to a trillion pounds of spending in total (the government currently spends around \u00a3840 billion a year), or a trillion pounds of additional spending over an undetermined number of years.\n\nAfter Theresa May made the claim that Labour\u2019s spending would cost a trillion pounds (one thousand billion) in her Conservative Party conference speech this year, the academic Philip Cowley suggested the claim might well be based on a finding in his latest book. (The book is the most recent installment of a well-respected series of academic works analysing each general election since World War II.)\n\nHis book reports that some Labour insiders said that their \u201cfully costed\u201d 2017 manifesto actually had significant unaccounted spending (Professor Cowley quotes one anonymous Labour staffer as saying \u201cIt didn\u2019t add up!\u201d).\n\nThe manifesto and funding plan detailed around \u00a349 billion of extra annual spending to be funded through higher taxes. There was also a commitment to set up a \u00a3250 billion infrastructure fund over ten years. Professor Cowley wasn\u2019t trying to get to the bottom of Labour\u2019s spending figures: the context for the discussion is the Conservative party\u2019s choice not to publish their own costings, leaving them less able to attack Labour\u2019s manifesto, which is described by a Labour figure as a \u201chuge mistake\u201d.\n\nProfessor Cowley reports one Labour insider as saying that the Conservatives could have credibly claimed, as an attack line during the election, that there was one trillion pounds of spending commitments in Labour\u2019s manifesto, if they had scrutinised Labour\u2019s costings more. \u201cSuch a claim would have involved the Conservatives being a bit imaginative, but it would have been \u2013 our source felt \u2013 at least plausible for them to have done so\u201d he wrote for the New Statesman.\n\nThat\u2019s not quite the same thing as Labour\u2019s manifesto definitely costing \u00a31 trillion, or even Labour sources believing that\u2019s what it cost (and, as mentioned earlier, we don\u2019t know whether this refers to total spending or increased spending). But the book does suggest that Labour staffers believed they were committed to more spending than their manifesto claimed.", "lang": "en"}
