This includes young offender institutions, secure children\u2019s homes and secure training centres.\n\nIt\u2019s also correct that there is an increasing proportion of BAME young offenders in the secure estate. The number of Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) young offenders in the secure youth estate is decreasing, but not as quickly as the number of white young offenders.\n\nThe number of young people given any type of sentence in court has been falling. It was just under 97,000 in 2005/06 compared to fewer than 28,000 in 2015/16.\n\nOnly about 6% are given a custodial sentence in any given year.\n\nThe number of young offenders sentenced to custody in the \u201csecure youth estate\u201d has also been falling.\n\nOn average there were 959 under 18s in the secure youth estate in any given month in 2015/16, down from 2,832 across 2005/06. Provisional figures suggest that it continued to decrease in 2016/17, and then will increase slightly to 921 in 2017/18.\n\nWe\u2019re looking into the reasons behind this fall in numbers. The Lammy Review says that Youth Offending Teams have been largely successful in reducing youth offending and reoffending.\n\nIn 2015/16 the most common primary offences of young people in custody were \u2018violence against the person\u2019 (34% of young offenders in custody) and robbery (25%).\n\nDespite the overall fall, the numbers being held in custody for some types of offences is increasing; namely drug offences and sexual and violent offences.\n\nA higher proportion of young offenders in custody are BAME\n\nIt\u2019s correct that the proportion of young BAME offenders in the secure youth estate is increasing. It went from 25% of the population in custody in 2005/06 to 41% in 2015/16.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the number of BAME young offenders in custody has increased \u2013 over the ten years it went from 701 down to 398. But the number of BAME young offenders in the secure youth estate hasn\u2019t decreased as quickly as the number of young white offenders has.\n\nThe review by David Lammy concluded that there was no single reason for the overrepresentation of people from BAME backgrounds (both young and old) in the criminal justice system.\n\nIt said that BAME people were more likely to be arrested, but that this didn\u2019t fully explain their over-representation in the secure estate. They were also more likely to plead not guilty in court (the review found that when someone pleaded guilty they were more likely to receive a shorter sentence or a community sentence).\n\nThe review also looked into the severity of sentences given to BAME people. It found that they were more likely than white defendants to receive a prison sentence for drug offences at the Crown Court in 2015, even once past convictions were taken into account. But it wasn\u2019t able to find an \u201cevidence-based explanation\u201d for this happening.\n\nWe\u2019ve looked more into this here.\n\nDifferent stages in the criminal justice system\n\nThe proportion of young BAME people varies at different points in the criminal justice system.\n\nRoughly 18% of 10 to 17 year olds identified as BAME at the time of the 2011 census. In comparison 25% of 10 to 17 year olds arrested for a crime in 2015/16 were BAME and 41% of those in the secure youth estate.", "lang": "en"}
