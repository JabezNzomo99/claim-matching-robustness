Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Priyanka Gandhi has said \u2212 \u2018If there is no Namaz on roads, then there will be no Yoga in parks\u2019. Fact: Priyanka Gandhi hasn\u2019t made any such statement. Information from no credible source was found to authenticate the claim. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched on Google if Priyanka Gandhi has made any such statement, no search result with relevant information was found. If she had really made such statements, owing to the sensitivity of the statement, it would have been reported by all the major newspapers and channels in India. But no news agency has reported anything about Priyanka Gandhi making such a statement.\n\nWhen a Twitter advanced search was performed on the official Twitter account of Priyanka Gandhi with the text \u2018\u0938\u0921\u093c\u0915\u094b\u0902 \u092a\u0930 \u0928\u092e\u093e\u091c \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u094b\u0917\u093e \u0924\u094b \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0915\u094b\u0902 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092f\u094b\u0917 \u092d\u0940 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u094b\u0917\u093e\u2019, it was found that she hasn\u2019t tweeted anything about it.\n\nEarlier, when posts claiming Priyanka Gandhi has made statements praising the Pakistan Army had gone viral, FACTLY has debunked it and written the fact-check article which can be read here.\n\nTo sum it up, Priyanka Gandhi has not made any statement indicating that \u2018If there is no Namaz on the roads, then there will be no Yoga in the parks\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
