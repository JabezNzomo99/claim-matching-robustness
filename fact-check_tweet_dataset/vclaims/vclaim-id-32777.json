They originate from a website which falsely impersonates BBC News.\n\nKobe Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna died in a helicopter crash on 26 January. Since then, a number of false web pages claiming that his 17-year-old daughter Natalia had died by suicide, and recorded herself doing it, have spread online.\n\nNatalia is still alive. On February 24, Natalia and her two younger sisters attended a public, televised memorial service for Mr Bryant at the Staples Centre in Los Angeles, where her mother Vanessa Bryant paid tribute to her late husband.\n\nAlthough the web pages claiming Natalia died purport to be from BBC News, they are just impersonating the BBC by using its logo. The \u201csuicide videos\u201d are posted on black backgrounds, which is not in the BBC\u2019s style, and have URLs which are clearly not related to the BBC.\n\nThe \u201csuicide video\u201d of Natalia is also not a video at all and in some versions links through to another false story about actor Will Smith and his son Jaden dying in a car crash\u2014falsely purporting to be from CNN.\n\nNone of the web pages show any evidence that Natalia has died, and it has not been reported by any news outlets.\n\nAnother viral claim circulating on Facebook is that Natalia\u2019s mother Vanessa has killed herself. We have fact-checked this too, and it is also false.", "lang": "en"}
