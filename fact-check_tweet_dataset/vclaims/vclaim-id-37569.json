The video has been doing rounds on social media since January this year, with the caption \u2013 \u201csmall scale industry in Pakistan.\u201d\n\nThe video was viral both on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThe video was circulating on WhatsApp as well. Alt News found that it was viral last year also, including on YouTube, with the same \u2018Pakistan\u2019 claim.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nThe video itself gives away the falsehood of the claim.\n\n1. If one looks closely, the words \u2018\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u091a\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0921\u094d\u0930\u0928 \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 (Bharatiya Children Bank)\u2019 are printed on the notes.\n\n2. Some of the notes also have the words \u2018Manoranjan Bank of India\u2019 printed on them\n\n3. Another hint that the notes are fake is the absence of \u2018\u20b9\u2019 before the currency value. The comparison of a fake note (left) and a specimen of a real note (right) juxtaposed together gives a clearer picture.\n\nIn 2017, the media had reported that an SBI ATM in Delhi dispensed Rs 2,000 notes with \u2018Children\u2019s Bank of India\u2019 printed on them.\n\nA similar event took place in UP last year. Rs 500 notes were dispensed from a BOI ATM with \u2018Children\u2019s Bank of India\u2019 printed on them.\n\nThe Outlookhad reported a counterfeit currency racket last year where a stash of Rs 32 lakh \u2018Children\u2019s Bank of India\u2019 notes was recovered.\n\nWhile the origin of the video could not be established by Alt News, it seems to be taken inside a printing press. Boomlivehad reported that a man in the background can be heard speaking Marathi. The video was also debunked by SM Hoaxslayerearlier this month when it was being shared as \u2018fake notes printed in Bangladesh.\u2019", "lang": "en"}
