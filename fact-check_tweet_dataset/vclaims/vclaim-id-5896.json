As explained here by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), vaccines are used to prevent, rather than treat, infection, \u201cworking with the body\u2019s natural defenses to safely develop immunity to disease.\u201d Vaccines mimic an infection, causing the body to produce antibodies and defensive white blood cells, in order to help develop immunity.\n\nThe CDC says that a scientist\u2019s approach to a given vaccine depends on whether the infection the vaccine will prevent is caused by a virus or by bacteria. There are also \u201cpractical considerations, such as regions of the world where the vaccine would be used,\u201d which are \u201cimportant because the strain of a virus and environmental conditions, such as temperature and risk of exposure, may be different across the globe.\u201d ( here )\n\nDifferent types of vaccines include live, attenuated vaccines; inactivated vaccines; toxoid vaccines; subunit vaccines; and conjugate vaccines. More information on how each kind works can be found here , provided by the CDC, and www.vaccines.gov/basics/types , provided by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS).\n\nVaccines have been successful in helping to eliminate diseases formerly prevalent in the United States. Viruses prevented by vaccines include polio, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, smallpox, measles, mumps, rubella, and rotavirus. Examples of bacterial infections prevented by vaccines include tetanus and pneumococcal disease ( here , here ).\n\nThe claim that doctors do not administer vaccines for viruses because viruses need to run their course may stem from a confusion between vaccines and antibiotics. As explained here by the Mayo Clinic, antibiotic drugs typically fight bacterial infections, \u201cbut they aren't effective against viruses.\u201d\n\n\u201cAntibiotics cannot kill viruses because bacteria and viruses have different mechanisms and machinery to survive and replicate. The antibiotic has no \u2018target\u2019 to attack in a virus,\u201d according to Drugs.com ( here ).\n\nIn fact, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) warns against using antibiotics when you have a virus, as they \u201ccan put you at risk of getting a bacterial infection that is resistant to antibiotic treatment\u201d ( here ).\n\nCertain viral infections, like the common cold, do not have available vaccines. Since they are caused by viruses, they cannot be treated with antibiotics, and, without available antiviral medications, they must \u201crun their course.\u201d (here , here ).\n\nThe current scientific approach to finding a cure for COVID-19 involves the search for a variety of treatments. Currently, more than half a dozen drugmakers around the world are conducting advanced clinical trials, each with tens of thousands of participants, and several expect to know if their COVID-19 vaccines work and are safe by the end of 2020 ( here ).\n\nMeanwhile, pharmaceutical companies and labs are working to develop antiviral treatments for COVID-19. \u201cSince the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is new,\u201d however, \u201cthere is limited evidence regarding specific antivirals that may work against it,\u201d according to the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine ( here ). One antiviral candidate is Remdesivir, an experimental COVID-19 drug currently used under emergency authorization ( here ).\n\nBeyond the quest for a vaccine and effective antiviral medications, other treatments currently being tested for the novel coronavirus include monoclonal antibodies, dexamethasone, and convalescent blood plasma therapy. More information about them can be found here .\n\nFalse. Vaccines are used to successfully prevent some viruses and bacterial illnesses. Antibiotics, on the other hand, typically treat bacterial rather than viral infections.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
