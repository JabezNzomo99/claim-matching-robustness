Beto O\u2019Rourke and another man who the post identifies as El Chapo.\n\nThe photo, which was published on Jan. 30 and shared more than 12,000 times by Jan. 5, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) And rightfully so \u2014 this Texas-based PolitiFact correspondent knows the congressman from the state\u2019s 28th district when she sees him.\n\nThe man identified as El Chapo is actually U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar from Texas. Cuellar even posted the same picture to Facebook back when it was taken in 2016.\n\n\"Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and I met with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto in Los Pinos in Mexico City to discuss U.S.-Mexico trade relations, the Trans-Pacific Partnership and immigration,\" Cuellar said in the May 3, 2016 post. \"Our meeting occurred during a bipartisan congressional delegation visit to Mexico, Peru and Child this week focusing on security, trade, migration and human rights.\"\n\nNieto is walking between Cuellar and Pelosi, who issued a statement about the delegation\u2019s meeting with the Mexican president.\n\n\"At Los Pinos, we appreciated the opportunity to visit with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and to engage in a productive dialogue on security, the economy, migration and human rights issues,\" she said.\n\nAccording to the Rio Grande Guardian, Pelosi, Cuellar and O\u2019Rourke were joined by U.S. Reps. Richard Hanna, Lucille Roybal-Allard, Linda Sanchez, Michael Fitzpatrick, Michelle Lujan-Grisham, Pete Aguilar, Ruben Gallego and Norma Torres.\n\nNone of those people are Mexican drug lord El Chapo.\n\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
