Tony Evers and firearm confiscation is getting new life online amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMany on Facebook have recently picked up a story from April 2019 headlined \"Wisconsin gov. pushing firearm confiscation orders.\"\n\nWhen shared, no date for the story is visible on Facebook.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe new life and lack of date gives this claim a very different ring amid the flurry of executive orders by Evers.\n\nThe first-term Democrat has taken a series of dramatic steps to limit activity in Wisconsin as he and officials across the country take steps to contain the spread of coronavirus. His latest \"Safe at Home\" order, issued Tuesday, March 24, 2020, closed non-essential businesses and gathering places until April 24.\n\nBut none of those orders deals with gun confiscations.\n\nThe headline was misleading in 2019.\n\nThe article, from a website called Steadfast and Loyal, describes Evers as \"attacking the Second Amendment.\" But it offers zero proof for that claim or the headline reference to the governor \"pushing firearm confiscation orders.\"\n\nInstead it pastes in a series of paragraphs from a similarly headlined story from far-right Breitbart news, published back in January 2019.\n\nBut neither story actually details Evers proposing any such thing. The Breitbart story \u2014 as quoted by Steadfast and Loyal \u2014 refers to a WISN-TV story about Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, calling for red flag laws during his inaugural address.\n\nWe will note, though the stories didn\u2019t, that Evers had generally voiced support for Kaul\u2019s plan in January 2019.\n\nBut there\u2019s a huge difference between red flag laws and the widespread gun seizures implied by this headline.\n\nRed flag laws provide a mechanism \u2014 with a judge\u2019s approval \u2014 to take guns from people exhibiting dangerous behavior before they harm themselves or others.\n\nRELATED: Do red flag laws allow gun seizure without a judge\u2019s OK?\n\nRELATED: Wisconsin Assembly Speaker's new take on red-flag gun laws still misses target\n\nAt the time the Steadfast and Loyal article was written, Evers hadn\u2019t proposed anything in this vein, but he later did, in November 2019. He called a special session of the Legislature to consider proposals for a red flag law and universal background checks, but Republicans who control the Assembly and Senate immediately closed the session without action.\n\nUnder Evers\u2019 proposal, a law enforcement officer, family member or household member could petition a judge to intervene if they believe an individual is a danger to self or others. The judge then could issue a preliminary order good for up to 14 days, during which the guns could be taken away. A judge would then schedule a full hearing, where the gun owner could present his or her case and the judge could issue a final order valid for up to one year.\n\nA year-old story now circulating again on Facebook says Evers is \"pushing firearm confiscation orders.\"\n\nThat was an overreach in 2019, and it\u2019s even more absurd now.\n\nThe article was referring to red flag laws, but at the time of this post Evers hadn\u2019t proposed one yet. And more importantly, red flag laws are a far cry from the implication this headline gives of some form of widespread gun confiscation.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
