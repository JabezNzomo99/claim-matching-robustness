Experts told Africa Check that studies are outdated and too limited in their scope.\n\u2022 None A 2012 study by the medical research council tracking 3,952 rape cases did find that only 8.6% ended in a guilty verdict. But this does not mean that 8.6% of all rapists are convicted. \n\n\n\n\n\non 26 February 2020. The ad is printed across a double spread and reads in large block letters \u201cwhen raped, use this page\u201d. It encourages rape victims to wrap their clothes in the newspaper to preserve vital evidence.\n\nThe advert also claims that \u201cit is estimated that 40% of South African women will be raped in their lifetime and only 8.6% of rape perpetrators are convicted\u201d.\n\nRape in South Africa often makes headlines. According to the most recent crime statistics,\n\nwere reported to the police in the financial year 2018/19.\n\nDoes that mean 40% of South African women will be raped in their lifetime, but only 8.6% of rapists are convicted? We checked.\n\nfor Rape Crisis, pointed us to two publications for the source of the statistics in the advert.\n\nThe first was\n\nin the now defunct New Age newspaper. It was written by Nonhlanhla Sibanda, then project coordinator for the non-profit\n\nSibanda wrote: \u201cAlthough actual statistics are not known, it is estimated that more than 40% of South African women will be raped in their lifetime.\u201d We contacted her about the source of this statistic, but did not get a response.\n\nThe second source Rape Crisis pointed us to was a\n\ntitled Rape Justice in South Africa by the\n\n. But it does not include the statistic that 40% of South African women will be raped in their lifetime.\n\nResearch on rape statistics is limited and out of date\n\nResearch on the share of South African women who have been \u2013 or will be \u2013 raped is limited.\n\nprovince had been \u201craped by a man, whether a husband or boyfriend, family member, stranger or acquaintance\u201d. The study used a representative sample of\n\n, conducted in the Western Cape province in 2014, found that\n\nreported non-partner rape. Both these studies provide insight into the problem, but they don\u2019t represent the whole country. They can only tell us about the situation in a certain province at a particular time.\n\nThe only national estimate available is from 1998. Then South Africa\u2019s Demographic and Health Survey found that\n\naged 15 to 49 had been \u201cforced to have sex\u201d in their lifetime. But this figure is over 20 years old and was only for a portion of the female population.\n\nAccurate statistics on rape are difficult to produce because of the high cost of producing methodologically sound studies, gender-based violence researcher\n\ntold Africa Check. Researchers also disagree on which method of research produces the most accurate results.\n\n\u201cFar too many of our studies look at women of reproductive age only. So we tend not to have information about what\u2019s happening with older women,\u201d Vetten said. This was the case in the 1998\n\n\u201cWhat they also don\u2019t do, and can\u2019t do, is interview women in prison or other institutions where it\u2019s hard to access individuals. So studies will always underestimate and not take into account key populations.\u201d\n\nVetten said that accurate rape statistics were important in determining the extent of the problem.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s also very important from a distribution of resources point. A politician wants to know how big a problem is before they spend money on it.\u201d\n\nMany rape victims do not report the crime due to stigma, a lack of support from their communities and a distrust in the police, said Nomfundo Mogapi, clinical psychologist and programme manager at the\n\nBoth Vetten and Mogapi said they were not aware of any study that estimated that \u201c40% of South African women will be raped in their lifetime\u201d. The available data is dated and not nationally representative.\n\nOne of the sources provided by Rape Crisis was Rape Justice in South Africa, a\n\n. The study, conducted in 2012, tracked 3,952 rape cases from 170 randomly selected police stations across the country\u2019s nine provinces.\n\nThe majority of the complainants were female (94.1%). Most of the alleged perpetrators of rape were male (99%).\n\nThe study tracked the rape cases through the criminal justice system. Of the 3,952 cases, arrests were made in 57% of cases. Of the original cases, 65% were referred for prosecution. Trials were started in just 18.5% of cases.\n\nThe study found that only 8.6% of cases concluded with a guilty verdict. Neither Mogapi nor Vetten were aware of any more recent studies.\n\nBut the statistic only speaks to the percentage of reported rape cases that end in convictions, said Vetten. It cannot be applied to\n\n\u201crape perpetrators\u201d, as not all crimes are reported.\n\nResearch on the percentage of rapes that are reported to the police in South Africa is limited.\n\nestimated that just 3.9% of women who had been raped (by either a partner or non-partner) had reported it to the police. These findings are 10 years old and not nationally represented.\n\nThere is no recent, national estimate of the percentage of rapes that are reported to the police or the number of rapes that are committed each year. Neither is there data on the percentage of rape perpetrators that are convicted.\n\nWe rate this claim \u201cmisleading\u201d, as it takes a statistic about reported cases and applies it to a larger category of committed crimes.\n\nVictims often decline to continue with cases\n\nThe 2017 study cited by Rape Crisis found that prosecutors declined to prosecute in 34.4% of the cases studied. When researchers examined the documented reasons given, they found that in 67.6% of the cases, it was because the victim said they wanted to \u201cget on with their lives\u201d.\n\nMogapi told Africa Check that rape victims often withdraw charges as they experience retraumatisation and a lack of support when they go through the criminal justice system.\n\n\u201cGoing through the criminal justice system you really need to have psychological support because the experience itself is very traumatic. You are being forced to tell the story over and over again,\u201d Mogapi said. \u201cSome victims end up saying \u2018my mental health is much more important\u2019.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
