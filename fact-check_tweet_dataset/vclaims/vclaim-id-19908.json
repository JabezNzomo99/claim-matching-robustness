Labour politicians say that in particular, it is \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d pupils, \u201cstate school\u201d pupils, or children from \u201clower waged\u201d families who are being put off.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked Labour for the sources of these claims, and haven\u2019t been given an answer.\n\nIn 2016 the number of applicants to UK universities fell slightly, but not by as much as they did in 2012, following the increase in tuition fees. The number of applications to UK universities (which doesn\u2019t include applications made after the June application deadline) rose in 2016. The number of applicants for 2017 (reported after 15 January deadline) showed a fall of 5%. This is the second largest of three falls since 2002.\n\nUCAS don't publish figures on what percentage of university applications come from state school pupils (as was referred to in the claim). The figures we do have may be affected by local authority led schools becoming academies.\n\nAs far as we can see it\u2019s wrong to say there has been any fall in the number of English applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds. The number and rates of young people applying and going to university, including disadvantaged or \u201clower waged\u201d young people, have continued to increase.\n\nWe\u2019re focusing here on the numbers of people living in the UK applying to university in the UK. When figures are only available by each country of the UK, we have focused on applicants in England, as that is where we\u2019ve seen the recent increases to tuition fees and changes to student finance.\n\nThe total number of university applications to the UK rose in 2016 but the number of applicants fell slightly\n\nUCAS publishes data for both the number of applications by UK applicants and the number of applicants.\n\nIn 2016 the number of applicants to UK universities fell slightly from 2015. The number of applications to UK universities rose in 2016, but that doesn\u2019t include applications made after the June application deadline. The January deadline for 2017 shows that the number of applicants to UK universities fell by about 5% compared to the same time in 2016.\n\nSince applicants can make up to five applications, it\u2019s probably more useful to focus on applicant numbers.\n\nThe 2017 fall in total number of applicants was the second largest of three falls since 2002 but it\u2019s harder to compare further back than this, according to UCAS.\n\nThe number and rate of young people applying has continued to increase\n\n18 year old applicant numbers have continued to increase.\n\nApplication rates for 18 year olds in England reached a record high of 37% by the 2017 January deadline, although this is a smaller increase than seen in previous years.\n\nApplication rates refer to how many from a certain group apply to university. Generally rates are more useful in this area because they aren\u2019t influenced by changes in the overall population.\n\nFor English students leaving school in 2016 their application rate was the highest ever recorded at 45% (including applications by this group in 2016 and 2017).\n\nApplication rates for older age groups and particular subjects have fallen\n\nApplication rates for all older age groups in England, aged 20 and over, have fallen, and by an amount comparable to the drop for all age groups seen in 2012.\n\nParticular subjects have seen larger falls too. The number of applicants from England studying nursing fell by 23% in 2017. UCAS says this is the, \u201cmost noticeable decrease,\u201d it has seen.\n\nThe Royal College of Nursing blames the fall in nursing on the removal of grants for students studying nursing.\n\nFor older applicants, the fall is probably the result of several factors, according to UCAS\u2014 more people going to university when they are younger, higher employment rates, a higher minimum wage and other educational opportunities such as apprenticeships.\n\nAs for the fall in the total number of students applying to university, some suggest the increasing cost of university is beginning to put off students. In 2017 the cost of tuition fees will go up for the first time since 2012.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to say if the recent fall in applications reflects a shift in the longer term trend, which has generally been one of increasing numbers of people continuing to go to university. \n\n\n\nThe number of disadvantaged students applying hasn\u2019t fallen according to UCAS\u2019 measures\n\nShadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner also made a similar claim on BBC Question Time, where she seemed to say the number of disadvantaged students going to university has fallen.\n\nAs far as we\u2019re aware, there haven\u2019t been any falls in UCAS\u2019 published measures of \u201clower-waged\u201d or disadvantaged students.\n\nThe number of 18 year olds living in the most disadvantaged areas in the UK applying to university has been increasing.\n\nSo has the rate. 22.1% of 18 year olds living in the most disadvantaged areas in the UK applied by the January 2017 deadline, up from 21.7% in 2016, and from 20.7% in 2015.\n\nThe same is true of people living in England specifically.\n\nThe other measures we\u2019re aware of to look at students from low wage families relate only to the rates of young people going to university (so these are effectively a year behind the application figures).\n\nThese are all still at record highs, although there has been some levelling off in the growth in the past year or so.\n\nThe rates of disadvantaged young people going to university (both at the age of 18, and for school leavers) has continued to increase.\n\nThe entry rate for state school pupils in England who received free school meals at the age of 15 has continually increased, and is now at a record high of 16.1% (in 2016, up from 15.9% in 2015 and 14.7% in 2014).\n\nThe entry rate among 18 year olds in England who UCAS identify as being least likely to enter higher education, based on things like their ethnicity and where they live, has continued to increase too. It is now 13.6% in 2016, up from 13.5% in 2015, and 13.1% in 2014.\n\nNumbers applying from \u201cstate schools\u201d has fallen, but not from all state-funded schools\n\nThe number of 18 and 19 year olds from schools defined in UCAS\u2019 figures as \u201cstate schools\u201d who applied to university has fallen between 2015 and 2016 in the UK, and in England specifically.\n\nBut we can\u2019t read too much into this without more information.\n\nThis category excludes many state funded schools and providers, as academies, grammar schools, sixth form colleges and further education providers are all counted separately.\n\nSchools decide their own category into the UCAS system, so UCAS said schools counted in the \u201cstate funded\u201d category will be state-funded ones that didn\u2019t identify with any of the other categories. UCAS said it would \u201ctypically\u201d refer to local authority maintained schools.\n\nWith growing numbers of schools becoming academies, we know that at least some schools will have moved their self-categorisation from \u201cstate school\u201d to \u201cacademy\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately UCAS doesn\u2019t publish information on the proportions of state school students applying to university, so we can\u2019t take account of potential underlying changes to the total number of pupils at each school type.\n\nWhat we can say is that including all state-funded schools and colleges (everything but \u201cindependent\u201d schools in UCAS\u2019 statistics), the number of young applicants continues to increase in the UK and in England.", "lang": "en"}
