The original photograph was found on a website Live Cities which had published an article about the woman seen in the picture, posted below.\n\nIn the above photograph, the woman shown seated next to PM Modi is Dr. Gurdeep Kaur Chawla, who is an interpreter. She is the founder-director of Indian Languages Services, a California-based organisation that provides interpretation and translation services. Dr. Chawla has been seen on numerous occasions with top political leaders and corporate doyens from across the globe. Dr. Chawla has been profiled by more than one news organisation, including Economic Times, ABP Asmita and Punjab Kesari.\n\nAlt News could not independently verify the identity of the woman in the photoshopped image of PM Modi shared on social media. Image morphing is the simplest and most common technique used for spreading misinformation on social media, and is especially used to malign individuals. It does not require expertise- there are numerous tools for the same. Viewers and readers are encouraged to verify images they may find suspect, through tools like reverse image search.", "lang": "en"}
