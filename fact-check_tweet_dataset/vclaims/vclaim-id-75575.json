The stories seemed to have originated from a spurious graphic shared on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nExpress's story said Kamal Amrohi in a fit of rage said 'talaq' thrice to Meena Kumari, only to regret it later but not before the actress had to undergo the horrifically demeaning practice of Nikah Halala.\n\nHalala is a practice of reconciliation where a divorced woman marries another man, consummates the marriage and gets a divorce by mutual consent from the second man. Only after which she can reunite with the first husband.\n\nMeena Kumari was reported to have followed this by marrying actress Zeenat Aman\u2019s father Aman Ullah Khan before she could remarry Amrohi.\n\nQuite a remarkable tidbit of Bollywood trivia expect that we were hearing it for the first time. BOOM searched online for old tabloid articles on the tragedian whose memory is immortalized in cult movies such as Pakeezah and movies like Baiju Bawra and Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam.\n\nWhile much has been written about Meena Kumari including a rumoured affair with actor Dharamendra, none of the stories mention the word 'talaq'. This includes Meena Kumari: The Classic Biography written by veteran journalist Vinod Mehta. (Source: Men who loved and left Meena Kumari)\n\nBut not everyone was fooled. Safvi a historian and author was one of the first to call the story fake on Twitter.\n\nBOOM spoke to Delhi-based playwright Danish Iqbal whose play 'Daastaan-e-Dard' on the life of Meena Kumari is currently in rehearsal stage. Iqbal who has researched the actress' life for his play rubbished the idea that she was a victim of triple talaq.\n\nIqbal toold BOOM that on the contrary it was Meena who eventually walked away from the relationship. He said that he had seen letters from Amrohi to Meena asking her to return. Iqbal also said there were anecdotes that Amrohi had asked an employee to keep tabs on her which caused a fallout between the couple.\n\nMeena Kumari born Mahjabeen Bano was born to Sunni Muslim father Master Ali Bux and mother Iqbal Begum, whose original name was Prabhawati Devi, a Bengali Christian who converted to Islam. (August 1st, 1933)\n\nIn 1952, at the age of 19 Meena Kumari married 34-year-old writer director Kamal Amrohi. The marriage was her first and Amrohi's third (Bilkis Bano, Mehmoodie were his other wives) It is reported that Amrohi first met Meena when she was six years old and he was looking to cast a child artist for a film he was working on.\n\nMeena Kumari died of cirrhosis of the liver precipitated by excessive drinking on March 31st, 1972. She was buried at Shia cemetery Rahematabad Qabristan, located at Narialwadi, Mazgaon in Mumbai.\n\nWhen Kamal Amrohi died in 1983 he was buried next to Meena Kumari in Rehmatabad Qabristan.\n\nThis is corroborated by Tajdar Amrohi, son of Kamal Amrohi from his second wife Mehmoodie. (Source)\n\nTajdar who planned to make a movie on his step mother who he refers to as \"Chotti Ammi\" has been quoted several times in the past insisting that Meena Kumari and his father were never legally separated though he has spoken candidly about the breakdown of their marriage.
