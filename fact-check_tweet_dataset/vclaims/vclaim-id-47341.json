No, that's not true: The photo of the spray-painted Jimi Hendrix statue used to imply recent vandalism is from 2013. There is no evidence that the Jimi Hendrix statue in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood has been vandalized in 2020.\n\nThe claim appeared in a post (archived here) where it was published by a Facebook user on June 24, 2020. It read:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nThe sentence \"ALL STATUE LIVES MATTER\" is a play on the phrase and organization \"Black Lives Matter.\"\n\nThe statue of Hendrix was not recently defaced like the Facebook post and accompanying photo insinuates. The statue of Hendrix was spray-painted in September of 2013 as part of a vandalism spree. This is what the 2013 vandalism looked like:\n\nHendrix was born in Seattle in 1942. Although Hendrix died at 27, he is still regarded as one of the most celebrated guitarists of all time.\n\nSome of the post about the Jimi Hendrix statue also included a similar claim about a Stevie Ray Vaughan memorial in Austin, Texas.
