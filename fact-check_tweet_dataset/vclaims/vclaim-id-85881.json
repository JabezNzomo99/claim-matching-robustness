But is that the whole story?", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-01T20:05:47Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85881", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/12/31/claims-regarding-obamas-use-of-executive-orders-and-presidential-memoranda/", "vclaim": "A number of readers have asked about these statements by the president, especially in the wake of a recent USA Today article that highlighted President Obama\u2019s use of another form of executive action, known as a presidential memorandum. The article asserted that Obama has \u201cissued a form of executive action known as the presidential memorandum more often than any other president in history\u201d and that when executive orders and memorandums are combined, Obama has taken more \u201chigh-level executive action\u201d than any president since Harry S. Truman.\n\nSo already one can see that it is difficult to count presidential memoranda; not all of Obama\u2019s were published in the Federal Register, although they all are listed on the White House Web site. In fact, comparing the number of executive orders by presidents is difficult enough because they only started to be numbered in 1907, so historians had to dig into the records to find them before that date. It was only after a law was passed in 1935 that executive orders were required to be published in the Federal Register.\n\nThus executive orders are the easiest to track \u2014 the tip of the iceberg, so to speak \u2014 while presidential memoranda are hidden beneath the surface. But not all executive orders are earth-shattering; some appear banal, such as changing the name of the National Security Council staff and making the day after Christmas a holiday for federal workers. Meanwhile, one of the presidential actions on the Affordable Care Act \u2014 the delay in implementing the employer mandate \u2014 that led to a lawsuit by House Republicans was accomplished through neither an executive order nor a presidential memorandum; it was just a Treasury Department notice.\n\nJust going by the numbers on executive orders, Obama has issued them at a lower rate than any president since Grover Cleveland. Much like the White House, various news organizations have frequently cited the count on executive orders to suggest the GOP attack on Obama\u2019s alleged overreach lacked much basis. The Washington Post has done so on at least two occasions; other news organizations include 538, the New Republic and The Huffington Post.\n\nLowande said he picked that start date as \u201cpractical research decision\u201d because he did not have enough time to go back further. He added that \u201cmy data only include those that presidents chose (for whatever reason) to publish.\u201d He noted that USA Today\u2019s assertion that Obama has issued the \u201cmost ever\u201d was not correct. \u201cMore accurately, he has deemed more of his important enough to publish in the Federal Register,\u201d he said.\n\nWoolley, however, expressed some skepticism that transparency was the main reason. \u201cI suspect the president (and his staff) are interested in minimizing numbered executive orders simply because they are easily countable,\u201d he said. \u201cPresidents mostly don\u2019t like \u2018score-keeping\u2019 especially when it can be used to criticize them. But the other benefits that come with publication are real, so he publishes unnumbered orders often. And selectively emphasizes other executive action.\u201d\n\nAn administration official, who would not be directly quoted, said executive orders are usually used when amending a previous EO, issuing a presidential directive to a large number of agencies, or issuing a directive that has a substantial effect on the public; presidential memoranda are generally used for directives that are to a limited number of agencies or for issues that are more technical or limited in scope. (He provided numerous examples, mainly to rebut the implications of the USA Today article.)\n\nWoolley said that, historically, this was not the case, however. \u201cIn the old days, orders were issued and enumerated that were very specific, nitpicking things,\u201d he said. \u201cIn creating a history of EOs, people working in the 1930s gathered all kinds of little orders and called them EOs. So in a historical sense, there is just not much basis for saying that there has been some kind of clearly understood hierarchy of orders.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
