The yolk of flamingo eggs is a similar colour to that of chickens - yellow to reddish. It can sometimes have a slight pink hue from the bird\u2019s diet, but not similar to that shown in the viral photo. The shells and whites are also not pink.\n\nFlamingos get their distinct pink colour from the pigments that naturally occur in their diet. At birth, flamingos are grey, and their colour builds up over a number of years.\n\nThe photo shared on Facebook appears to be an edit of a stock image of an egg.", "lang": "en"}
