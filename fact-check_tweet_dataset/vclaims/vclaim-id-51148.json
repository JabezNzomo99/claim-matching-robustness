Many states, including Texas, have their own flag codes as well.\n\nA popular legend claims that, because Texas was once an independent nation, it is the only state that can fly its flag at the same height at the U.S. flag. The Facebook post, which has garnered nearly 300 likes, makes a similar claim.\n\nHowever, any state can fly its flag side-by-side with the American flag at the same height, with some provisions.

Texas state code makes other stipulations: the flags should be displayed on flagpoles of equal height, and the flags themselves should be of approximately equal size.\n\nThe American flag must be displayed in the center and higher than other flags when flown with multiple state flags on separate flagpoles, according to the U.S. Flag Code. Similarly, it must be flown at the top when sharing the same flagpole.\n\nNo flag may fly above or in \u201csuperior prominence\u201d to the U.S. flag, according to the U.S. Flag Code.", "lang": "en"}
