{"title": "PolitiFact - Don\u2019t believe this blog post about Quaden Bayles committing suicide", "subtitle": "After his mother posted a video of him sobbing and saying he wanted to die because he was being bullied for dwarfism, 9-", "author": "www.politifact.com", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-38645", "url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/05/blog-posting/dont-believe-blog-post-about-quaden-bayles-committ/", "vclaim": "After his mother posted a video of him sobbing and saying he wanted to die because he was being bullied for dwarfism, 9-year-old Quaden Bayles drew worldwide support, including from actor Hugh Jackman, Boston Celtics player Enes Kanter and Eric Trump, President Donald Trump\u2019s son.\n\nNow, a blog post is trafficking in some of the worst kind of clickbait: a hoax that the Australian child has committed suicide.\n\nThe post, which says it was published \"15 mins ago\" regardless of when you view it on the website, features the BBC News logo and video with this description: \"The BULLIED 9-yrs old Kid \u2018Quaden Bayles\u2019, KILLED himself, Left a \u2018Suicide VIDEO\u2019 in his Phone and Sent to Everyone at his School after BULLYING Worsens. - BBC News.\"\n\nClicking on the video leads to this page, with another video that says \"R.I.P. Quaden Bayles 2011-2020.\" The short clip shows an American news anchor saying that police found the body of a 9-year-old before abruptly stopping with this warning: \"This video may show graphic content. Share to continue watching.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nIt\u2019s similar to another hoax suicide report. In February, we debunked claims that Kobe Bryant\u2019s widow killed herself after his death. Like this post about Bayles, that one also featured the BBC News logo and an \"R.I.P\" video that cut off with a warning that told viewers to share it to continue watching.\n\nBBC didn\u2019t report on Bryant\u2019s supposed suicide, and it didn\u2019t report on Bayles allegedly killing himself. We found no other media coverage of such an event, either.\n\nWe rate this blog post Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
