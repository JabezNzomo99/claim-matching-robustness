That would be great news \u2014 if true. The interruption of school threatens to create a learning deficit \u2014 and many parents may find it difficult to return to work if children are not in classes.\n\nLet\u2019s examine DeVos\u2019s evidence that children do not transmit the coronavirus, as it appears to be influencing administration policy. President Trump echoed her claim in a news briefing Wednesday evening. \u201cThey do say that [children] don\u2019t transmit very easily, and a lot of people are saying they don\u2019t transmit,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t bring it home with them. They don\u2019t catch it easily; they don\u2019t bring it home easily.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the German researchers told The Fact Checker that the results do not apply to a country such as the United States, where infections have been soaring. Germany, by contrast, is among the countries that are considered to have handled the outbreak with skill and diligence, keeping infections per million people relatively low.\n\n\u201cOur results depict a situation with low infection rates after the initial transmission peak is under control,\u201d Jakob Armann, a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at University Children\u2019s Hospital in Dresden and co-author of the study, said in an email. \u201cIf you have rising infection rates \u2014 as in the United States currently \u2014 putting people in close contact will obviously lead to transmission of respiratory viruses as SARS-CoV-2.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe point he was trying to make is that these findings are in contrast to the earlier assumptions that children will spread the virus to a much higher degree than adults,\u201d Armann said. \u201cWe are not trying to argue that children do not spread the virus at all, and you are absolutely right that in high-infection communities, children will get infected and will transmit to close contacts.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, 241,904 child coronavirus cases were reported as of July 16, with children representing 8 percent of all cases. There was a 46 percent increase in child cases from July 2 to July 16, although mortality remains low, with 24 states reporting no child deaths so far.\n\nAlthough there have been relatively few deaths of children \u2014 fewer than 70, according to state reports \u2014 about 3.3 million adults ages 65 and older live in a household with school-age children, according to a July 16 analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. That\u2019s about 6 percent of all seniors in the United States, who have a greater chance of becoming severely ill from the virus if a child becomes infected.\n\nMichael T. Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota\u2019s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, said that too often people have latched on to studies that later turn out to be flawed. \u201cThere have been so many studies, sometimes with strident conclusions, only to be blown out of the water later\u201d when conditions change, he said. \u201cThe bottom-line message is that school-age kids will see transmissions. How much is unclear, but they definitely are not brakes.\u201d\n\nAfter we communicated the response from the German researchers, we received this statement from the Education Department: \u201cThe science remains on the side of reopening schools, even at the highest levels of the medical field. As the Secretary has said, we have to think about the impact on the whole child if schools continue to remain closed. In addition to a quality education, students need the peer-to-peer interaction, access to mental health care, and nutritious food that schools provide. As she has said previously, decisions on schools fully reopening will need to be made on case-by-case basis depending on the local health situation, and the goal should be fully reopening in the fall.\u201d\n\nAs a Cabinet secretary, DeVos has a responsibility to provide accurate information to the public. It\u2019s easy to pick and choose medical studies to assert a political point. But it\u2019s irresponsible to mainly rely on a news account of a report that has not even been peer-reviewed yet \u2014 and that concerns a low-infection environment not yet applicable to the United States.\n\nThere is evidence that children may not get as sick as adults, and younger children especially may not transmit the virus as easily. From an educational perspective, certainly it would be better to provide in-class instruction than to continue remote learning. But to claim that children actually may stop the spread of the disease shows a stunning lack of due diligence.", "lang": "en"}
