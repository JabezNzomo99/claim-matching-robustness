To read the others, click here.\n\nEl Paso Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke, who announced Thursday that he is running for president, had been teasing a presidential bid for weeks.\n\nSpeculation about his intentions prompted the conservative Club for Growth to release a television ad looking to weaken enthusiasm for O\u2019Rourke among Democratic primary voters.\n\nThe ad argues that O\u2019Rourke has coasted through life due to \"white male privilege\" and that he is a far cry from former President Barack Obama, as many have drawn comparisons between the two Democrats.\n\nIt also claims that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s father-in-law, \"a billionaire real estate developer\" from El Paso, \"bankrolled a Super PAC to buy Beto a congressional seat.\"\n\nClub for Growth provided a fact sheet detailing the source for each statement in the advertisement. Sources include newspaper articles and other sources online. O\u2019Rourke did not return a request for comment.\n\nO\u2019Rourke married Amy Hoover Sanders in the early 2000s. Her father, William Sanders, is a wealthy real estate developer who grew up in El Paso.\n\nA review of his finances conducted by Forbes in November of 2018 found that, \"it\u2019s unlikely, though possible, that he\u2019s a billionaire.\" It estimated that Sanders instead has a net worth of about $500 million.\n\nSanders contributed directly to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s congressional campaign in 2012, giving him $5,000 in individual contributions to fund his challenge of then-U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes, an El Paso Democrat who had held his seat for nearly 16 years.\n\nDuring the race, Reyes was targeted by the Campaign for Primary Accountability, a Super PAC with the stated goal of aiding candidates who challenge longtime incumbents from both parties.\n\nThe group, which was founded by Houston\u2019s Leo Linbeck III, targeted candidates in Texas, Ohio, Illinois and a number of other states during the 2012 election, spending upwards of $1.8 million across 15 congressional races.\n\nCampaign finance reports show that the PAC put the largest sum into the O\u2019Rourke-Reyes race: it spent $240,000 against Reyes but did not contribute financially to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign.\n\nSanders did not contribute directly to the Campaign for Primary Accountability PAC, but Campr II Partners, a partnership with ties to Sanders, contributed $37,500 to the group.\n\nHowever, other donors contributed significantly more to the PAC than the partnership. Linebeck gave more than $775,000, businessman Joe J. Ricketts contributed $500,000 and Empower Texans Chairman Tim Dunn gave $350,000. Eric O\u2019Keefe, a co-founder of the PAC, contributed $100,000.\n\nClub for Growth said O\u2019Rourke\u2019s father-in-law, \"a billionaire real estate developer\" from El Paso, \"bankrolled a Super PAC to buy Beto a congressional seat.\"\n\nSanders is not considered a billionaire. He contributed to a PAC that was targeting longtime incumbents in Congress, including O\u2019Rourke\u2019s opponent. But his contribution did not come close to others made to the group.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This is one of four fact-checks featuring a claim made in Club for Growth\u2019s TV ad about Beto O\u2019Rourke.
