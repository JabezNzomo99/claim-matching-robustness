After a year of unsuccessful efforts to repeal and replace the law also known as Obamacare, Republicans on Capitol Hill gave Trump\u2019s move a cool reception.\n\nIf he wins, it would do away with the law\u2019s popular protection for people with pre-existing conditions. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said that should not be a concern.\n\n\"Every single plan that this White House has ever put forward since Donald Trump was elected covered pre-existing conditions,\" Mulvaney said on ABC News\u2019 This Week March 31. \"Every single plan that Republicans in the House voted on in the previous Congress covered pre-existing conditions. Every single plan considered by the Senate covers preexisting conditions.\n\n\"The debate about pre-existing conditions is over. Both parties support them, and anyone telling you anything different is lying to you for political gain.\"\n\nMulvaney\u2019s sweeping declaration about the Republican solutions is misleading. No Republican proposal matches the level of protection in Obamacare, and, at the very least, all open the door to significantly higher rates for people with health problems.\n\nWe reached out to the White House for comment and did not hear back.\n\nIn the old days, insurance companies had ways to avoid selling policies to people who were likely to cost more than insurers wanted to spend. They might deny them coverage outright, or exclude coverage for a known condition, or charge so much that insurance was unaffordable.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act boxes out the old insurance practices with a package of legal moves. First, it says point-blank that carriers \"may not impose any preexisting condition exclusion.\" It backs that up with another section that says they \"may not establish rules for eligibility\" based on health status, medical condition, claims experience or medical history. And while insurers can charge older people more, they can\u2019t charge them more than three times what they charge younger policy holders.\n\nWrapped around all that is a fourth measure that lists the essential health benefits that every plan must offer. A trip to the emergency room, surgery, maternity care and more all fall under this provision. This prevents insurers from discouraging people who might need expensive services by crafting plans that don\u2019t offer them.\n\nThe trade-off for insurers in the law was that everyone had to have insurance. The Republicans' most successful attack on the law was on that point: People who don't have insurance no longer face a fine.\n\nThe gaps in the Republican plans\n\nAll of the Republican bills had language that specifically forbid insurers from denying coverage based on someone\u2019s health history. Yet all of them included wrinkles that could make policies much more expensive, or not offered at all, for people with health issues.\n\nThe House\u2019s American Health Care Act allowed rates for older people to vary as much as 5 to 1 compared with young people; meanwhile, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s limit was 3 to 1. It also gave states the option to let insurance companies set rates based on health.\n\n\"People with pre-existing conditions would have been guaranteed insurance, but there was no guarantee the insurance would cover the benefits they need or be affordable,\" said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a source of neutral data on health policy.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s Better Care Reconciliation Act also expanded the allowable range of rates to 5 to 1. It included a 6-month waiting period for certain people who lost or dropped continuous coverage.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson amendment offered states a block grant program. Under it, states gained the flexibility to allow insurers to set premiums based on health conditions, and states had leeway in defining the essential health benefits that every plan must cover.\n\nShortly before the 2018 midterm elections, a group of 10 Republican senators introduced a bill called Ensuring Coverage for Patients with Pre-Existing Conditions. Despite its name, the bill included an option for companies to deny certain coverage if \"it will not have the capacity to deliver services adequately.\"\n\nBroad agreement on the limits in the GOP legislation\n\n\"Mulvaney means the issue was addressed, nothing more than that,\" said Joe Antos, a health care analyst at the market-oriented American Enterprise Institute, \"At least one Republican bill talked about allowing states to adopt less stringent insurance rules, but requiring that they devote funds to help those with pre-existing conditions. That is less certain than the Affordable Care Act rules, which are unequivocal.\"\n\nA long-standing critic of Obamacare, health care consultant Bob Laszewski, pointed to the same loophole. Asked if the Republican plans fell short of the current law\u2019s protections, he offered a one-word response: \"Agreed.\"\n\n\"The Affordable Care Act sets a fairly high bar,\" said former Republican Senate health care policy staffer Rodney Whitlock. \"And because of that, it\u2019s very challenging for Mulvaney to make the case that pre-existing conditions are covered, under what most people would consider a common definition of coverage.\"\n\nWhitlock and health law professor Wendy Netter Epstein at DePaul University noted the importance of affordability, a key guardrail in Obamacare.\n\n\"I might be offered a health insurance plan, but with rates so high that the offer is meaningless,\" Epstein said. \"Or I might be given a plan that \u2018covers\u2019 me but doesn\u2019t reimburse for essential services that I need. What the Affordable Care Act does is provide assurances that all people, even those with pre-existing conditions, receive meaningful coverage.\"\n\nAntos takes exception to the sweep of that statement. He noted that millions of people in the individual market have not found Affordable Care Act policies affordable.\n\n\"The law leaves out lower-middle-class people who aren\u2019t eligible for ACA subsidies, can\u2019t afford the ACA premium \u2014 or the combination of unsubsidized premium and high cost-sharing means buying an ACA plan doesn\u2019t make sense \u2014 and don\u2019t have employer coverage,\" Antos said. \"The fact that there is no medical underwriting under the ACA doesn\u2019t mean everyone is guaranteed coverage that they can actually afford.\"\n\nStill, another health law researcher, David Gamage at Indiana University, said Mulvaney\u2019s words \"stretched the meaning of coverage.\"\n\n\"Covering pre-existing conditions should be understood as requiring that there would exist real-world options for insurance that would be available and affordable for those with pre-existing conditions,\" Gamage said. \"Most of the Republican plans put forward by the White house or voted on in Congress would have clearly failed this test.\"\n\nMulvaney said that every single Republican health care plan \"covered pre-existing conditions.\" It is accurate to say that all of them addressed the matter, but in one way or another, all of them failed to match the guarantees currently in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA wide range of policy analysts agreed that under each proposal, some people with ongoing health problems potentially faced much higher rates or coverage of fewer benefits than today. For people concerned about pre-existing conditions, the current coverage is stronger than anything Republicans have proposed.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
