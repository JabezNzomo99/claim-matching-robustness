But from the persecution of journalists to a crackdown of free expression online, this claim is false.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "June 11, 2019", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-23004", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-ivan-golunov-press-freedom-russia/29993862.html", "vclaim": "On June 9, Dmitry Kiselyov, the CEO of the Russian government media corporation Rossiya Segodnya and TV host, falsely claimed that freedom of speech in Russia is more robust than virtually anywhere else on Earth.\n\nHis comments were delivered while reporting on the case of Ivan Golunov, the investigative reporter for the independent Russian-language news website Meduza, who was recently detained on questionable drug charges.\n\nThe case prompted a firestorm of social media activity and rallies in support of Golunov, with several Russian media outlets coming out in support of the journalist, who was allegedly beaten while in custody and released under house arrest on June 8.\n\n\u200bThe Kremlin released a statement saying it was monitoring the case.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, June 11, it was announced that the criminal case against Golunov was being closed due to a lack of evidence.\n\nPrior to the decision to free Golunov from house arrest, Kiselyov had said the high profile nature of Golunov\u2019s arrest would guarantee a \u201ctransparent investigation.\u201d\n\nYet, while expressing his belief the authorities would handle the case \u201cwithout bias,\u201d Kiselyov said bias already existed online and in journalistic society, in so far as \u201cfears regarding the end of freedom of speech [in Russia] are piling up.\u201d\n\nKiselyov claimed Russia has long had freer speech \u201cthan anywhere else on the planet,\u201d given that fear has long since disappeared and people are free to write what they want.\n\nThe independent international watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF), which evaluates the state of journalism in 180 countries and territories, ranked Russia 149th in its 2019 World Press Freedom Index.\n\nThe report noted the \u201cdraconian laws and website blocking\u201d that had been introduced in Russia since the 2011-12 anti-government protest movement.\n\n\u201cLeading independent news outlets have either been brought under control or throttled out of existence,\u201d RSF said. \u201cAs TV channels continue to inundate viewers with propaganda, the climate has become very oppressive for those who question the new patriotic and neo-conservative discourse, or just try to maintain quality journalism.\u201d\n\nRSF added: \u201cMore journalists are now in prison than at any time since the fall of the Soviet Union and more and more bloggers are being jailed \u2026 Murders and physical attacks against journalists continue to go unpunished.\u201d\n\nRegarding politically motivated censorship online, Roskomsvoboda, a Russian non-governmental organization, has documented the blocking of millions of websites by authorities, many of them on specious grounds.\n\nThis past March, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed bills allowing Russian authorities to further block websites deemed to be publishing \u201cfake news,\u201d and to imprison for up to 15 days anyone found to have repeatedly insulted state officials, symbols or Russian society.\n\nAs Polygraph.info previously reported, the officials behind those measures are also behind efforts to build a so-called internet Iron Curtain, which would cut Russia off from the global internet.\n\nOne of those officials, State Duma deputy Andrei Lugovoy (who was implicated in the 2006 murder of former Russian secret service officer Alexander Litvinenko, poisoned with radioactive polonium in London), in 2013 co-authored an internet extremism bill that, among other things, allows authorities to block websites publishing calls for unsanctioned protests.\n\nStemming from that legislation, in March 2014, Russian government blocked the LiveJournal blogs of opposition leader Alexei Navalny and the Kasparov.ru and Grani.ru websites on the pretext that they had made \u201ccalls for unlawful activity\u201d during Russia\u2019s annexation of the Crimean peninsula. RSF described Crimea and Chechnya as \u201c\u2019black holes\u201d from which little news and information emerges.\n\nAlso in 2014, Amnesty International found that the right to freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of assembly in Russia had long been only partial and often involved risks for critics of the government.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian government internet watchdog Roskomnadzor also attempted to block the Telegram messaging app in April 2018 for refusing to give Russian security services access to users\u2019 encrypted messages.\n\nIronically, that ban has been flouted, by, among others, Putin\u2019s press secretary Dmitry Peskov and RT editor in Chief Margarita Simonyan.\n\nIt is also illegal in Russia to distribute images of President Putin wearing makeup, while sharing social media memes can lead to criminal prosecution. Meanwhile, Google faced suspension for identifying Crimea as Ukrainian territory.\n\nThose examples, coupled with Golunov\u2019s detention and a host of other acts of violence meted out against journalists, prove Kiselyov\u2019s claims regarding free speech in Russia to be demonstrably false.", "lang": "en"}
