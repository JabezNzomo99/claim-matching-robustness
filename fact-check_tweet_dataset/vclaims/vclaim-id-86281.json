Don\u2019t believe the 5.6. Don\u2019t believe it.\u201d 2019: \u201cThe unemployment rate is the lowest rate it\u2019s been in over 51 years. Think of that. And as I said before about African-American, I now say also about Hispanic-American and Asian-American, unemployment, have reached the lowest rate in the history of our country, unemployment.\"\n\nThe president is still bumbling unemployment statistics. In May 2015, the unemployment rate was 5.6 percent. But Trump often pointed to people who had given up looking for work to claim the unemployment rate was flawed. A subset of the unemployment rate, the U6 rate, which takes into account people who stopped looking for jobs, had fallen from a peak of 17.1 percent in October 2009 to 10.8 percent when Trump spoke. The Fact Checker found Trump\u2019s estimate of 18 to 20 percent to be flat-out false.\n\nThese days, the president readily claims credit for the low unemployment rate and ropes in a variety of claims about the jobless rates for minorities. In May 2019, the unemployment rate was 3.6 percent, which is the lowest rate since December 1969. Trump earned Three Pinocchios for his claims about the African American unemployment statistic. It reached a low of 5.9 percent in May 2018, but . This metric has been in existence for less than 50 years. An older set of government data suggests black unemployment went much lower in the 1950s. The Asian-American statistic has been around for less than 20 years. And while it reached a low of 2 percent in May 2018, it rose to in March, the most recent month for which data are available.\n\n2015: \u201cI\u2019ll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places. I\u2019ll bring back our jobs, and I\u2019ll bring back our money\u2026We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing.\u201d 2019: \"In the eight years before I took office, on average we lost 2,000 manufacturing jobs a month. Since my inauguration we\u2019ve added 16,000 manufacturing jobs a month -- that didn\u2019t happen by accident. \u201c\n\nWhile running for election, Trump regularly promised to revive a struggling manufacturing sector by \u201cbringing back\u201d jobs. The U.S. gained a slim number of manufacturing jobs per month on average in the eight years before Trump took office in large part because of the recession. That doesn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t growth. Manufacturing jobs started to increase steadily in April 2010 \u2014 more than five years before Trump announced he was running for president.\n\n2015: \u201cLast quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product \u2014 a sign of strength, right? But not for us. It was below zero. Whoever heard of this? It\u2019s never below zero.\u201d 2019: \u201cOur economy is the envy of the world, perhaps the greatest economy we have had in the history of our country.\u201d\n\nStill, the president can certainly brag about the state of the economy, but he runs into trouble when he makes a play for the history books. While jobless claims and the unemployment rate are low, economic historians point out the labor force participation rate, business labor productivity, wages and the GDP aren\u2019t growing at the same rate they may have in the past. They noted the economy today is not doing as well as it did under Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson or Bill Clinton \u2014 or Ulysses S. Grant. We\u2019ve previously awarded Trump a Bottomless Pinocchio for this claim.\n\n2015: \u201cWe have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what\u2019s happening. We have a stock market that is so bloated. Be careful of a bubble because what you\u2019ve seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens. So be very, very careful.\u201d 2019: \u201cBut you know, today we had a massive day on the stock market. A lot of good things are happening, but we had a very big day and we\u2019re very close to I think our 68th record. You know, we\u2019ve hit all-time records, just tremendous; I think it\u2019s actually more than that, but it\u2019s a lot.\u201d\n\nStill, Trump regularly cites data from the Dow Jones industrial average, a collection of 30 U.S. \u201cblue chip\u201d companies. But the Standards & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index provides a more nuanced data set. It has grown roughly 5 percent faster than Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index for the largest percentage of overall growth, while the German and British markets declined. As of a year ago, the Japanese and German markets had kept pace with the United States, but in recent months, the U.S. stock market has posted gains that have put it ahead.", "lang": "en"}
