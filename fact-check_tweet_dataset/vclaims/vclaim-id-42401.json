Devin Nunes attempted to claim that earlier comments of his about the coronavirus, in which he encouraged people to go out to eat, had been distorted.\n\n\u201cWhat I was saying is you have empty restaurants, you can go through the drive-thru or do take-out. It\u2019s a great place to go,\u201d said Rep. Nunes.\n\nThis does not align with what he said while on Fox News\u2019 Sunday Morning Futures, with Maria Bartiromo:\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re healthy, you and your family, it\u2019s a great time to go out and go to a local restaurant, likely you can get in easy. Let\u2019s not hurt the working people in this country that are relying on wages and tips to keep their small business going. Don\u2019t run to the grocery store and buy $4,000 of food, go to your local pub.\u201d\n\nTakeout and drive-thru were never suggested as options in Rep. Nunes\u2019 comments, and the language he used suggests actually going inside the restaurant for a sit-down meal. Several of his arguments for going to local restaurants indicate he meant to advise people to eat out -- noting it would be \u201clikely you can get in easy,\u201d urging tipping, and encouraging folks to bring their families. (You don\u2019t need to \u201cget in\u201d at all if you\u2019re going for takeout; some people tip on takeout but the frequency and amount of tipping diminish; and, there\u2019s no reason to bring the family to pick up food to go.)\n\nHealth experts say the best way to slow the spread of coronavirus is through social distancing, and the White House released new guidelines on Monday encouraging people to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people and going to public places like restaurants.\n\nIt is a good thing that Rep. Nunes is now offering guidance that corresponds with advice given by public health professionals, but his suggestion that he was always referring to drive-thru and takeout is inaccurate.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
