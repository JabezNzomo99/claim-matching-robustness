That quote checks out. But it\u2019s not the whole story on Jefferson.\n\nIn 1787, Jefferson wrote to Edward Carrington and presented a seemingly different opinion.\n\n\"The basis of our governments being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right,\" Jefferson wrote. \"And were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter. But I should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them.\"\n\nTrump told the thousands at his rally that he turned around a troubled contract for the F-35 that had been \"seven years late, hundreds of billions of dollars over budget.\"\n\nTrump said he negotiated for the defense contractor Lockheed Martin to shave \"hundreds of millions of dollars off the price.\"\n\nThat\u2019s a line he\u2019s used before. It\u2019s Mostly False.\n\nDefense and budget experts told us that the cost reductions have been coming for years, long before Trump\u2019s arrival into the White House.\n\nSteve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said that the cost reduction for the Air Force variant of the F-35 had been in the works since before Trump announced his candidacy in June 2015.\n\n\"The savings are a little higher than was initially projected, but all President Trump did was elevate attention to the issue,\" Ellis said. \"He\u2019s not responsible for the savings, they were already in the pipeline long before he came on the scene.\"\n\nDefending his stalled immigration ban, Trump said \"there was no way to vet those people. There was no documentation. There was nothing.\"\n\nTrump has said this before. It\u2019s False. A refugee vetting system does exist and has existed since 1980. It involves multiple federal intelligence and security agencies as well as the United Nations. Refugee vetting typically takes one to two years and includes numerous rounds of security checks. Syrians undergo additional checks.\n\nForged documents and passports are a concern in some countries, but that doesn\u2019t give Trump license to say there is no system.\n\n\"No system is foolproof,\" David Martin, a University of Virginia professor who\u2019s previously held posts at DHS and the State Department, has told us. \"If we really wanted a foolproof system, we would shut down immigration entirely.\"\n\nTrump bashed polls that showed he would lose the 2016 election, but he celebrated polls showing an increase in optimism.\n\n\"Look at what\u2019s happening to every poll when it comes to optimism in our country,\" Trump said. \"It\u2019s sweeping across the country.\"\n\nThere is support for Trump\u2019s point, but it ignores other polling that highlights a more pessimistic view.\n\nBacking up Trump\u2019s case is Gallup\u2019s Economic Confidence Index, which shows Americans more confident about the country\u2019s economic outlook. Take a look:\n\nConversely, 57 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of the country\u2019s standing in the world. That\u2019s the highest that number has been in a decade, according to Gallup. And Trump\u2019s approval rating, of 41 percent, is lower at this point than any other president Gallup has tracked since Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nTrump defended his immigration ban by maintaining that his ban applies to \"countries picked by Obama.\"\n\nBut that misses context about the actions of the Obama administration. The Obama-signed law Trump is referring to contains provisions that restrict travel to the United States for people who lived in or visited Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria since March 2011. They must have a visa to enter the United States; they can\u2019t use what is known as the Visa Waiver Program, which allows 90-day U.S. visits to other foreign visitors.\n\nThe law was soon expanded by Obama\u2019s Department of Homeland Security to cover Libya, Somalia, and Yemen. They were identified in the agency\u2019s announcement as \"countries of concern,\" a phrase used in the law.\n\nTrump\u2019s action goes much further and includes banning people who have a valid visa to enter the United States.\n\u2022 Getting past the rhetoric that Trump inherited \"a mess.\"\n\u2022 Trump again said the media doesn\u2019t show his crowds. They do.\n\u2022 Trump is right about the stock markets setting new highs.\n\u2022 Trump says he did \"very well\" with women in the election. Neither polls nor exit polling data back him up.", "lang": "en"}
