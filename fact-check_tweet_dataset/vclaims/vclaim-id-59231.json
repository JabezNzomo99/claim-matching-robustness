We thought you might wonder: Is that true? Did the company pay back its loans plus a profit?\n\n \n\n Final stock sale\n\n \n\n Back in 2008, AIG was in deep trouble. AIG Financial Products had invested heavily in complicated financial instruments called credit default swaps. As financial journalist Michael Lewis put it in his book The Big Short, AIG became, essentially, the world\u2019s biggest owner of subprime mortgage bonds.\n\n \n\n When those bonds turned out to be dangerously hollow, the financial world unraveled. Bear Stearns failed, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac collapsed and Lehman Bros. went bankrupt. After markets reacted badly to the Lehman bankruptcy, the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department decided to rescue AIG.\n\n \n\n Offering $182 billion to stabilize the company, the federal government became its largest stockholder. Two years ago, the Treasury held 92 percent of AIG\u2019s common stock \u2014 more than a billion and a half shares.\n\n \n\n The company made significant changes, including slashing bad investments made by AIG Financial Products, the division that oversaw the controversial credit default swaps.\n\n \n\n The federal government gradually sold its stake. Last month, the Treasury sold the last shares for an overall \"positive return\" of $22.7 billion. Andrew Ross Sorkin, a New York Times columnist and author of Too Big to Fail, called AIG the \"turnaround of the year.\"\n\n \n\n Still, the New York Times editorial board and critics of the bailout point out that amount doesn\u2019t take into account tax breaks the company got as part of the deal. Former members of an oversight panel said in March that a special tax exemption offered by the Treasury in 2008 amounted to a \"stealth bailout.\"\n\n \n\n It allowed AIG to count net operating losses against future tax bills, which \"some estimate has contributed to $17.7 billion in profits for the company,\" according to the group of former oversight panelists, including chair Elizabeth Warren, now a Democratic senator from Massachusetts.\n\n \n\n So, have the government\u2019s loans been repaid, with a \"positive return\" of $22 billion for taxpayers? Yes. Was the entire U.S. bailout of AIG, including special tax provisions, that profitable? No.\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n AIG says it honored its commitment to repay the government, plus a profit of more than $22 billion.\n\n \n\n It's true that the government has recouped the $182 billion it loaned AIG, plus $22.7 billion. Still, critics have a point that a special tax provision granted to aid the struggling company substantially offsets that \"profit.\" We rate the company\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
