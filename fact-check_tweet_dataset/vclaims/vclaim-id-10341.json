No, the porn star claiming to have had an affair with Donald Trump several years ago did not die in a hail of Tomahawk missiles, that's just a satirical story made up by a humor website. There is no truth to the story.\n\nIt originated from an article published on April 14, 2018 by the Waterford Whispers News which was titled \"Stormy Daniels Killed In Syrian Airstrike\" (archived here) and which opened:\n\nADULT film star Stormy Daniels has been reportedly killed last night in a US led airstrike in Syria, WWN can confirm. The controversial porn actress had apparently travelled to the middle eastern country on Thursday in what friends and family members are saying was an unusual move by the dead 39-year-old.\n\nThe summary on social media might have fooled some readers into thinking it was a real news report:\n\nBut the Whaterford Whispers News has a disclaimer page which reads:\n\nDisclaimer\n\nWaterford Whispers News is a fabricated satirical newspaper and comedy website published by Waterford Whispers News.
