Now, this pimp is in police custody.),\u201d reads the message.\n\nThe claim is massively viral on Facebook.\n\nIt is also being shared on Twitter.\n\nThis video was also circulated in 2018 using a similar claim.\n\nAs can be seen in the video posted above, the man is being escorted by a posse of policemen. His face is blackened by bystanders and he is also slapped by a woman.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nAlt News fact-checked this claim and found that it is not related to the Kathua rape and murder case. The video posted below was uploaded by News Nation on April 5, 2018, and it states that the incident occurred in Uttar Pradesh where a youth accused of raping a 13-year old girl was beaten up in the presence of policemen.\n\nInterestingly, another article from Dainik Bhaskar dated April 20, 2018, reported about the incident occurred in the \u2018Union Territory\u2019 section, referring to Chandigarh. The headline read, \u2018Rape accused\u2019s face blackened, beaten with slippers, video viral\u2019 (translated).\n\nSince two different sources ascribed two different locations to the video, we decided to investigate further. From the visual cues in the clip, we found that the video is probably from Madhya Pradesh. This inference was arrived at through two clues \u2013 the insignia on the policeman\u2019s uniform and the number plate of the police vehicle. As can be seen from the image below, the insignia of \u2018MP Police\u2019 is visible on the shoulder of the policeman. The number of the vehicle is MP 02 3431.\n\nWe also spotted signboards in the video. One of them read what seemed like \u2018Arshi Kendra Hanumangarh or (Hanumanganj)\u2019. Another signboard that we spotted in the video read what seemed like \u2018Fani Trading Company\u2019.\n\nHowever, the above information wasn\u2019t enough to determine the exact time and location of the video. We posted a slowed down version of the video on Facebook and sought information from the public with regard to the origin of the video. Some users on Facebook pointed out that the incident is from Hanumanganj area of Bhopal.\n\nBased on these clues, we zeroed in on Bhopal. The incident had occurred in the Hanumanganj area of the city. Alt News spoke to Sudhesh Tiwari, Town Inspector (SHO) at Hanumanganj police station in Bhopal. He confirmed, \u201cThis video is from here. He has been accused of raping a 13-year old girl. We were taking him to court when people blackened his face and women beat him up as an expression of public anger. He was accused of raping a 13-year old girl due to which he was assaulted by the people.\u201d\n\nLater, we found that this incident had also been reported accurately by www.eenaduindia.com on April 6, 2018. According to the report, the accused is from Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe video was shared extensively on Facebook last year where it was uploaded by popular pages. Individual users also shared the video with identical textual description which suggested that it was circulating on WhatsApp. This video was posted on a group called \u0905\u0917\u0930 \u0906\u092a \u0930\u093e\u091c\u092a\u0942\u0924 \u0939\u0948 \u0924\u094b join \u0915\u0940\u091c\u093f\u092f\u0947 \u092f\u0947 \u0917\u094d\u0930\u0941\u092a, \u0926\u0947\u0916\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902 FB \u092a\u0930 \u0915\u093f\u0924\u0928\u0947 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u092a\u0942\u0924 \u0939\u0948 with over 16,00,000 members and was shared more than 20,000 times. A person called Gobinda Das also uploaded it and his post was shared more than 19,000 times.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Kathua rape and murder case and the resultant public anger, there was a flurry of fake news about the incident on social media. In this instance, a video from Madhya Pradesh was passed off as that of the Kathua rape accused. The video was shared thousands of times and is still circulating on various social media platforms.", "lang": "en"}
