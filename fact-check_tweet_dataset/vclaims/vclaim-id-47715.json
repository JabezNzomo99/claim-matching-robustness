However, following the message both nurses were accused of not being real frontline workers.\n\nThe claim that nurse Jenny McGee does not appear on the Nursing and Midwifery Council register is false\u2014a Jennifer McGee registered in South East London is on the list. The post also suggests that as she does not seem to be the same Jennifer McGee who appears on the Nursing Council of New Zealand\u2019s register that this casts doubt on whether she is a real nurse.\n\nIt is true that the Jennifer McGee registered in New Zealand is not the same as that registered in London\u2014they both have different middle names for example. Multiple media outlets reported that Jenny McGee has worked in both Australia and in the UK for almost a decade as a nurse after training in New Zealand. Nurses in New Zealand can only register after they have completed their qualifications and nurses registering in the UK do not need to have registered in the country they trained in provided they can provide other details about their qualifications.\n\nThe claim that Luis Pitarma does not appear on the Nursing and Midwifery Council register is also false. He doesn\u2019t appear initially if you only search the name Luis Pitarma, but if you search for his full name then he does appear and the register shows that he is registered in South East London.", "lang": "en"}
