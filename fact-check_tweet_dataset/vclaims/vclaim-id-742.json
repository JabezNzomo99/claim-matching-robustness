The articles are based on a new report from think tank the Nuffield Trust but appear to confuse the different sets of figures in the report.\n\nThe rate of people attending A&E in England with \"probable alcohol poisoning\" has doubled in six years, according to the Trust's report. These are people arriving at A&E, regardless of whether they are treated in A&E, receive no significant treatment or are admitted to a hospital ward.\n\nEmergency admissions to hospital, when someone has been admitted to a hospital ward for treatment due to alcohol, have increased by over 50% in nine years. So emergency admissions due to alcohol have increased by over a half, rather than doubled. Not all these admissions are related to alcohol poisoning\u2014patients being treated for alcohol induced liver and heart problems would be counted too, for example.\n\nTeenage girls were most likely to visit A&E for probable poisoning, but were not most likely to be admitted as ITV claims\u2014that distinction (for emergency admissions) belongs to men and women aged between 45 and 64. Similar claims were made by Sky, the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph.\n\nSome of the articles make these distinctions clear in the body of their articles. Sky have since corrected their headline, after we got in touch. We'll be asking for corrections to the headline and text in the other articles where required.\n\nAttendance rates have doubled over six years\n\nFrom 2008/09 to 2013/14, A&E attendance rates likely to be due to alcohol poisoning doubled, from 73 in 100,000 people to 149 in 100,000 people. This is an increase of 105%.\n\nFrom 2005/06 to 2013/14, emergency admissions specific to alcohol increased by 54%, from 375 in 100,000 people to 577 in 100,000.\n\nThe Trust said the attendances at A&E measure may include a small number of other types of poisoning.", "lang": "en"}
