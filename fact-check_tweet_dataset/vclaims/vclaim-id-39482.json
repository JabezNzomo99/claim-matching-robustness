Ted Cruz for his seat in the U.S. Senate, appeared in an hourlong town hall event on CNN on Oct. 18.\n\nPrior to the town hall, a false headline started circulating on Facebook saying: \u201cCHARGES FILED AGAINST BETO O\u2019ROURKE FOR ACCEPTING ILLEGAL $10 MILLION CONTRIBUTION.\u201d\n\nThere were no \u201ccharges\u201d filed, but a complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission about the CNN town hall with O\u2019Rourke.\n\nOn Oct. 11, CNN announced its lineup of political specials for the midterm elections. Among them was a town hall moderated by CNN\u2019s Dana Bash with O\u2019Rourke taking questions from the audience. A spokeswoman for CNN told FactCheck.org that the network had invited Cruz to appear in his own town hall program, but he declined.\n\nCruz\u2019s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, confirmed in a tweet that Cruz was \u201cunable to participate\u201d in \u201cback to back town halls.\u201d But, Roe added, \u201cthe Cruz campaign proposed that @CNN host one of the Cruz-O\u2019Rourke debates. The O\u2019Rourke campaign declined.\u201d\n\nFollowing CNN\u2019s programming announcement, Neal Dikeman, the third candidate in the race who is seeking the seat on the Libertarian line, wrote an open letter to CNN asking to be included in the televised town hall.\n\nDikeman later filed a complaint with the FEC against CNN and O\u2019Rourke, claiming that the town hall event would amount to an illegal $10 million campaign contribution if it aired as scheduled.\n\nIn response, CNN attorney David C. Vigilante wrote a letter to Dikeman saying Cruz and O\u2019Rourke are the \u201conly two viable candidates,\u201d based on polling, and that the CNN town hall was within the \u201cpress exemption\u201d of campaign finance laws. Vigilante cited a case from 2009 that made similar allegations, which the FEC dismissed.\n\nSo, while it\u2019s true that the FEC has gotten a complaint about the town hall program with O\u2019Rourke, no \u201ccharges\u201d have been filed against the candidate. And it\u2019s far from certain that the town hall could be considered an \u201cillegal $10 million contribution\u201d since the FEC hasn\u2019t yet ruled on the complaint.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.
