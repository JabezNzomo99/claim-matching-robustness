But the point total claim raised the hackles of one of our sports gurus, who said the Senate had made a rookie mistake.\n\nWhen another reader started raising questions about the Senate resolution on Twitter, we went to at NFL.com.\n\nAccording to the site, New England scored 444 points during the regular season. That put the team in third place, one point behind the Chicago Bears (with 445 points) and the Broncos (with a whopping 606).\n\nThird place isn't second place, so the claim seems to be False.\n\nBut the resolution doesn't specify regular season. If you include postseason play, which purists are loath to do when comparing all the teams in the NFL, New England does rank second. (The Bears didn't make the playoffs.)\n\nBy that measure, the resolution is correct. Denver has logged 630 points, New England 487 points, and Kansas City 474 points.\n\nIn sum, the claim can be accurate, but only if you combine regular-season and postseason play, which means comparing teams that competed in 16 games with those that have played 17 games (or in a few cases, 18 games). That's a sizable caveat.\n\nBecause the statement needs clarification or additional information to be correct, we rate it .", "lang": "en"}
