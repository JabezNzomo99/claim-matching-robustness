The government also claimed it has reduced the debt by half since the inauguration of Akerodolu in 2016. The two claims are false, according to checks carried out by The ICIR.\n\nDonald Ojogo, the state commissioner for Information and Orientation, made the claims on Monday during an interview with Sunrise Daily, a current affairs programme aired by ChannelsTV. Ondo government\u2019s official website later published Ojogo\u2019s statements shortly after.\n\nAccording to the commissioner, Akeredolu\u2019s administration has reduced the debt inherited from the previous government (N220 billion) by 50 per cent and has increased \u201cthe Internally General Revenue (IGR) of the state from the N700 million inherited from the PDP [People\u2019s Democratic Party] administration to over N1 billion monthly.\n\n\u201cOur resolve as a government is that by the time we leave office in the next five years, I said in the next five years because Mr Governor is going to recontest and win by God\u2019s grace, we hope to leave the government without debt for the incoming administration after our two terms,\u201d he said.\n\nOjogo\u2019s claim about Ondo State\u2019s inherited debt from the PDP-led government is off-target. Data from the Debt Management Office (DMO), in fact, revealed that the state\u2019s debt profile has increased since 2016.\n\nAkeredolu was declared governor of Ondo State in November 2016 and was sworn in February.\n\nDMO statistics reveal that as of December 2016, the state\u2019s domestic debt was N53.2 billion while its external debt was $49.5 million (N15.1 billion). Altogether, its debt was N68.3 billion.\n\nThis is only 31 per cent of N220 billion claimed by the state.\n\nBy December 2017, the state\u2019s debt had increased to N73.9 billion. A year later the debt came down to N73.6 billion but again increased to N79.8 billion as of June 2019.\n\nTherefore, rather than supposedly reduce by 50 per cent between 2016 and 2019, Ondo State\u2019s debt increased by 16.85 per cent.\n\nThe state commissioner distorted facts not only about the present administration\u2019s debt reduction performance but his claim on internally generated revenue is also grossly understated, check by The ICIR has revealed.\n\nHe said the government inherited by Akeredolu\u2019s administration was IGR of N700 million per month and this has improved to \u201cover N1 billion monthly\u201d.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, Ondo State generated total internal revenue of N8.68 billion in 2016, which is the same as N723 million per month. But the state\u2019s IGR has improved beyond the commissioner\u2019s modest assessment.\n\nLatest NBS statistics show that the state currently generates an average of N3.2 billion in a month.\n\nOndo\u2019s total IGR was N19 billion in the first two quarters of 2019. The total IGR for all four quarters in 2018 was N24.8 billion, equalling an average monthly IGR of N2 billion.\n\nIn the last two quarters of 2017, the average monthly IGR was N975 million. It crossed the one billion naira line in the first quarter of 2018 when the state generated N1.2 billion per month. And, by the last quarter of that year, it had increased to N3.4 billion per month.\n\nOur finding: The Ondo Commissioner for Information\u2019s claim about the state\u2019s inherited debt profile is false. Akeredolu inherited N68.3 billion as debt, not N220 billion. Also, the state\u2019s debt has increased to N79.8 billion in the last three years and not reduced by 50 per cent as claimed.\n\nIn addition, while Ojogo\u2019s claim about IGR generated under the immediate past administration is fairly accurate, the figure he gave about the improvement in the IGR is understated.", "lang": "en"}
