Counting those from the British Transport Police and those on secondment it was 126,000.\n\nThis relates to the number of full time equivalent officers (or how many there would be if you added up all their hours to make full time roles).\n\nThe number of police officers in England and Wales is around the level it was at in 2000 (that\u2019s if we look at how many police officers there were in March last year, which lets us compare further back in time).\n\n\n\nPolicing is local too, though. If you live in Merseyside, you might not care what\u2019s happening to police numbers in Gwent.\n\nThe staffing picture varies across the 43 police forces of England and Wales. The number of officers working for Surrey Police has actually risen by 3%. Every other force has lost officers, with Cleveland seeing the biggest drop (-27%). You can check your area by looking at table A1 of this House of Commons Library research.\n\nYou might also care about the number of frontline officers. There\u2019s no hard and fast notion of who fits that description. The official definition has changed several times. At the moment, officers are categorised as one of frontline (like response teams, neighbourhood policing and front desk roles), frontline support (such as intelligence) and business support (such as training).\n\nUsing that breakdown, there are 14% fewer \u2018frontline\u2019 officers since 2010. But the proportion of all officers who work on the frontline has risen a little, from 91% to 93%.\n\nAgain, that varies. In March 2016, Staffordshire Police had 96% of their officers on the front line, compared to 90% for Greater Manchester.", "lang": "en"}
