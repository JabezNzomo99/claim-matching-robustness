By this measure, the Poll Tax (with a net approval of -57% at its least popular) was far more unpopular than the Chequers deal (net approval -34%), as many more people actively opposed it. A large percentage of people say they don\u2019t know what they think of the Chequers deal.\n\nWhat was the Poll Tax?\n\nThe \u2018Poll Tax\u2019 \u2013 officially known as the \u2018Community Charge\u2019 \u2013 was a new local government flat tax introduced by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative government, to replace the previous system of council \u2018rates\u2019. It came into force in Scotland at the beginning of the 1989 financial year, and then in England and Wales a year later in 1990.\n\nThe tax was extremely unpopular, sparking widespread protests, riots and co-ordinated non-payment campaigns. Opposition to the tax (and the damage it was having on Conservative polling figures) was a major factor the leadership challenge that forced Margaret Thatcher to resign in November 1990.\n\nPolling firm Ipsos MORI has historical opinion poll figures covering several years from when the Poll Tax was first proposed, until its introduction in England and Wales in the spring of 1990. This data shows that opposition to the tax peaked in March 1990, shortly before it was due to come into force in England and Wales, when only 19% of people approved of it and 76% disapproved, a net approval of -57%.\n\nHow does the Chequers deal compare?\n\nThe \u2018Chequers deal\u2019 or \u2018Chequers plan\u2019 is the common term for the Brexit negotiating position agreed by the cabinet during a meeting at Chequers (the prime minister\u2019s country residence) in early July. It was immediately controversial, and prompted the resignation of several pro-Brexit cabinet ministers who opposed it, including the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.\n\nA poll by Sky Data on September 4 found that 18% of people approved of the deal, while 52% disapproved (with 30% responding \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019). Earlier polling by YouGov, which asked a slightly different question, showed that only 13% of people thought the deal would be \u201cgood for Britain\u201d compared to 42% who thought it would \u201cnot be good for Britain\u201d (44% responded \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019).\n\nHere we\u2019ll use the Sky Data figures, both because they are the most recent, and because the question they asked is most comparable to that asked about the Poll Tax.\n\nWhile the level of support for the Chequers deal is marginally below that of the Poll Tax (although within the polling margin of error), the level of opposition to it is significantly lower, by 24%. This is reflected in the fact that the percentage of \u2018don\u2019t knows\u2019 is far higher for the Chequers deal, at 30% compared to just 5% for the Poll Tax.\n\nThis means that the net approval for the Poll Tax at its worst was -57%, while that for the Chequers Deal is -34%. Over the years that Ipsos MORI polled, the Poll Tax regularly had net approval ratings below the current level for the Chequers deal. So while the low level of support for the Chequers deal is comparable to the Poll Tax at its least popular, it\u2019s not accurate to say that it is \u201cmore unpopular\u201d.\n\nWhen considering the number of \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 responses, it\u2019s worth noting that with the Poll Tax the proportion of \u2018don\u2019t knows\u2019 decreased as the policy came closer to being implemented.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that people can dislike the Chequers deal for opposing reasons: some Leave supporters think the form of Brexit it proposes is too \u2018soft\u2019, while Remain supporters may oppose it because it is still a plan for Brexit.", "lang": "en"}
