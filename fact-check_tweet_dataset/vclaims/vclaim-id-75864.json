The institute measured mean wealth by race. Using 2010 data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, the Urban Institute looked at assets including cash savings, homes, retirement accounts and subtracted any debt.\n\nThe Urban Institute concluded that, post-recession, for every $1 an average black or Hispanic person has in wealth, an average white person has $6. That\u2019s up from 1983, the farthest back the study goes, when the ratio was 5-to-1.\n\nThomas Shapiro, a Brandeis University social policy professor who studies the wage gap, said the 6-to-1 ratio is correct, but represents the lower end of the wealth gap range researchers have come up with.\n\nAt the higher end of the spectrum, a 20-to-1 ratio in 2011. They took median wealth from the Census Bureau\u2019s Survey of Income and Program Participation 2009 data. So the data varies by survey used, year and measure of average (mean vs median).\n\nThere\u2019s debate among economists and social scientists about which ratio is the most accurate. Darrick Hamilton, an urban policy professor at The New School, said the Census Bureau surveys more low-income families, while the Survey of Consumer Finances oversamples high-income families where minorities aren\u2019t as well represented.\n\nOverall, any ratio from 6-to-1 to 22-to-1 could be considered an accurate measure of the wealth gap, Shapiro told us.\n\nMenendez said, \"A white family is likely to have about six times as much wealth than a black or Hispanic family coming out of the recession.\" A study from the Urban Institute supports her statistic. Other research shows an even wider gap, further proving her point that race is a factor in U.S. wealth.\n\nMenendez's statement is accurate, and might even understate the issue.
