Facebook page Yogi Sarkar had posted it in May 2018, which was shared over 3500 times. It was also shared on Twitter. This photograph had been fact-checked by Alt News Hindi in May 2018, when it was shared widely. Alt News found that the origin of this photograph is Sonia Gandhi\u2019s meeting with the then Maldives President Abdul Gayoom during the latter\u2019s visit to India in 2005.\n\nThe image was mischievously photoshopped and made to appear as if Ms. Gandhi is seated in the lap of Mr. Gayoom. Sonia Gandhi\u2019s image from the above picture was cropped and placed together with that of Mr. Gayoom. The video posted below is a step-by-step illustration of how this was possibly achieved.", "lang": "en"}
