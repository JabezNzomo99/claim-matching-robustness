The claim is false; the photo has circulated in reports since 2012 about a 12-year-old boy who was accused of killing his sibling in the US state of Florida.\n\nThe post was published here on Facebook on July 16, 2020. It has been shared 655 times.\n\nThe lengthy post narrates a dialogue between a judge and a 15-year-old child. It states the child was prosecuted for allegedly stealing bread and cheese from a store because he was hungry.\n\nPart of the post\u2019s Burmese-language caption translates to English as: \u201cAt the end of the interrogation, the judge made the order... \u2018We are all responsible for his committing crime. So everyone in the court, including me, was ordered to pay ten dollars. No one can go out of court without paying ten dollars.\u2019 The judge took ten dollars from his pocket and placed it on the table.\u201d\n\nThe photo was also published here, here and here on Facebook alongside a similar claim.

He was charged in the beating death of his 2-year-old half brother, David Galarraga. Galarraga died in March from a fractured skull, bleeding brain and bruising to his left eye and nose. The family said he had an accident while playing on a jungle gym. Cristian\u2019s mother, Biannela Marie Susana, 25, was charged in April with aggravated manslaughter by culpable negligence. The warrant for her arrest said she came home to find Galarraga unresponsive but did not call 911.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison between the photo in the misleading post (L) and the photo in The Florida Times-Union report (R):\n\nIn January 2018, local broadcaster Action News Jax reported that Fernandez, then 19, was set to be released on probation. He served seven years in a juvenile detention centre after pleading guilty to manslaughter, the report said.", "lang": "en"}
