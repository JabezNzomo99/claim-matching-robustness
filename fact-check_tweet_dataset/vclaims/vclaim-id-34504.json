It shows Janna DeVylder, the owner of a design studio in Sydney, Australia.\n\nDeVylder became the face of popular conservative memes in 2016 after a Reuters photographer took her picture during an election night event at the University of Sydney in Australia. She was decked out in a star-spangled top hat and a Hillary Clinton pin, grimacing at the election returns.\n\nDeVylder, who grew up in Iowa and now lives in Sydney, voted by absentee ballot for Clinton in the last presidential election, she told the Des Moines Register in 2017 for a story about her meme fame.\n\nNow that picture has been mislabeled to claim that it shows Karlan \u2014 who became a target of the right after her appearance as a Democratic witness during the impeachment hearing \u2014 in an effort to discredit her testimony. The text featured with one popular meme says: \u201cFor those who deny that Pamela Karlan\u2019s testimony was politically motivated: Here she is \u2013 the night Trump won.\u201d\n\nOther false memes that claim to show the professor have been circulating on social media. We wrote about them here.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
