For instance, it has been turned into a movie poster for Dumb and Dumber, was shared in a meme comparing the two Trumps children into to the \u201csloth\u201d character from the movie The Goonies, and was frequently shared with the captions \u201cThey look like that \u201ch\u2019yucc\u201d sound Goofy be making\u201d or \u201cDonald Trump HATES this photo of his two sons. Please don\u2019t share it.\u201d\n\nHowever, this picture (despite the Getty Images watermark) is not a genuine photograph of Donald Trump\u2019s sons, but a digitally altered version of one.\n\nThe original photograph was taken on 12 November 2005, during Donald Trump, Jr.\u2019s wedding reception at his father\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and was captioned: \u201cDonald Trump, Jr. pose with his brother Eric Trump after the wedding ceremony at the Mar-a-Lago Club on November 12, 2005 in Palm Beach, Florida. (Photo by C. Allegri/Getty Images)\u201d\n\nSeveral subtle changes were made to the original image in order to uglify the Trump brothers. For instance, Donald Trump, Jr.\u2019s upper lip was enlarged, his bottom teeth were hidden, his right eye was moved off-center, and his left ear was lowered. Eric Trump\u2019s eyes were also widened, and some extra fat was added to his neck.\n\nHere\u2019s a comparison of the fake image (left) and the real image (right):", "lang": "en"}
