Indeed, Holloway says media coverage of the issue has diminished his chances to win the contest.\n\n \n\n Holloway and his wife, Lynda, own 15 parcels in the city, including several apartment buildings on the near north side. Some of the buildings have been the subject of numerous and repeated building code violations.\n\n \n\n Holloway was ordered to Milwaukee Municipal Court because a large batch of the violations have not been corrected. That hearing, involving dozens of long-standing violations, is set for March of 2011.\n\n \n\n Beyond that, a security guard at one building faces misdemeanor charges for accusing him of threatening a tenant who was at odds with Holloway; another tenant faces charges of trashing that same tenant\u2019s apartment; and reports show more than 800 police calls to Holloway-owned buildings in the past two years.\n\n \n\n So ears perked up at a candidate forum at the Marquette University Law School when Holloway -- who was serving as acting county executive at the time -- was asked about his record as a landlord. He compared the dire economic situation facing some of his tenants with the economic woes facing the state and county government, then described the problems.\n\n \n\n \"The code violations are primarily storm windows,\" Holloway said, adding \"which we take and provide plastic which is better than storm windows.\"\n\n \n\n He added: \"And it has to do with tuckpointing, which is all complete.\" And he said: \"Within the households, it\u2019s fine.\"\n\n \n\n Finally, he declared: \"I\u2019m saying I have resolved these problems. We are working to resolve these problems.\"\n\n \n\n This one is easy enough to check.\n\n \n\n We looked at the city\u2019s online database available through the Department of Neighborhood Services. Each violation for each property is listed. We counted, and then counted again.\n\n \n\n At the time he made the statement, Holloway had 200 outstanding violations on eight of his 15 properties. Some of the violations were new -- and written up on Jan. 21, 2011, the same day as the candidate forum.\n\n \n\n Do they all relate to exterior issues, such as brickwork, as Holloway claimed?\n\n \n\n No.\n\n \n\n Some examples of properties and violations listed:\n\u2022 2061 W. Atkinson Ave.: Fire extinguishers, door security hardware, faulty intercom, smoke detectors, carpeting, and damaged ceiling plaster. Other violations for the building include tuckpointing, parking lot repair, windows, screens and downspouts.\n\u2022 2022 W. Atkinson Ave.: Windows, screens, outdoor canopy, downspouts, handrails and porch issues were cited. And this mention was included: \"Restore ext. door frame to rodent proof condition.\"\n\n\n\n Let\u2019s return to Holloway\u2019s statement.\n\n \n\n Facing a date in Municipal Court, Holloway told a forum audience -- including those who watched on TV and YouTube -- that the building code violations still at issue involve the exterior of the properties. \"Within the households,\" he said, \"it\u2019s fine.\" But inspection records paint a different picture: Roaches, exit signs, smoke detectors, ceiling plaster. All of those -- and more -- are interior issues. There\u2019s even a note about faulty fire extinguishers.\n\n \n\n That seems appropriate. We rate Holloway\u2019s statement Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
