Her remarks about treating \u201cundocumented immigrants\u201d with respect did not mention MS-13 members at all.\n\nTrump made his original \u201canimals\u201d comment during a May 16 roundtable discussion at the White House with California political and law enforcement leaders. The discussion began shortly after 3 p.m., according to the White House transcript. Trump started off the event by claiming the state\u2019s so-called \u201csanctuary\u201d policy, limiting state and local law enforcement\u2019s communications with federal immigration authorities, \u201cprovides safe harbor to some of the most vicious and violent offenders on Earth, like MS-13 gang members putting innocent men, women, and children at the mercy of these sadistic criminals.\u201d\n\nMuch later on during the event, Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims talked about issues involving the communication between those working in local jails and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. Mims mentioned MS-13, and Trump responded with comments on \u201cpeople coming into the country,\u201d without mentioning the gang:\n\nSheriff Mims, May 16: Thank you. There could be an MS-13 gang member I know about \u2014 if they don\u2019t reach a certain threshold, I cannot tell ICE about them. Trump: We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in \u2014 and we\u2019re stopping a lot of them \u2014 but we\u2019re taking people out of the country. You wouldn\u2019t believe how bad these people are. These aren\u2019t people. These are animals. And we\u2019re taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that\u2019s never happened before. And because of the weak laws, they come in fast, we get them, we release them, we get them again, we bring them out. It\u2019s crazy.\n\nSome news coverage of the event said Trump referred to some immigrants as \u201canimals.\u201d Other reports said his remarks were about immigrant gang members.\n\nThe following morning, on May 17, Pelosi commented on the president\u2019s remarks during her weekly press conference. She criticized Trump for saying \u201cundocumented immigrants\u201d were \u201canimals.\u201d\n\nPelosi, May 17: We believe some of us who are attracted to the political arena and to government and public service that we\u2019re all God\u2019s children. There\u2019s a spark of divinity in every person on Earth and that we all have to recognize that as we respect the dignity and worth of every person. \u2026 And so when the president of the United States says about undocumented immigrants, \u2018these aren\u2019t people, these are animals,\u2019 you have to wonder, does he not believe in the spark of divinity? The dignity and worth of every person? \u2018These are not people, these are animals,\u2019 the president of the United States. \u2026 Calling people \u2018animals\u2019 is not a good thing.\n\nLater that day, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders was asked what the president meant by the remark, and she said he \u201cwas very clearly referring to MS-13 gang members.\u201d Later that same day, Trump, too, was asked to clarify his remarks, and he said: \u201cBut I\u2019m referring, and you know I\u2019m referring, to the MS-13 gangs that are coming in.\u201d\n\nWe can\u2019t say what Trump meant when he made his remarks, but there is a history of Trump referring to MS-13 gang members as \u201canimals.\u201d Given that, and the larger context of the conversation about people who are in jails and in the country illegally, it\u2019s certainly plausible that he was referring to the gang members.\n\nAt a July 25, 2017, rally in Ohio, Trump called MS-13 gang members \u201canimals\u201d who \u201cslice and dice\u201d young girls because they want their victims \u201cto go through excruciating pain.\u201d Three days later in New York, Trump retold the story of gang members using knives instead of guns because \u201cit\u2019s more painful, and they enjoy watching that much more. These are animals.\u201d\n\nTrump now has been putting his spin on Pelosi\u2019s remarks.\n\nAt a May 22 gala event for the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion rights group, Trump claimed: \u201cAnd the other day \u2014 just the other day \u2014 Nancy Pelosi came out in favor of MS-13. That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard that. She wants them to be treated with respect, as do other Democrats. That\u2019s not going to be happening. We\u2019re not going to release violent criminals into our country.\u201d\n\nBut Pelosi did not come \u201cout in favor of MS-13.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention the gang or gang members at all.\n\nHe also falsely implies that Democrats \u2014 by treating criminals with respect \u2014 would \u201crelease violent criminals into our country.\u201d He went even further on May 23, when he said in an interview on Fox News: \u201cYou heard Nancy Pelosi the other day, like, trying to find all sorts of reasons why they should be able to stay.\u201d Pelosi did not say violent gang members in the U.S. illegally \u201cshould be able to stay.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
