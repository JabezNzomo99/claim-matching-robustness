All pet owners are expected to surrender any pets in excess of the mandatory \u20182-pet maximum\u2019 to their local Humane Society shelter by the compliance date of September 3rd 2016,\" the story reads.\n\nWe reached out to Associated Media Coverage and did not hear back. Nonetheless, experts quickly dismissed this claim.\n\n\"This is, in fact, a hoax, and The Humane Society of the United States would never support such an ordinance,\" Humane Society spokeswoman Cheylin Parker said.\n\nLocally, we also reached out to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey\u2019s office.\n\n\"This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth,\" said Daniel Scarpinato, a spokesman for Ducey. \"There\u2019s no such law in Arizona, and as a huge animal lover himself, Governor Ducey encourages animal adoption all across our state.\"\n\nOthers have debunked this story, too. The Snopes website debunked the claim and noted that the Associated Media Coverage website appears to have been registered in February 2016.\n\nAssociated Media Coverage said, \"pet owners within Texas, Arizona and Missouri...are expected to surrender any pets in excess of the mandatory \u20182-pet maximum\u2019 to their local Humane Society.\"\n\nWe rate it as Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
