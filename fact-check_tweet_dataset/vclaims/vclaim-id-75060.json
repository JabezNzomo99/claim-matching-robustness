Why? Because, the story says, the mammoth retailer is celebrating its 125th anniversary.\n\nFirst of all, Walmart was founded in 1962. So it\u2019s at least 55, not 125.\n\nMore importantly for Walmart fans, the offer is not real.\n\n\"We care deeply about our customers and have procedures in place to help protect them from criminal behavior,\" she said. \"We frequently review our educational and prevention measures and when necessary, take additional steps to better inform our customers about the dangers of scams.\"\n\nWalmart also clarifies on its website cases of fraud in which surveys are listed as potentially suspicious. A legitimate survey from Walmart is only taken on its official website.\n\nPolitiFact decided to test out the offer. When clicking on the survey link, we were notified that only 456 coupons remained. (That number didn\u2019t change as we refreshed and revisited the page at different points.)\n\nThe survey consists of three questions: Have you ever shopped at Walmart? You prefer Walmart because of? Are you satisfied by the services of Walmart?\n\nWhen we finished, we were asked to share the survey with our Facebook friends \u2014 the promised coupon never materialized.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a bug. It\u2019s just not real. Neither were free Delta and Southwest airline tickets.\n\nWe rate this scam Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
