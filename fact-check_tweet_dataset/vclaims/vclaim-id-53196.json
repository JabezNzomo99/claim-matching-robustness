Soon after, a video began to circulate on social media.\n\nPakistani social media users claimed that the video showed Indian army bunkers being destroyed by Pakistani fire.\n\nInterestingly, the same video was posted by one Pawan Durrani (followed on Twitter by Office of Nirmala Sitharaman), who claimed that the video represented firing on Pakistani positions by the Indian army.\n\nThe video in question is old and does not represent the recent exchange of fire between the Indian and Pakistani armies, as claimed on either side of the divide. Alt News found this video on YouTube. It was uploaded in March 2019 and is titled, \u2018Pakistani forces attack Indian Border in Kashmir; Kotli, March 2019\u2019. Alt News could not independently ascertain the claim accompanying the video.\n\nIn August 2019, the same video was used by Mirror Now in a broadcast which reported a ceasefire violation along the LoC by the Pakistani army. The video is posted in the below tweet by the channel.\n\nIt may be noted that the video in question is old, and does not depict the recent cross-border tension between India and Pakistan.", "lang": "en"}
