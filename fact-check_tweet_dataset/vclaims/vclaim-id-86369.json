Without credit, Biden\u2019s stump speech included lines lifted from a speech given by Neil Kinnock, then leader of the British Labour Party. An operative in a rival campaign \u2014 that of then-Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, who eventually won the Democratic nomination \u2014 gave to the media a tape comparing Biden\u2019s speech and Kinnock\u2019s speech.\n\nBiden tried to hang on, but then reporters discovered he had flunked a class in a law school for submitting a paper that borrowed heavily from another law review article without proper citation. The coup de grace came when Newsweek reported that Biden had made false or exaggerated claims about his law school record during a discussion months earlier with voters in New Hampshire, which had been captured by C-SPAN.\n\nThe Newsweek article had an impressive quadruple byline of Mickey Kaus, Eleanor Clift, Howard Fineman and John P. McCormick. The magazine distributed its report to other outlets before publication \u2014 something that was done in the pre-Internet era. Thus, even though the official date of the Newsweek issue is Sept. 28, 1987, Biden was already out of the race by then. He withdrew on Sept. 23, citing ''the exaggerated shadow'' of his mistakes.\n\n\u201cI think I have a much higher IQ than you, I suspect. I went to law school on a full academic scholarship \u2014 the only one in my class to have full academic scholarship. The first year in law school, I decided I didn\u2019t want to be in law school and ended up in the bottom two-thirds of my class. And then decided I wanted to stay and went back to law school and, in fact, ended up in the top half of my class. I won the international moot court competition. I was the outstanding student in the political science department at the end of my year. I graduated with three degrees from undergraduate school and 165 credits; you only needed 123 credits. I would be delighted to sit down and compare my IQ to yours, Frank.\u201d\n\nThe Restoration PAC ad simply takes a clipped version of Biden\u2019s remarks \u2014 leaving out, for instance, his admission he did not do well in his first year \u2014 and overlays the audio so the focus is on Biden. (C-SPAN mostly kept the camera on Fahey.) Then, it shows damaging news reports on the incident, including Biden\u2019s admission that \u201chis memory had failed him.\u201d The ad concludes with the tagline: \u201cJoe Biden. Unsuited then. Unsuited now.\u201d\n\nA great book on the 1988 presidential race, Richard Ben Cramer\u2019s \u201cWhat It Takes,\u201d recounts how Biden in law school never wanted to be a grind and spent most of his time in the student lounge, gabbing. He barely made the cut after the first year, when Syracuse kicked out the bottom-third of the class. Biden after the first year ranked 80th \u2014 and only the top 88 were permitted to go on to the second year. We\u2019re not sure how Biden could have forgotten that.\n\nFahey told WMUR in 2019 that Biden had apologized for his comments when they met again in 2008, during Biden\u2019s second run for the presidency. \u201cHe said, \u2018You\u2019re Frank Fahey,\u2019 and he knew right off and he said, \u2018I want to apologize.\u2019 He said, \u2018I was way out of line that day,\u2019\u201d Fahey recalled, adding: \u201cI like his honesty.\u201d\n\nThe incident in question took place 33 years ago \u2014 and Biden was talking about his record in law school 23 years earlier. Voters may find that fibs about events that took place more than a half-century ago may not be especially relevant, especially when Biden is running against a man who has his own problems telling the truth. The ad, for understandable reasons, does not include the fact that the man Biden insulted is now a supporter. Some voters may find that relevant.\n\nBut everything happened in the ad as described. The editing of the clip leaves in place the essence of Biden\u2019s remarks and does not manipulate it in a misleading way. So Restoration PAC does not earn any Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
