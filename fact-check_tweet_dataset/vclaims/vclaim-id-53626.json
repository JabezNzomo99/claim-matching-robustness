National executive member of BJP Kisaan Morcha, Amit Dixit, shared the video claiming that \u201cgangster\u201d Akram attacked a doctor and his family in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Aligarh. \u201cJihadi Akram is absconding,\u201d he further wrote (archive). His tweet received close to 2,000 retweets.\n\nSeveral people commenting on Dixit\u2019s tweet stress on the need for retaliation by Hindus and how the community needs to protect itself from such attacks since many assumed that the person who was attacked was Hindu.\n\nOne N K Khaitan who is followed by BJP spokesperson Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga shared the video (archive) and wrote, \u201cA doctor is fighting for his life after gangster Akram Tippa shot at the doctor.

As of this writing, his tweet naming the perpetrator Akram Tippi has garnered over 2,000 retweets.\n\nThe clip is viral on Facebook as well. One Ajay Sehrawat who has a verified account and identifies as ex-MTV roadies contestant wrote, \u201cScenes from Muslim Majority area Hamdard nagar, Aligarh. Heavy firing and stone pelting reported. Gangster Akram A K.A Tippa shot one doctor who is critical and admitted in Hospital. Akram is absconding and Aligarh police is looking for him. #religionofpeace.\u201d An archived version of his post can be viewed here.\n\nFrom the Facebook pages \u2018Nationalist Sumit \u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093e\u0926\u0940 \u0938\u0941\u092e\u093f\u0924\u2018 and \u2018Expose The Deshdrohis\u2018, the video has drawn 1,100 and 1,700 shares respectively.\n\nA quick Google search with keywords \u2018Aligarh doctor violence\u2019 led us to multiple media reports. According to an article published in The Times of India (TOI), the victim, Dr SU Khan, was travelling with his wife and son Aman on a bike when they collided with an autorickshaw in Aligarh\u2019s Hamdard Nagar on May 13. \u201cAfter Khan reportedly advised the auto\u2019s driver Akram alias Tippa to drive more carefully, the latter got aggressive and allegedly started hurling abuses and manhandled the doctor,\u201d the report adds.\n\nThe report further states that Akram fired a bullet which hit Aman\u2019s hand and \u201ca relative of Akram allegedly hit the pistol\u2019s butt on Khan\u2019s head\u201d. The father-son duo was admitted to the hospital for treatment. The police has been quoted as saying that an attempt to murder case has been registered and raids are being conducted based on video evidence to nab the accused.\n\nDainik Jagran identifies Khan as a teacher. However, Alt News confirmed with Civil Lines police that Khan is a doctor by profession. According to Dainik Jagran, Khan and Akram are neighbours. After the road collision, Akram attacked Khan at his residence. His son suffered a bullet wound on his arm while Khan\u2019s head was injured with the pistol\u2019s butt. These events transpired at around 12 pm. According to the report, Akram returned to Khan\u2019s residence with 15-20 people at around 4 pm. Shots were also fired. Khan\u2019s family members pelted stones in retaliation. In the concluding paragraph, the report says that the police has booked Akram, Asad and a few unidentified men for violence and attempt to murder.\n\nA video report by Mojo carries Khan\u2019s statement where he says that Akram came to his house and fired at him. Further in the report, SP City Aligarh Abhishek Kumar gives similar details as provided in Dainik Jagran\u2019s report. He says that whlle the police took Khan and his son to the hospital, Akram came back with a mob, went to Khan\u2019s place and fired at his family members. A relative of Khan told the channel that Akram has \u201ccriminal\u201d tendencies. \u201cHe came back with 10-12 people. We were 5-6. The mob began firing and we tried to stop them using stones. They threatened to kill us in 24 hours,\u201d said the relative.\n\nTherefore, a video of violence that took place in UP\u2019s Aligarh on May 13 has been shared on social media with messaging highlighting the Muslim identity of the perpetrator but not the victim\u2019s identity. This misled several users who believed that the attack had a sectarian angle.", "lang": "en"}
