The claim is false; both photos have circulated online since at least 2011, five years before Duterte became president; the photos show a tributary of the river cited in the posts.\n\nThe collage was shared in this Facebook post on July 3, 2020.\n\nThe first photo, which shows a rubbish-filled body of water, bears a Tagalog-language text overlay that translates to English as: \u201cDURING THE TIME OF DECENT PEOPLE / PASIG RIVER / Aquino Term\u201d.\n\nThe second photo, which shows the same body of water without noticeable pollutants, is overlaid with text that reads: \u201cPASIG RIVER / Duterte Term / DURING THE TIME OF INDECENT PEOPLE\u201d.\n\nDuterte was elected president in May 2016, replacing former President Benigno Aquino III.\n\nIdentical photo collages were shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook here, here, here, here and here.\n\nCombined reverse image and keyword searches on Google found that both photos were published online in May 2011, more than five years before Duterte took office.\n\nThey were published in this report by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) about cleanup operations in a Pasig River tributary.\n\nThe ADB report states: \u201cA massive cleanup in Estero de Paco, an estuary (sic) of Manila's Pasig River, was conducted. Concrete embankments have been built and running water and septic tanks installed.\u201d\n\nBelow is a set of screenshot comparisons showing the photos in the misleading posts (L) and the photos in the ADB report (R):\n\nThe photos were also published in this September 2012 report by Philippine news organisation Rappler.\n\nThe location of the Estero de Paco estuary in relation to the Pasig River can be viewed on Google Maps here.\n\nThe misleading use of the photos has also been debunked by FactRakers, a Philippines-based fact-checking initiative.", "lang": "en"}
