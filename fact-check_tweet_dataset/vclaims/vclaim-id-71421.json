Spread this message to as much as you can. Your one message can save many life\u2019s.\u201d The message is attributed to Dr. B. Sukumar of Sri Saisudha Hospital.

He said: \u201cThis message is fake. I have not given any such statement. This message is circulating for many years by my name. This is wrongly attributed to me. I have never written such a letter or prescribed coconut oil for dengue.\u201d\n\nWe also performed various searches in the fact check we did earlier to debunk this post. The complete fact check can be read here.\n\nThere is no scientific evidence supporting the claim coconut oil can prevent dengue.\n\nAs per the US National Library of Medicine, Virgin coconut oil does have some antimicrobial properties but there are no randomized controlled trials that have proven its efficacy in active infection.\n\nWe scanned the social profile of the user who shared the post. We found that the user named Nelia Salazar is based out of Leyte, Philippines.\n\nConclusion: Post claiming coconut oil can prevent dengue is fake. Dr. B.
