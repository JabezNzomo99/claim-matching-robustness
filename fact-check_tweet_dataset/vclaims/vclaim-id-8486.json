The story originated on notoriously unreliable website YourNewsWire.com in an article (archived here) titled \"NFL Lawyer, Who Claimed Super Bowl Is 'Rigged', Found Dead\" which opened:\n\nAn NFL entertainment lawyer, who has worked for the corporation for more than 15 years, has been found dead in New York City hours after telling reporters that Super Bowl LII is \"rigged.\" Dan Goodes was found dead in his hometown of New York City in what early reports described as an \"gangland-style execution\", hours after blowing the whistle on the \"rigged Super Bowl\" backstage at a promotional event in Minneapolis.\n\nFirst of all, the picture of the crime scene that accompanied the article is from a 2017 story about a police officer being killed in his patrol car in the Bronx neighbourhood.\n\nWe also found no trace of anyone named \"Dan Goodes\" on the internet in combination with the search term \"NFL\", other than exact copies of the hoax story.

It is kind of hard to take any story with so many easily verifiable falsehoods seriously.\n\nYourNewsWire has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt. Their Facebook page \"The People's Voice\" recently lost its verification checkmark according to a report from MMFA.\n\nThe Terms of Use of the site also make it clear they don't really stand behind the accuracy of any of their reporting:\n\nThe site was profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.", "lang": "en"}
