It showed a GMA News report on the alleged gruesome fate of the male rape victim.\n\nThe claim was spotted in a social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle. Facebook pages such as Paolo Pulong Duterte, WBP We Blog Ph, and Unofficial: PNP Chief Ronald \u201cBato\u201d Dela Rosa shared the post, which has accumulated over 800 total interactions combined.\n\nThe facts: The claim is a rape hoax that had circulated in the past. The GMA News video in the article was about a different man\u2019s genital mutilation done by his wife after a marital fight in Pasay City in 2013. It did not mention any OFWs. (READ: CONVERSATION: The plight of #OFWomen)\n\nThe thumbnail used in the embedded video was also false. It was taken from a portion of a GMA News YouTube video posted on July 6, 2018. The image showed a photo of a Filipino worker who fell into a coma after being battered by an unidentified Arab youth in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nThis is the second time that Rappler fact-checked a claim from viralpro.net. In December 2018, it circulated a hoax that claimed the Miss Universe Organization banned mixed ethnicity Filipinos from joining the competition. \u2013 Glenda Marie Castro/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
