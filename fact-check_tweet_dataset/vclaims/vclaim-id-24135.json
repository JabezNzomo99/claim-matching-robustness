That\u2019s a made-up quote from a satirical story published in 2017.\n\nAn old satirical story\u2019s claim that President Donald Trump made a nonsensical suggestion about punishing \u201csuicide bombers\u201d has resurfaced in viral Facebook posts.\n\n\u201cTrump just said he thinks suicide bombers deserve the death penalty,\u201d the posts claim. \u201cThink about it. Take as much time as u need\u2026 .\u201d\n\nThe claim also appeared in a community forum on the website of the AARP; that post received several hundred engagements on Facebook as well, according to CrowdTangle data.\n\nQuick internet searches show that the story that spread the claim was first published in May 2017 on BreakingBurgh.com, under the headline: \u201cTrump Fires Up Base With Call For Death Penalty For Suicide Bombers.\u201d\n\nThat website describes itself as a \u201csatirical blog serving Western Pennsylvania and beyond.\u201d\n\nThe story attributes several made-up quotes to Trump to give the impression that he doesn\u2019t realize suicide bombers kill themselves in their attacks. For example, it claims Trump said, \u201cAnyone who terrorizes and kills good people by suicide bombing deserves nothing less than the highest penalty, which is to pay with their life.\u201d\n\nBut without the context of the full story \u2014 and the blog\u2019s satire disclaimer \u2014 many Facebook users appeared to consider the posts factual and questioned Trump\u2019s intelligence.\n\n\u201cAs incredible as this sounds \u2014 think of who said it,\u201d one user commented. \u201cSharing.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
