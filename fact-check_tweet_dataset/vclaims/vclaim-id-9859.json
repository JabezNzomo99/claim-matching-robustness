London and New York have very similar populations (8.8m and 8.5m respectively in mid-2016), so we can draw comparisons between the total numbers.\n\nBut the recent figures have been outliers. Across the first three months of 2018 there were more homicides in New York than London. There were 57 homicides in New York between January and March and 45 in London.\n\nAnd looking at the number of homicides in the course of a year there were around 2.5 times as many in New York than in London in 2017.\n\nIt is slightly inaccurate to claim the number of \u201cmurders\u201d is higher, as neither the NYPD nor the Metropolitan Police publish murder statistics, only homicide statistics, which include murders and manslaughter charges.\n\nThe claim that the capital has experienced a surge in knife crime is also correct. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics for the year to September 2017 show a 21% increase in offences involving knives or other sharp instruments compared to the previous year, with the largest increase coming from London.\n\nLooking specifically at homicides involving a knife, Home Office police record data shows that the number of offences in London increased from 65 to 76 over the same period.\n\nHomicides have increased in London since 2014, but the numbers are roughly the same over a longer period\n\nThe Metropolitan Police figures show that in 2017 there were 130 homicides, of which 14 were victims of terrorist incidents. While in 2014 there were 84 homicides. Excluding the victims of terrorism, that\u2019s a 38% increase in the number of homicides in the city between 2014 and 2017.\n\nBut looking over a longer term period, the number of homicides in London has remained steady at around 100 per year while in New York homicides have decreased considerably\u2014from 515 in 2011 to 292 in 2017.\n\nComparing figures from London and New York\n\nThere are slight problems directly comparing the data from London to New York, because of the homicide definition mentioned previously.\n\nWhile the police statistics include murder, manslaughter and infanticide within homicide, in New York homicide only includes murder and non-negligent manslaughter.\n\nAs the Metropolitan Police\u2019s definition of homicide is wider than NYPD\u2019s and it is likely to be slightly higher.", "lang": "en"}
