But we thought it worth putting our own assessment of his claims about the Marshall Plan on record too.\n\nNormally, when we see inaccurate claims in public life, they\u2019re based on an incomplete or misleading representation of available information. It\u2019s actually quite rare to see false claims that seem to be pulled completely out of thin air, as Mr Kawczynski\u2019s claim is.\n\nThe Marshall Plan was an aid programme (officially known as the \u201cEuropean Recovery Programme\u201d) undertaken by the USA towards Europe in the aftermath of World War II.\n\nAs the George C. Marshall Foundation puts it: \u201cThe Marshall Plan was intended to rebuild the economies and spirits of western Europe, primarily.\u201d\n\nSources differ to an extent on exactly how much funding went into the Marshall Plan, but what is clear is that not only did the UK receive funds from the plan\u2014contrary to Mr Kawczynski\u2019s claim\u2014but we in fact received more aid than any other nation.\n\nOf the roughly $12 billion that the US put into the programme between 1948 and 1950, the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of $2.7 billion went to the UK, according to the UK government. If you include funding up to 1952 the UK received over $3 billion.\n\nNo country received more than the UK. West Germany received around to $1.5 billion (with the exact sum again depending on which source you read).\n\nSo while sources vary slightly as to the exact amounts, the UK undeniably received far more money from the Marshall Plan than West Germany did.", "lang": "en"}
