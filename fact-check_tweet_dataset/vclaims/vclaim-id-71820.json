It\u2019s my job to be an independent watchdog for taxpayers. To shine a light on government waste, and I found lots of it. Uncovering $350 million in waste and fraud; it led to 40 criminal charges against both Republicans and Democrats.\"\n\nSounds like a lot. We decided to take a closer look at the Democrat\u2019s statement that her office has uncovered $350 million in \"waste and fraud\" and that the discoveries resulted in 40 criminal counts against officials on both sides of the aisle.\n\nWhen we contacted Galloway\u2019s campaign, a staff member cited the 2018 annual report produced by the auditor\u2019s office. That report is compiled from a running list of audits conducted across the state. The $350 million figure showed up in the report, as did 38 of the alleged criminal counts brought as a result of Galloway\u2019s audits. The campaign showed in news releases additional counts brought after the annual report.\n\nDeidrick also provided a chart the office uses to track the number of criminal counts brought as a result of audit findings. The chart listed 19 individuals and tallied up the criminal counts brought against each person; Galloway\u2019s office identified a total of 45 criminal counts, including those filed after the 2018 report.\n\nThere are 551 audit reports available on the auditor\u2019s website from Galloway\u2019s first full month as auditor in May 2015 to the end of 2018. These reports were used to calculate the total \"waste and fraud\" Galloway said her office uncovered.\n\nFor this reason, Hofmann said the distinction Galloway made in her claim that the $350 million was a total of waste and fraud was important. Hofmann said government organizations, in particular, often have \"redundancies, or just places that they\u2019re losing money.\"\n\nWe used Missouri Casenet, a press release from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the Western District of Missouri, a PDF of charges filed and media accounts to look into the criminal counts brought against the people Galloway indicated in her total.\n\nOur research determined that a total of 52 criminal counts were brought against 19 people as a result of audits from Galloway\u2019s office. Receiving stolen property was the most common criminal charge, with 37 counts. The other charges varied, but included counts of forgery, violations of ethics rules by elected officials and stealing of various amounts.\n\nOf the 19 individuals charged, only four were elected officials who ran as a Republican or Democrat. Three of those charged were Democrats, and only one was a Republican. The other 15 individuals \u2013 or about 79 percent of those charged \u2013 were hired employees, nonpartisan appointees or held nonpartisan elected offices.\n\nGalloway\u2019s audits have resulted in over 50 criminal charges, making her claim of 40 criminal counts accurate. However, while the last part of the claim is technically true \u2013 charges have been brought against three Democrats and one Republican official \u2013 only four of the 19 individuals charged held partisan offices. For this reason, her claim lacks important context.", "lang": "en"}
