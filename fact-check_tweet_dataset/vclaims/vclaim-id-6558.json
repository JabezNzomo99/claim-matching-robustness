It\u2019s difficult to say where the item originated, but it\u2019s now widespread, having been reposted as recently as Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nConsidering the dodgy grammar and spelling, the tweet itself likely came from a website allowing people to create fake tweets featuring real accounts. It\u2019s not all that difficult to find one.\n\nIt\u2019s also easy to see that Gates didn\u2019t send the tweet. While he has more than 33 million followers, Gates isn\u2019t nearly as prolific a thumb-masher as Trump.\n\nThe only tweet Gates appears to have sent on Jan. 22 was to congratulate former Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation CEO Jeff Raikes for being elected chairman of the Stanford University Board of Trustees.\n\nThe Internet Archive doesn\u2019t show that he tweeted anything else that day, so it doesn\u2019t appear Gates mentioned Trump and then deleted it. He doesn\u2019t appear to have ever tweeted about Trump at all, although he has been somewhat critical of Trump in the past.\n\nGates did talk with Trump prior to his inauguration and did compare the real estate tycoon to a president \u2014 but it was John F. Kennedy, not Reagan.\n\n\"A lot of his message has been about where he sees things not as good as he'd like,\" Gates said on CNBC on Dec. 13, 2016, about a phone call he had with Trump.\n\n\"But in the same way President Kennedy talked about the space mission and got the country behind that, I think that whether it's education or stopping epidemics, other health breakthroughs, finishing polio, and in this energy space, there can be a very upbeat message that (Trump's) administration is going to organize things, get rid of regulatory barriers, and have American leadership through innovation, be one of the things that he gets behind.\"\n\nGates met with the then-president-elect face-to-face in New York\u2019s Trump Tower later that day for about an hour.\n\n\"It was a good time,\" Gates said afterward. \"We had a good conversation about innovation, how it can help in health, education, the impact of foreign aid and energy, and a wide-ranging conversation about power of innovation.\"\n\nBut that tweet? Despite what scads of disreputable websites report, it never happened.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants On Fire!\n\nEditor's note: The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation supports PolitiFact's initiative to fact-check claims about global health and development.
