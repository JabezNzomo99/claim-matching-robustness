Laws regulating concealed weapons vary by state, but sheriffs in many states have debunked the rumor.\n\nWearing a face mask can curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, but their use has become political. One recent survey from the Pew Research Center found that 83% of liberal Democrats said they usually wear a face mask, while 49% of conservative Republicans said that they do.\n\nSo it may not be surprising that the issue has crossed over to another politically divisive topic \u2014 gun laws.\n\nFacebook pages and Instagram users are sharing a meme that falsely claims: \u201cKnow what else wearing a mask does??? Anyone?? REMOVES YOUR CONCEAL CARRY ability. That\u2019s right!! Its in the rules. CCW licencees are NOT allowed to wear face coverings while carrying.\u201d\n\nBut there are no blanket \u201crules\u201d that apply to wearing a mask while carrying a concealed weapon. Laws vary by state, and sheriffs across the country have issued statements debunking the claim.\n\n\u201cConcealed carry is a state by state deal,\u201d Warren Eller, chair of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice public administration department, told us by email. \u201cWith that said, I can tell you that none of the 8 states I have had permits in have any such rule.\u201d\n\nProvisions related to wearing masks or face coverings \u201care not necessarily in concealed carry statutes,\u201d Anne Teigen told us by email. She covers state firearms policy for the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those regulations are often found in separate statutes.\n\nThe NCSL compiled a list of 18 such state laws, plus one in the District of Columbia. Most of those laws address the use of a face covering during the commission of a crime or to conceal a person\u2019s identity. None of the laws specifically reference someone carrying a legally permitted concealed weapon.\n\nWe\u2019ll use North Carolina as an example since, as Eller pointed out, the state\u2019s concealed carry law generated news after Gov. Roy Cooper announced on June 24 that everyone must wear face coverings while in public.\n\nNowhere in North Carolina\u2019s concealed carry law does it mention the use of face masks or coverings. But an unrelated section of state law does. It\u2019s titled, \u201cProhibited Secret Societies and Activities,\u201d and when it was passed in 1953 it was referred to as the \u201canti-Ku Klux Klan statute.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s relevant to the claim made in this meme is that the law specifies:\n\u2022 No person or persons at least 16 years of age shall, while wearing any mask, hood or device whereby the person, face or voice is disguised so as to conceal the identity of the wearer, enter, be or appear upon any lane, walkway, alley, street, road, highway or other public way in this State.\n\u2022 No person or persons shall in this State, while wearing any mask, hood or device whereby the person, face or voice is disguised so as to conceal the identity of the wearer, enter, or appear upon or within the public property of any municipality or county of the State, or of the State of North Carolina.\n\u2022 No person or persons at least 16 years of age shall, while wearing a mask, hood or device whereby the person, face or voice is disguised so as to conceal the identity of the wearer, demand entrance or admission, enter or come upon or into, or be upon or in the premises, enclosure or house of any other person in any municipality or county of this State.\n\u2022 No person or persons at least 16 years of age shall while wearing a mask, hood or device whereby the person, face or voice is disguised so as to conceal the identity of the wearer, hold any manner of meeting, or make any demonstration upon the private property of another unless such person or persons shall first obtain from the owner or occupier of the property his or her written permission to do so, which said written permission shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the county in which said property is located before the beginning of such meeting or demonstration.\n\u2022 It shall be unlawful for any person or persons, while wearing a mask, hood or device whereby the person, face or voice is disguised so as to conceal the identity of the wearer, to place or cause to be placed at or in any place in the State any exhibit of any kind whatsoever, with the intention of intimidating any person or persons, or of preventing them from doing any act which is lawful, or of causing them to do any act which is unlawful. For the purposes of this section, the term \u201cexhibit\u201d includes items such as a noose.\n\nNo part of that law applies specifically to concealed weapon permit holders. Furthermore, each provision requires that the intent be to \u201cconceal the identity of the wearer.\u201d So the law doesn\u2019t apply to face coverings for medical or public health reasons.\n\nIn addition, Cooper signed a bill in May that temporarily amended that law, specifying that those who are \u201cwearing a mask for the purpose of ensuring the physical health or safety of the wearer or others\u201d are exempt.\n\nAt least three North Carolina sheriff\u2019s offices also have publicly clarified that it\u2019s not illegal to wear a COVID-19-related mask while carrying a legally permitted concealed weapon.\n\nAs the rumor spread widely online, sheriffs in other states have done the same.\n\nResponding to the broad claim in the meme, John Donohue, a professor at Stanford Law School who has done research in the area of concealed carry laws, told us by email, \u201cThis issue is largely the product of either the paranoid element that exists in part of the American gun community or the malicious element that also exists in part of the gun community that often seeks to divide Americans, which is particularly reprehensible at this stressful time.\n\n\u201cIf you are lawfully carrying a concealed weapon, no one will know, so the mask will be a non-issue. If you are wearing a mask to protect your health or that of others, you cannot be prosecuted,\u201d Donohue said. \u201cThe only problem that would occur would be if you are trying to conceal your identity to commit a crime, in which case you are a criminal and should be arrested.\u201d\n\nSo, while laws vary by state, we were unable to find an example of a regulation that makes it illegal to carry a permitted concealed weapon while wearing a face mask for health reasons. And there is no nationwide rule that would broadly apply to all concealed carry permit holders.\n\nUpdate, July 15: Readers have contacted us seeking information about the impact of wearing face masks on concealed carry laws in their states. This is what we\u2019ve learned:\n\nIndiana law permits its residents to carry weapons, but there is no law on concealed carry. \u201cUnder the law, a mask does not interfere with the ability to carry,\u201d a spokesperson for Gov. Eric Holcomb told us by email on July 2.\n\nIllinois State Police issued this statement after Gov. J. B. Pritzker signed an executive order in April mandating the use of face masks: \u201cThe Governor\u2019s Executive Order regarding the wearing of masks or protective facial coverings in public settings during this serious global pandemic was not intended to negatively impact permit holders under the Illinois Concealed Carry Act while legally carrying firearms. The Executive Order does not require or suggest that law enforcement should arrest or criminally charge conceal carry license permit holders for wearing protective masks while in public as long as they are complying with the other provisions of the Illinois Concealed Carry Act and are not committing any other violations of Illinois law.\u201d\n\nGeorgia has an anti-mask law similar to North Carolina\u2019s; it was passed in 1951 in response to Ku Klux Klan harassment. Gov. Brian Kemp suspended the law in April with an executive order specifying that the law \u201cshall not apply to any person wearing \u2018a mask, hood, or device by which any portion of the face is so hidden, concealed, or covered as to conceal the identity of the wearer\u2019 if that person is wearing such device for the purpose of complying with the guidance of any healthcare agency or to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\u201d Kemp\u2019s press secretary, Cody Hall, confirmed to us by email that wearing a mask due to the COVID-19 pandemic won\u2019t affect the ability to carry a weapon.\n\nMichigan law makes it a misdemeanor to wear \u201ca mask or other device\u201d that conceals a person\u2019s face \u201cfor the purpose of facilitating the commission of a crime.\u201d But that\u2019s unrelated to the state\u2019s law on concealed weapons, which says nothing about the use of masks. The sheriff in Roscommon County, Edward Stern, confirmed to FactCheck.org that there is nothing in state law that would prohibit the carrier of a permitted concealed weapon from wearing a face mask for public health reasons. Similarly, the sheriff\u2019s office in Montcalm County posted on Facebook about the issue, saying, \u201cBottom line-you are not breaking the law if lawfully carrying a concealed weapon and wearing a mask.\u201d\n\nTennessee has an anti-mask law geared toward stopping hate crimes, similar to the laws in North Carolina and Georgia. Tennessee makes it illegal to \u201cwear a mask or disguise\u201d while intimidating someone from exercising his or her civil rights. But its law on carrying handguns says nothing about wearing a mask. The executive director of the Tennessee Firearms Association confirmed in an interview with a Fox News station in Nashville that it is legal to wear a face mask during the COVID-19 pandemic and carry a permitted gun in Tennessee.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
