Bombardier\u2019s claim suggests it\u2019s closer to 2% of GDP.\n\nIt\u2019s very possible Mr Smith misspoke when he made the claim and meant to say this. We\u2019re trying to confirm whether Bombardier recognises Mr Smith\u2019s version.\n\nJobs at Bombardier are threatened due to a trade dispute. Bombardier is a Canadian company. Their plant in Belfast is involved in producing the C-Series plane.\n\nUS plane manufacturer Boeing claims that Bombardier was able to sell the C-Series to the US airline Delta at a reduced price because Canada and the UK had provided illegal state subsidies to the company.\n\nThe US Department of Commerce is investigating the case. If they decide against Bombardier, the cost of importing the plane the Belfast factory helps make to the US could rise sharply with \u201cserious implications for the workers\u201d at the Belfast plant, according to the UK government.\n\nBased on published figures Owen Smith\u2019s statement that Bombarder makes up 10% of the Northern Ireland economy is unlikely to be right. We\u2019ve asked his office for more details.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s economy was worth about \u00a334 billion in 2015, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics. So 10%\u2014as Mr Smith\u2019s claim suggests\u2014is in the region of \u00a33.4 billion.\n\nFigures suggest that about 22% of the NI economy comes from manufacturing exports. If Bombardier does make up 10% of that, as the company itself says, then its exports would be worth about about \u00a3760 million and account for roughly 2% of the overall economy.\n\nSeparate figures suggest the manufacturing of transport equipment as a whole is worth just under 2% of the economy.\n\nThese calculations are very rough and neither will show Bombardier\u2019s exact contribution to Northern Ireland\u2019s economy. But they do suggest 10% is unrealistically high.", "lang": "en"}
