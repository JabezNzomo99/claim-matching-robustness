He and several IRA employees were named in a federal indictment filed in February 2018.\n\nThe reports comprise nearly 150 pages of densely packed information, publicly available online. Yet Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, what he read \u201cin public access\u201d generated \u201cnothing but misunderstanding,\u201d as quoted in the Russian state media outlet TASS.\n\nHe is further quoted as claiming the reports include nothing but \u201cgeneral claims and accusations.\u201d\n\n\"We believe that these are absolutely unfounded claims,\" Peskov stated, as quoted by TASS. \"The Russian state and the Russian government have nothing to do with any meddling [in other countries\u2019 domestic affairs], moreover with this abstract kind of meddling.\"\n\nEven a cursory reading of the extensive reports shows Peskov\u2019s comments to be false.\n\nThe Computational Propaganda Research Project\u2019s report outlines the data it analyzed from the social media companies:\n\nOn Page Six: \u201cFacebook provided data on ads bought by IRA users on Facebook and Instagram and on organic posts on both platforms generated by accounts the company knew were managed by IRA staff. Twitter provided a vast corpus of detailed account information on the Twitter accounts the company knew were managed by IRA staff. Google provided images of ads, videos that were uploaded to YouTube, and non-machine-readable PDFs of tabulated data on advertisements but provided no context or documentation about this content.\u201d\n\nThe project concluded the data enabled researchers to understand \u201cIRA activity across platforms, along with visibility into platforms on which little or no data had previously been revealed, such as Instagram.\u201d\n\nNew Knowledge provided specific numbers of accounts, engagements and followers. On page 18: \u201cThe IRA developed a collection of over 3841 personal accounts on Twitter; approximately 1.4 million people engaged with their tweets. They generated 72,801,807 engagements on their original content.\u201d\n\nOn Facebook, New Knowledge said data was provided \u201c\u2026from 81 unique Pages, of which 33 had over 1000 followers. Of these 33, fourteen major pages focused on Black audiences, five were aimed at Left-leaning audiences, one was a travel-focused older page, and thirteen targeted Right leaning audiences.\u201d\n\nThe Computational Research Project included pages of tables such s the one below detailing posts on Instagram:\n\nThe New Knowledge report includes many pages of images distributed by the IRA on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter:\n\nBoth of the reports concluded the Russian online activity was aimed at divisions among voters and in U.S. politics \u201c\u2026designed to polarize the US public and interfere in elections\u2026\u201d\n\nFar from \u201cgeneral\u2026and unfounded claims,\u201d as Peskov alleges, the reports are specific, providing the U.S. publicly and the Russian public, through open sources, the first detailed look at the inner workings of a campaign hatched in Moscow and directed at U.S. voters.\n\nWe judge Peskov\u2019s comments to be false.", "lang": "en"}
