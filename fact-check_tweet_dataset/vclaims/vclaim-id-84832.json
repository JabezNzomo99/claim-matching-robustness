He begins to have a point when talking about indirect spending on NATO: The U.S. defense expenditure represents about 72 percent of the spending on defense by all countries that are NATO members. U.S. defense spending far exceeds the spending of other NATO members, and that imbalance is driven by America\u2019s role as a world power. It makes little sense to count defense spending in Asia as part of \u201cNATO funding.\u201d We awarded this claim Three Pinocchios.\n\nTrump: \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t. I was never for it. I was against it \u2014 before it ever started, I was against it. And I was against it from before 2004. I was against the war in Iraq, and I was against it for years. And [President George W.] Bush used to hate me for being so against it, and they sent people from the White House to try and convince me. All I\u2019d say is, \u2018It will destabilize the Middle East, and Iran will take over the Middle East.\u2019 And that\u2019s exactly what happened.\u201d\n\nTrump has said since October 2015 that the White House tried to hush his (nonexistent) opposition ahead of the invasion. Trump never answered our request for the names of White House officials he supposedly met with. We checked with a dozen former Bush White House officials, and none could recall a meeting with Trump, concerns about his opposition, or even Trump\u2019s views being on their radar prior to 2004. We awarded this claim Four Pinocchios.\n\nWhile Trump has provided the majority of funds raised by the campaign committee so far, he has raised money from individual donations, as we\u2019ve written. Of the $48.4 million raised as of April 16, 2016, 75 percent ($36 million) was money from Trump. The rest came from mostly individual donations, according to FEC data maintained by the Center for Responsive Politics. As of April 16, 2016, outside groups contributed $2.8 million to the Trump campaign.\n\nWe looked into allegations that Hillary Clinton had told two stories after the attacks \u2014 a private one that it was a terrorist attack and the public one that blamed Muslim outrage over a YouTube video. The evidence was mixed, open to interpretation, but we concluded that there was not enough for GOP rivals to make definitive judgments that she lied.\n\nWe also reached out to family members to get their side of the story. Their recollections fell into three camps: Clinton talked about the video; Clinton said something odd; Clinton never mentioned the video. This is difficult to fact-check, since the conversations weren\u2019t recorded and memories can evolve over time. Most family members interviewed said she did not mention a video \u2014 but we\u2019ll leave it up to readers to draw their own conclusions.\n\nAs we have noted before, economists generally have been skeptical of such claims, as it is difficult to separate out the impact of trade agreements on jobs, compared with other, broader economic trends. The Congressional Research Service in 2015 concluded that the \u201cnet overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP.\u201d The report, however, noted that there were \u201cworker and adjustment costs\u201d as the three countries established a single market. That means there were some losers \u2014 but also winners.", "lang": "en"}
