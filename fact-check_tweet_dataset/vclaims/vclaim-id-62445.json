The claims are false; as of July 1, 2020, Chinese media continues to report on the hospitalisation of COVID-19 patients; experts warn the purported remedies for COVID-19 cited in the misleading posts do not cure the virus and are potentially harmful to human health.\n\nThe claims were published here on Facebook on June 25, 2020. The post has been shared more than 260 times.\n\nThe Tagalog-language claim translates to English as: \u201cJust in case you get Infected with covid 19 corona virus\u2019s [sic] / Just share / Read this.\u201d\n\nThe text in the image reads: \"Chinese are not taking any medicine or any vaccine for Corona virus. Every household has a Corona Virus case. They have stopped going to hospital for cure. They instead kill the virus with heat. / Very Hot Steam Inhalation from kettle 4 times a day / Hot Gargles 4 times a day / Hot tea 4 times a day / Virus dies in 4 days. / 5th Day you are Corona Negative.\"\n\nSimilar claims have also been shared here, here, here and here on Facebook, and here and here on Twitter.\n\nThe claims, however, are false; as of June 30, 2020, Chinese media continues to report on COVID-19 patients hospitalised across the country.\n\nThis June 30, 2020 report by China\u2019s state-run Xinhua News Agency states, in part: \"Chinese health authority said Tuesday it received reports of 19 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases on the Chinese mainland Monday, including eight domestically transmitted and 11 imported ones.\n\n\"By Monday, the Chinese mainland had reported a total of 1,918 imported cases. Of the cases, 1,830 had been discharged after recovery, and 88 remained hospitalized. No deaths from the imported cases had been reported.\"\n\nAnother Xinhua report, published a day earlier, mentioned the discharge of the first person from the latest COVID-19 infection cluster in Beijing from a hospital in the Chinese capital.\n\nThe report states in part: \u201cHe went to a hospital on June 12 after experiencing symptoms of fever and fatigue and tested positive in a nucleic acid test. The patient had been treated in Beijing Ditan Hospital since June 13.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, this news release from China\u2019s National Health Commission, as well as other reports from Chinese media here and here, all made references to the hospitalisation of COVID-19 patients in China in June 2020.\n\nExperts say the claim about \u201ckilling\u201d the novel coronavirus through \"steam inhalation\"; \u201chot gargles\u201d; and by drinking hot tea are without any scientific basis and potentially harmful to human health. AFP has previously debunked the claims here, here and here.\n\nThe Philippine health department also warned against steam inhalation in this Tagalog-language graphic posted to Facebook on June 25, 2020.\n\n\u201cSteam inhalation... does not kill the COVID-19 virus and is not among the remedies against COVID-19,\u201d the graphic states. \u201cThere\u2019s a possibility that the virus attaches to the steam (aerosolization), that can lead to the spread of disease.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can also cause accidents like burns and scalding.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
