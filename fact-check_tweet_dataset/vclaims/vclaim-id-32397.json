But the statement was revised in 2014.\n\u2022 None Currently, the WHO does not recommend an \u201cideal\u201d caesarean rate. Instead, every effort should be made to provide caesarean sections to women who need them, an expert told Africa Check. \n\n\n\n\n\nWith the start of the new year, babies born on the first day of 2020 were\n\nin South Africa. But it was not plain sailing for all expectant mothers.\n\nTwo women died while giving birth in South Africa\u2019s Gauteng province during the 2019 festive season, the provincial government\u2019s health representative, MEC\n\nMasuku was also reported to have said that South Africa\u2019s caesarean rates are twice the globally accepted average.\n\nIs this claim accurate? We checked.\n\nis a surgical procedure used to deliver a baby through an opening in the mother\u2019s lower abdomen rather than through the vaginal canal.\n\nSome pregnant women choose to have the procedure done but many caesareans happen because of complications during pregnancy or labour.\n\nWe asked Masuku\u2019s office for the source of the claim that South Africa\u2019s caesarean rate was twice the globally accepted average. Philani Mhlungu, the MEC\u2019s spokesperson, gave us evidence to show that Gauteng province\u2019s caesarean rates were twice the globally accepted average.\n\nIn Gauteng, during the 2017/18 financial year, 29% (63,560) of all births occurred via caesarean section, he said. He added that the World Health Organization \u201crecommends 15% of births to be caesarean births\u201d.\n\nThe Saving Mothers reports, prepared by the\n\nnational committee for confidential enquiry into maternal deaths, also contain figures on caesarean rates.\n\n(62,847) of all public sector births in Gauteng were via caesarean delivery. South Africa\u2019s national public sector caesarean rate for the same year was 27.4% (248,381).\n\ntold Africa Check that in the 2016/17 financial year, 75.7% of all deliveries in private medical facilities were via caesarean section. During the 2017/18 financial year the figure increased slightly to 76.9%.\n\nCalculating a combined public and private rate isn\u2019t straightforward. The public data is reported by calendar year and the private data by financial year.\n\nHowever, if we use 2017 data from the department of health and private data from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018, the figure is\n\nHow do these rates compare to countries around the world?\n\nGlobally, 21.1% of all births occur via c-section\n\nNaomi Massyn is one of the editors of the\n\nreport, an annual publication that monitors health data from each of South Africa\u2019s 52 health districts.\n\n, which included data from 169 countries. It showed that globally there were\n\ncaesarean deliveries in 2015. This was 21.1% of all births that year.\n\n. The Dominican Republic had the highest rate \u2013\n\n. When regional data was examined, the researchers found that caesarean rates were\n\nin West and Central Africa and\n\nin Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nWHO does not recommend \u2018ideal\u2019 rate\n\nBut how many caesarean deliveries are too many? We contacted\n\nfrom the WHO\u2019s department of reproductive health and research. She leads the organisation\u2019s work around caesarean sections.\n\n\u201cThere is an average rate of caesarean section worldwide. If you take the caesarean rate from all the countries and you calculate the average, you get about 20%.\u201d But that has nothing to do with an \u201caccepted\u201d caesarean rate, she said.\n\nIn 1985, the WHO met with experts to discuss what was thought to be a large increase of caesarean rates worldwide. Based on the evidence available, they\n\nthat \u201cthere is no justification for any region to have caesarean section rates higher than 10-15%\u201d.\n\nBut this conclusion was based on data from northern European countries where the outcomes were the best in the world, Betran explained. \u201cSo, by default, it was accepted that if these north European countries could achieve the best outcomes of a caesarean section rate between 10 and 15%, that should be considered the optimal caesarean section rate.\u201d\n\nNearly thirty years later, in 2014, the WHO conducted a review to \u201cunderstand whether this 10 to 15% still held\u201d, Betran said. The organisation then\n\nthat it was\n\nwhat effect caesarean section rates had on outcomes like the death rates of mothers and babies.\n\n\u201cThere is not sufficient evidence,\u201d Betran said, which is why the WHO \u201cdoes not currently hold a recommendation for an ideal caesarean section rate\u201d.\n\n\u201cRather than strive to achieve a specific rate, WHO\u2019s message is that every effort should be made to provide caesarean sections to women in need,\u201d Betran said.\n\n\u2018There is no good or bad caesarean section rate\u2019\n\nWhen asked whether South Africa\u2019s caesarean rate of 27.4% is concerning, Betran said: \u201cThere is no good or bad caesarean section rate. There are good and bad outcomes.\u201d\n\nFor example, if a country has a caesarean rate of 20% and all the outcomes are good, it\u2019s great. But if a country is trying to lower its caesarean rate and it still has bad outcomes, that\u2019s not good, Betran explained.\n\nOne also has to consider the differences in healthcare systems, Betran said.\n\n\u201cWe could never judge if it was appropriate for a Tanzanian doctor, looking at a woman that is having difficulties, to decide at four in the afternoon to do a caesarean section if he knows that he\u2019s not going to have any obstetrician on call overnight.\u201d\n\nIn comparison, Betran explained, a doctor in the United Kingdom might allow a woman to continue labouring through the night, knowing that there will be an obstetrician and anaesthetist available if there is an emergency.\n\nConclusion: WHO used to recommend caesarean rates between 10 and 15%, now says \u2018every effort should be made to provide caesarean sections to women in need\u2019\n\nIn early 2020, Gauteng health MEC Bandile Masuku claimed that South Africa\u2019s caesarean rates are twice the globally accepted average.\n\nThe World Health Organization previously recommended that caesarean rates should range between 10 and 15% but this was revised in 2014. Due to lack of evidence around the effect of caesarean section rates on other outcomes, the WHO does not currently recommend an ideal caesarean section rate.\n\nThe latest data shows that South Africa\u2019s caesarean rate in public hospitals was 27.4% in 2017. When we take into account data from the private sector, the national caesarean section rate rises to just over 32%.\n\nNone of these figures are twice the global average of 21.1%.", "lang": "en"}
