Alas, it is not so.\n\nThe story, posted Feb. 4 on the blog ehealthdigest.org, has been on the internet since at least May 2015.\n\nThe story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: No, NASA has not discovered a planet covered in marijuana.\n\nIf such a thing did happen, it would be national news and not simply a regurgitated report on a few obscure blogs.\n\nThe story has been repeatedly debunked. The planet that was supposedly discovered \u2014 Planet X637Z-43 \u2014 even has its own hoax Wikipedia page.\n\nThe post attempts to make the claim appear slightly credible but falls short in several areas, especially when quoting Harvard astronomer David Charbonneau as saying, \"Imagine if it takes 140 years to travel from one planet to another, let\u2019s just say it\u2019s going to be a very long trip. You better have rolled yourself a couple of joints for the road.\"\n\nWe reached out to Charbonnaeu but did not immediately hear back.\n\nThis is full on Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
