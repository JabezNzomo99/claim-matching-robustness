The video is claimed to be from the Badminton Court of the National Sports Club of India (NSCI) in Mumbai, which has been converted into a quarantine center for Coronavirus-infected patients.\n\nVishvas News investigated and found the claim to be misleading. This video, which is going viral in the name of Mumbai\u2019s NSCI Quarantine Center, is of a Quarantine Center in Tripura.\n\nFacebook user \u2018Aditya Patil\u2019 shared the viral video (archive link), writing, \u201cNSCI badminton court!!! Who is keeping a eye on all this or Night life is still on??\u201d\n\nThe video has been shared by many other users with this claim on Twitter as well. Nitesh Rane, an MLA from Kankavali in Maharashtra, shared this video stating it of Mumbai.\n\nResponding to this same tweet, the official handle of the Greater Mumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) stated that: this is not a video from NSCI nor is any badminton court being used for COVID facility there.\n\nAfter this, in another tweet, responding to the official handle of BMC, it was stated said that this video is from Tripura.\n\nSearching the appropriate keywords, we found the same video uploaded on June 9, 2020 on Tripura\u2019s local news portal \u2018TRIPURAINFOWAY TIWN\u2019 YouTube channel.\n\nAccording to the information provided with the video, this view is of Hapania Quarantine Center in Tripura. In the search, we found another video bulletin uploaded on the same YouTube channel on June 3, 2020. The details stated that the COVID-19 center will be opened from June 4 in Hapania, Tripura.\n\nVishvas News contacted Dr. Subhashish Debbarma, Director, Health Services Department, Tripura. He said, \u2018The video is of the Quarantine Center in Hapania.\u2019\n\nTripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb has also informed about the opening of this Quarantine Center from his official Twitter handle.\n\nThe user who shared the viral post has declared himself as a resident of Mumbai in his profile.\n\nConclusion: Video of patients dancing at COVID-19 quarantine centre is not from Mumbai, but Tripura.", "lang": "en"}
