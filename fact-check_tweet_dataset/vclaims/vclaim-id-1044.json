Reuters found no report from a credible source mentioning the tweet. An archived version of Tyson\u2019s Twitter account from May 29, 2020 visible archive.vn/VOqHF does not include it.\n\nMost iterations of the claim feature a chart that allegedly shows \u201cinterracial violent crime from 2012 to 2015\u201d. The data illustrated on the chart appears to be drawn from a document visible here (see Table 1), published by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) in 2017.\n\nThe report presents average yearly data (not 2012-2015 cumulative) on non-fatal personal crimes, which includes rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault, as defined on pages 1 and 11.\n\nThe report finds that in \u201cthe majority of violent victimizations, white victims\u2019 offenders were white and black victims\u2019 offenders were black\u201d.\n\nThe report presents average yearly data (not 2012-2015 cumulative) on non-fatal personal crimes, which includes rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault, as defined on pages 1 and 11.\n\nThe report finds that in \u201cthe majority of violent victimizations, white victims\u2019 offenders were white and black victims\u2019 offenders were black\u201d.\n\nThe data presented in the bar chart is partly inaccurate \u2014 in some iterations of the graph two numbers are incorrect (white-on-black should be 92,728, black-on-Hispanic should be 173,537). While the other numbers are true, the graph is presented in a misleading way. While it is true black-on-white crime was the highest if only looking at interracial percentages, this understates the importance of demographic realities (that as of the 2019 Census, whites make up 76.5% of U.S. population and blacks 13.4%). ( here )\n\nThe civil rights organization Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), argues that this higher rate can be explained by population size and the impact of segregation. \u201cEssentially, black people are far more likely to come into contact with white people in the course of their daily life than the other way around\u201d ( here ).\n\nThe graph also omits white-on-white violent crime, which is substantially higher than black-on-white. The BJS documents 2,082,546 white-on-white violent victimizations, for example. Out of the total violent crime on whites (3,679,410), 56.6% was white-on-white, 14.7% was black-on-white and 11% was Hispanic-on-white. The 540,873 black-on-white victimizations illustrated in the chart is representative of 14.7% of the total violent crimes committed on white victims (page 2 here ).\n\nAccording to SPLC, the numbers on \u201cinterracial crime and violence committed by minorities\u201d have been continuously used in narratives by \u201cwhite-supremacist-myths\u201d.\n\nThe SPLC notes in another article that white supremacists have constantly appealed to the \u201cmanipulation\u201d of crime statistics to make the claim that \u201cnonwhite minorities, particularly African-Americans, are far more crime-prone and the source of most violent crime against whites.\u201d ( here )\n\nFalse. Mike Tyson did not tweet about black-on-white \u201ckillings\u201d, meme features misleading chart\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
