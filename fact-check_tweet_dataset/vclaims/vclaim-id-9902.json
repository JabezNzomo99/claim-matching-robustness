The median hourly wage gap for these employers is around 10%.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-9902", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/gender-pay-gap-new-figures/", "vclaim": "Gender pay gap: what do the new figures tell us?\n\nNew rules means that all UK employers with over 250 staff have to report their gender pay gap to the government. Over 10,000 employers had responded at the time of writing, of which around 5% either had under 250 employees, or didn\u2019t provide the total number.\n\n78% of these employers had a gender pay gap in March or April 2017. That\u2019s around eight in ten.\n\nAmong these firms, the median hourly wage for women is 10% less than for men. That compares to around 18% across all UK workers. These figures refer to full and part-time workers.\n\nWhat is the gender pay gap?\n\nIt\u2019s the difference between men\u2019s and women\u2019s average earnings, and is often expressed as a percentage of male earnings.\n\nThat\u2019s not the same as unequal pay\u2014when men and women get paid different amounts for doing the same work. That\u2019s been unlawful since 1970.\n\nWhat do the new figures tell us?\n\n14% of employers with more than 250 employees reported no gender pay gap, and 8% have a negative gap (meaning women have a higher median hourly salary than men).\n\nMen had higher median bonuses at 53% of organisations, with women having the higher average at 15%. Across all employers of 250 people or more, the median bonus for a woman was 6% lower than for a man.\n\nThe data also allows you to look at the specific situation at each of the 10,000 organisations in more detail. You can search for any organisation covered by the data here.\n\nOn average, the bigger the employer-size, the higher the gender pay gap. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says that \u201cover time the data will allow the monitoring of trends in gender pay gaps in different industries\u201d.\n\nBut it adds that the figures must be interpreted with care. It suggests that there may be different reasons for pay gaps in different organisations and at different points in employees\u2019 careers.\n\nFor example, it says \u201cresearch also shows that some, but not all, of the gender wage gap is explained by the fact that after having children women are much more likely than men to work part-time, and part-time work is associated with little or no subsequent progression in hourly wages.\u201d\n\nIt also suggests there may be some errors in the figures organisations have submitted. For example, the number of employers reporting their pay gap to be exactly zero (in mean and median terms) is larger than would be expected.\n\nAll employers with over 250 employees have to report their gender pay gap. This is based on a \u201csnapshot date\u201d in March or April 2017.\n\nBoth full and part-time workers are included, and each is counted as one individual employee.\n\nAgency workers are counted as the employees of their agency or service company. Self-employed people are counted in an organisation\u2019s data if they \u201cpersonally perform\u201d work for them.\n\nEmployees based overseas are generally included if their contract is subject to English, Scottish, or Welsh law.", "lang": "en"}
