{"title": "Did a Starbucks Manager Threaten to Fire Employees Who Say 'Merry Christmas'?", "subtitle": "The chimeric \"War on Christmas\" conflict was neatly characterized in a single tweet.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2019-12-19T15:41:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-33853", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/starbucks-fire-merry-christmas/", "vclaim": "The so-called \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d supposedly involves commercial entities\u2019 deliberately eschewing the use of religious symbolism and terminology in their operations and products \u2014 even to the extent of forbidding their employees from wishing customers a \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d\n\nThe stereotype of the atheistic, liberal, anti-Christmas combatant was perfectly encapsulated in a Dec. 4, 2019, tweet from someone who asserted that he was the manager of a Starbucks outlet in Charlotte, North Carolina. He proclaimed that he had \u201cinformed my employees that they will be fired on the spot if I hear them say \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 to any customers\u201d \u2014 an action he purportedly took because he \u201cpersonally dislike(s) conservative Christians\u201d:\n\nThat outrage-inducing tweet gained added prominence when it was amplified a few weeks later by the Facebook campaign page for Republican U.S. Rep. Steve King of Iowa, where it was reposted with the added comment \u201cWow\u201d:\n\n \n\n\n\nBut King (or his campaign) was taken in by a troll. As Starbucks explained many times over, the person behind the Twitter account that posted the controversial tweet (@MuellerDad69) was not a Starbucks employee:\n\nAnd that account \u2014 which Business Insider (BI) noted \u201cpreviously claimed to discriminate against military service members and police officers who were customers at Starbucks\u201d \u2014 was indeed suspended for violating Twitter\u2019s rules:\n\nBI also observed that King, \u201cwho was stripped of his committee seats by his own party in January [2019] after making a series of racist comments, often taunts his political opponents online and traffics in conspiracy theories.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
