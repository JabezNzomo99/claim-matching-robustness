The vehicles keep moving back and forth in the chase. The police van finally manages to intercept the truck and bring it to a halt briefly. However, when the police officer steps out of the vehicle to apprehend the driver he is run over.\n\nThe clip is going viral with captions that suggest the horrific crime is a fallout of stricter penalties proposed for traffic violations under the recent Motor Vehicle Amendment Act 2019.\n\nThe new provisions of the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act 2019 were notified by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways last month and was implemented in many states from September 1. The revised Act has increased the penalties for traffic violations and erring drivers.\n\nThe viral clip has been captioned as: \"The #IndianGovernment has made serious mistakes in the amendment in #MVAct2019, which have had unfortunate repercussions long after the decisions were taken. Feel so sorry for the cop who was crushed to death on road just to avoid the unfair chalaan obtruded by government.\"\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search on the key frames of the video and found that the incident happened in Hengshui City, of Hebei Province in China earlier this year.\n\nThe same video was uploaded to YouTube on May 31, 2019.\n\nMultiple local news reports from China said that the incident occurred in Shenzhou, Hengshui City (China) on May 30 when the truck was being chased by the cops for reckless driving.\n\nAccording to reports, \"Officer Guo Sai and his partner had tried to flag down the suspect surnamed Bai for a routine traffic inspection in the city of Shenzhou, which is in Hengshui City in North China\u2019s Hebei Province. However, Bai refused to stop his heavy goods vehicle, forcing the officers to chase them through the city.\"\n\nThe police officials were directed to intercept the vehicle and stop it, when it ran over an official. The driver then tried to flee the crime scene, but was later caught.\n\nThe Traffic Police Detachment of the Shenzhen Public Security Bureau was quoted as saying that the police officer was in stable condition, while details of his injuries have not been disclosed.\n\nRead more here, here and here.", "lang": "en"}
