It was at that event more than a year ago that the president pointed to a red placard on stage.\n\nContrary to what the meme claims, the sign did not encourage people who dislike America to leave the country. It actually had a much kinder sentiment, simply reading, \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d\n\nThe original image, which The Daily Caller found through a reverse image search, comes from a Reuters photographer.\n\nInternet users have manipulated the words on the placard to express different sentiments in the past. For example, one photoshopped version makes it quote \u201cGucci Gang,\u201d a popular rap song from 2017.\n\nThe doctored image derives its message from comments Trump reportedly made about Haiti and some African countries last year. Trump allegedly referred to those nations as \u201cs***hole countries\u201d during a meeting with senators. The U.N. human rights office condemned the language, saying the remark was \u201cracist\u201d if true.\n\nTrump came under fire last week for suggesting that a group of progressive congresswomen \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\u201d The tweet was widely believed to refer to Democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, all of whom are U.S. citizens and, with the exception of Omar, were born in the U.S.\n\nThe Democrat-led House passed a resolution July 16 condemning his tweets as \u201cracist comments that have legitimized increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.\u201d\n\nTrump responded to the vote, saying over Twitter, \u201cThose Tweets were NOT Racist. I don\u2019t have a Racist bone in my body!\u201d", "lang": "en"}
