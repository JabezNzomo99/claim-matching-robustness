They had come to molest and kidnap Kashmiri women, she claims, further adding that the Indian army tried to hide these dead bodies but failed.\n\nThe 30-second clip has been widely circulated on Facebook. It is also being shared by Pakistani social media users using an Urdu caption \u2013 \u201c\u0628\u06be\u0627\u0631\u062a\u06cc \u0641\u0648\u062c\u06cc \u06c1\u0646\u062f\u0648 \u062c\u0646\u0648\u0646\u06cc\u0648\u06ba \u06a9\u06cc \u0644\u0627\u0634\u06cc\u06ba \u0686\u06be\u067e\u0627\u0646\u06d2 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u0646\u0627\u06a9\u0627\u0645\u060c \u0645\u0642\u0628\u0648\u0636\u06c1 \u06a9\u0634\u0645\u06cc\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u0628\u06be\u0627\u0631\u062a\u06cc \u0641\u0648\u062c\u06cc\u0648\u06ba \u06a9\u0648 \u067e\u06be\u0631 \u0645\u0646\u06c1 \u06a9\u06cc \u06a9\u06be\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u067e\u0691 \u06af\u0626\u06cc* *\u06a9\u0634\u0645\u06cc\u0631\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0627\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u0648 \u0627\u063a\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u06a9\u0631\u06a9\u06d2 \u0644\u06d2 \u062c\u0627\u0646\u06d2 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u06d2 170 \u06c1\u0646\u062f\u0648 \u062c\u0646\u0648\u0646\u06cc \u062c\u06c1\u0646\u0645 \u0648\u0627\u0635\u0644*\u201d\n\nThe complete broadcast by 92 News HD can be watched here.\n\nThe broadcast plays blurred visuals of the purported \u201cHindu fanatics\u201d dressed as army men lying dead on the ground. We found that the same visuals have been circulating on social media. Alt News received a verification request on its official mobile app where the video played during 92 News HD broadcast was shared.\n\nThe video can be watched below.\n\nAlt News broke the video we received on the app into multiple frames and found that a YouTube user had uploaded it on 2016. This itself establishes that the video broadcast by 92 News HD cannot represent a recent event that took place in Kashmir.\n\nTo confirm the exact location of the video, we searched for it with the keywords \u201cCRPF soldiers killed\u201d and found similar visuals on news reports \u2013 a 2010 report by The Hinduand a 2013 report by India Today \u2013 on the Dantewada Maoist attack where 76 security personnel were ambushed and killed.\n\nA comparison of the visuals in the viral video and those in news reports establish that they represent the same event.\n\u2022 A tree trunk which is visible behind the slain bodies in both the images.\n\u2022 The blue mat on which the dead soldiers are laid out can be seen in both the photographs.\n\u2022 The wall with gaping holes is distinctly seen in both the images. The pattern of the holes is also exactly the same.\n\u2022 Several bodies are laid outside the mat \u2013 this too can be seen in both images.\n\nFurthermore, we found another photograph of the same location on AP Images.\n\nOne more hint which confirms that the video has nothing do with Kashmir are the words \u201c\u092c\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0930 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0935\u0939\u0928 \u0938\u0902\u0918 (Bastar parivahan sangh)\u201d imprinted on a mat visible at about 2 minutes in the complete video. Bastar is a district in Chhattisgarh.\n\nA video of the 2010 Dantewada Maoist attack where paramilitary forces were massacred was picked up by a Pakistani news channel to claim that the slain men were \u201cHindu fanatics\u201d, dressed as Indian army men, who abused Kashmiri women. The false claim was earlier shared to circulate another old video.", "lang": "en"}
