Congress has not voted to alter or deny the adjustment for 2020. There hasn\u2019t been a change in congressional salaries since 2009.\n\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA) distributes benefits, among them disability insurance, to well over 60 million Americans each month, using annual cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) to prevent value erosion from inflation.\n\nSince 1975, Congress hasn\u2019t had input in COLAs. The adjustments are automatically made each year based on the change in consumer prices for a basket of goods and services purchased by urban wage earners and clerical workers. Benefits go up if there is a measurable percent increase in the index year over year.\n\nThere also haven\u2019t been any recent votes to alter or deny Social Security COLAs in either chamber of Congress. The SSA announced a 1.6 percent COLA for 2020.\n\nThe post\u2019s claim that Congress approved an $8,872 increase in its own monthly salaries doesn\u2019t hold up either.

Under that law, congressional salaries go up if there is a measurable increase in the Employment Cost Index year over year, unless the adjustment is statutorily denied.\n\nCongress hasn\u2019t seen a salary increase since 2009, when they first instituted the pay freeze. Non-ranking members of the House and Senate currently receive an annual salary of $174,000, and ranking members earn higher salaries \u2013 House Speaker receives $223,500, Senate president pro tempore receives $193,400 and majority and minority leaders in both chambers receive $193,400.", "lang": "en"}
