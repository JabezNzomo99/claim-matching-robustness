Iterations of the image include logos of the Kentucky Department of Education and other authorities, and have been shared at least 1,200 times on Facebook as of April 29, 2020 ( here , here , here , here , here ).\n\nThis claim is false. Multiple Kentucky authorities have publicly said this image is a hoax on their social media channels and urged users to always consult official sources.\n\nThe false claim reads: \u201cAs part of the Kentucky Department of Education effort to maintain a healthy learning environment and a comprehensive education during COVID19, Governor Andy Beshear has authorized Kentucky teachers to make in-home visits. With parental approval, teachers will inspect the bedroom of each student currently enrolled in grades K-8. Teachers will observe social distancing during these in-home visits. Please have your child thoroughly clean their room in preparation for the visit. Teachers WILL contact you to schedule your appointment. Your student WILL BE evaluated for an official grade.\n\nWhile some users acknowledge it as a joke, others believe it is authentic. Example posts read: \u201cThis is some scary sh*t right here. Who feels it\u2019s okay to allow their child\u2019s teacher INTO their bedrooms for an inspection?! Sounds a little Korea. Um, nope. You all better find your backbone\u201d ( here ) and \u201cAre they serious? Just what I need someone coming in our house thats been to other homes well they better be ready to get their shoes lysoled and all.\u201d ( here )\n\nThe Kentucky Department of Education debunked the claim on Twitter and Facebook ( here , here ), noting the logo on the image, visible here , is outdated and hasn\u2019t been used in many years. The Department stressed that any communication on their behalf would be posted on their official social media accounts.\n\nThe Kentucky School Boards Associations also asked parents to spread the word on this image being false ( here ). Michael A. Ford, Superintendent of Russell County Schools, stated this to be a hoax and considered it a \u201cgreat example\u201d to explain social media scams to children ( here ).\n\nGovernor Andy Beshear recently recommended to continue the suspension of in-person classes in Kentucky through to the end of the academic year (here).\n\nEducation Week estimates the school closures have affected at least 55.1 million public and private school students in the U.S. (here). According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), there are over 1,200 million learners affected worldwide amidst the coronavirus outbreak (here).\n\nFalse. A claim that teachers in Kentucky are authorized to do in-home bedroom inspections of students is a hoax.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
