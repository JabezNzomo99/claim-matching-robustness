Thank you!)\u201c\n\nWhen Alt News called the number, it was switched off. Website Newscheckerhowever had earlier fact-checked the video and was able to contact Rocky Bhadauria, a resident of Madhya Pradesh. He informed that the child had wandered into a neighbour\u2019s house while playing outside. After posting her clip on Twitter, the girl\u2019s family members were able to find her and took her home.\n\nThe same message \u201cchild seen in Mangalore with Tamil beggars\u201d was earlier viral to circulate another piece of misinformation where images of a girl from Bangladeshi were shared.", "lang": "en"}
