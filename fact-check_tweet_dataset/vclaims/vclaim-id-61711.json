In national polls conducted during November and December 2003, Edwards lagged significantly behind Howard Dean, Wesley Clark, Richard Gephardt and Joe Lieberman.\n\nBut the poll numbers were a little different in South Carolina. A few polls showed Edwards trailing, but at least two state polls showed Edwards the leading named candidate after \"Don't Know\" or \"Undecided.\" On the other hand, today Edwards seems to be trailing Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in South Carolina in every published poll we were able to find.\n\nEdwards didn't say whether he meant national or local polls in his interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network.\n\nGiven the two polls that showed Edwards leading South Carolina, we can't give him full marks and instead award him Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
