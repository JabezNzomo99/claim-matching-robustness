News reported that it had obtained a tape of former U.S. President Barack Obama talking privately with ex-members of his administration. On the tape, Obama reportedly characterized the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic as \u201can absolute chaotic disaster.\u201d\n\nIn response, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declared during an interview with Lara Trump (President Donald Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law) that \u201cPresident Obama should have kept his mouth shut\u201d and criticized the Obama administration for supposedly failing to prepare a pandemic \u201cgame plan.\u201d That interview was broadcast live by the president\u2019s re-election campaign:\n\nThey claim pandemics only happen once every hundred years but what if that\u2019s no longer true? We want to be early, ready for the next one, because clearly the Obama administration did not leave to this administration any kind of game plan for something like this.\n\nHowever, McConnell\u2019s criticism on the latter point was untrue. As former Obama White House Ebola Response Coordinator Ronald Klain stated in a tweet, \u201cWe literally left them a 69-page Pandemic Playbook \u2026 that they ignored\u201d:\n\nBack in March 2020, Politico had written about the 69-page pandemic playbook (titled \u201cPlaybook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats and Biological Incidents\u201d), which was completed by the Obama administration in 2016:\n\n[H]undreds of tactics and key policy decisions are laid out in a 69-page National Security Council playbook on fighting pandemics \u2026 [R]ecommendations include that the government move swiftly to fully detect potential outbreaks, secure supplemental funding and consider invoking the Defense Production Act \u2026 \u201cEach section of this playbook includes specific questions that should be asked and decisions that should be made at multiple levels\u201d within the national security apparatus, the playbook urges, repeatedly advising officials to question the numbers on viral spread, ensure appropriate diagnostic capacity and check on the U.S. stockpile of emergency resources. The playbook also stresses the significant responsibility facing the White House to contain risks of potential pandemics \u2026\n\nAccording to Politico, the Trump administration had been briefed on the document in 2017, but it was not approved by the National Security Council (NSC) as Trump administration strategy, and one NSC official referred to it as \u201cquite dated\u201d:\n\n[T]he Trump administration was briefed on the playbook\u2019s existence in 2017, said four former officials, but two cautioned that it never went through a full, National Security Council-led interagency process to be approved as Trump administration strategy.\u201d An NSC official confirmed the existence of the playbook but dismissed its value. \u201cWe are aware of the document, although it\u2019s quite dated and has been superseded by strategic and operational biodefense policies published since,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe plan we are executing now is a better fit, more detailed, and applies the relevant lessons learned from the playbook and the most recent Ebola epidemic in the [Democratic Republic of the Congo] to COVID-19.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, contrary to McConnell\u2019s claim, the Obama White House did indeed leave behind a pandemic playbook \u2014 as Ben Rhodes, Obama\u2019s former deputy national security adviser, also noted on Twitter:", "lang": "en"}
