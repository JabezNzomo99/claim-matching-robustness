Regular readers may recall our series of \u201cgaffe checks\u201d during the 2012 campaign, such as President Obama\u2019s \u201cYou didn\u2019t build that\u201d and Mitt Romney\u2019s \u201cI like to fire people.\u201d\n\nBut the Trump campaign has taken this to a new level, trying to spin attack gold out of dropped letters or odd turns of phrase.\n\nA few days ago, the Trump campaign tried to claim that Hillary Clinton pledged to raise taxes on the middle class \u2014 a silly attack, because it was clear from the context of her statement that she was pledging not to raise taxes. PolitiFact asked a linguistic professor to run Clinton\u2019s remarks through a phonetics computer program and found that when she said \u201caren\u2019t,\u201d she hit the \u201cn\u201d but somehow missed the \u201ct.\u201d But she nonetheless said she would not raise taxes.\n\nNow, Trump has seized on an odd turn of phrase for another line of attack. He claims that Clinton said she \u201cshort-circuited\u201d when talking about the FBI investigation of her emails. That statement was made Friday, Aug. 5, and within a day the Trump campaign released a video ad on Facebook that portrays the former secretary of state as a malfunctioning robot. Trump has further attacked her mental capacity, declaring, \u201cI think the people of this country don\u2019t want somebody that\u2019s going to short-circuit up here.\u201d\n\nDuring an appearance before black and Hispanic journalists, Clinton answered a question about remarks that she had made about the FBI\u2019s statements on her controversial email set-up as secretary of state \u2014 statements that earned Four Pinocchios and and a Recidivism Watch. During an interview on Fox News, Clinton had claimed that FBI Director James Comey had said her answers to the public \u201cwere truthful,\u201d when, in fact, he had only said that there was no evidence she had lied to the FBI; he took no position on her public statements.\n\nClinton explained that she was trying to say that her answers to the FBI were consistent with what she has said in public but had conflated the two thoughts to wrongly suggest that Comey had vouched for her public statements.\n\nThe \u201cit\u201d is clearly there, though somewhat obscured because the previous word ended with \u201c-ed.\u201d Indeed, the ASC Services LLC transcription service clearly heard an \u201cit\u201d as well and rendered her comment this way: \u201cSo I may have short-circuited it.\u201d\n\nThere are fewer than 100 days till the election, and clearly we have entered the silly season. Contrary to the narrative spun by the Trump campaign, Clinton did not say she herself \u201cshort-circuited.\u201d She merely said she short-circuited her answer on Fox News \u2014 an answer that, after all, earned her Four Pinocchios. Her statements on the email issue certainly are worthy of scrutiny, but mischaracterizing her comments in this manner is simply wrong. Reporters also should be careful about falling for the Trump campaign\u2019s spin on this comment.", "lang": "en"}
