No, that's not true: The claim is misrepresentation of what the billionaire philanthropist said in a CNBC interviewed. First, COVID-19 vaccine would not be \"his.\" While the Microsoft co-founder's foundation is spending hundreds of millions of dollars supporting COVID-19 testing, treatment and vaccine research, Gates would not own the vaccine. When Gates referred to 700,000 people potentially being harmed, he was using a hypothetical scenario to make it clear that great caution must be taken in vaccine testing to ensure it is safe.\n\nThe claim is included in a video posted on YouTube and used in an article published by NaturalNews.com on May 17, 2020, titled \"Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will be harmed or killed by his coronavirus vaccines\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nNatural News, a website that has been caught promoting false claims about vaccines in the past, misrepresented what Gates said in his April 9, 2020, interview with CNBC. First of all, Gates never \"admitted that upwards of 700,000 people could be injured or die\" from a COVID-19 vaccine. It was a hypothetical number of those who might be harmed IF care was not taken. It is the opposite of the article's claim about Gates' \"rush to develop one, two, or even seven vaccines.\" He was explaining the importance of not rushing.\n\nGates said a vaccine could be ready faster than 18 months \"if everything goes perfectly,\" but until then the world will have to depend on new treatments developed to deal with COVID-19.\n\nThe article falsely claimed that Gates said that for a vaccine to be effective in older people it would \"have to be super-charged, in a sense. And this super-charging means that some people are going to be injured or killed as a result.\"\n\nWhat Gates really said was that making a vaccine that is effective in older people is \"a huge challenge\" because flu vaccines are less effective for the elderly. \"And doing that so that you amp it up so that it works in older people, and yet you don't have side effects, if we have one in 10,000 side effects that's way more, 700,000 people who will suffer from that.\"\n\nNote, he said it should be made so \"you don't have side effects\" that harm people. Gates never said \"700,000 people will be harmed or killed\" as the article's headline claimed he said.\n\nA vaccine that does not give full immunity for the elderly is still a major protection for them, he said. \"Most of the benefit comes from younger people not spreading it because they're vaccinated and that benefits, on a community basis, the elderly.\"\n\nGates did acknowledge that there \"will be some risks\" from a vaccine:\n\nThis is the video titled Bill Gates Admits [Cerveza 19] Vaccine could possibly Kill And Maim 700,000 embedded in the Natural News article:\n\nThis is the full interview as uploaded by CNBC:\n\nThe Natural News article ended with the suggested that Gates, who has vowed to leave almost all of his $106 billion fortune to charity, should be hung or shot to death and that he was \"paving the way for the antichrist.\"\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes naturalnews.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
