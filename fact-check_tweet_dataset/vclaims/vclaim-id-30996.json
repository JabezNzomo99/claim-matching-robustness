Many of his works, such as \u201cThe Importance of Being Earnest\u201d and \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray,\u201d are still highly regarded in literary circles.\n\nThe alleged quote featured in the Facebook post has been widely attributed to Wilde online, yet there is no credible source linking it to him. The DCNF searched a collection of his complete works but found nothing matching the statement. (RELATED: Did Oscar Wilde Coin This Saying About Happiness?)\n\nThe Oscar Wilde Society Chairman Donald Mead confirmed to the DCNF in an email that the quote is not genuine, writing, \u201cThis is definitely not Oscar. It is all over the internet with no source.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefinitely not Wilde!\u201d concurred Sos Eltis, author of \u201cRevising Wilde: Society and Subversion in the Plays of Oscar Wilde,\u201d in an email to the DCNF. \u201cHilarious that anyone claims it is.\u201d\n\nWhile there is no evidence Wilde ever coined the saying, it is thematically similar to several statements about identity found in his writings. In a 1987 letter to his friend and lover Lord Alfred Douglas, Wilde wrote, \u201cIt is tragic how few people ever \u2018possess their souls\u2019 before they die.\u201d\n\nThe website Quote Investigator traced the earliest instance of the quote back to a 1999 post on Usenet, an early computer network of discussion threads, though a thematically-related statement by theologian Thomas Merton was published in The Hudson Review several decades earlier.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
