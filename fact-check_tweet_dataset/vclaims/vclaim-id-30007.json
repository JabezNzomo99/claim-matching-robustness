According to the report, robbers had broken into the Kali temple on Tuesday morning.\n\nMedia outlet Prabhat Khabar reported the incident on January 22. As per the article, locals informed the police that the robbers used sticks to steal jewellery placed on the idol. However, they failed and the idol broke. The report also claimed that five people were arrested for the crime.\n\nAlt News contacted New Jalpaiguri police station and was told that it was indeed a robbery attempt. The robbers tried to steal jewellery with sticks with hooked ends but failed. The police informed that no jewellery was found stolen. However, contrary to Prabhat Khabar\u2019s reportage, the cops also said that arrests are yet to be made and the case is still under investigation. Therefore, social media claims blaming members of the Muslim community are baseless.\n\nAccording to Dainik Jagran, this was the eight robbery attempt in the temple.\n\nA case of an attempted robbery at a Kali mandir in Siliguri, West Bengal was communalised on social media. While several users falsely claimed that Hindu deity Kali\u2019s idol was \u2018demolished\u2019, others blamed members of the Muslim community without any base.", "lang": "en"}
