These posts used photos of a rally where the protesters used signs tagged with Anakbayan and KMU.\n\nOne post had the caption, \"Naglabasan talaga! Ginamit pa 'yung QPass [quarantine pass] niyo para makalabas at maggaganyan (You really went out! You even used your quarantine passes to go out and do that).\"\n\nMeanwhile, other posts said, \"LOOK: Nagrally na naman ang mga Kanser ng Lipunan at Coronavirus ng Bayan. Imbes na sumunod sa ipinapatupad na Enhanced Community Quarantine (LOOK: The cancer of society and coronavirus of the nation held another rally. They could have just followed the ongoing enhanced community quarantine).\"\n\nThe facts: The photos were taken during a rally held on February 4, more than a month before Luzon was placed under enhanced community quarantine.\n\nA day before this rally was conducted, President Rodrigo Duterte said \"everything is well\" in the Philippines. There were only two confirmed cases in the country at the time.\n\nDuterte announced the Metro Manila lockdown on March 12. The entirety of Luzon was then placed under lockdown or enhanced community quarantine on March 16.
