But, FACTLY has found that the video is an old one. The same video was posted by a user on Twitter in April 2019 with a description that it was taken at Vidyasagar Setu in West Bengal. The location in the posted video has similarities with the other videos of the bridge. So, it can be confirmed that the video was taken in West Bengal. But it was taken much before the current lockdown.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
