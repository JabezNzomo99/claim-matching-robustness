During the episode, businessman Maverick Carter, asked James about entering a mostly white environment when he started high school.\n\nJames said, \u201cI went to an all-white high school, Catholic high school, so when I first went to the ninth grade in the high school, I was all of a sudden like \u2018I\u2019m not f***ing with white people\u2019. My whole, I was so institutionalized, growing up in the hood, it\u2019s like \u2018they don\u2019t f*** with us, they don\u2019t want us to succeed\u2019 [\u2026] So, I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m going to this school to play ball, and that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t want nothing to do with white people, I don\u2019t believe that they want anything to do with my\u2014it\u2019s me and my boys, we going to high school together and we here to hoop.\u2019 So that was like my initial thoughts and my initial shock to, like, white America when I was 14 years old, for the first time in my life.\u201d (Snipped visible here ).\n\nJames was referring to St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in Akron, Ohio, which he attended between 1999 and 2003 ( here , here ).\n\nAs a teenager, James and his three teammates, Dru Joyce III, Sian Cotton, and Willie McGee, attended the predominantly white St. Vincent-St. Mary, largely because Joyce was unlikely to make the varsity basketball team at Buchtel High, a predominantly Black public school in the area (here). Along with Romeo Travis, the group became known as the \u201cFab Five\u201d as members of the St. Vincent-St. Mary\u2019s team that won the Ohio state championship in 2003 (here).\n\nPartly false.
