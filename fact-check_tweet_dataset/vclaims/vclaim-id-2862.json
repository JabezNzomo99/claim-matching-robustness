It says that when it comes to social mobility in England \u201cThere is no simple north/south divide. Instead, a divide exists between London (and its affluent commuter belt) and the rest of the country\u2014London accounts for nearly two-thirds of all social mobility hotspots.\u201d\n\nA \u201chotspot\u201d is an area with high social mobility, according to the report.\n\nThe best performing council area in England for social mobility was Westminster and the worst performing was West Somerset. In terms of regions, London was by far the best performing and the East Midlands was the worst.\n\nOf the 32 council areas in London, the report classified 29 as \u201chotspots\u201d. It attributes London\u2019s dominance in the social mobility league tables to its economic strength.\n\nThe report also says that some of the worst performing areas of the country for social mobility are in rural areas rather than cities and some are also in \u201crelatively affluent\u201d parts of the country.\n\nScarborough was near the bottom of the list\n\nScarborough\u2014where this week\u2019s Question Time was held\u2014was ranked 295 out of 324 local authorities for social mobility (when ranked from best to worst). The report described it as one of several \u201centrenched social mobility coldspots\u201d and it was in the bottom ten local council areas for \u201cschool social mobility indicators\u201d.\n\nThe government has said it will provide a share of \u00a372 million to \u201cOpportunity Areas\u201d\u201412 regions in England that performed poorly for social mobility in last year\u2019s report from the Commission. One of these areas is the North Yorkshire Coast, including Scarborough.\n\nIn North Yorkshire the government says the \u201cOpportunity Areas\u201d programme will involve improving early years education, supporting literacy and maths in the area and increasing the number of good secondary school places available.\n\nThe report also looks at social mobility in Scotland and Wales, although because of differences between the way the statistics are collected in the three countries they can\u2019t be compared to each other.\n\nIn Scotland social mobility was highest in \u201crural and semi-rural\u201d areas. Former industrial areas Dundee, East Ayrshire and Clackmannanshire had the lowest social mobility.\n\nIn Wales there was no clear north/south divide, nor a clear contrast between city and rural residents.\n\nThe Social Mobility Commission says social mobility is \u201cabout ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to build a good life for themselves regardless of their family background.\u201d So in the report an area with lots of social mobility would mean coming from a disadvantaged background wouldn\u2019t hold a person back from achieving their potential.\n\nThe report looked at disadvantage in England and Wales based on whether or not a person was eligible for free school meals and then looking at various factors like how these people performed at school, whether or not they obtained a degree, and the kind of jobs and wages they went on the get.\n\nThe figures for Scotland focused on all people\u2019s life changes, rather than specifically those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds.", "lang": "en"}
