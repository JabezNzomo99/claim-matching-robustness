It actually shows American soldiers in Kuwait in December 2011.\n\nThe Facebook post, which has been circulating since Oct. 17, claims to show three U.S. soldiers in Syria \u201ccrying and visibly shaken\u201d in reaction to Trump\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cU.S. soldiers on the ground in Syria seen crying and visibly shaken saying they could stop this in 10 minutes but Trump won\u2019t let them!\u201d reads the caption.\n\nTrump announced the withdrawal of U.S. troops from northeastern Syria in early October, ahead of a Turkish military incursion into the area. The withdrawal, some have noted, largely abandoned the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces who were allied with the U.S. in combating the Islamic State.\n\nThrough a reverse image search, the Daily Caller found that the photograph does not, in fact, show soldiers in Syria reacting to the withdrawal of U.S. troops from northeastern Syria. The image, taken by Lucas Jackson for Reuters, actually shows troops at Camp Virginia, Kuwait, in 2011, according to the caption.\n\n\u201cSoldiers from the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division rest while waiting to pack their weapons for shipment back to the United States at Camp Virginia, Kuwait December 19, 2011,\u201d reads the photo caption. \u201cThe 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division was the last U.S. Military unit to depart Iraq and is processing to return to Fort Hood, Texas.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
