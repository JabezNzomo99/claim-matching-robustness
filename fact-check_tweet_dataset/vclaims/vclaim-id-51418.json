So, in effect, the campaign decided to create its own footage by manipulating photographs.\n\nPolitical ad-makers often seize the ugliest, nastiest photos they can find of the opponent. But this takes it to a whole new level. We\u2019re going to keep our focus on these images, not the other (dubious) claims made by the ad.\n\nThe ad displays these words as it shows an image of Biden appearing to be alone, sitting on the floor, though, oddly, he also appears to be talking.\n\n\u201cThe image, which was used without the Gazette\u2019s permission, was taken by Photo Editor Liz Martin in December when Biden was visiting the home of Coralville Mayor John Lundell,\u201d the newspaper reported. \u201cAbout three dozen supporters and journalists were at the event, Martin said, and Biden sat on the floor to give someone else his seat.\u201d\n\nThe ad tightly crops the photo so that many of the participants in the conversation cannot be seen. Then it deletes people who were immediately behind Biden, including a woman in a coat and a cameraman.\n\nThe next still image appears to show a grimacing Biden in an interior setting. But it\u2019s actually a photo of Biden speaking at a nature preserve in Cedar Rapids in September 2019. At one point, he removed the microphone from the stand and started wandering around, taking questions from the audience.\n\nThe ad removes the microphone. It removes the green trees behind Biden. And then it adds a background image of an empty interior space, with a door opening visible in the background. The result is that Biden appears to be alone and troubled.\n\nThe final image in the ad has relatively minor Photoshopping but is out of context. By now, the viewer is primed to believe Biden is in a basement; the photo is dark and he appears to be isolated, as much of the background is fuzzed out.\n\nBut, as can be seen in the original Associated Press photo, Biden is actually praying at the brightly lit Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Del., in June following the killing of George Floyd in police custody.\n\nTwo of these photos fall under the category of \u201cdoctored\u201d in the Fact Checker\u2019s Guide to Manipulated Video. In the most egregious case, one image literally takes Biden from a nature preserve and puts him in a darkened room, even deleting the microphone that would signal he was speaking to people.\n\nWe\u2019ve taken a tough line on manipulated video, and we\u2019re going to be equally tough on the use of these images because the framing of the ad \u2014 Biden alone in his basement \u2014 is largely based on them.\n\nBefore the coronavirus appeared, Biden ran a traditional campaign, holding town halls and meeting with people. The fact that the Trump campaign is forced to take images of events of Biden with people and twist them into him being alone demonstrates how little material they actually have for an attack ad.", "lang": "en"}
