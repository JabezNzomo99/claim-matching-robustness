House Bill 6666\u2026. no bull\u2026. look it up and WAKE UP!!!!\"\n\nThe post also shows an illustrated cross-section of a person\u2019s nasal passage and mouth while he tilts his head back. In the illustration, someone with white gloves inserts a long swab up the person\u2019s nose into the nasal passage. An arrow pointing toward the end of the swab says: \"Implant microchip here.\"\n\n\"If they have to dig this deep to get to \u2018infected\u2019 tissues then it isn\u2019t coming out when you talk to someone closer than 6ft,\" reads text over the image.\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe coronavirus has killed more than 354,000 people worldwide, and more than 100,000 people in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends staying at least 6 feet away from people outside of your home to prevent being exposed to the virus, which is thought to mainly spread from person to person via respiratory droplets that are produced when someone coughs, sneezes or talks.\n\nThis post is wrong to suggest that because COVID-19 testing requires a long nasal swab, infected people can\u2019t produce these droplets that could infect someone else.\n\n\"The swab has to go pretty far back because cells and fluid must be collected from along the entire passageway that connects the base of the nose to the back of the throat to get a really good specimen,\" MD Anderson Cancer Center says in this post about COVID-19 testing.\n\nThere are also other COVID-19 tests that are less invasive, such as a throat swab, the center adds, but it\u2019s not as sensitive as the nasal swab.\n\nWe\u2019ve previously fact-checked several incorrect claims about coronavirus, microchips and Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates and liberal billionaire investor George Soros. We couldn\u2019t find any credible evidence to support the claims being made against the men in this Facebook post.\n\nWe\u2019ve also already debunked a claim that \"the Democrats are pushing for an implanted microchip in humans, and everyone to be vaccinated.\"\n\nThere is a resolution that was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives on May 1 \"to authorize the secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID-19, and related activities such as contact tracing, through mobile health units and, as necessary, at individuals\u2019 residences, and for other purposes.\" But H.R. 6666 doesn\u2019t mention microchips or suggest that people should or will be chipped if they\u2019re tested for COVID-19.\n\nThe resolution isn\u2019t on the \"House floor\" as the Facebook post claims. No action has been taken on the so-called TRACE Act since Rep. Bobby Rush,D.-Ill., introduced it nearly a month ago. Bill Gates also was not involved in crafting the act (and USA Today has more on that in its fact-check).\n\nGates has recommended contact tracing to end the pandemic. But in an April 23 essay, he says that some countries \u2014 China and South Korea among them \u2014 have required coronavirus patients to disclose their whereabouts for the past 14 days using GPS information and spending records.\n\n\"It is unlikely that Western countries will require this,\" Gates writes. \"There are applications you can download that will help you remember where you have been; if you ever test positive, then you can voluntarily review the history or choose to share it with whoever interviews you about your contacts.\"", "lang": "en"}
