{"title": "Does Microsoft Own Patent '666' About Implanting Microchips in People?", "subtitle": "The Redmond, Wash.-based computer company published a patent for a \"cryptocurrency system using body activity data.\"", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2020-04-20T13:22:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-48303", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/microsoft-own-patent-666/", "vclaim": "The number WO2020060606A1 contains three \"6's\" but is obviously not the same as \"666.\" This patent focuses on tracking body activity via wearable technology, such as a smart watch, and makes no mention of implanted microchips.\n\nThe spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease in 2020 sparked a flurry of conspiracy theories concerning where it originated, how it spread, and who was responsible for it. One such theory blamed the disease on Bill Gates and claimed that the former Microsoft CEO had started a pandemic so that he could insert microchips into people around the globe under the guise of providing vaccinations or for other purposes.\n\nThis conspiracy theory is propped up by little more than coincidences and misinterpretations. For instance, in April 2020 social media users started to share a link to a patent supposedly owned by Microsoft that pertained to the micro-chipping of individuals for financial gain.\n\nThis patent was especially insidious, users claimed, because it carried the numbers \u201c666,\u201d the biblical \u201cmark of the beast,\u201d and the letters WO, which they claimed stood for the \u201cWorld Order.\u201d\n\nThe above-displayed screenshots pertain to a genuine patent filed by Microsoft. However, this patent does not involve a plan to microchip individuals, \u201cWO\u201d does not stand for World Order, and one has to ignore the existence of 11 other characters in order to arrive at the conclusion that this patent carries the devil\u2019s number.\n\nThis patent is for a \u201ccryptocurrency system\u201d that \u201cuses body activity data.\u201d Microsoft Technology Licensing applied for this patent in June 2019, and the patent was published a few months later in March 2020 under the number \u201cWO2020060606A1.\u201d\n\nThe patent, which has not been granted as of this writing, makes no mention of microchips.\n\nThe diagrams included in this patent (and shown in the screenshots above) show how the \u201cperson,\u201d \u201cuser device,\u201d and \u201csensor\u201d are all distinct items. The text of the patent further explains that the \u201cuser device\u201d in the diagram may include wearables, such as a smart watch, or cell phones, laptops, or tablets:\n\nThe patent provides two options for the sensor. First, the sensor could be incorporated into one of the aforementioned devices, such as a smartphone. The \u201csensor\u201d may also be its own standalone component:\n\nAt no point in this patent does Microsoft suggest that the sensor would be a microchip implanted into a person\u2019s skin.\n\nSo what about the claim that this is World Order patent 666? As we noted above, this patent was truly published under the number \u201cWO2020060606A1.\u201d It truly contains the number 666 (or, more accurately, 060606). However \u201cpatent WO2020060606A1\u201d is not the same as \u201cpatent 666.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the \u201cWO\u201d at the start of this patent does not stand for \u201cWorld Order.\u201d It is shorthand for WIPO, the World Intellectual Property Organization, which issued this patent. The \u201cA1\u201d at the end of this patent number signifies that this is only a published patent. The \u201ckind code\u201d B1 is applied to granted patents.\n\nWe reached out to Microsoft for more information about this patent and will update this article if we hear back.\n\nTo sum up: Microsoft has applied for a patent that deals with the development of a cryptocurrency system based on tracking body-activity data. However, this patent focuses on wearable technology, such as a smart watch, not implanted microchips, and while patent number \u201cWO2020060606A1\u201d contains three \u201c6\u2019s,\u201d this appears to be little more than a coincidence.", "lang": "en"}
