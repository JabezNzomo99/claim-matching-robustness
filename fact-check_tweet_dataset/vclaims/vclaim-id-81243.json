Bush and statements about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq on this list. Bush has blamed faulty intelligence, though critics have charged the administration with cooking the intelligence in the first place.\n\nThere\u2019s also Lyndon Johnson and the Gulf of Tonkin incident, and Ronald Reagan and Iran-Contra. Are there specific quotes we should highlight, such as \u201cwe did not trade arms for hostages.\u201d In his mea culpa, Reagan said he firmly believed that to be the case when he said it, but conceded it turned out not to be true.\n\nWhat about John F. Kennedy and the Bay of Pigs? In a letter to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, one day after the CIA-backed invasion of Cuba had started, he said, \u201cI have previously stated, and I repeat now, that the United States intends no military intervention in Cuba.\u201d Does lying to a foreign leader count?\n\nJimmy Carter famously said he would never lie to the American people. Did he live up to that pledge? Or should his toast to the Shah of Iran on Jan. 1, 1978 as \u201can island of stability in a turbulent corner of the world\u201d be regarded as a lie or just simply naive? (The toast came after weeks of violent protests in Iran, and Mohammad Reza Shah Palavi was soon forced from power.)\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the case of Dwight Eisenhower and the U-2 incident. When an American U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960, officials assumed the pilot had died and so concocted a false cover story (issued in the State Department\u2019s name) that quickly collapsed after the Soviets revealed the pilot was still alive and had confessed. Eisenhower was forced to admit he had misled the American public.\n\nEisenhower later described it as his \u201cgreatest regret\u201d as president. \u201cThe lie we told [about the U-2]. I didn\u2019t realize how high a price we were going to pay for that lie,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if I had to do it all over again, we would have kept our mouths shut.\u201d\n\nOf course, everyone hates to be caught in a lie. So what do you think? What should be on the list\u2014and how should they rank?\n\nPlease put your ideas in the comment section below or use this form.
