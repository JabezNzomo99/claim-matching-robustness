(Source: On Muslim Holiday, Houston\u2019s Mosques Open to Harvey Evacuees) Not only did the fake news site make up fictitious names but also conjured fake quotes by one 'Aswat Turads', imam of the mosque. Below is an excerpt from the story.\n\n\"The building can easily hold over 500 people, much more than the 27 currently inside. But the imam of the mosque, Aswat Turads, says that they absolutely cannot accept any non-Muslim people because it\u2019s against their religion. \u201cThe Quran is very clear,\u201d Turads told local news radio station WXTX, \u201cwe are forbidden from helping infidels, no matter how much we want to. If we allow Christians and Jews inside, we are violating a fundamental tenant of Islam and will be punished by Allah.\" - Excerpt from fake news story\n\nThe fake story spread like wildfire, accumulating 13,74000 Facebook shares on its website alone.\n\nThe website initially used a picture of Ibrahim Hindy, a Canadian Imam from Toronto. Hindy who spotted his picture in the story took to Twitter to debunk it. Hindy told news outlets he was undertaking the Haj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia when the flooding in Texas took place.

(Source)\n\nSites like Lead Stories and Snopes were quick to debunk the article.\n\nWhat is America's Last Line of Defense?\n\nIt's a serial fake news site that hides behind the garb of being a 'satirical site', a common ploy used by such sites to avoid getting shut down. The site's disclaimer is brazen and says that it 'presents fiction as fact and our sources don\u2019t actually exist.'\n\n\"DISCLAIMER: America\u2019s Last Line of Defense is a satirical publication that may sometimes appear to be telling the truth. We assure you that\u2019s not the case. We present fiction as fact and our sources don\u2019t actually exist. Names that represent actual people and places are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and do not in any way depict reality. In other words, if you believe this crap you\u2019re a real dumbass.\"", "lang": "en"}
