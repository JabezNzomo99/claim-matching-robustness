It\u2019s Gone!'\u201d The story was published on the website BIZ News.\n\nThe story contained a number of sensational and false statements such as, \u201cSocialist politicians in the Democratic Party have tried for years to eliminate Social Security, a source of income relied upon by millions in this country just to get by in their old age.\u201d While the story didn\u2019t actually contain the quote in the headline above, the copy did include an Ebenezer Scrooge-like statement falsely attributed to U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi:\n\n \n\n To be clear, no record exists that Pelosi made this remark or the quoted remark in the BIZ News headline. However, a similar, also-fake quote about Social Security that was attributed to Pelosi circulated in April 2020.\n\nThis item is nothing more than an example of junk news. We therefore rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
