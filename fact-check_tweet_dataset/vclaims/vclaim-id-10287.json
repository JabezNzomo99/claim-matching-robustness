No, that did not happen. The fake story originated on a website that is known for regularily publishing false stories and which is part of a network of such sites.\n\nThe story appeared on the website Global News (glonews360.com) and was titled \"Former FC Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o arrested after girlfriend plunges to her death during balcony sex\" (archived here). It opened:\n\nFormer Cameroonian striker Samuel Eto'o has been arrested on suspicion of 'negligence causing others to die' after a girlfriend fell over a balcony to her death in Lagos, Nigeria. Samuel Eto'o, 37, was arrested at one of the state's top luxury hotels, 'The Wheatbaker Hotel', along Lawrence Rd, Ikoyi, Lagos on Wednesday following the horrific death of Nneka Claudia, 26. She fell to her death after the pair were said to be having 'strange and extravagant sex' on the balcony of a 5th floor of the hotel apartment. She suffered severe head injuries and multiple fractures when she plunged naked to the floor below.\n\nNo other news sources have made any mention of the news and none of the supposed footage of the incident is available anywhere online.\n\nThis is not the first time Eto'o has been victim of fake news. On April Fools' Day a site falsely claimed he was running for president in Cameroon, causing Eto'o to threaten a lawsuit later:\n\nIt remains to be seen if Eto'o will sue this website too.\n\nThe \"arrest photo\" illustrating the story seems to have been taken on the sidelines of a soccer match in 2011:\n\nMore than 15,000 fans defied the torrential rains to be at the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos to say goodbye to Nwankwo Kanu as he called time on an international career that spanned over 17 years. The cheering fans proudly displayed banners in tribute to the 34-year-old icon: \"Kanu is our legend, we will always love you\", \"Who will be like Kanu?\"\n\nThe site appears to be part of a network of fake news websites that all have normal looking front pages with some generic news stories taken from other websites but which frequently publish hoax articles on other parts of the site that aren't immediately obvious to visitors. These stories frequently are death hoaxes about celebrities or other well known people that have been reported as being in the hospital by mainstream news sources.
