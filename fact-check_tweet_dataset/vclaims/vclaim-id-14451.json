To improve national air quality accurate evidence is important to ensure scarce resources are used well. \n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s coal-rich Mpumalanga province is the \u201cworld\u2019s largest air pollution hotspot\u201d, an international environmental group recently\n\nBut Greenpeace then said Mpumalanga only led the world for\n\nemissions, as shown by the group\u2019s \u201cgroundbreaking analysis\u201d of new satellite data. Nitrogen dioxide is produced by combustion, such as in car engines or when coal and gas are burned for energy.\n\nThe watchdog blamed this on heavy coal use by power utility\n\nin the province, and weak air pollution standards.\n\nprompted parliament\u2019s committee on the environment to\n\nBut does the province out-emit everyone else for nitrogen dioxide, including\n\nHow the data was collected\n\n\u2019s senior climate and energy campaign manager, shared with Africa Check the approach the group used to reach its conclusion. She said the information was from a satellite\n\nthe Dutch government and the\n\nand launched in 2017. The data covered 1 June to 31 August 2018.\n\nThe satellite is at a height of 824 kilometres, the team that operates it told Africa Check. Gases in the atmosphere each absorb a specific wavelength of light, so an\n\n\u201cabsorption lines\u201d to determine which gases are present and in what quantity.\n\nAreas with raised concentrations of nitrogen dioxide were identified and the average amount of the gas present over the three-month period worked out. An\n\nwas then used to pinpoint the specific locations and probable sources of emissions.\n\nSaid Greenpeace: \u201cThe unprecedented detailed imagery from the satellite gives us a powerful \u2018eye in the sky\u2019 from which polluters cannot hide.\u201d\n\nOf the 50 largest \u201chotspots\u201d identified, China had 10. There were eight in Arab states, four in the European Union and three each in India, the US and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThat Mpumalanga is a large source of air pollution has been well documented for years, scientists told Africa Check.\n\nIt\u2019s caused by the location of several large power stations on its coalfields, said Prof Harold Annegarn of\n\nThe arrangement of these stations was \u201cunusual anywhere in the world\u201d, Annegarn said. They were laid out in this way partly to reduce transport costs and make them closer to places that use large amounts of power.\n\n\u201cThe consequence is a high concentration of emissions from them, including nitrogen dioxide. Nobody is disputing that.\u201d\n\nIn 2007 the high emissions prompted the government to\n\nto be taken to improve air quality, such as better monitoring and regulation.\n\nHow high up is the pollution?\n\nWhat is new, is the level of detail in satellite images used by Greenpeace, Prof\n\nthe parliamentary committee. She researches air quality and environmental health at the\n\nShe said the method Greenpeace used to analyse the new satellite\u2019s data was not yet without problems, but would be improved with time - helping strengthen estimates of emissions.\n\nAnnegarn said the satellite couldn\u2019t tell at what height the nitrogen dioxide is situated. It only showed that there is a certain amount of the gas in the entire column of the atmosphere.\n\nA significant fault with Greenpeace\u2019s analysis was that \u201cthey jump from the concentration in the aerial density and emissions to say that the high number is equivalent to a high concentration at the ground level\u201d, he told Africa Check.\n\nThe tall stacks on the power stations meant nitrogen dioxide was generally emitted at levels higher than where people breathe. Where the gas goes also depends on the wind and other weather, he said.\n\nTo find out how much pollution is in the air we breathe, other methods such as ground-based and aircraft measurements should be used with satellite measurements, Prof Pieter van Zyl of the\n\nWhat are the outdoor concentrations in the air\n\nThe environmental department told Africa Check it was monitoring outdoor air in real time, with the results\n\n\u201cGround level monitoring of nitrogen dioxide shows that our levels are below the\n\n,\u201d spokesman Albi Modise said. \u201cRemember, this is the air we breathe and not the tropospheric [ up to about\n\nThe standards say that the amount of nitrogen dioxide in the air should not be more than 21 parts per billion, or 21 microgrammes per litre, averaged over a year.\n\nAn Africa Check review of 2018 data from the\n\nshowed this limit had not been exceeded in the year to August.\n\noperates five monitoring stations in the highveld priority area. They\n\naccredited, \u201cthus all instruments are continuously scrutinised on their data accuracy and availability\u201d,\n\nKamaseelan Chetty, the senior manager responsible for air quality at the agency, told Africa Check.\n\nEmissions most visible in winter and on high ground\n\n\u201cIs there a hotspot? Yes, but we cannot make comparisons and declare this is the world\u2019s largest,\u201d Garland said.\n\nThere were a number of reasons for this, she told lawmakers. These included the seasons. Greenpeace\u2019s data spanned South Africa\u2019s winter months. In winter the emissions would be most visible to satellites due to low dispersion. In eastern China, the eastern US and much of Europe, this peak occurs in January.\n\n\u201cThis is comparing our peak almost to one of their lower periods. So it\u2019s not quite fair. We would need more long-term measurements to say that,\u201d Garland said. This would be at least a year\u2019s worth of data, she told Africa Check.\n\nMpumalanga\u2019s highveld was at a higher altitude, also making emissions more visible to the satellite, she said.\n\nAnnegarn added that the 25-kilometre radius Greenpeace used to define a \u201chotspot\u201d was an arbitrary measure and had no \u201cscientific relevance\u201d.\n\nInternational databases mainly capture what is well-known\n\nThere is also an issue of comparability of emissions captured in international databases, Garland said. \u201cSo many times the large point emission sources are well-known and estimated in these emission inventories, but the more local sources are not.\u201d\n\nFor example, vehicle emissions and burning at people\u2019s homes were also major contributors to nitrogen dioxide in Johannesburg, but these were not easily captured in such international databases.\n\nSaid Van Zyl: \u201cAs to whether Mpumalanga \u201cis\n\nworld's biggest pollution hotpot is difficult to quantify based only on satellite retrievals for nitrogen dioxide. Levels of other very important pollutant species such as sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone and particulate matter must also be considered.\u201d\n\nGreenpeace told the committee it would focus on other pollutants later.\n\nDue to limited resources and the long-term nature of the problem, correctly identifying emission sources and their impact is important, Garland said.\n\n\u201cWe really do want to improve air quality and so we really do need to get the correct evidence behind it.\u201d\n\nConclusion Difficult to quantify if Mpumalanga is world\u2019s biggest polluter from the methods used by Greenpeace.\n\nIn a widely-reported statement, the environmental group Greenpeace said South Africa\u2019s Mpumalanga province was the world\u2019s largest \u201cair pollution hotspot\u201d.\n\nIt however said this was only for nitrogen dioxide, basing the conclusion on its \u201cgroundbreaking analysis\u201d of new satellite data.\n\nBut experts said Mpumalanga\u2019s air pollution problem has been known for years. What is new is that more detailed imagery is now available.\n\nA number of problems with Greenpeace\u2019s analysis were cited. These include equating aerial emissions with ground level concentrations, comparing different global peak emission periods and the use of an arbitrary distance to define a hotspot.\n\nOfficial data shows the ground level concentrations stipulated by law for nitrogen dioxide have so far not been exceeded since 2010.\n\nWhile air pollution in Mpumalanga is rightly of national concern, using accurate evidence will help ensure scarce resources are spent in the best way possible to improve air quality.", "lang": "en"}
