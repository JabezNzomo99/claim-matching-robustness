Streep, who supported Hillary Clinton for president, said that \u201cit kind of broke my heart\u201d when she saw \u201cthat moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter.\u201d She did not mention Trump by name.\n\nTrump tweeted that he \u201cnever \u2018mocked\u2019 a disabled reporter\u201d but did show him \u201cgroveling\u201d as he \u201ctotally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad.\u201d\n\nStreep and Trump were both referring to New York Times investigative journalist Serge Kovaleski, a disabled reporter who suffers from arthrogryposis, which primarily restricts joint movement in the limbs.\n\nKovaleski co-authored a story for the Washington Post in 2001 that said \u201ca number of people\u201d in Jersey City, New Jersey, were \u201callegedly seen celebrating\u201d the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. During the Republican primary, Trump cited that story as evidence for his discredited claim that he saw on television \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of people in New Jersey celebrate the terrorist attacks.\n\nTrump made his claim about the celebrations during a speech in Alabama on Nov. 21, 2015. Two days later, Trump tweeted a link to Kovaleski\u2019s Post article from Sept. 18, 2001, and demanded an apology from those who wrote that his statement was false.\n\nBut as we have written, the Post never reported that there were \u201cthousands\u201d of people in New Jersey \u201ccelebrating\u201d the attacks, as Trump originally claimed. The story, written by Kovaleski and Fredrick Kunkle, said that \u201cIn Jersey City \u2026 law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river.\u201d\n\nIn interviews after Trump made his claim, Kovaleski and Kunkle both said that they couldn\u2019t recall if the allegations about the tailgate-style celebration were ever substantiated.\n\nIn a CNN story published Nov. 24, 2015, Kovaleski was quoted saying that he and Kunkle \u201cdid a lot of shoe leather reporting in and around Jersey City and talked to a lot of residents and officials. \u2026 But I do not recall anyone saying there were thousands, or even hundreds, of people celebrating.\u201d\n\nAnd in an update to its story from Nov. 22, 2015, the Washington Post Fact Checker quoted Kunkle saying that he could never confirm the reports of celebrations.\n\n\u201cI specifically visited the Jersey City building and neighborhood where the celebrations were purported to have happened. But I could never verify that report,\u201d Kunkle told the Post.\n\nThen, during a campaign rally in South Carolina on Nov. 24, 2015, Trump, while making a jerking motion with his arms, paraphrased Kovaleski as saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I said. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d\n\nMany, including Streep, saw that as Trump imitating Kovaleski\u2019s disability, which Trump has denied he was doing.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what Trump\u2019s intentions were, and readers can judge the video of Trump\u2019s remarks for themselves. But we can say that Trump is wrong to claim that Kovaleski \u201ctotally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
