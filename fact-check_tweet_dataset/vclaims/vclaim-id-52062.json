(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe meme first started circulating more than a year ago after Pelosi responded to President Donald Trump\u2019s threat to shut down the government if funding wasn\u2019t secured for the border wall between the United States and Mexico.\n\n\"The obstructionist Democrats would like us not to do it, but believe me, if we have to close down our government, we're building that wall,\" Trump said at a rally in August 2017.\n\n\"President Trump\u2019s multi-billion dollar border wall boondoggle is strongly opposed by Democrats and many Republicans,\" Pelosi\u2019s statement read. \"Democrats will stand fast against the immoral, ineffective border wall and the rest of Republicans\u2019 unacceptable poison pill riders.\"\n\nAfter Pelosi\u2019s statement, a meme began circulating with an image of Pelosi and text that said \"Building a wall will violate the rights of millions of illegals. It\u2019s not just our country, it\u2019s their country, too!\"\n\nThe text of that meme was copied to other memes that attributed it as a direct quote from Pelosi.\n\nWe have not found any credible news sources that quote Pelosi in this way, and none of the memes give an idea of where or when she would have made this statement.\n\nThe meme has popped up a few other times on social media. In January 2018, for example, the government was facing a shutdown, partially because of disputed funding for the border wall. Pelosi posted a thread on Twitter, speaking again in opposition of the wall. The meme started circulating again.\n\nThere\u2019s no credible source that Pelosi said building the border wall would \"violate the rights of millions of illegals.\" The meme started as a rough paraphrase and transitioned to an incorrect direct quote.
