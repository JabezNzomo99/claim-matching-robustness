Germany is our biggest export market in the EU, though.\n\nIn 2016 we exported around \u00a3100 billion worth of goods and services to the USA (18% of our total exports) and \u00a349 billion to Germany (9% of our total exports).\n\nHowever our trade deficit with Germany, that\u2019s the gap between the amount we export and the amount we import, is higher than with any other country. In 2016 we imported about \u00a326 billion more from Germany than we exported to it. That was closely followed by China, we imported about \u00a325 billion more from than we exported to it.\n\nWe exported around \u00a333 billion more from the USA than we imported from it in 2016. The USA is also Germany\u2019s largest export market. Around \u20ac111 billion was exported there in 2017\u20149% of its total exports. That was followed closely by France at \u20ac105 billion. China is Germany\u2019s third largest export market with \u20ac86 billion exported there in 2017.\n\nChina is Germany\u2019s biggest importer, at \u20ac101 billion in 2017.", "lang": "en"}
