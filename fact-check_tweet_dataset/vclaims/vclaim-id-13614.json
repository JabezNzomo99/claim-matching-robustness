Many have shared (1, 2, 3) the home page of BBC along with the prediction of the election results. The alleged poll, which forecasted 160+ seats for the Congress and 30 seats for the BJP in June, predicts a win for the BJP with 135 seats forecasted on November 28, 2018.\n\nThe similar post (with numbers changed after October 2018) has also been shared by Twitter user Rishi Bagree, drawing over 6,000 likes and more than 2,000 retweets. However, Bagree did not attribute the pre-election survey to BBC.\n\nTwitter and Facebook alike, individual users have widely circulated the purported poll that forecasts a win for the BJP against the Congress in the December Rajasthan elections.\n\nThe identical text across multiple Facebook accounts hints that the alleged survey is viral on WhatsApp as well.\n\nAlt News spoke to a BBC spokesperson who informed that no such opinion poll has been published by the news organisation. Moreover, BBC does not commission pre-election surveys in India.\n\n\u201cThis fake survey on the Rajasthan polls has been circulating on WhatsApp and social media, with some messages claiming it to be from BBC News. We\u2019d like to make absolutely clear that it is fake and does not come from the BBC. The BBC does not commission pre-election surveys in India,\u201d said the spokesperson.\n\nIn so far as the exit polls are concerned, three opinion surveys have been conducted with regard to the Rajasthan Assembly Elections \u2013 ABP News-CVoter, C fore and Times Now in association with CNX \u2013 and all of them predict a win for the Congress.\n\nFake news often piggybacks on credible media outlets to give misinformation an appearance of genuineness. In May 2018, before the commencement of Karnataka Assembly elections, another purported opinion poll \u2018Janta Ki Baat\u2019 was viral as a BBC survey. However, Alt News had found that the poll was fake and attempted to imitate \u2018Jan Ki Baat\u2019 survey. An imposter BBC website was also viral in September this year, propagating a \u2018list\u2019 of the world\u2019s most corrupt political parties, placing the Congress second. The same website also propagated a \u2018list\u2019 of most corrupt leaders, placing Narendra Modi at seventh. The Indian Prime Minister was also declared the second most corrupt leader in the world by an imposter Fox News website.", "lang": "en"}
