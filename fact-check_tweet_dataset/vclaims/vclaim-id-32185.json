No, that's not true: it is fake news being spread over social media, and the avowed Democratic socialist has only said he wants a 52 percent tax on income over $10 million.\n\nThe false information began spreading on social media shortly after the February 19, 2020, debate among the Democratic presidential hopefuls. Facebook posts, including this one (archived here), began popping up. It opened:\n\nBernie Sanders said at the debate last night that he wants minimum wage to be $15 per hour. Bernie Sanders wants free health care for all and was asked how he would pay for it. His answer was raise taxes to 52% on anybody making over $29,000 per year. 52% of $31,200 = $16,224 in tax\n\n$31,200 - $16,224 = $14,976 is your pay\n\n$14,967 \u00f7 52 weeks = $288 per week\n\n$288 \u00f7 40 hr week = $7.20 per hour So much for 15$ an hour minimum wage\n\nThink before you vote people.\n\nUsers on Facebook saw posts like this in their feed:\n\nThis is wrong. Sanders made no such remark during the debate. For a full transcript of the debate, go here. Also, this math does not consider the standard deduction before workers would pay on differing levels of income. Under Sanders' plan on how to pay for \"Medicare for all\", he recommends reforming the personal income tax system by increasing the progressive income tax on wealthy Americans. His plan, found here, includes:\n\n- 40 percent on income between $250,000 and $500,000\n\n- 45 percent on income between $500,000 and $2 million\n\n- 50 percent on income between $2 million and $10 million\n\n- 52 percent on income above $10 million.\n\nSanders claims middle-class families would save money under his plan due to a 4 percent income-based premium paid by households:\n\nSanders' plan is the most ambitious of any Democratic presidential candidate in transforming the nation's healthcare system. It has come under scrutiny, and he has received much flak for his lack of detail on how much the plan would cost American taxpayers. A good deal of this criticism was thrown at him, including from Pete Buttigieg, during Wednesday's debate.\n\nBut this Facebook post, for example, includes false quotes and wrongly interprets Sanders' plan.", "lang": "en"}
