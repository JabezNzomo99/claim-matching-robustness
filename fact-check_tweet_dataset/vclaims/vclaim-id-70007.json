Iraq has been a designated combat zone via Executive Order No. 12744 since January 1991.\n\nHowever, she is not the first First Lady to visit a combat zone, as defined by federal regulations, since 1969. At least two other former first ladies \u2013 Michelle Obama and Barbara Bush \u2013 have done so, as well.\n\nIn November 2015, Obama visited al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which has been designated a combat zone since 1991, according to the Department of Defense website. She showed her support for troops at the base while visiting Qatar and Jordan to promote education for adolescent girls, The New York Times reported.\n\nBush visited U.S. service members in Afghanistan in 2005 and 2008. The country was designated as a combat zone starting September 2001, according to the IRS website.

She accompanied then-President Richard Nixon there in 1969, according to the Richard Nixon Foundation.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Tuzla Air Base in Bosnia in 1996 as first lady, though it does not appear to have been officially designated a combat zone at that time.\n\n\u201cOnly the Persian Gulf region remains as a designated combat zone,\u201d reads a June 1996 Department of Defense article. \u201cU.S. forces serving in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and Croatia as part of Operation Joint Endeavor currently receive tax and monetary benefits \u2018as if\u2019 they were in a combat zone.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
