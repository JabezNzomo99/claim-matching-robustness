In the first excerpt, a sentence is highlighted saying, \u201cIn around 2020 a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe.\u201d The excerpt also says the illness will vanish, reappear in 2030, and then \u201cdisappear completely\u201d.\n\nThe second excerpt features dialogue from Koontz\u2019s novel. In it, two characters discuss a biological weapon called \u2018Wuhan-400.\u2019 Called the \u201cperfect weapon,\u201d it afflicts only human beings and no other living creature can carry the microorganism.\n\nThe Facebook post has been viewed more than 490,000 times and shared nearly 5000 times.\n\nThe coronavirus Covid-19 outbreak began in Wuhan, China in late December 2019, and has since spread to 58 countries. Nearly 3000 people have died and more than 87,000 have been infected as of March 1, 2020, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe Facebook post claims that Dean Koontz\u2018s book The Eyes of Darkness predicted the coronavirus Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan, however the book\u2019s first edition was published in 1981 and referred to an outbreak in Russia of a virus called \u201cGorki-400.\u201d\n\nIn the 1981 publication of The Eyes of Darkness, published under the pseudonym Leigh Nichols, the story was that the virus was developed in laboratories outside a Russian city named \u201cGorki\u201d.\n\nWhen The Eyes of Darkness was re-released under Koontz\u2019s own name in 1989, the Cold War between the Soviet Union (now Russia) and the United States was nearing the end after the former began an era of \u201cglasnost\u201d or increased openness. A revision of The Eyes of Darkness changed the virus name to \u2018Wuhan-400\u2019 and its origin to China. Wuhan, an industrial centre for most of China\u2019s history, is also home to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\nThe fact checking website Snopes described the mention of \u2018Wuhan-400\u2019 in Koontz\u2019s book as \u201cnothing more than a coincidence\u201d. Apocalyptic viruses are often used in fiction writing such as Stephen King\u2019s book The Stand.\n\nThe post\u2019s first excerpt that mentions an outbreak of a pneumonia-like illness in 2020 comes from a book by the late self-proclaimed psychic Sylvia Browne, End Of Days: Predictions and Prophecies About The End of the World.\n\nBrowne was a frequent guest on TV talk shows and wrote more than 40 books before her death in 2013. The Skeptical Inquirer published an article examining Browne\u2019s predictions and found that of 115 cases examined, her confirmable accuracy rate was 0 per cent. She also was convicted of fraud in 1992.\n\nThe \u2018Wuhan-400\u2019 virus in Koontz\u2019s novel is a biological weapon created in a laboratory, however the World Health Organization said the Covid-19 virus was most likely developed in wild animals, likely to be bats.\n\nAAP FactCheck has previously examined claims that the Covid-19 virus originated in a laboratory and found no evidence.\n\nKoontz has made no comment about The Eyes of Darkness social media posts and AAP FactCheck sought for comment from Koontz\u2019s publishers, Penguin Random House NZ, but received no reply at the time of publication.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP Factcheck finds the original viral post\u2019s claim to be false. The post is a conflation of two separate books \u2013 one a fictional novel, one a book by a controversial psychic. While both deal with the idea of a virus epidemic, there are many differences between the texts and the reality of Covid-19 to date. The claim that Dean Koontz\u2019s novel explicitly predicted the coronavirus Covid-19 outbreak that began in late 2019 is false. False \u2013 The primary claims of the content are factually inaccurate. AAP FactCheck is an accredited member of the International Fact-Checking Network.
