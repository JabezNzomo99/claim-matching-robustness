When you get your student finance, it works not like a loan but like a graduate contribution system... It does not go on your credit file. It is effectively like mildly increasing the amount of tax that you pay, just like increasing pension contributions also decreases your disposable income. It is not a big issue for getting a mortgage.\u201d\n\nThe personal finance journalist Martin Lewis appearing on BBC Question Time criticised politicians for framing student loans as a debt when they don\u2019t actually work like debts. He has a point.\n\nThe student finance system is devolved and is one area where different parts of the UK differ dramatically. For example, this argument happened in St Alban\u2019s in England, where students are responsible for their own tuition fees and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at here. People who live in Scotland and study in Scotland aren\u2019t usually required to pay tuition fees.\n\nAs Mr Lewis said, student loan repayments don\u2019t work in the same way as what we usually call a debt. The government\u2019s own website makes clear that \u201cthe size of your monthly repayments will depend on how much you earn, not what you owe.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why the MoneySavingExpert website is right to say that the headline figure for what students might \u2018owe\u2019 at the end of university is \u201cmostly meaningless\u201d. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that \u201cmore than three-quarters of students can expect to have some debt written off\u201d because the repayments due with the amount they earn won\u2019t fully repay the \u2018debt\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that student loans do not go on your credit file. The Student Loans Company confirmed to us that: \u201cA student loan will not affect an individual\u2019s credit rating as long as they meet their contractual obligations.\u201d\n\nThe obligation to pay a bit of your income (once it reaches a certain level) in order to repay student costs does reduce your disposable income. So a lender might ask if you have student loan repayments because they reduce the amount of income you have free to repay other debts.\n\nWhich? have calculated having to make student loan repayments might reduce the amount a lender might offer you for a mortgage by about \u00a33,000-4,000 if you earn \u00a330,000\u2014when somebody might be able to borrow about \u00a390,000-\u00a3130,000 overall.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be right to describe the student finance system as exactly like a graduate tax either. There are some points of the student finance system which are more like loans than taxes or a \u2018graduate contribution\u2019. Nobody forces you to take a student loan if you\u2019re rich enough not to need one, and if you\u2019re earning enough to make enough repayments you eventually won\u2019t have to pay any more.", "lang": "en"}
