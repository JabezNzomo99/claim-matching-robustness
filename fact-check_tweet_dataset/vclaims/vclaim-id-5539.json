But officials release fresh water from reservoirs primarily to prevent salt water from contaminating agricultural and urban water supplies.\n\nOn May 27, Trump met with farmers for a private half-hour meeting before his rally in Fresno, as reported by the Los Angeles Times. During his speech, Trump references this meeting, stating, \u201cI just left 50 or 60 farmers in the back and they can\u2019t get water. And I say, \u2018How tough is it? How bad is the drought?\u2019 \u2018There is no drought. They turn the water out into the ocean.\u2019\u201d Earlier in this speech, he made similar claims:\n\nTrump also told his audience in Fresno that if he wins the election, \u201cBelieve me, we\u2019re going to start opening up the water, so that you can have your farmers survive.\u201d He added, \u201cWe\u2019re going to get it done quick. Don\u2019t even think about it. That\u2019s an easy one.\u201d\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Trump is right that some farmers believe the preservation of fish species has caused the state\u2019s water issues. In June 2015, the newspaper reported that, \u201cFarmers in the Central Valley call it a \u2018man-made drought,\u2019 complaining that water needed for crops is going to fish instead.\u201d Carly Fiorina, previously Hewlett-Packard\u2019s CEO and a GOP candidate, also made similar claims when she was considering running for president last year.\n\nBut California\u2019s water issues can\u2019t be reduced to the preservation of a threatened fish species. Experts told us water management practices, the state\u2019s natural climate and global warming have all contributed to the state\u2019s current drought and water issues.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s current drought began in late 2011. By Jan. 17, 2014, Gov. Jerry Brown declared the drought a state of emergency.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s current drought has meteorological, hydrologic and agricultural elements. The U.S. Geological Survey calls the dry conditions that often develop after below average amounts of precipitation a \u201cmeteorological drought.\u201d These conditions can then cause a \u201chydrologic drought,\u201d where the flows and levels of streams, rivers, lakes and reservoirs decline. Drought also affects farmers by reducing soil moisture, hindering crop growth, which the USGS calls an \u201cagricultural drought.\u201d\n\nMost of California\u2019s precipitation falls between October and April. As a result, the state\u2019s ecosystems are accustomed to seasonal drought outside of those months. Droughts lasting multiple years are also a regular characteristic of California\u2019s climate.\n\nHowever, California\u2019s current drought is \u201cunique\u201d when compared with past years, write Jeffery Mount and others at the Public Policy Institute of California in an August 2015 report called, \u201cWhat If California\u2019s Drought Continues?\u201d\n\n\u201cTaken together, the past four years have been the driest since record keeping began in the late 1800s,\u201d write Mount, a watershed scientist, and colleagues. In other words, the state has experienced the low levels of precipitation characteristic of a meteorological drought.\n\nBut the current drought is especially different because 2015 and 2014 were also the two warmest years on record in the state (and it\u2019s likely globally as well). Scientists call the combination of dry and hot conditions a \u201chot\u201d drought.\n\nRecord heat contributed to California\u2019s current meteorological drought, in part, by reducing snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains. During the dry season (May to September), this snowpack melts and provides about one-third of the state\u2019s farms and cities with fresh water.\n\nOn April 1, 2015, California\u2019s Department of Water Resources estimated the snowpack of the Sierras to be at 5 percent of the average for that time of year \u2013 lower than any year in records since 1950. And this is a period when snowpack is supposed to be at its peak.\n\nIn addition to receiving less precipitation during winter, warmer temperatures caused what snow had accumulated \u201cto melt faster and earlier, making it more difficult to store and use,\u201d according to California\u2019s water resources department.\n\nWhile El Ni\u00f1o did bring more precipitation during the following winter (2015 to 2016), and thus more snowpack, it wasn\u2019t enough to end the drought. El Ni\u00f1o changes global atmospheric circulation such that some regions receive more rainfall and others less.\n\nWith less precipitation and less water from snowpack, the flow and level of ground and surface water reservoirs also declined in the state, leading to a hydrologic drought.\n\nAnd with less water in reservoirs, there\u2019s less water for urban and agricultural use. Not to mention that record heat in California also dried up soils and stressed crops, which, in turn, led to a greater need for irrigation (i.e. an agricultural drought).\n\nMount and his colleagues call California\u2019s current drought a \u201cdrought of the future\u201d because the state is more likely to experience such conditions as the region\u2019s climate warms in the coming decades.\n\n\u201cThe drought revealed our weaknesses in how we manage water for all sectors,\u201d Mount told us in an email. \u201cIt gave us an unwelcome \u2026 glimpse into the future as conditions warm in California and competition for water becomes more intense.\u201d\n\nIn short, California\u2019s drought is very real and the state does not have \u201cplenty of water,\u201d as Trump suggested. California\u2019s water issues go far beyond preserving a \u201cthree-inch fish,\u201d as we\u2019ll explain in the next section.\n\nWater management practices, along with the drought, have contributed to difficulties for farmers in parts of California.\n\nTo start, not only does California receive the majority of its precipitation between October and April, but it also primarily rains and snows in the northern parts of the state.\n\nThis creates a water management \u201cproblem\u201d because most of the demand is from farms in the San Joaquin Valley and coastal urban areas, such as Los Angeles, Peter Moyle, a fish biologist and associate director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California, Davis, told us in an email.\n\nThe San Joaquin Valley makes up the southern two-thirds of California\u2019s Central Valley. The northern one-third is known as the Sacramento Valley. The San Joaquin Valley is divided into the San Joaquin Basin and the Tulare Basin. Fresno, where Trump gave his speech, lies in the Tulare Basin, the southernmost section of the Central Valley.\n\n\u201cMassive water projects \u2026 have turned essentially desert areas into places where people can live and farm,\u201d Moyle told us.\n\nAs the New York Times reported, these projects include giant pumps that transport water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to the Central Valley and to cities in southern California, such as Los Angeles. The water flowing into the Delta originally comes from farther north, including from the Sierra Nevada mountains.\n\nHowever, \u201cDuring long droughts there is a natural tendency to keep in the north the water that has been produced there, assisted by very old and sacred water rights,\u201d Moyle told us. \u201cMany farmers in the south not only have a very limited indigenous supply of water, but they have very junior water rights to use both local rivers and imported water.\u201d\n\nThis creates competition for water between northern and southern farmers, but also exacerbates issues between Central Valley farmers and environmentalists, Moyle said.\n\nWith less water in general due to drought and fewer rights to the water that is available, Central Valley farmers argue the current drought is man-made because water is being \u201cwasted to the ocean\u201d to preserve fish species, Moyle added.\n\nSo how is available water actually distributed in California? Back in July 2014, Mount and colleagues at the Public Policy Institute of California broke down water use in the state into three sectors: 50 percent environmental, 40 percent agricultural and 10 percent urban.\n\nBut \u201cenvironmental\u201d water usage is only partly used for preserving fish species, such as the delta smelt and Chinook salmon.\n\nFor one, \u201cMore than half of California\u2019s environmental water use occurs in rivers along the state\u2019s north coast,\u201d write Mount and colleagues. Farmers in the Central Valley and elsewhere can\u2019t access most of this water because it\u2019s largely isolated from the state\u2019s water management infrastructure (i.e., the Delta pumps).\n\nMany of the rivers of northern California are designated as wild and scenic, which means they can\u2019t be dammed without an act of Congress. In a blog post, Mount writes, \u201cMost of the volume that flows down Wild and Scenic Rivers is in the North Coast and includes flood flows, where there is no practical way to recover it for either agricultural or urban use.\u201d\n\nIn areas where water is shared by all three sectors, agricultural use dominates at 53 percent, compared to 33 percent environmental use and 14 percent urban use, according to Mount and his colleagues.\n\nEven still, some environmental water use benefits farmers, as it\u2019s needed to maintain water quality for agricultural and urban use.\n\nHow so? As previously mentioned, the current drought has reduced surface water levels and flows, which left the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta more susceptible to salt water intrusion from the ocean. And when salt water infiltrates fresh water supplies, it can\u2019t be used for urban and agricultural purposes.\n\nTo solve this problem, officials release water from reservoirs to prevent salt water from contaminating fresh water in the Delta.\n\nReservoir water also needs to be released because the state\u2019s water infrastructure itself, which directs water north to south, disrupts the Delta\u2019s natural ability to flush salt water out to sea (an east to west flow), Mount told us.\n\nBut these releases also help keep the Delta\u2019s water fresh for threatened species, such as the delta smelt. The state is mandated by law to protect this fish, the Chinook salmon and other species under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nDuring his rally, Trump was most likely speaking about the delta smelt when he referred to a \u201ccertain kind of three-inch fish.\u201d We reached out to Trump\u2019s campaign for clarification, but have yet to hear back.\n\nThe Chinook salmon \u201chas equal or greater impact on water supplies\u201d compared to the delta smelt, Mount also told us. \u201cThe reason is that salmon do not just need flow, but they need cold water.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s water infrastructure, which includes dams in addition to pumps, has \u201ccut off more than 85% of the historic spawning habitat for salmon,\u201d primarily in the Central Valley, added Mount.\n\nTo make up for the loss of spawning habitat, \u201cwe have to reserve cold water, which collects at the bottom of reservoirs, to release for salmon, particularly winter- and spring-run Chinook which are teetering on the brink of extinction,\u201d said Mount. \u201cThis causes a delay in the release of water until late in the irrigation season, which directly impacts supplies to farms.\u201d\n\nHowever, Mount and colleagues estimated that in 2014, 71 percent of \u201cocean outflow,\u201d or released fresh water from reservoirs, was needed for urban and farm water salinity control, while 18 percent was required to preserve fish habitat.\n\nSo despite what the Fresno farmers may have told Trump, California\u2019s water issues go far beyond protecting \u201ca certain kind of three-inch fish.\u201d\n\nFirst, delta smelt are not the only fish that require preservation. Chinook salmon and other species also benefit from the release of fresh water from reservoirs. Second, most of the water that is being flushed out to sea is needed to prevent salt water from infiltrating agricultural and urban water supplies. And lastly, the infrastructure that was developed to deliver water to farmers in the Central Valley has itself disrupted the Delta\u2019s natural ability to flush salt water out to sea, contributing to the need to release fresh water from reservoirs.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s unlikely the solution to California\u2019s water wars will be \u201cquick\u201d and \u201ceasy,\u201d as Trump said. \u201cWater management issues are never black and white,\u201d Mount told us.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: SciCheck is made possible by a grant from the Stanton Foundation.\n\nClarification, June 9: We changed Peter Moyle\u2019s title from \u201cwildlife ecologist\u201d to \u201cfish biologist\u201d at the request of UC Davis.", "lang": "en"}
