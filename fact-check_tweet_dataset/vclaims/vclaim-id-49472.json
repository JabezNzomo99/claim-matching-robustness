Twitter user '@AlexJoestar622' shared it on the microblogging platform on June 24. \"Remember when I told y'all about the Philippines having human-sized bats? Yeah, this was what I was talking about,\" reads the caption of the post.\n\nHuman-sized bats have been spotted in the Philippines. The claim is false. An animal of that stature actually exists but the impression of it being given by the photo is not correct. While the exact species of the creature is unclear the general consensus is that the picture shows a giant golden-crowned flying fox or the golden-capped fruit bat, this species of megabat is endemic to the Philippines. However, the creature seen in the viral image doesn't appear to have the golden fur around its head. According to a report on Snopes, the image could also show another species of megabat, called fruit bats or old world fruit bats, such as the Large flying fox (Pteropus vampyrus). The photo was shared on Reddit sometime back.\n\nThe perspective in the viral shot makes the bat much far larger than it actually is. Flying foxes have wingspans of 1.7 metres (5.5 ft), their bodies are quite small, barely extending 30 centimetres in length (11.8 inches).\n\n\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343 Also Read: Fact Check: Can Consumption Of Foods With Higher pH Prevent COVID-19?", "lang": "en"}
