There was not a uniformed police officer allowed on the convention floor. I was told that by four high ranking Philadelphia police officers, two of whom I\u2019ve known for a very long time. Then I walked the floor two nights and couldn\u2019t find a single uniformed police officer. Go look at your footage. Find me a uniform. Hillary Clinton did not want uniformed police officers on the convention floor.\n\nWhile Giuliani claimed that he had been told by four high-ranking police officers (supposedly outside the arena) that uniformed law enforcement officials were not allowed inside on the convention floor, he appears to be the only person making this accusation \u2014 which made a great pull quote:\n\nOther web sites quickly picked up the story to spread Giuliani\u2019s comments, but no additional evidence has appeared to confirm his claim.\n\nWe reached out to the Philadelphia Police Department to find out if Clinton\u2019s team had informed them that they were not allowed on the convention floor, and were told that both uniformed and plainclothes officers were stationed throughout the convention:\n\nGood evening Mr. Evon, Philadelphia Police have worked in conjunction with the Secret Service throughout this event which includes the interior portion of the venue, as well as the exterior portion. Officers in uniform and plain clothes have been assigned to all areas inside of the venue, which includes the various floors, levels, and interior portions.\n\nNot only were uniformed police officers allowed at the Democratic National Convention, but Pittsburgh Chief of Police Cameron McLay spoke on Day 2 of the event:", "lang": "en"}
