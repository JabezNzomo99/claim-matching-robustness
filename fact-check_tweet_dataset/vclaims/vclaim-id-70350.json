However, the most widely accepted number comes from the Pew Hispanic Center, which estimated that there were 11.2 million illegal immigrants in the United States in 2010.\n\nSo it\u2019s mathematically impossible for more than 43 percent of all food stamps to be given to illegals -- there simply aren\u2019t enough undocumented immigrants in the country to make the math work. Nor does the math work if you choose a month before the number of food stamp recipients rose due to the recession. In October 2008, there were 30.8 million recipients; 43 percent of that number is 13.2 million, which exceeded the total number of illegal immigrants at the time, 11.6 million.\n\nNone of this even takes into account an even more basic reality: It is against the law for Illegal immigrants to receive food stamps and the government has a process to verify immigration status. Citizen children of illegal immigrants can qualify (there are 3.5 million, according to Pew) but that's not enough to make the math work.\n\nIs it possible some illegal immigrants receive food stamps anyway? Sure. But even if every single one somehow managed to fool the government, it still wouldn't be enough to account for the 43 percent.\n\nThe first of the Facebook post\u2019s 10 claims -- that \"more than 43 percent of all food stamps are given to illegals\" -- is ridiculously false. It isn\u2019t mathematically possible given the number of illegal immigrants in the United States, and it ignores the fact that illegal immigrants can\u2019t even receive food stamps legally.
