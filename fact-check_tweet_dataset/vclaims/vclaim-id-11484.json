It has increased by \u00a36,025. The basic rate of income tax is set at 20% so the amount of tax \u2018saved\u2019 by the taxpayer would be \u00a31,205.\n\nBut this figure doesn\u2019t account for the fact that prices have risen over the last ten years, meaning you can buy less with the same sum of money today than a decade ago\u2014an effect known as inflation. Factoring that in, the amount kept by the taxpayer is the equivalent of about \u00a3940.\n\nBut for some families, these savings could be cancelled out by changes to other taxes. For example the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that when looking at the changes all taxes and benefits as a whole, rather than just income tax, there had been \u201csignificant reductions in household income\u201d for low-income households between 2010 and 2015.\n\nWhere does \u00a31,205 come from?\n\nFor most people there is a set amount of money that you can earn without having to pay any income tax\u2014known as the personal allowance. Some very high earners don\u2019t receive a personal allowance, or have it reduced.\n\nAt the moment the personal allowance is \u00a311,850 and at the Budget last week the Chancellor announced that from next April the personal allowance will increase to \u00a312,500 and keep increasing until it\u2019s around \u00a313,310 in 2023/24. There are some exceptions to this\u2014for example, you can have a different personal allowance if you\u2019re married and over a certain age. The government says that from 2021/22 onwards the increases are based on forecasted inflation (the change in how much things cost over time), and therefore might change.\n\nThe \u00a31,205 mentioned in the tweet is based on the difference between the amount of income you could get tax free in 2010/11 and next year in 2019/20. In 2010/11 the typical person\u2019s personal allowance was \u00a36,475. So the personal allowance will have increased by \u00a36,025 by 2019/20.\n\nThat means \u00a36,025 of additional income on which no tax is paid in 2019/20. The income tax rate that would have been applied on that income (known as the \u201cbasic rate\u201d) is 20%, which works out at \u00a31,205. This is what the government claims it has saved the typical basic rate taxpayer.\n\nBut these figures don\u2019t account for inflation\n\nPrices have changed since 2010 and it now costs more to buy things, an effect known as inflation, so we need to factor that in too. What matters is how much you can buy with that \u00a31,205, and as inflation goes up, this will go down.\n\nOnce you account for the way prices have changed over the last ten years, the difference between the personal allowance in 2010/11 and 2019/20 reduces to \u00a34,710 in 2019/20 prices. So the amount saved by the taxpayer also changes to around \u00a3940.\n\nAnd income tax isn\u2019t the only tax that might matter to you\n\nOf course this won\u2019t necessarily be the experience of every taxpayer and it doesn\u2019t factor in any other changes that have been made to the tax system over that time. Those paying less due to income tax changes might not be taking home more money overall than they were in 2010/11.\n\nIn 2017 the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that when including changes to other taxes and benefits such as VAT and child tax credits, changes have led to \u201csignificant reductions in household income\u201d for low-income households between 2010 and 2015.", "lang": "en"}
