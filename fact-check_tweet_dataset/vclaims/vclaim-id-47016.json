The claim is misleading and has been branded by the government as \u201cfake news\u201d; on June 15, authorities announced Metro Manila and Laguna would remain under its current, loosened lockdown restrictions until at least the end of June.\n\nThe claim, published in this Facebook post on June 13, shows a purported list of regions in the Philippines, their corresponding COVID-19 risk levels and designated lockdown measures.\n\nAccording to the post, areas in the Philippines are divided into categories of low, moderate and high COVID-19 risks. Under the Philippine government\u2019s guidelines, areas with moderate risk are subjected to general community quarantine (GCQ) and those with high risk are under enhanced community quarantine (ECQ), which comes with more movement restrictions.\n\nThe claim alleges that IATF, the country\u2019s Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Disease, has put three areas back under ECQ following lockdown easing in mid-May.\n\nThose areas include the NCR, the National Capital Region commonly known as Metro Manila; Cebu, a city on the island of Cebu; and Laguna, a province southeast of the capital Manila.\n\nIdentical claims were also shared on Facebook here, here, here and here.\n\nHowever, the claims are misleading.\n\nOn June 15, the government announced here that while Cebu would revert to ECQ, Metro Manila and Laguna would remain at GCQ until at least the end of June.\n\nThe Philippine government also published an image of the misleading claim here on its COVID-19 website with a superimposed stamp that states: \u201cFAKE NEWS\u201d.\n\nThe government added that the latest IATF resolution is numbered 45, not the \u201cjust approved\u201d no. 35 as the misleading claim states.\n\nA copy of IATF's resolution no. 35, issued on May 11, 2020, can be viewed here.\n\nWhile the document presented similar categorisation for various Philippine regions, it placed Metro Manila, Laguna and Cebu under \u201cmodified ECQ\u201d, a slightly more relaxed version of ECQ, until at least the end of May.", "lang": "en"}
