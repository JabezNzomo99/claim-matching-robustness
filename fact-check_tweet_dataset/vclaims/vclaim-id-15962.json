It was claimed that the visuals of gun-toting men were from Purulia district in West Bengal. Some of the outlets even went a step further by alleging that the men were, \u201cTMC workers\u201d. In the video, people can be heard speaking in Hindi and Bengali. \u201c\u0930\u0918\u0941\u0928\u093e\u0925\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u091c\u093e \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0939\u0948 \u0935\u094b\u091f \u0915\u0930\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f\u0964 \u0915\u093f\u0938\u0915\u0940 \u0913\u0930 \u0938\u0947 \u092f\u0947 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u092c\u094b\u0932\u0947\u0964 \u0939\u092e \u0932\u094b\u0917 \u0907\u0932\u0947\u0915\u094d\u0936\u0928 \u0915\u0930\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0906\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u092f\u0947 \u092c\u094b\u0932\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u0915\u094b\u0907\u090f \u091c\u0930\u0941\u0930\u0924 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u0948 (We are going to Raghunathpur to make them vote. Why should we disclose from which side [political party] We have come to conduct the elections and we don\u2019t need to speak about it -translated)\u201d, said a man when he was questioned as to where were they headed with arms, and for which party were they doing it.\n\nTimeline of the reports about gun-toting men\n\nAt 12:44 PM, ETV Bharat published a report titled, \u201c\u09ad\u09cb\u099f \u0995\u09b0\u09be\u09a4\u09c7 \u09af\u09be\u099a\u09cd\u099b\u09bf\u201d, \u0985\u09a4\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09a7\u09c1\u09a8\u09bf\u0995 \u0986\u0997\u09cd\u09a8\u09c7\u09df\u09be\u09b8\u09cd\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0 \u09b9\u09be\u09a4\u09c7 \u09ac\u09b2\u09b2 \u098f\u0995\u09a6\u09b2 \u09a6\u09c1\u09b7\u09cd\u0995\u09c3\u09a4\u09c0 (\u201cGoing to make them [people] vote,\u201d said a group of terrorists who were carrying advanced firearms -translated)\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is the picture that we are getting. The situation in West Bengal is becoming more grim, with every passing day, with every phase of elections. Voting day terror squad. These are the men who are masked. We don\u2019t know really who these men are but this video is from Purulia. That\u2019s the information we are getting\u2026\u2026This is happening on an election day where a Taliban style campaign taking place in West Bengal\u201d, said the Republic TV anchor.\n\nZee News, and Aaj Tak too broadcasted the video with a narrative that BJP has alleged that these men are TMC workers wielding guns to threaten voters.\n\nThe official handle of Bharatiya Janata Party tweeted a clip from the Zee News\u2019 broadcast accusing the \u201cTMC of crushing the democracy\u201d. BJP MP Babul Supriyo also shared the viral video on May 12.\n\nSeveral other media outlets including News24, News 18 and India TV relayed the visuals claiming that these were from Purulia district, West Bengal.\n\nWe found that the men in the video only said they were going to Raghunathpur, which is a city located in Purulia district, West Bengal. Based on the video, it is difficult to verify if the video is from West Bengal.\n\nAlt News contacted Purulia police to ascertain whether such gun-totting were spotted in Purulia district. Superintendent of Police Akash Magharia said, \u201cIn the video, the men never said where they are from and where did they belong to. This is not related to Purulia district. Anybody can claim that they are going to Purulia. My nakkas [checkpost] were in place. My men are in town. No person of that type carrying such arms had entered Purulia and we had a peaceful election here\u201d. In response to the question whether the police were able to locate the video, he said, \u201cWe had earlier thought it to be from Jharkhand but we are investigating it further.\u201d\n\nTimes Now also broadcasted the same visuals while covering the polls but later clarified in the same show that it was \u201ca fake video\u201d. The reporter in the broadcast said that a local journalist had orchestrated the sequence in the video and that the police are investigating the matter.\n\nAlt News couldn\u2019t independently verify the video and establish its origins. Suffice to say, a video sans verification was relayed by sections of mainstream media with an unsubstantiated narrative that TMC workers were threatening the voters in West Bengal. As far as the claims about TMC workers brandishing guns in Purulia is concerned, the men in the video only stated that they are going to Raghunathpur, which is in Purulia district. Neither, there is evidence to claim that they were TMC workers nor that they entered Purulia. Alt News will update the article when there is more information about this incident.", "lang": "en"}
