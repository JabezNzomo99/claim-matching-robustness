Bowman III, a law professor at the University of Missouri and expert on impeachment. \u201cThe Johnson case really illustrates the basic principle: The House can run an impeachment any way they darn well please.\u201d \u201cIn the history of our nation, the House of Representatives has never attempted to launch an impeachment inquiry against the President without a majority of the House taking political accountability for that decision by voting to authorize such a dramatic constitutional step.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Pat A. Cipollone, White House counsel, in a letter on Tuesday to House Democratic leaders Though the full chamber voted to start impeachment inquiries against Presidents Bill Clinton and Richard M. Nixon, nothing in the Constitution or House rules requires it. And outside of presidents, there are several cases of judicial impeachments that began without a vote. \u201cIn the past, House committees, under their general investigatory authority, have sometimes sought information and researched charges against officers prior to the adoption of a resolution to authorize an impeachment investigation,\u201d according to an October report from the Congressional Research Service. For example, impeachment inquiries into three federal judges in the 1980s began without explicit authorization by the full House, according to the report. While the whole House voted to start impeachment investigations into Mr. Clinton and Mr. Nixon, whether such a vote was taken in Mr. Johnson\u2019s is more ambiguous. In the second attempt to impeach the 17th president, the full House voted on and approved resolutions authorizing the Committee on Reconstruction to begin a general investigation and to obtain the evidence gathered previously by the Judiciary Committee. But those resolutions did not explicitly authorize a second impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no requirement in the Constitution that the House do anything specific, in any order, prior to voting to approve articles of impeachment,\u201d said Stephen Vladeck, a constitutional law professor at the University of Texas. Mr. Bowman, who called the White House letter \u201ca parade of absurdities,\u201d noted that impeachment is just one of the powers granted to Congress so \u201cif you took the White House argument seriously, it would mean that there has to be a vote\u201d before any House committee could begin hearings on legislation related to interstate commerce, budgets or even establishing post offices. \u201cThe House of Representatives is now essentially running an impeachment process without following precedent, without allowing the president to have counsel, without allowing the president to call witnesses or have subpoena power.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, in an interview this week \u201cIf they have a vote to do a formal impeachment inquiry, historically, precedent is such that, yes, then everyone gets the right, the minority party gets rights. Certainly, the White House gets rights. The president gets rights that aren\u2019t there now.\u201d \n\n\u2014 Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, in an interview this week This argument \u2014 which featured prominently in Mr. Cipollone\u2019s letter and has been echoed by other defenders of Mr. Trump \u2014 misrepresents the separation of duties in Congress in regards to the impeachment process: The House investigates and charges, and the Senate holds trial. Allowing the subject of an impeachment inquiry to call witnesses or present counterevidence is not required in either the Constitution or House rules. The House Judiciary Committee did hear testimony from the White House counsel at the request of the Clinton administration in 1998 and allowed Mr. Nixon\u2019s defense lawyers to present rebutting evidence in 1974. But no such accommodation was made in Mr. Johnson\u2019s case, who was impeached by the House before it even drew up articles of impeachment. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable for folks to suggest that the House should follow these more conciliatory precedents,\u201d Mr. Vladeck said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely false to argue that it\u2019s under any constitutional or legal obligation to do so.\u201d After a successful impeachment vote, the House then appoints lawmakers known as managers who essentially act as prosecutors in a Senate trial. The impeachment rules in the upper chamber do offer the impeached person some rights. Witnesses, for example, may be cross-examined and each side \u2014 the House managers and the impeached person \u2014 can make closing arguments before the Senate. \u201cRemember when Pelosi said that the transcript would show a quid pro quo? It doesn\u2019t.\u201d \n\n\u2014 Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, in an interview this month \u201cNo quid pro quo\u201d has become a rallying cry among those opposed to an impeachment inquiry, particularly since the reconstituted transcript of the phone call between Mr. Trump and the Ukrainian president was released on Sept. 25. (The phrase appears in talking points the White House pushed to its surrogates).\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Graham cited remarks Ms. Pelosi made to House Democrats in a closed-door meeting on Sept. 24, the day before the transcript was released. But in those remarks, she focused less on the need to prove an exchange of favors, arguing that simply asking for foreign intervention into an election was inappropriate enough. \u201cDon\u2019t get caught in the trap of, oh, there is no quid pro quo. No, he asked for assistance from the foreign government. That\u2019s wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to know this: There is no requirement that there be a quid-pro-quo in the conversation,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said in public remarks that day. \u201cWe don\u2019t ask foreign governments to help us in our elections, that\u2019s what we tried to stop with Russia. It\u2019s wrong.\u201d Other Democratic leaders in the House also echoed that sentiment. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary for us to find evidence of a quid pro quo,\u201d Mr. Schiff said on Sept. 22. \u201cYou don\u2019t need an explicit quid pro quo to betray your country.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
