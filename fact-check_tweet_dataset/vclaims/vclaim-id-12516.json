The other two were Khabib\u2019s younger cousin, Professional Fighters League (PFL) lightweight Abubakar Nurmagomedov, and teammate Zubaira Tukhugov, who were each suspended for 12 months and fined $25,000.\n\nOn February 21, the NSAC penalized a fifth fighter who took part in the brawl -- Dillon Danis, a Bellator welterweight and McGregor\u2019s training partner, who received a seven-month suspension and $7,500 fine.\n\nThe brawl was sparked after Khabib Nurmagomedov, who defeated McGregor by fourth-round submission, jumped over the cage and attacked Danis, whom he accused of insulting \u201cmy faith and my father.\u201d\n\nThe head of Russia\u2019s Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, claimed in response to the NSAC sentencing on February 21, said that the decision had been motivated by \u201cWestern Caucasophobia\u201d (the Caucasus is the geographic name of the Chechen and Dagestani fighters\u2019 home region in Russia). Kadyrov said the NSAC\u2019s aim was to \u201chumiliate our guys\u201d and \u201ctrample in the dirt the entire Caucasus,\u201d calling the punishment \u201cmonstrously disproportional.\u201d\n\n\u200bThe Chechen leader, however, missed quite a few essential details.\n\nThe NSAC offered K. Nurmagomedov the opportunity to shorten his suspension to six months \u2013 the same as McGregor\u2019s \u2013 on condition he agree to participate in an anti-bullying campaign. The champion refused, calling Nevada a \u201csin state\u201d and pledging never to fight there again. The suspension was also applied retroactively, meaning it started from October, when the incident occurred.\n\nAdditionally, UFC fans and experts alike questioned the fairness of Danis\u2019s punishment. He said he was acting in self-defense after being attacked by Nurmagomedov.\n\nKadyrov is a fan and supporter of the champ, Nurmagomedov, with the two calling each other \u201cbrothers.\u201d Friendship with Chechen leader reportedly comes with benefits: for instance, on February 5, Nurmagomedov posted on his Instagram account a photo of his father standing next to a new Mercedes SUV.\n\n\u201cThis gift for my father arrived today from Chechnya,\u201d Nurmagomedov wrote, thanking Kadyrov.\n\n\u200bIn his home region of Dagestan, Nurmagomedov has also assumed an \u201cethics police\u201d role in his public speeches and highly popular social media posts, condemning \u201csinners\u201d and demanding that local authorities \u201ccleanse\u201d the republic of \u201cfaggots\u201d and \u201cprostitutes\u201d that offend \u201clocal morals.\u201d\n\nLast week, a local theater cancelled a play after Khabib said it was \u201cpornographic\u201d because an actress appeared on stage in a neglig\u00e9e.\n\nThe fighter\u2019s outrage provoked a storm of threats against the play\u2019s director and actors, who later issued a public apology for \u201cinsulting local traditions.\u201d\n\nRegarding the suspension, some have noted that K. Nurmagomedov received a lesser punishment than his corner men, even though he\u2019s the one who initiated the brawl. Others, including his coach at the American Kickboxing Academy, Javier Mendez, said making Nurmagomedov participate in an anti-bullying campaign to reduce his suspension was hypocritical.\n\n\u201cKhabib gets fined only nine months, plus if he does anti-bullying or whatever, he gets three months off so he can fight when Conor can fight,\u201d MMA Fighting quoted Mendez as saying. \u201cOkay, but now you\u2019re telling the guy that was bullied two months out by verbally assaulting his family, his religion and his country that you need to do an anti-bull[y]ing slogan? F you! I ain\u2019t doing nothing. And I support that one hundred percent. I\u2019m not doing nothing for you.\u201d\n\nMcGregor faced several felony charges following an attack on a bus transporting UFC fighters, including Nurmagomedov, in Brooklyn, New York in April 2018. In July of that year he entered a plea deal to avoid jail time, which was viewed as a slap on the wrist by many in the MMA community. That punishment, however, was meted out by the Kings County Criminal Court in Brooklyn and not any state athletic commission.\n\nAnd while some MMA fans back Mendez\u2019s sentiment, by far the top-rated comment on that article stated that Nurmagomedov\u2019s outrage over the punishment was unjustified.\n\n\u201cMaybe I'm in the minority, but you can\u2019t hop out of the cage, flying jump kick someone, damn near start a riot, and then complain about being fined,\u201d wrote user \u201cMMA Escape.\u201d\n\nWhatever position one takes on Nurmagomedov\u2019s punishment, Kadyrov provided no evidence it was in any way influenced by the Dagestani fighter\u2019s ethnicity.\n\nPolygraph.info therefore finds Kadyrov\u2019s claim that Nurmagomedov and his teammates were unduly punished to \u201chumiliate\u201d the Caucasus to be false.", "lang": "en"}
