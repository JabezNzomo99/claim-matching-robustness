Rushmor (sic).\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence Trump ever tweeted the statement. The tweet appears to be fabricated.\n\nTrump on July 3 delivered a speech at South Dakota\u2019s 2020 Mount Rushmore Fireworks Celebration, where he announced the executive order to establish a \u201cNational Garden of American Heroes\u201d to commemorate prominent figures in U.S. history, according to The Associated Press.\n\nA viral Instagram post alleges in an image that Trump tweeted the following day about a supposed movement to have his likeness added to Mount Rushmore, which features the faces of former Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt.\n\n\u201cMy staff is telling me there\u2019s a huge movement to add me to Mt Rushmor,\u201d reads the alleged tweet. \u201cI\u2019m very honored, but I won\u2019t allow this to go any further until I finish my second term (unless there\u2019s more!) Maybe just a statue in DC (not a state!) until then. #maga.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that Trump actually tweeted the statement. A search of the president\u2019s verified Twitter accounts \u2014 @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS \u2014 turned up no such remark. Nor does the alleged comment appear in ProPublica\u2019s archive of his deleted tweets.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweets are often the subject of media attention, but no reporting on this purported tweet could be found, further adding to the post\u2019s dubiousness. It appears to be fabricated. (RELATED: Did Donald Trump Tweet, \u2018There Are Still More People Alive Then Dead\u2019?)\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Trump has been the target of a fake tweet. The Daily Caller has debunked a number of fabricated Trump tweets, including one that falsely claimed he said, \u201cAnyone who ordered a ticket to my rally and didn\u2019t attend should be arrested and face very powerful charges. #treason.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
