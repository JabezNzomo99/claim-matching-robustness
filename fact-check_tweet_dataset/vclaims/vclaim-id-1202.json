It does not appear on Trump\u2019s timeline, nor does it appear in Twitter searches for posts with this wording. No news outlets reported that Trump tweeted this.\n\nAccording to Politwoops, a project by ProPublica that archives deleted tweets from politicians, no such tweet has not been deleted from his page (here).\n\nThe posts, which have been shared hundreds of times on social media (here , here , here ), place the screenshot of the fictitious tweet alongside a series of authentic images of Trump with Maxwell and Epstein.\n\nThe false tweet comes after Maxwell was arrested on July 2 on U.S. charges of luring underage girls so that the financier Epstein could sexually abuse them (here). In August 2019 Epstein was found dead in a New York jail cell, where he was being held on charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of underage girls as young as 14 (here).\n\nReuters recently debunked other fictitious tweets attributed to Trump (here , here).\n\nFalse. Trump did not tweet that he did not know Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Real images accompanying the falsified tweet show that Trump has met Epstein and Maxwell.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
