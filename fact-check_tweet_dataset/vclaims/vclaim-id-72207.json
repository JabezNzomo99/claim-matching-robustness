It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean support for every one of the thousands of provisions in it.\n\nFor example, when Johnson was accused of having \"supported a plan to cut benefits and raise the retirement age\" for Social Security, our rating was Mostly False. Part of the evidence cited was Johnson\u2019s vote for a federal budget plan, not a proposal dealing solely with Social Security.\n\nIn this case, there was a motion to remove the tax increase from the budget. Feingold voted to table the motion -- a vote that helped keep the increase in the budget.\n\nRepublicans have also posted a video clip of Feingold speaking prior to his votes that indicated why he was not opposed to the tax increase. He said he probably would vote for the tax increase because it would be paid only by people who were earning enough money that they were already paying income taxes on their Social Security benefits.\n\nSo, the vote was to raise taxes only on more affluent Social Security recipients, not all of them.\n\n\"Tried to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants\"\n\nJohnson\u2019s campaign cites a Feingold vote on an amendment to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, saying Feingold voted against closing a loophole to ensure that illegal immigrants did not receive Social Security benefits.\n\nThere was a motion to table the amendment and the motion was approved 50-49, with Feingold in the majority. In other words, the amendment failed.\n\nBut we\u2019ve already rated this part of the claim, when Johnson made it in the 2010 Feingold-Johnson campaign. Our rating was False.\n\nThe amendment did not apply to illegal immigrants. It dealt with the policy on payments to formerly illegal workers -- undocumented workers who later were made legal.\n\nIllegal immigrants would not have been made eligible for Social Security benefits even if amendment had passed.\n\nJohnson says Feingold \"voted to raise taxes on Social Security benefits for seniors, he even tried to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants.\"\n\n \n\n On a proposal that would have removed a tax increase on Social Security benefits from the 1994 federal budget, Feingold voted no and indicated he was satisfied the increase applied only to higher-income senior citizens. The tax increase wasn\u2019t imposed on all Social Security recipients.\n\nFeingold did not vote to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants.\n\nFor a statement that has an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
