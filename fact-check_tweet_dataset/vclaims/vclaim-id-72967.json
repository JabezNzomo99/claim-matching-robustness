Recurring budget deficits -- with hardly any intervening surpluses -- have created a national debt of , and federal spending continues to outpace tax receipts.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., recently came to New Hampshire to test the waters for a presidential bid, talking about the deficit at a in Concord. During a question-and-answer session, he said the country needed to simplify the tax code and reform entitlements.\n\nTo put in perspective just how much money he was talking about, he said, \"If you took every penny of the (richest) 1 percent, including their dog, you wouldn't even begin to balance the budget.\"\n\nReally? Politifact New Hampshire decided to check it out.\n\nWe first checked with Graham\u2019s Senate office. His spokesman, Kevin Bishop, from the Wall Street Journal opinion section that talks about the difficulty of balancing the budget solely by taxing the income of the country\u2019s richest people.\n\nThat may be true, but it\u2019s also not the way Graham phrased it. Graham didn\u2019t single out the income taxes of the richest 1 percent; he said \"every penny of the 1 percent\" (while throwing in their pets for good measure).\n\nThere\u2019s enough wiggle room in Graham\u2019s statement to allow for three plausible ways to define \"every penny\" -- total wealth, total income and total taxes for the richest 1 percent. We\u2019ll look at each.\n\nFiguring out how much wealth -- stocks, bonds, income, real estate, and the like -- is held by the nation\u2019s richest 1 percent holds is somewhat tricky because some of those elements are hard to measure. But there have been several estimates.\n\nOn the low end, the Boston Consulting Group puts the amount of privately held wealth in the United States at . The group\u2019s figure is based on a proprietary formula and excludes real estate, businesses owned by investors and luxury goods.\n\nOn the upper end, the U.S. Federal Reserve cited the net worth of all U.S. households and nonprofits at . That number includes the value of real estate and of nonprofit organizations, some of which are closely held by individuals.\n\nA middle ground can be found in data compiled for the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. Their definition of national wealth excludes nonprofits, and comes in at .\n\nThese estimates all look at the entire nation\u2019s holdings. What about the share owned by the richest 1 percent?\n\nIn a , Saez and Zucman found that the top 1 percent own 41.8 percent of the country\u2019s wealth. Estimates from other researchers showed a somewhat lower percentage -- percent and percent, depending on the year.\n\nUsing their own data set, that means the richest 1 percent have holdings worth about $23 trillion. If you apply their 41.8 percentage to the other two estimates, the amount ranges from $16 trillion to $29 trillion.\n\nEach figure is easily enough to balance the U.S. budget, which ran a $483 billion deficit last year and which is projected to be $486 billion in the red this year, according to . Even adding up deficits for the next decade gives us $7.7 trillion -- a total easily covered by that $26.2 trillion that could (at least in this example) be confiscated from our nation\u2019s richest residents.\n\nAnother way to look at it: All federal spending in 2012 . So the richest 1 percent\u2019s wealth could also pay off the year\u2019s entire budget -- six-and-a-half times over.\n\nIn fact, even the lowest of the three wealth estimates would come close to wiping out the country\u2019s current level of accumulated debt, which stands in excess of $18 trillion.\n\nEven if you use the income of the 1 percent, it\u2019s still a number far greater than you would need to balance the budget. The data collected by Saez and Zucman show a national income of . The Federal Reserve reports the for the same year. On the low end, the IRS reported in adjusted gross income for 2012.\n\nThe richest 1 percent\u2019s share of the income for 2012, according to the Paris School of Economics\u2019 , is 22.8 percent (including capital gains). That means taking the entirety of the group\u2019s income that year would net us somewhere between $2 trillion and $3.2 trillion.\n\nIn other words, if you use total income of the 1 percent, you don\u2019t even have to raid Fido\u2019s food bowl to do what Graham suggests.\n\nAnd what of the actual tax burden of the 1 percent? According to estimates , the richest 1 percent paid 27 percent of all federal income taxes in 2012. They had an average income of $1.8 million apiece that year and paid an average of $489,437 in taxes.\n\nThat works out, roughly, to some $563 billion in taxes collected from the richest in 2012. A tidy sum, to be sure, but it has already been applied to offset our government\u2019s costs. One would have to double the taxes collected from the group to cover current deficits.\n\nThis is the one scenario in which Graham has a point.\n\nGraham said, \"If you took every penny of the (richest) 1 percent, including their dog, you wouldn't even begin to balance the budget.\"\n\nGraham has a point if you take it the way his staff suggests he meant to say it. But the talking point (which, to be clear, no one is suggesting as a real policy) came out more broadly. If you use either total wealth or total income -- interpretations we think are at least as plausible given his \"every penny\" remarks -- Graham is off base.\n\nOn balance, we rate his claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
