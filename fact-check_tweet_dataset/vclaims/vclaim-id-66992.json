It is being shared with a screenshot of an authentic NDTV report about 60 students who were already COVID-19 positive appeared for the CET exam in Karnataka.\n\nThe posts aim to show that both articles are about students testing positive after appearing for entrance exams in the state. The fake posts are part of the widespread Twitter campaign mainly led by students against the Supreme Court and the Centre's nod to hold the Joint Engineering Entrance Exams (JEE) and National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) in September. On August 17, the Supreme Court ruled against further postponing the entrance exams while the Centre refused on August 25. Six state ministers have written to the Supreme Court to reconsider the exam dates due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAlso Read:What Is The Controversy Surrounding NEET 2020? All You Need To Know\n\n\n\nThe News18 graphic riddled with errors reads,\" COMDEK UGNET 2020:57 deaths with 5371 students tested +ve for COVID-19, 8456 students quarantined.\" The headline spells COMEDK as 'COMDEK' and quarantined as 'quarantined'.\n\nAshutosh Kumar, National Vice-President of All India Students Union tweeted the fake News18 screenshot and the screenshot of the NDTV article, drawing comparison between the 80,000 students who appeared for the entrance exam to over 28 lakh students appearing for JEE, NEET, and the final year exams.\n\nThe other posts which shared the same screenshot also used the fake claim to support the decision that the NEET and JEE exams should be postponed.\n\nView archives here and here.\n\nBOOM found that the News18 image was edited and fake and the NDTV report was being shared with a misleading context.\n\nA search did not yield any results for news reports that students who appeared for the COMEDK exams or their parents had tested positive for COVID-19. We also searched on the News 18's website to see if they had published any story reporting deaths and COVID-19 cases but did not find any such story.\n\nAn analysis of the screenshot showed that the fake claim has been edited onto another story of News18. The original text discusses that the answer key for COMEDK UGET 2020 will be released on August 23.\n\nThe fake screenshot and the original news story bear the same timestamp of 4.56 pm\n\nThe NDTV story does not relate to the COMEDK exams but is about how students who were already COVID-19 positive were allowed to appear for the CET exam for engineering, while following social distancing norms.\n\nThe story which is being used in a misleading context states that of the 1.47 lakh students who appeared for CET, 60 were COVID-19 positive. The story talks about separate seating arrangement and safety precautions followed for the COVID-19 positive students so they could appear for the entrance examination.\n\nAlso Read:Final Year Students Cannot Be Promoted Without Exams: Supreme Court", "lang": "en"}
