Glenn Chong.\n\nThe report could already have reached more than 600,000 people on Facebook. Its biggest traffic generator is a Facebook page affiliated with Greco Belgica, commissioner of the Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission.\n\nThe article, posted Dec. 13, is a mere copy of a Dec. 12 Abante report originally headlined:\n\nPhilnetizen.com altered several paragraphs and changed the headline to:\n\nUnlike the Abante report, philnetizen.com wrote its headline as a statement of fact, failing to clearly state that it was Chong who made the accusation.\n\nIt also carried an edited thumbnail that juxtaposed a selfie of Santillan swiped from Chong\u2019s official Facebook account and an Inquirer.net photo of the car Santillan and Casing were riding during the fatal encounter with the police. The images were overlaid with the logos of Comelec and Smartmatic.\n\nChong has previously accused the Comelec and election technology provider Smartmatic-Total Information Management Corp. of poll fraud in the 2016 automated elections.\n\nThe misleading article was posted the same day two top officials and at least 10 officers of the Rizal provincial and Cainta municipal police offices were relieved from their posts following the alleged shootout that killed Santillan and Casing.\n\nPolice claim the two were involved in carnapping and illegal drug activities. Chong says the operation was a set up and the police \u201ctortured and executed\u201d Santillan based on an autopsy report.", "lang": "en"}
