The chief inspector of prisons recently described a \u201cgrim situation\u201d in which too many prisons have become \u201cunacceptably violent and dangerous places\u201d. The last Prime Minister spoke of a \u201cscandalous failure\u201d of the system earlier this year, listing concerning statistics on violence and self-harm rates.\n\nFormer prisons minister Andrew Selous appeared on this morning\u2019s BBC Today programme to respond to claims that, in spite of all this, prison officer numbers are falling.\n\nThis is true. There are fewer prison officers in public prisons in England and Wales than there were in 2010, and there are fewer since a year ago.\n\nMr Selous is just looking at the number of people being appointed and the number of people leaving. This doesn\u2019t factor in people who are promoted or re-graded within the service, or the hours they work.\n\nThe staffing figures we use in this piece are full-time equivalents, unless we say otherwise. That means a person who works half the hours of someone else counts half as much, although overtime isn\u2019t taken into account. The benefit of using this measure is that you get a sense of how many hours are being worked by officers, rather than just caring about headcounts.\n\nJust under 24,000 people work in operational roles in public sector prisons in England and Wales. Take away managers and those who work in support roles and you\u2019re left with 14,700 who could be described as \u2018frontline\u2019 officers, working at grades 3-4.\n\nThese are people who work directly with prisoners day-to-day, and it\u2019s who the Howard League is referring to when it claims that officer numbers are falling.\n\nAt the end of March 2010, before the general election that year, almost 19,900 such officers were in post. By June 2015 they\u2019d fallen to 15,100, and have fallen another 400 over the last year to the latest count of 14,700.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting some caveats, even though they\u2019re unlikely to affect the trends significantly.\n\nThere have been some changes to the structure of the prison system that blur the comparison over time a little. Some prisons, such as HMP Northumberland, transferred to the private sector over the last five years. Others have become public prisons as well. These figures can\u2019t account for these changes.\n\nSo what is Andrew Selous referring to when he says that the number of officers has gone up?\n\nHe\u2019s focusing just on people entering and leaving the service, not accounting for the hours they work. He\u2019s also comparing over a longer time period, and he\u2019s looking at a slightly wider group of people\u2014grades 3-5\u2014which includes supervisors and some managers.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t change the fact that the overall numbers of prison officers are falling, but there\u2019s a story to tell here.\n\nPeople enter and leave the prison service for all kinds of reasons. New people are recruited, and people in other roles are moved to the frontline. On the other side, people are promoted or transferred into other roles, retire, resign, leave voluntarily, are dismissed or pass away.\n\nSo lots of things are going on when we see the number of officers change.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s been happening to the number of people being recruited to become prison officers at grade 3, compared to those leaving at grades 3-5, over the last six years. These are actual headcounts of people, and don\u2019t take into account the hours they work.\n\nThat surge in the number of leavers in 2013/14 was when the prison service wanted to reduce staffing numbers, and so offered voluntary early exit packages for staff. Almost 2,000 officers, grades 3-5, left the service that year.\n\nSince then, there\u2019s been a recruitment drive, and the number of officers being appointed has surged. That\u2019s either slowed or slightly reversed the fall in officer headcounts.\n\nAndrew Selous hones in on the change over 18 months between the start of 2015 and the middle of 2016. That\u2019s how you get to his 790 increase.\n\nDoes this mean that the situation is improving?\n\nWe can\u2019t know just from looking at recruitment. This change doesn\u2019t reflect how many hours officers are working. Some people reduce their hours, or are taken on for fewer hours than the people they replaced. In addition, some people are promoted or re-graded out of roles with direct day-to-day contact with prisoners. Recruitment and leaving figures can\u2019t tell us about these things.\n\nTo get a sense of how the service is managing against the concerning trends of violence, we need to look at the stock of prison officers overall and the hours they\u2019re working, rather than this narrower set of figures on joiners and leavers.\n\nThe headline was changed from 'Frontline prison officers: are they putting in the hours?'.", "lang": "en"}
