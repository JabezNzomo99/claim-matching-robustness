But the inquiries begin inside Russia \u2013 as part of Russia\u2019s own election politics and among opposition figures.\n\nIn the run-up to the Russian presidential election last year, Russia\u2019s Central Election Commission released information on Putin\u2019s personal assets and income, stating that he earned an average of $112,000 a year between 2011 and 2016, totaling approximately $673,000, the Washington Post reported.\n\nPutin listed 13 bank accounts with a combined balance of $241,000, an 800-square-foot apartment in St. Petersburg, 230 shares in Bank Saint Petersburg and three automobiles -- two Soviet-era Volga sports cars built in 1960 and 1965 and a 2009 Lada 4x4.\n\nCritics have long claimed his actual wealth is exponentially higher.\n\nIn 2007, Russian political expert Stanislav Belkovsky estimated Putin\u2019s wealth at $40 billion, saying the Russian president \"effectively\" controlled 37% of the shares of Surgutneftegaz, an oil exploration company, and Russia's third biggest oil producer, worth $20 billion, as well as 4.5% of Russia\u2019s natural gas monopoly Gazprom and \"at least 75%\" of Gunvor, a Swiss-based oil trader founded by billionaire Putin-confidant Gennady Timchenko.\n\n\u200bAccording to the New York Times, the CIA produced a secret assessment of Putin\u2019s wealth that also put the figure at $40 billion. Agency officials told the newspaper that assessment \u201clargely tracked\u201d with Belkovsky\u2019s assertions.\n\nThe following year, a U.S. diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks similarly alleged that Gunvor \u201cis rumored to be one of Putin's sources of undisclosed wealth,\u201d noting that opposition leader Alexei Navalny had \u201csued Gunvor and several Russian oil companies for information regarding their oil trading practices\u201d and estimating \u201cthat Gunvor may control up to 50% of total Russian oil exports.\u201d\n\nGunvor itself claims to move 2.5 million barrels of oil every day \u2013 about 3% of the world\u2019s oil.\n\nBut the opaque nature of such alleged schemes has led to widely varying estimates over the years.\n\nIn 2012, Belkovsky revised his estimate of Putin\u2019s wealth upwards to $70 billion. Five years later, Kremlin critic and financier Bill Browder assessed Putin\u2019s wealth at $200 billion. \u200b\n\nAlso in 2012, Leonid Martynyuk and then opposition leader Boris Nemtsov released a report entitled \u201cLife of galley slave (palaces, yachts, cars, planes and other accessories),\u201d which claimed that Putin had 20 palaces and villas, including \u201cPutin\u2019s Palace,\u201d a Black Sea property worth $1 billion dollars that was allegedly built through a convoluted cash flow scheme.\n\nThey also alleged that Putin owned some 43 aircraft, various yachts (including a $35 million vessel allegedly transferred to Putin via the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich) and an extensive watch collection.\n\nOther signs of opulence have slipped out during public relations events and media \u201cphoto ops.\u201d For example, Putin was once seen exercising in a sweat suit worth an estimated $3,200.\n\nPeskov himself caused a stir in 2015 when he was photographed wearing a watch worth upwards of $600,000 dollars. Peskov and his wife were subsequently spotted vacationing on a yacht that cost $388,000 a week to rent during the off season.\n\nIn 2016, Adam Szubin, who was then U.S. Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Crimes, told the BBC the U.S. government had evidence linking Putin\u2019s wealth to Timchenko\u2019s activities.\n\nLater that year, documents leaked from Mossack Fonseca & Co., a Panamanian law firm and corporate service provider, which became known as the Panama Papers, included personal financial information about public officials worldwide, including several close to Putin.\n\nThe Panama Papers revealed that Sergei Roldugin, a cellist, lifetime friend and godfather to Putin\u2019s eldest daughter, Maria, had helped moved billions of dollars through a series of shell companies which the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) said were engaged in:\n\u2022 dubious over-the-counter transactions with shares of the largest state-owned Russian companies such as Rosneft;\n\u2022 \u201cdonations\u201d from major Russian businessmen often laundered through paper deals;\n\u2022 preferential loans from the Cyprus-based RCB Bank, a large stake of which is controlled by Russia\u2019s state-owned VTB Bank.\n\nThe OCCRP noted that funds accumulated through Rodulgin\u2019s offshore companies that were later reinvested in Russia fell into two categories -- strategic assets, and leisure-relate assets like resorts, yacht clubs and palaces.\n\nOne such resort, built on land purchased with funds acquired through Rodulgin\u2019s firm Sandalwood Continental, would be used to host the wedding of Putin\u2019s younger daughter, Katerina Tikhonova, and Kirill Shamalov, the billionaire son of long-time Putin friend Nikolai Shamalov.\n\nShamalov is a founding member of Ozero, a dacha housing cooperative in Leningrad Obast near Saint Petersburg that also includes Yuri Kovalchuk, who is chairman of and the largest shareholder in Bank Rossiya, which is also known as \u201cPutin\u2019s Wallet\u201d; former Russian Railways President Vladimir Yakunin; and former Minister of Education and Science Andrei Fursenko.\n\nRussian Commercial Bank in Cyprus, a subsidiary of the Russian state-owned bank VTB, extended an $800 million credit to Sandalwood Continental from 2009-11.\n\nWhy it Matters, Inside Russia and Elsewhere\n\nThat Putin\u2019s wealth is allegedly funneled through myriad tax shelters and controlled by proxies explains why the U.S. bill would seek to determine the holdings of those closest to Putin.\n\nReuters reported in 2015 that many of Putin\u2019s friends \u201chad grown famously rich,\u201d and that their children were on a trajectory analogous to that of China\u2019s \u201cprincelings\u201d \u2013 the children and grandchildren of Communist Party leaders who gained positions of power and wealth.\n\nNavalny said Russia\u2019s extreme concentration of wealth (it regularly ranks among the world\u2019s most unequal societies) was reflective of a \u201cneo-feudal system.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday in Russia, it is absolutely normal that the boards of directors at state banks are headed by children of security service officials, who aren\u2019t even 30 years old when they are appointed,\u201d Navalny told Reuters. \u201cIt is more than just a dynastic succession. Children don\u2019t just inherit their parents\u2019 posts, but also the right to choose any other post they fancy. The danger is that very soon all key resources will end up in the hands of five to seven families.\u201d\n\nTestifying before the U.S. Congress in 2017, Browder, who was once Russia\u2019s largest foreign investor, said the Panama Papers had also indirectly implicated Putin in a $230 million tax fraud scheme uncovered by his accountant Sergei Magnitsky.\n\nMagnitsky died in pre-trail detention in 2009 after uncovering the scheme, allegedly organized by corrupt Russian officials who had seized possession of three companies owned by Browder.\n\nAs a result of Magnitsky\u2019s death, Browder successfully lobbied for the Magnitsky Act, the U.S. law that targets Russian officials implicated in human rights and corruption cases. In 2016, the U.S. Congress passed a global version of that bill, allowing foreign officials implicated in human rights abuses worldwide to be sanctioned.\n\n\u201cInformation from the Panama Papers also links some money from the crime that Sergei Magnitsky discovered and exposed to Sergei Roldugin,\u201d Browder told the U.S. Congress in his 2017 testimony.\n\n\u201cBased on the language of the Magnitsky Act, this would make Putin personally subject to Magnitsky sanctions,\u201d Browder noted, adding \u201cthis is particularly worrying for Putin, because he is one of the richest men in the world.\u201d\n\nAccording to Vladimir Kara-Murza, a twice-poisoned Russian opposition figure, Putin has taken the Magnitsky Act personally.\n\n\u201cIt was the Magnitsky Act that Putin tasked his foreign ministry with trying to stop; it was the Magnitsky Act that was openly tied to the ban on child adoptions; it was the Magnitsky Act that was the subject of the 2016 Trump Tower meeting attended by a Kremlin-linked lawyer; it is advocating for the Magnitsky Act that may soon land any Russian citizen in prison. It was the Magnitsky Act that Putin named as the biggest threat to his regime as he stood by Trump\u2019s side in Helsinki,\u201d Kara Murza wrote.\n\nAccording to journalist Julia Ioffe, the Magnitsky Act \u201cwas the blueprint \u2026 for the big sanctions that came in 2014\u201d following Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and military intervention in Eastern Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWhat made Russian officialdom so mad about the Magnitsky Act is that it was the first time that there was some kind of roadblock to getting stolen money to safety,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAccording to Browder, Putin\u2019s hidden wealth is his \u201cAchilles\u2019 heel,\u201d which is why Putin made the surprise move of offering up Russians suspected of interfering in the 2016 election in exchange for interviewing people close to the U.S.-born financer during the 2018 Russia\u2013United States summit in Helsinki Finland.\n\nUltimately, much remains unknown about Putin\u2019s actual wealth. Due to the nature in which Putin\u2019s alleged holdings are managed, Russian security expert Mark Galeotti wrote that \u201cspecific assertions rest on rather shakier evidentiary grounds.\u201d\n\n\"Putin's name doesn't appear on any shareholders' register,\u201d Belkovsky said in 2007, noting \u201cthere is a non-transparent scheme of successive ownership of offshore companies and funds.\u201d He added: \u201cBut please pay attention that Vladimir Vladimirovich [Putin] has never sued me.\"\n\nThe late Karen Dawisha wrote in her book \u201cPutin\u2019s Kleptocracy\u201d said that the proxy system through which Putin\u2019s alleged wealth is distributed means that he, like many of Russia\u2019s oligarch\u2019s, has access to wealth rather than ownership of it.\n\n\u201cWithout the presidency Putin theoretically would not be allowed to keep any of these accoutrements of power \u2026 Thus his motivation to leave power is reduced to zero,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThat assessment trucks with a leaked 2007 U.S. diplomatic cable:\n\n\u201cSince Putin reportedly had secret assets tied up abroad (working through proxies like XXXXXXXXXXX) he worried that with a strong successor like (senior official Sergey) Ivanov the tables could be turned on Putin, making him the object of law enforcement investigations and Interpol warnings.\u201d\n\n\u200bWhile a great deal of uncertainty remains, Polygraph.info finds that any attempts to label investigations of the Russian president\u2019s assets, \u201cRussophobia\u201d are false.", "lang": "en"}
