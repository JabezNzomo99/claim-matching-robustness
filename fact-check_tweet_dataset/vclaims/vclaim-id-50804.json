People said, what\u2019s with the lightbulb? I said, here\u2019s the story. And I looked at it. The bulb that we\u2019re being forced to use \u2014 number one, to me, most importantly, the light's no good. I always look orange, and so do you; the light is the worst.\" \u2014 Trump\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign organization didn\u2019t provide us with any information to back up this statement.\n\nBut the light-quality criticism is overly broad.\n\nSome compact fluorescent bulbs, which were created in 1976, don\u2019t have good light quality, said Noah Horowitz, director of the Center For Energy Efficiency Standards, Climate & Clean Energy Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nBut those fluorescent bulbs, also called CFLs, are being supplanted by LEDs. More than 1 billion LED bulbs have been purchased in the United States, and sales are growing as prices have decreased and CFL sales are plummeting, Horowitz said.\n\nIndeed, Trump\u2019s Energy Department says that quality LEDs \"offer comparable or better light quality than other types of lighting.\"\n\n\"Incandescents have a limited spectrum, whereas there are many options for LEDs, often making the quality of light better than incandescents,\" said Mark Rea, professor at the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y.\n\n\"But number two, it\u2019s many times more expensive than that old incandescent bulb that worked very well.\" \u2014 Trump\n\nHis campaign cited a light bulb wholesaler website that said CFLs \"initially cost more than conventional bulbs but have the potential to save you money in the long run because of their longevity and efficiency.\"\n\nBut LEDs are an even better bargain.\n\nThey can cost three times as much as incandescents, but they are five times more energy efficient and last 10 times as long, Rea said.\n\nThat means a savings of $25 to $100 or more over the 10- to 25-year lifetime of a new LED, said Horowitz.\n\n\"And very importantly, I don't know if you know this, they have warnings. If it breaks, it\u2019s considered a hazardous waste site; it\u2019s gases inside.\" \u2014 Trump\n\nAgain, he\u2019s referring to CFLs, not LEDs.\n\nCFLs contain low levels of mercury, so the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency does consider them \"household hazardous waste.\" The agency recommends they be recycled, as some communities provide for, rather than thrown into the regular household trash.\n\nMercury is a liquid, but it can evaporate and become a vapor. At high exposure levels, it can be a health hazard.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign pointed out that authorities in King County, Wash., issued a 15-step guide for cleaning up a broken fluorescent bulb. They include venting the room and using rubber gloves to put the broken pieces in a sealed container.\n\nHowever, those recommendations are for CFLs. In contrast, LEDs pushed by the Obama administration are mercury free and don\u2019t contain any gases, Rea and Horowitz said. LEDs can be disposed of in the regular trash.\n\nTalking about CFLs is misleading, Rea said, because LEDs \"are the only relevant lighting technology.\"", "lang": "en"}
