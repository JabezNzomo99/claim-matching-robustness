The majority of those sentenced do not end up in custody and the proportions of ethnicity vary throughout the system.\n\nThe report says that \u201cjust over half (53%) [of those in young offender institutions] said that they were from a white ethnic background with 47%, the highest rate recorded since 2001, identifying as black or minority ethnic\u201d.\n\nThis is 47% of all children who responded to the survey. Last year, 86% of children in young offender institutions in England and Wales, or 632, answered it. We don\u2019t know how children who weren\u2019t surveyed would have responded.\n\nChildren who didn\u2019t tick \u2018white\u2019 were counted as an ethnic minority.\n\nAs the graph below shows, 47% is the highest proportion since the survey began in 2001.\n\nThe proportion of black or minority ethnic children in young offender institutions depends on the area\n\nThe proportion of children who reported that they were black or from a minority ethnic background wasn\u2019t consistent across the five young offender institutions in England and Wales. For example in the Keppel Unit in Wetherby, West Yorkshire 7% of those who responded said they were black or minority ethnic. In Feltham in London it was 70%.\n\nAll of the children held in young offender institutions are boys. Girls are now held in secure training centres or secure children\u2019s homes. There are around 1,000 children and young people held in these various youth custody facilities, the vast majority under 18.\n\nFigures from the Ministry of Justice show that a similar proportion of under-18s across all these facilities are from ethnic minorities: around 45%, excluding unknowns, as of September 2016. Again, that percentage has risen sharply: 10 years ago it was 25%.\n\nThere\u2019s a much higher proportion of black and minority ethnic children in custody than in the overall population. 18% of 15 to 17-year-old boys identified as black, Asian or minority ethnic at the time of the 2011 census.\n\nEmerging findings from the Lammy Review show that young males from ethnic minorities are also disproportionately likely to be arrested, charged, and prosecuted in the Crown Court (which is generally reserved for more serious offences) than their white peers.\n\nThere is no single easy answer to why minority ethnic groups are overrepresented in this way. It may in part be down to \u201cdisadvantage at earlier stages in their lives\u201d as one study chaired by Baroness Young found in 2014.\n\nBut the report also found that factors like disproportionate use of stop and search contributed. Black, Asian and minority ethnic young people being more likely to deny an offence also came into play. Denying offences meant that they were less likely to just be cautioned. The report also raised concerns about \u201cgang policy and the resulting police response which identifies young BAME people as a risk rather than in need\u201d.\n\nEthnicity varies at different points in the criminal justice system\n\nThe proportion of black, Asian and minority ethnic boys varies at different points in the criminal justice system. For example, they accounted for 23% of all 10 to 17 year-olds arrested in 2014/15 compared to 39% of all those in \u201csecure estate custody\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ve written more about ethnicity in the justice system more widely here.\n\nWe updated this piece to include more information about the proportion of black, Asian and ethnic minority young people across the rest of the justice system, not just those in custody.", "lang": "en"}
