We don\u2019t negotiate. We don\u2019t negotiate. You pay practically the same for the country as if you go into a drug store and buy the drugs. If we negotiated the price of drugs, Joe, we\u2019d save $300 billion a year.\u201d\n\nBoth former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) have proposed detailed plans to control prescription-drug prices, with both calling for Medicare to negotiate directly with prescription-drug companies to get lower prices \u2014 something currently prohibited by law. Republican candidates have also decried high prescription-drug costs, though generally their policy proposals have been thinner.\n\nDeveloper Donald Trump may be the Republican front-runner but, like the Democrats, he also says he wants to allow Medicare to negotiate directly with drug companies. In fact, he makes the bold claim that he would save $300 billion a year. Is this even remotely possible?\n\nCEPR based its estimates by comparing the per capita cost of drugs in the United States with the costs in Canada (which pays about 70 cents for each dollar spent in the United States) and Denmark (35 cents). CEPR then applied the difference to the anticipated costs of Medicare\u2019s prescription drug program between 2013 to 2021. Thus Canada represents the low range of the estimated saving ($230 billion over 10 years) and Denmark the high end ($541 billion over 10 years).\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Trump is being sloppy and when he discusses Medicare, he really means to say he would force government-led pricing on all prescription drugs. But the numbers don\u2019t add up that way either.\n\nIn fact, depending on the source you consult, total annual spending on prescription drugs in the United States is between $298 billion a year to $423 billion. So that would mean Trump is claiming that he can eliminate virtually any cost to prescription drugs. It would suddenly be free!\n\nSanders\u2019s broader plan is for overhauling the entire health-care system to a government-run model. Warren Gunnels, his senior policy adviser, says Sanders also would eventually set up a system under which the government buys patents from drug companies as soon as new drugs are produced, so generic brands can be immediately produced.\n\nWhether the government bargaining for Medicare drugs would even yield savings of $38 billion a year is certainly debatable. The Obama administration, in its 2017 budget plan, includes a proposal that would allow the Secretary for Health and Human Services to negotiate with manufacturers for high\u2010cost drugs and biologics covered under Part D, but says there would be no budget impact. A 2015 study, by researchers at Carleton University and Public Citizen, estimated annual savings of $15-16 billion if negotiations resulted in the same prices for drugs paid by Medicaid or the Veterans Health Administration, which currently get rebates.\n\nDean Baker, who wrote CEPR\u2019s report, disputes that analysis. \u201cMuch of the research now being undertaken goes to developing copycat drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cIf drug prices were structured so that a breakthrough drug carried a high price and copycats were priced much lower, we would see far less research of copy cat drugs, but possibly the same or more of breakthrough drugs. \u2026. As an economist, I find it utterly absurd that we are paying thousands of dollars for drugs that might sell for $10 or $20 a prescription in a free market.\u201d\n\nUpdate, March 4: In the March 3 debate, Trump for the first time said that his statement that he would save $300 billion on prescription drugs in Medicare actually was supposed to mean negotiating for a range of products in the Medicare system. But the $300 billion pledge doesn\u2019t make much sense either. Projected Medicare spending in 2016 is $560 billion, so Trump unrealistically is claiming he will cut spending nearly 55 percent.\n\nOnce again, we are confronted with a nonsense figure from the mouth of Donald Trump. He is either claiming to save four times the entire cost of the Medicare prescription drug system \u2013 or he is claiming to make prescription drugs free for every American. Neither is possible, so he once again earns Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
