The article says the Philippine vice president promised to quit if no candidates from her party won in recent midterm elections. The posts are misleading; the article is satirical and was originally published by a website that describes itself as \u201ccreative writing\u201d.\n\nMultiple Facebook posts, including this one, shared around 1,500 times since it was uploaded May 14, 2019, and this one published the same day, contain a screenshot of an apparent news article about Philippine Vice President Leni Robredo.\n\nRobredo is a member of the opposition Liberal Party. Here is her Twitter profile and here is the party website.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of one of the posts:\n\nThe post\u2019s Filipino-language caption, translated to English, says: \u201cLet\u2019s spread this masters, vice leni will step down if those in her line up will not make it.. Congrats\u2026\u201d\n\nThe article in the screenshot has the headline: \u201cRobredo To Step Down If None Of The Otso Diretso Makes It To Magic 12?\u201d\n\n\u201cOtso Diretso\u201d, meaning \u201cEight Straight\u201d, was the name of the alliance fielded by the Liberal Party in the Philippines\u2019 midterm elections on May 13, 2019. Here is their campaign page on Facebook.\n\nThe \u201cMagic 12\u201d refers to the winners of the Senate race, where 12 seats were up for grabs. Unofficial results reported by AFP here on May 14 indicate a bad result for the Liberal Party.\n\nThe same image was also shared in other Facebook posts that also present the article as genuine. Screenshots of three of these posts appear below, followed by English translations of their captions:\n\n1. This post shared around 1,500 times has a caption that says, translated to English: \u201cI hope the VP still remembers this. Please spread so this can reach Her!\u201d.\n\n2. The caption of this post says, translated to English: \u201cO FAKE VP will you keep your word???\u201d\n\n3. Translated to English, this post says: \u201cO yeah! Welcome BBM\u201d.\n\n\u201cBBM\u201d refers to Ferdinand \u2018Bongbong\u2019 Marcos Jr, the son and namesake of late Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Here is his website.\n\nHe lost to Robredo in the race for vice president in May 2016, as reported by AFP here at the time, but he lodged a challenge to the results that prompted a recount, as shown in this official document published on his website.\n\nThe recount is still ongoing. Here is an update on the matter on the website of the Philippines\u2019 Supreme Court dated January 22, 2019.\n\nAll of the posts contain a screengrab of an article credited to \u201cThe Adobo Chronicles\u201d, this satirical website. Here is the original Adobo Chronicles article shown in the post, which is dated May 7, 2019.\n\nThe image below compares screenshots of the misleading Facebook post (L) and the original article as it appears on the Adobo Chronicles site (R):\n\nThe text and photo of Robredo in the two screenshots is the same, but the font is different and the date, byline and \u2018Leave a comment\u2019 does not appear in the image featured in the misleading Facebook post.\n\nOn the Adobo Chronicles \u2018about\u2019 page here there is a disclaimer written in a satirical tone which says that the information on the site is not fully factual.\n\nIt says, in part: \u201cWhen writing stories for this blog, we let the news sizzle and simmer in our mind in a mixture of fact and fiction, then we spice it up with figments of our imagination\u201d.\n\nIt also says: \u201cEverything you read on this site is based on fact, except for the lies. We abide by the highest standards of creative writing and intend to make this site as respectable as possible to the extent allowed by our fertile mind.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the disclaimer:\n\nSome Facebook users appeared to believe the posts were sharing a genuine article about Robredo.\n\nFor example, a comment on one of the misleading posts, translated to English, says: \u201cWhere\u2019s your promise that you will step down if the Straight Eight does not win leave now VP\u201d. Below is a screenshot of the comment with the identity of the poster redacted:\n\nThe comment below, when translated to English, says: \u201cMa\u2019am may not be a liar if she will indeed step down as she said. This is when we will see her real character, when the winning senators have already been declared, right ma\u2019am?", "lang": "en"}
