Misuari is the founder and leader of the Moro National Liberation Front.\n\nThe latter had waged, while the former has been waging, an armed insurgency against the Philippine government for the right to self determination of the Moros in Mindanao.\n\nContrary to Duterte\u2019s claim, \u201ctalks\u201d between the Philippine government and both the MILF and the MNLF have already been concluded.\n\nDuterte has inherited four peace agreements signed by previous administrations:\n\u2022 The 1976 Tripoli Agreement, signed between the Marcos administration and MNLF, which provided for the creation of an autonomous region in Mindanao.\n\u2022 The Final Peace Agreement in 1996 between the Ramos administration and the MNLF, designed to fully implement the Tripoli Agreement and establish the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).\n\u2022 The Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro (FAB), signed between the Aquino administration and the MILF in 2012, where both parties agreed to replace the ARMM with a new political entity called the Bangsamoro.\n\u2022 The Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB), the final political settlement between the government and MILF signed in 2014. With the CAB, the MILF agreed to decommission its fighters, while the Philippine government agreed to the creation of the Bangsamoro, an entity more autonomous than ARMM, through an enabling law called the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL).\n\nMILF and Philippine government peace panels in a meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

(See: Is that so? Duterte unclear on BBL).\n\nBefore being elected president, Duterte during a Feb. 2016 visit to MILF\u2019s Camp Darapanan, said he would push for the passage of the BBL and make the proposed Bangsamoro region a template for a broader plan to shift the country\u2019s system of government to federalism.\n\nDuring his first months in office, and prior to his first state of the nation address (SONA), the president said he would push for the shift to federalism that incorporates provisions of the proposed BBL. If this strategy is rejected, he would move for the passage of the BBL, he said.\n\nYet, in his first SONA, Duterte urged Congress to pass the BBL but take out its contentious and supposedly unconstitutional provisions, and include Misuari in the process. (See Is that so? Duterte unclear on BBL)\n\nOn Nov. 2016, Duterte reconstituted a new transition council, tasked to submit a new draft BBL. The council submitted its draft to Malacanang July 18, barely a week before Duterte\u2019s second SONA, where he made no mention of the BBL. (See Duterte targets CPP-NPA-NDF in his 2nd SONA).\n\nThe BBL is not among the 28 bills included in the list of approved common legislative agenda for the 17th Congress by the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council, as of Aug. 29.\n\nPeace and Development Roadmap of the Duterte Administration", "lang": "en"}
