That is, cards from your favorite Democratic opponents.\n\n\"If I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put T and AX together,\" coos a sweet valentine from Sen. Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"My liberal heart bleeds for you,\" intones Sen. Barack Obama.\n\nSix options await the last-minute shopper \u2014 and you can send it to 10 people at once!\n\nMany can appreciate the messages' snide sentiments, but here's the problem: While most of the Valentines are cute twists on criticisms of the two candidates, one is simply untrue.\n\nIt's a Clinton valentine that reads: \"Roses are red, violets are blue, I'll raise your taxes and there is nothing you can do.\"\n\nPolitiFact checked an earlier claim from the RNC that Clinton's campaign proposals would cost taxpayers more than $777.6-billion. We found that to be Mostly True. And Clinton has said she supports letting the Bush tax cuts of 2001 expire as scheduled in 2010 for people making more than $250,000 a year. Critics point to that as a sign she plans to raise taxes as president.\n\nBut it's the \"there is nothing you can do\" line that draws the Truth-O-Meter's attention.\n\nSince when can a president raise taxes without the approval of Congress? And aren't voters encouraged to speak up about policies they oppose?\n\nWe gave a Pants on Fire ruling to former presidential candidate John Edwards when he claimed king-like powers for the presidency. The RNC now makes a similar claim.\n\nMaybe the RNC should stick to the biting sarcasm of such sentiments as \"On this Valentine's Day ... may higher taxes come your way!\" (a Clinton card offering) or \"Will you be my Valentine? Yes ... no ... present\" (a shot at Obama's voting record in the Illinois state Senate).\n\nOr consider adding fact sheets with footnotes to its Valentines. For this day, it's Pants on Fire wrong.", "lang": "en"}
