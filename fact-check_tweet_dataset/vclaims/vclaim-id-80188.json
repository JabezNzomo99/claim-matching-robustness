The scorecard and a photo of Indian captain Virat Kohli in the posts are misleading, and PTV says the pages are impostor sites.\n\nThe pages, including this one, show parts of a scorecard from a domestic cricket match in England in 2014 when the Wirral Cricket Club was bowled out for three runs.\n\nAn English translation of the Urdu post underneath the scorecard in the pages reads: \u201cUnprecedented match in the history of cricket, the entire team was out for zero. Watch the video.\u201d\n\nNext to the scorecard is a photo of Kohli dressed in his Test uniform and wearing a helmet with his bat handle under his arm, giving the impression he has just been dismissed.\n\nThe reports attracted more than 2,500 reactions on Facebook in the first three days after they were posted in July 2018.\n\nClicking on what is purported to be the video in the posts does not lead viewers to footage of a cricket match, rather a series of advertisements.\n\nThe scorecard shown in the misleading reports shows the top 10 batsmen from the Wirral Cricket Club dismissed for zero, which is accurate.\n\nHowever the portion of the scorecard showing the number 11 batsman scoring one run, and two leg byes, is cropped out.\n\nMajor international media reported on the 2014 match, showing the complete scorecard, including the BBC, Cricket Australia and Sky News.\n\nThe Wirral Cricket Club also posted a humorous tweet about the result at the time.\n\nKohli did not play in that match.\n\nPTV also told AFP on July 14, 2018 the pages that carried the false reports were not run by the broadcaster.\n\n\u201cWe don't have any Facebook page with the name of PTV Cricket,\u201d Aly Naseer, an official from PTV's social media department, told AFP.\n\n\u201cIt is a very big problem for us because we are state broadcasters. If you can help with this, it will be great.\u201d\n\nNaseer said PTV had reported the pages to Facebook.\n\nOther posts on the impostor PTV pages, which claim to have more than 4.1 million followers, similarly use photos of cricket scenes to lure viewers into clicking onto other pages with advertisements.\n\nPTV's official sports page on Facebook is here.", "lang": "en"}
