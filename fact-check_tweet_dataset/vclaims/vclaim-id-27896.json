Another photo superimposed over the gold bars is of President Rodrigo Duterte. Text on the photo reads: \"Marcos gold will save the world!\"\n\nA report about the TRO published by the Philippine Star in 2002 says that Office of the Solicitor General filed a petition with the CA assailing the validity of the Pasay court's ruling and the 3 fake titles that laid claim to the Philippines.\n\n2. Is there a mention of the name Tallano in any documents from the Spanish regime? From the Blair and Robertson collection of documents? 3. Was there a historical document from Spanish period citing Maharlika as a place name in the Philippines?\n\nIn historian William Henry Scott's Looking for the Prehispanic Filipino, published in 1992, he spoke about the 4 societal classes that existed during the pre-colonial era.

Diokno, and if it was such a big case, was there a mention of the Tallanos in any of their writings, speeches, or credible biographies?", "lang": "en"}
