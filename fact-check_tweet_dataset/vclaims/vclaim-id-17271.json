Despite an immediate medical response, EMT\u2019s were unable to revive her. The cause of death is still unknown, however a preliminary autopsy has been confirmed to be underway. First responders told us that they discovered what appeared to be a needle used for drugs, as well as a bag of an ambiguous powdered substance. While no drug use has been substantiated, her mother had previously spoken to the media about Rousey\u2019s previous depression & drug abuse. Rousey\u2019s mother had this to say, \u201cAll of those who have criticized Ronda for taking a loss so to heart, for not just \u2018shrugging it off\u2019 don\u2019t understand that what made Ronda so successful is that she cares DEEPLY about winning to an extent that I don\u2019t believe the average person can wrap his/her head around.\u201d After her last fight, where she lost to Amanda Nunes in less than one minute, Rousey went silent \u2014 no one has heard a thing from her on social media, or from interviews. Her whereabouts and status were completely unknown to the public until this tragic happening was uncovered by two police officers discovered her body on a wellness check.\n\nHowever, the report that Ronda Rousey was found dead on 2 January 2017 was merely fake news that appeared solely on the fly-by-night \u201cUSA Today News\u201d web site and was reported neither by the legitimate USA Today news outlet nor any other credible source.\n\n\u201cUSA Today News\u201d in no way resembles the actual USA Today web site:\n\nThe \u201cUSA Today News\u201d article included an image of a large law enforcement presence in a residential neighborhood, a picture that appeared to come from a blog devoted to the television show House and did not depict any real event involving Ronda Rousey.", "lang": "en"}
