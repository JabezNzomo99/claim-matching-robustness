The dispatcher then tells Chloe \u201cto keep driving, remain calm and that he has \u201cback-up already on the way\u201d.\n\nThe story concludes with four police cars surround Chloe\u2019s car and the unmarked car. When police grab the occupant of the unmarked car he is revealed to be \u201ca convicted rapist and wanted for other crimes\u201d.\n\nThe post states \u201cApparently police have to respect your right to keep going to a \u2018safe\u2019 place. You obviously need to make some signals that you acknowledge them\u201d.\n\nThe post finally claims: \u201cLet your friends know about 112 (112 is an emergency number on your mobile that takes you straight to the police because 000 does not work if you have no signal).\u201d\n\nThe May 5 Facebook post has been shared over 19,000 times, attracted over 3,500 comments and been viewed over 2.1m times.\n\nThe post claims \u201cChloe\u201d was \u201cdriving to visit a friend at Southport\u201d, which is on Queensland\u2019s Gold Coast, from Toombul, a suburb of the Queensland capital Brisbane.\n\nThe Queensland Police Service (QPS) told AAP FactCheck the Queensland the story in the May 5 Facebook post is a hoax which has been repeated in various forms on the internet.\n\n\u201cWe have had enquiries relating to the story from back in 2015,\u201d the QPS spokesperson said in response to an email inquiry.\n\nAAP FactCheck has found other versions of the story circulating in the early to mid-2000s. US fact-checkers Snopes investigated a similar story about \u201cLauren\u201d from Virginia in the United States. The article also mentions a version of the story which was translated into an Australian setting.\n\nThe QPS spokesperson told AAP FactCheck that \u201cany motorist who believes an unmarked vehicle attempting to intercept them is not a police vehicle is urged to phone Policelink on 131 444 or if they fear for their safety, they should call Triple Zero (000)\u201d.\n\nThe May 5 post also claims that the \u201c112\u201d number dialled by Chloe goes \u201cstraight to the police, because 000 does not work if you have no signal\u201d.\n\nAustralia\u2019s emergency numbers are managed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). An ACMA spokesperson told AAP FactCheck in an email that both \u201c000\u201d and \u201c112\u201d work as emergency numbers provided the caller is an area that has some network coverage, even if the coverage is not from the caller\u2019s service provider.\n\n\u201cYour call to 000 or 112 will be carried on any other available mobile network that has coverage for your location,\u201d the ACMA spokesperson said.\n\nIf there is no network coverage it is not possible to place an emergency call. \u201cThe coverage is the critical thing \u2014 if there\u2019s no coverage, then no mobile will work,\u201d Chris Althaus from the Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association told the ABC in 2017.\n\n112 is the international standard emergency number, according to the Department of Transport, Regional Development and Communications. Calls made to 000 or 112 are both handled by Telstra operators, who connect you with your requested emergency service, the ACMA spokesperson told AAP FactCheck.\n\nThe post also states: \u201cPolice have to respect your right to keep going to a \u2018safe\u2019 place. You obviously need to make some signals that you acknowledge them.\u201d\n\nIn response to the claim QPS told AAP FactCheck that if motorists find themselves in a similar situation to the story in the May 5 Facebook post they should:\n\u2022 Stop at a place they feel safe, such as a well-lit area or an area with other people\n\u2022 Keep their doors locked and windows closed\n\u2022 Request to see the person\u2019s police identification; and\n\u2022 Advise the person they are calling police to verify their identity.", "lang": "en"}
