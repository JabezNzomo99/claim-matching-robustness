In fact, we found that there was only one person who ever quoted Bush as saying this \u2014 and that was Sherrod Brown. His language was inconsistent on the number of jobs, and whether he was talking about trade deficits or surpluses. But it was certainly a favorite talking point.\n\nApril 29, 2009: \u201cThe first President Bush said a billion dollar trade surplus or a billion dollar trade deficit translates into some 13,000 jobs gained or lost. A $1 billion trade surplus means you are manufacturing and selling $1 billion more out of the country than you are importing. That is a 13,000 job gain. A $1 billion trade deficit is the reverse, is a 13,000 job loss. That is according to President Bush the first. So you can do the math.\u201d\n\nBut note that these figures are about exports, not trade surpluses. Some economists will say that $1 billion in imports will result in a similar number of lost jobs, but again one cannot easily apply that metric to trade deficits. A nation might import products that it does not produce, so it\u2019s unclear how that directly leads to job losses. (The Fact Checker is wary of most political claims about jobs gains and losses from trade deals; it is best to assume, as most economists do, that trade changes the types of jobs in an economy, not necessarily the overall number. We obviously have no opinion on the TPP.)\n\nBaker is one of the most authoritative critics of free-trade agreements, but again, this is not what Brown quoted Bush as saying. Moreover, Baker goes on to say that this is a rather simplistic view of trade. \u201cMore honest and knowledgeable individuals don\u2019t rely on this exports create jobs line to make the case for expanding trade,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe more serious argument relies on either an economies of scale view, that by expanding the size of the market production costs fall, or the traditional comparative advantage view, that nations can gain by specializing in the goods they produce best.\u201d\n\nThen Petri came back and noted that Brown, in his 1994 book, had cited the book \u201cNAFTA: An Assessment,\u201d by Gary C. Hufbauer and Jeffrey J. Schott, as a source for the 13,000 statistic. We could not find that figure in the book, but we did find that this book predicted that NAFTA would create 316,000 jobs and lose (\u201cdislocate\u201d) 145,000 jobs, for a net gain of 171,000 jobs. This is a good example of how many trade economists believe that with trade deficits and surpluses, there is not a simple 1:1 ratio of jobs lost and gained. (Hufbauer later repudiated the 171,000 prediction, saying the practical result of NAFTA was zero jobs.)\n\nAgain, this is about exports, not trade surpluses. By Bush\u2019s math, there was a gain of $15 billion in exports \u2014 and yet there was still a trade deficit. If you used Brown\u2019s rhetoric about trade deficits, he appears to think Bush was suggesting that a $3.1 billion decline in the trade deficit resulted in 300,000 jobs \u2014 or nearly 100,000 per $1 billion. Of course, that would be absurd.\n\nEconomists can argue forever about the impact of trade deals; certainly economists agree that trade deficits can result in a loss of jobs. But it is pretty clear here that Brown for years has placed words in Bush\u2019s mouth. Moreover, for a self-proclaimed expert on trade, he doesn\u2019t seem to know the difference between exports and trade surpluses.\n\nThis is an excellent example of how Washington politicians live in their own invented reality, with a self-perpetuating feedback loop. Even if Brown had quoted Bush accurately on exports, rather than trade surpluses, the numbers would have been woefully out of date. Given that Bush was president about a quarter-century ago, you\u2019d think Brown would have checked to see if the ratio of jobs to exports had remained the same. You can\u2019t \u201cdo the math\u201d with ancient information.", "lang": "en"}
