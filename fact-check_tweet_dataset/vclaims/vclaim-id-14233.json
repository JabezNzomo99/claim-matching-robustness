And if you\u2019re Rep.", "author": "www.politifact.com", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-14233", "url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/mar/26/mark-walker/fact-checking-mark-walker-hr-1s-campaign-finance-p/", "vclaim": "If you\u2019re a voter in the United States, you\u2019ve probably seen your fair share of political ads on TV. And if you\u2019re Rep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., you\u2019ve apparently seen enough of them.\n\nA sarcastic new ad video Walker put out this month pokes fun at political campaign ads \u2014 and House Democrats\u2019 plan to help finance them.\n\nThe video shows an actor who, playing the role of a politician, is seen woodworking by a river. \"Hey there,\" the actor says. \"I\u2019m a politician, attempting to do human things so that I look relatable.\"\n\nThe ad targets HR 1, the sweeping election-law bill House Democrats passed March 8. Walker, who represents North Carolina\u2019s 6th Congressional District, posted it to YouTube March 7 and shared it the following day via Twitter and a press release.\n\n\"This week, House Democrats will pass HR 1,\" the actor in the ad says. \"They\u2019re calling it the \u2018For the People Act,\u2019 but really, it\u2019s for my campaign consultants.\"\n\n\"HR 1 is going to take your hard-earned tax dollars and millions more and send them to my campaign so I can put ads on TV,\" he continues.\n\nPolitiFact North Carolina found the ad funny, but also interesting. We decided to check its claims against the text of the bill, which is meant to overhaul the laws surrounding money in politics but is expected to die in the Senate.\n\nOur finding: Despite what Walker\u2019s ad says, the public-financing program put in place by HR 1 would not depend on tax dollars, and not all candidates would qualify to benefit from it.\n\nWhat HR 1 says about public funding for campaigns\n\nOne goal of HR 1 is to minimize the influence big donors and super PACs wield over elections.\n\nHR 1 would provide a 6-to-1 match for small-dollar donations and create a pilot program in three states to provide $25 vouchers for eligible voters to give money to candidates for Congress.\n\nWalker\u2019s ad gives the impression that anybody running for federal office would stand to benefit from these provisions, but that\u2019s not actually the case.\n\nFor starters, the 6-to-1 ratio would only apply to donations of $200 or less, including those made via the voucher program.\n\nNot all candidates would be allowed to receive matched donations, either. To be eligible, they would have to raise $50,000 in small-dollar donations from at least 1,000 individuals during the qualifying period, and they would have to agree to accept no contributions larger than $1,000.\n\nRay La Raja, professor of political science and an expert in campaign finance at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, said the eligibility requirements would make the matching program attractive to some candidates more than others.\n\n\"My hunch is that many Democrats would participate under the reform, but probably not those who expect highly competitive elections,\" he said. \"They would not want to risk coming up short of money for the campaign.\"\n\n\"Additionally, candidates who have ideological followings will likely benefit from this program,\" he added. \"Ideological candidates tend to draw more small donors.\"\n\nWalker\u2019s ad suggests that these programs \u2014 and the ads they could help finance \u2014 would be paid for using taxpayer money. As the bill is currently formatted, that\u2019s not the case.\n\nThe money would actually come from a new \"Freedom From Influence Fund\" under the U.S. Treasury, which would collect funds from a 2.75 percent fee assessed on criminal and civil fines and penalties or settlements with banks and corporations that commit corporate malfeasance.\n\nMichael Malbin, executive director of the Campaign Finance Institute, a nonprofit think tank for campaign-finance research, said money coming from the fees would not be taxpayer money.\n\n\"Anything that\u2019s funded by penalties is not being funded by taxpayers,\" he said.\n\nRick Hasen, professor of law and politics at the University of California, Irvine, took a less certain position. \"I think it is debatable whether it is still fair to call it \u2018tax dollars\u2019 being used to pay for the ads,\" he said, adding that the funds will enter into the \"public fisc\" with taxpayer money even though they are \"not from a direct tax.\"\n\nIn any case, Walker spokesman Jack Minor said the fees were not part of the version of HR 1 that was introduced to the House Jan. 3 or the version reported from the Committee on House Administration on March 4.\n\n\"Congressman Walker is a member of the House Administration Committee,\" Minor said. \"The bill that passed through there \u2026 there was no discernable funding structure.\"\n\nThe fees were added by an amendment during a Rules Committee debate on March 5, after the Congressional Budget Office had estimated the bill\u2019s costs. Earlier versions of the bill did not make it clear where the Freedom From Influence Fund was supposed to get most of its money.\n\nBut the funding mechanism was in place before Walker circulated his ad online.\n\nMinor said problems could arise when moving the fee money to the Freedom From Influence Fund. \"This money would go to the Treasury\u2019s General Fund where it would be intermingled with all taxpayer money as public funds,\" he said. \"Later, an equal amount would be transferred from the Treasury\u2019s General Fund to the Freedom From Influence Fund.\"\n\nNoting that the CBO estimated very high costs for the bill\u2019s provisions, Minor also said the money from fees would not be enough to pay for the donation-matching and vouchers.\n\n\"The federal government taking money from an American citizen is a tax,\" he said. \"And when Congress irresponsibly creates new pools of money that will inevitably fall short of adequate funding levels, Congress must take money from taxpayers to pay for the shortfall.\"\n\nBut the bill explicitly states that no money would be drawn from outside the Freedom From Influence Fund, and that the payments used for vouchers and grants would be reduced if there was not enough money in the fund.\n\n\"In any case in which the Commission determines that there are insufficient moneys in the Fund to make payments to participating candidates under this title, moneys shall not be made available from any other source for the purpose of making such payments,\" the bill says.\n\nIf HR 1 were to become law, future legislation could still change the funding mechanism to one based on tax dollars. A similar program for judicial candidates in North Carolina \u2014 which was repealed in 2013 \u2014 got half of its money from a $3 voluntary check-off on the state tax form, according to a summary of the program from Democracy North Carolina, an advocacy group focused on voter participation and money in politics. So it would not be unusual to see taxes come into play.\n\nBut the version of HR 1 that passed takes specific steps to avoid dipping into taxpayer money.\n\nWalker\u2019s ad said, \"HR 1 is going to take your hard-earned tax dollars and millions more and send them to (a candidate\u2019s) campaign so (he) can put ads on TV.\"\n\nThe video glosses over some key details about HR 1 to leave a misleading impression.\n\nFirst, the bill\u2019s public-financing options would not be available to all candidates, generally speaking. To be eligible, candidates would have to satisfy certain threshold requirements and refuse to accept individual contributions of more than $1,000.\n\nSecond, as the bill is currently structured, the program would get money from a 2.75 percent fee on people and corporations that commit malfeasance \u2014 not from a broad pool of tax dollars.\n\nThe ad contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. So we rate it Mostly False.\n\nThis story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab and PolitiFact.
