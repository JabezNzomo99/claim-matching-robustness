It was actually written by another Facebook user with the same name.\n\nTennis star Serena Williams has not been afraid to voice her opinions both on and off the court.\n\nWilliams has spoken out about sexism in the professional tennis industry, and the gender and racial pay gap. She has been a longtime supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, writing in a 2015 Wired article, \u201cTo those of you involved in equality movements like Black Lives Matter, I say this: Keep it up.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, she published a story in Harper\u2019s Bazaar about her controversial loss in the 2018 singles Grand Slam tournament, where she was charged with the code violation of \u201cverbal abuse\u201d after calling the referee \u201ca thief.\u201d Williams wrote, \u201cEver since I was a little girl, I\u2019ve felt a need to voice my opinion and be heard.\u201d\n\nBut a screenshot of a widely shared Facebook post that expresses frustration with current health, social and political issues is falsely attributed to the tennis icon.\n\nThe screenshot reads: \u201cI\u2019m sick of COVID-19. I\u2019m sick of black vs. white. I\u2019m sick of Democrats vs. Republicans. I\u2019m sick of Christians vs. atheists. I\u2019m sick of no one being allowed to think what they want & feel what they do without offending someone.\u201d It urges readers to \u201cstop thrusting your beliefs on others\u201d and claims that \u201cif you can\u2019t handle the fact that you may have a friend that has opposing views of you, then you are not any better than the bigots and the racists.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet that has been shared over 6,000 times, one Twitter user wrote: \u201cThey should give Serena Williams credit for winning another grand slam for this post.\u201d\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t have said it better myself!\u201d wrote NBA player Rudy Gobert, tagging the Twitter account of the 23-time Grand Slam singles winner in a mistaken tweet that has since been deleted.\n\nThese posts attached the screenshot of the Facebook post by user Serena Williams. But it appears to be a case of mistaken identity. The post originated from the account of a different Facebook user also named Serena Williams \u2014 not the account of the American tennis star.\n\nIn fact, the Facebook bio of the original poster reads, \u201cNope, not THAT Serena Williams.\u201d The popular post appears on this person\u2019s Facebook page, dated June 14.\n\nThis is not the first time a social media post written by a user with the same name as a public figure has sparked confusion. In September, we wrote about a viral rant that was falsely attributed to the actor and comedian Tim Allen after it was shared by another Facebook user who goes by the same name.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
