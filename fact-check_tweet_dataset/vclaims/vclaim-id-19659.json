Russian opposition figure Mikhail Khodorkovsky later confirmed that the three journalists had been working for one of his projects, the Center for Investigation, on a probe into the activities of a so-called \u201cprivate military company\u201d called Wagner or the Wagner Group. That company has previously been involved in the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria.\n\nOn August 1, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova posted a statement on Facebook in which she dismissed talk about a \u201cPMC\u201d (private military company) and claimed that her ministry had been completely open about Russian government involvement in the CAR. She linked to a Foreign Ministry statement that mentioned Russian military and civilian cooperation with the country\u2019s government. However, neither Zakharova nor the statement she provided mentions anything about Wagner or private military companies. In fact, private military companies are still not legal under Russian law, so the confirmed involvement of Wagner in the CAR raises many questions.\n\nZakharova\u2019s Facebook post also contained a questionable claim about the slain journalists.\n\n\u201cWhat they were actually doing in the CAR, what were their goals and objectives were, remains an open question,\u201d she wrote.\n\nHowever, that question had already been answered the day before, both by the journalists\u2019 colleagues and their employer: they were investigating the presence and activity of Wagner in CAR.\n\nThis past February, Wagner became the focus of international media attention when mercenaries it employed were soundly defeated in a clash with U.S. military forces and their local allies in Syria. In February, Polygraph.info conducted a fact check of Zakharova\u2019s denial of Russian involvement in the battle, pointing to a series of such denials. Polygraph.info also tackled Russian denials about Wagner\u2019s apparent ties to the Russian military.\n\nIf Russia is suppling CAR with small arms and instructors, as Zakharova\u2019s statement indicates, the Russian government is also clear about its own aims. Following an October meeting between Foreign Minster Sergey Lavrov and President Faustin-Archange Touadera of the Central Africa Republic, the foreign ministry stated the leaders reaffirmed \u201cpractical cooperation\u201d in a number of areas, pointing to \u201cmineral resource exploration.\"\n\nA thread from the Conflict Intelligence Team about the killing and Russian involvement in the Central African Republic\n\nAs to Wagner\u2019s presence, cooperation between the government and private military companies \u201crepresents the new Russian \u2018hybrid approach,\u2019\u201d Kiril Avramov of the University of Texas Intelligence Studies Project tells Polygraph.info. He describes the \"hybrid model, \u201cwhere one does not know where the state ends and private interest begins.\u201d\n\nSergey Sukhankin, a fellow at the Jamestown Foundation in Washington, DC says another company, PMC Patriot, is also said to be operating in the area.\n\n\u201cThe Wagner group is said to be in charge of military operations, while the Patriot group is in charge of protection of VIPs,\" Sukhanin tells Polygraph.info, though he says the Russian government will not acknowledge their presence because they\u2019re \u201cillegal\u201d under Russian law and operating as a mercenary is a crime.\n\nWhile no motive for the killing has been confirmed and the area where the journalists\u2019 vehicle was ambushed is known for armed attacks along the highway, the killing has aroused suspicion due to Wagner\u2019s involvement in the region. In April, a Russian reporter who had covered the company\u2019s involvement in Syria died after allegedly falling off his apartment balcony or out of his window. A number of other opposition and media figures have also died in this same manner over the years. Some of these deaths have been ruled accidental, though they were not criminally investigated.\n\n\u201cWe have had cases in which suspects managed to jump out of completely sealed, barred windows, and even cases in which the suspects suffered multiple lethal injuries from falling out of first floor windows,\u201d a Russian investigative journalist said on the topic. That comment was made by Orkhan Jemal, one of the three journalists killed in CAR on July 31.", "lang": "en"}
