The interviews were conducted between April 10 and April 28, just as many people were first experiencing health care under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWe have no issue with the survey methodology, which was based on online panel that was recruited offline through probability methods, in that every non-institutionalized American had some chance of being selected. (Our colleague, polling analyst Scott Clement, vetted the survey for The Fact Checker.) The survey itself is very interesting, providing a ground level look at how people feel about getting health insurance.\n\nThe 4x number is misleading, in that, in question 53, just 41 percent who enrolled are either very happy (20 percent) or somewhat happy (21 percent) with their coverage. The 4x statistic is derived by combining somewhat unhappy (7 percent) and very unhappy (4 percent) and then comparing 11 percent against 41 percent.\n\n\u201cAs we note in the survey report, it\u2019s true that 31 percent said it was too soon to tell whether or not they were happy with their coverage; that means the numbers may change over time, but the data we have is easily robust enough to indicate how people currently feel about their coverage,\u201d said Justin Nisly, Enroll America\u2019s spokesman. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t include every bit of data in the infographic, but what we did include is entirely accurate, and the full context is readily available.\u201d\n\nThe statistic that 7 out of 10 are confident they can make their payment appears okay. In question 45, 74 percent said they were very confident or somewhat confident they could make their payments. But one of four were not confident.\n\nThe phrasing of the next element, \u201crelieved,\u201d also veers into misleading. Calling it \u201cthe word that came to mind the most\u201d implies respondents were asked to come up with their own word. Instead, \u201crelieved\u201d was one among a choice of four words in question 54, including \u201cconfused,\u201d financially stressed,\u201d \u201cin control,\u201d and \u201cit doesn\u2019t really affect me.\u201d\n\nIn other words, \u201crelieved\u201d was one of four words that people could choose from, but it was not \u201cthe word that came to mind the most.\u201d In fact, relieved was chosen by 47 percent, so it was not even the majority choice.\n\n\u201cWhen offered a range of positive, negative, and neutral phrases to describe their feelings about having health insurance, 47 percent chose \u2018relieved\u2019 \u2013 the next most chosen phrase had just 17 percent, so I think it is entirely accurate to say that the word that best described the way consumers feel about their coverage is \u2018relieved,\u2019\u201d Nisley said. \u201cI guess you could quibble with using \u2018came to mind\u2019 to describe a question that offered various options, but I don\u2019t think that changes the basic point that a majority of respondents chose positive words to describe \u2018what it feels like to have health insurance.\u2019\u201d\n\nFinally, question 49 did ask enrollees whether their plan had enough doctors, and 56 percent said yes. But the very next question asks whether a person had tried to see a doctor yet, and 61 percent said no. And 63 percent said they had not tried to get prescriptions yet. And nearly half\u201449 percent\u2014said they had not yet tried to use their insurance yet.\n\n\u201cWe released a full report\u200b on the survey a week before this infographic, and it covers all of the data in detail, both positive and negative (for instance, reasons people chose not to enroll),\u201d Nisly said. \u201cThe infographic was a way to draw attention to a particular section of the survey and encourage folks to read the whole thing, not a substitute for the survey itself, which we\u2019ve shared quite freely.\u201d\n\nWe realize an infographic has to condense information, but there is a high burden to meet for one designed to be tweeted. In this case, Enroll America grabbed the statistics that cast the Affordable Care Act in the best possible light, even though a huge percentage of the respondents had barely a chance to experience the system and form opinions about it. We highly doubt many people actually read the report before they retweeted the graphic.", "lang": "en"}
