(\n\nEkiti had highest rate in region, not lowest\n\nThe data shows 219,766 pupils were enrolled in primary schools in the state in 2018 but only 191,625 were between age 6 and 11. In that year, the state had an estimated population of 300,111 children between ages 6 and 11.\n\nThis means the state\u2019s net enrolment rate in 2018\n\n, the highest in the South West region. Ondo state had a 62.7% net enrolment rate, Oyo state 62.1% and Ogun state 61.2%. The economic capital Lagos reported 58.8% and Osun state 56.9%.\n\nFor net enrolment rate at junior secondary school level, Ekiti was third\n\n, behind Ondo\u2019s 49.4% and Ogun\u2019s 44.7% in 2018.\n\nThis means that contrary to Fayemi\u2019s claim, Ekiti was not \u201cthe least in the South West\u201d for school enrolment in 2018, at\n\nOgunwale also told Africa Check that enrolment may not translate to attendance.\n\n\u201cWhile enrolment is about the number of pupils registered in school in a given academic year, attendance is about how many of the enrolled pupils actually attend classes,\u201d he said.\n\nFayemi has not responded to our enquiry about what the school enrolment was before the more than 75% he claims to have raised it to. Official data shows it was\n\nas 55% as of January 2019, four months after he took office.
