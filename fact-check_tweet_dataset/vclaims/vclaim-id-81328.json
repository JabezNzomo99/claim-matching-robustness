But readers of The Fact Checker also asked us to take a look, so we did. Cruz, as the first official presidential candidate, has received a lot of attention for his remarks. And global warming likely will be a topic of interest as the election season gears up.\n\nAfter initial criticism of his interview, Cruz seemed to back away a bit from his comment about \u201czero\u201d and \u201cno recorded\u201d global warming. In a March 24, 2015, interview with Texas Tribune, Cruz changed the statement to \u201cno significant warming\u201d: \u201cI\u2019m a big believer that we should follow the science, and follow the evidence. If you look at global warming alarmists, they don\u2019t like to look at the actual facts and the data. The satellite data demonstrate that there has been no significant warming whatsoever for 17 years.\u201d\n\nFirst, the reference to satellite data comes from these two analyses of global temperatures. The tables show that temperature levels have not reached the peak warm level in 1998. This is usually the starting point for skeptics who argue there has been no global warming in recent years; that year was particularly warm, due to an El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern.\n\nThe bottom graph is the relevant one here. The red and blue lines are two versions of satellite data. The black line is the weather balloon data. The green line is the actual surface level data. From 1998 to 2012, the last year in that data set, the red satellite data found a decrease in temperatures, at -0.043 degrees centigrade per decade. The rest found modest growth, ranging from 0.061 degrees to 0.072 degrees centigrade per decade.\n\nThere are many ways to measure global temperature. This study by Berkeley Earth, an independent nonprofit that studies land temperature data for climate science, looked at the various measures to understand this \u201cpause\u201d in global warming. Land/ocean temperatures (which is land temperature stations with sea surface data from ships and buoys) showed flat temperatures since 2001, though a long-term increase since 1970. Looking only at land temperatures, there was an increase since 2001. Ocean temperatures cooled slightly, and other measures still showed some increase in temperatures since 2001.\n\nOne of the main theories for this \u201cpause\u201d in global warming is that the oceans are in a decades-long heating and cooling variation. The pause does not prove a reduction in total energy received by the planet, according to the U.K. Met Office. Rather, some researchers say it has been affected by the ocean heat content.\n\nMichael Mann, Penn State meteorology professor who also published a paper in the journal Science about the effect of ocean heating and cooling on recent warming levels, said 17 years is a short period for evaluating global temperature trends. Based on the historical pattern of oscillations in ocean temperatures, the Pacific Ocean trend is close to \u201cbottoming out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is current as low as it\u2019s been for the past century, so we expect that it will return to more neutral and then positive values as the cycle continues,\u201d he said.\n\nNovack said such explanations of current global warming trends goes directly to Cruz\u2019s point that major policy decisions should not be made on scientific theories that are based on flawed models. They should be based on data, and the temperature plateau shows the models that previously were used projecting continued rise were incorrect, Novack said. Cruz is not denying temperatures are warmer now than they were 50 years ago, Novack said, noting that Cruz voted for an amendment in January stating climate change is real.\n\nCruz\u2019s claims that there has been \u201czero warming\u201d or \u201cno recorded warming\u201d since 1998 is not correct. Cruz may be able to make such statements based on particular measurements, but the range of data that are used to record global temperatures do not support that claim and show there have been slight increases in global temperatures since then. His subsequent comment that there has not been significant warming since 1998 is more on point, and researchers largely agree that the rate of global warming has slowed down in recent years.\n\nThe notion that concerns over global warming is no longer backed by science is not an accurate portrayal of the issue. Even the non-satellite data that Cruz\u2019s spokesman provided show that temperature levels have risen in the past 15 years, just not at the level of 1998 temperatures, which was an anomaly because of the strong El Ni\u00f1o. It is a highly misleading statement to the average viewer or reader, because of the starting point of Cruz\u2019s calculation. And to place the context of global temperatures in 15- or 17-year increments doesn\u2019t mean much in a debate where a decade or two are short periods of time.", "lang": "en"}
