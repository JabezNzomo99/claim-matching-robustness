And, please, follow theorfor guidance on protecting your community from the disease.\n\nIn early July 2020, the California Department of Public Health issued industry guidance for places of worship operating during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic in light of a dramatic spike in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations.\n\nAmong several suggestions for how places of worship can encourage safer social distancing, an early version of the guidance stated that religious sites must \u201cdiscontinue singing and chanting activities.\u201d A subsequent version dated July 6 specified that indoor singing should be discontinued.\n\nThe reasoning given by the state\u2019s public health department for the new guidance was as follows:\n\nEven with adherence to physical distancing, convening in a congregational setting of multiple different households to practice a personal faith carries a relatively higher risk for widespread transmission of the COVID-19 virus, and may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities such as singing and chanting negate the risk reduction achieved through six feet of physical distancing.\n\nA notable example of a \u201csuper-spreading event\u201d of COVID-19 occurred at a church choir rehearsal in Washington state, where 60 singers convened in Skagit County on March 10. Of those, 45 became ill with the virus and two died, despite attendees\u2019 best efforts to remain socially distant from each other. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \u201cThe act of singing, itself, might have contributed to transmission through emission of aerosols, which is affected by loudness of vocalization.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has become a political wedge issue in the the country\u2019s ongoing culture wars. Right-leaning media outlets seized on these new guidelines, writing headlines like, \u201cOutrage after California bans singing in churches amid coronavirus pandemic,\u201d and also, \u201cCalifornia\u2019s Governor Forbids Christians From Singing in Church Houses.\u201d\n\nThe state has no penalty for violating this guidance, so suggesting the state \u201cforbids\u201d any group from singing is an exaggeration. A spokesperson for the California Department of Public Health told us in an email, \u201cCalifornians are being encouraged to be responsible as the guidance is used to educate the public without the threat of fines and citations as the first course of action.\u201d\n\nAlso, the guidance doesn\u2019t apply to Christian churches alone, it applies to all \u201cplaces of worship and providers of religious services and cultural ceremonies,\u201d meaning any faith or cultural institution is equally affected.\n\nNevertheless, headlines that highlighted the fact that Christian church congregations would be affected prompted a spate of internet outrage and misleading claims that Christians were being unfairly singled out. For example:\n\nPer the Los Angeles Times, the Independence Day holiday \u201cmarked the 15th consecutive day that California tallied record hospitalization numbers of confirmed coronavirus patients. On Saturday, the state recorded 5,669 patients with confirmed coronavirus infections in California hospitals \u2014 an increase of 62% over the previous two weeks.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
