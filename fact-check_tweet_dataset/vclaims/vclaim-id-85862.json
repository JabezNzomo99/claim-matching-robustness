Both Republicans and Democrats have echoed similar concerns in the past over the tax and its potential impact on jobs and innovation. Repealing the tax likely will be a priority for the incoming GOP-controlled Congress, which means these claims also are likely to get louder and more repetitive.\n\nIndeed, in March 2013, the Senate approved a bipartisan amendment to the nonbinding 2014 budget blueprint that called for a repeal of the tax. It passed 79-20, with 33 Democrats supporting the repeal. The tax became a bargaining tool during negotiations over the government shutdown in 2013. The House voted to repeal it 248-174, with 17 Democrats joining the majority. In September 2014, the House again voted to repeal the tax as a part of the Jobs for America Act.\n\nWe\u2019re not privy to all of the factors driving each company\u2019s business decision, and can\u2019t prove whether the tax was the sole reason for a company to expand internationally. However, there are other valid reasons for investing overseas. U.S.-based medical device companies have either planned or begun international expansions, especially in China and Brazil, since at least 2008. American firms have faced pricing pressures, decline in reimbursements and increased regulations in recent years. Emerging competition from international markets, coupled with less income tax restrictions and regulation, make it attractive for U.S. companies to branch out.\n\nAn industry report by Ernst & Young found Western companies also stand to gain skills by investing in the Chinese market, in particular. Multinational companies can learn from the agility Chinese engineers have had to keep up with changing policies in their country, which \u201cwill also add value in their home markets, where health reform and commoditization are now facts of life,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cThere is more than enough proof that his quote was completely accurate. In fact, I\u2019m sure a tape will probably surface soon with Professor Gruber making the same case,\u201d spokeswoman Emily Schillinger wrote in an e-mail, pointing to news articles announcing companies\u2019 decisions to restructure internationally and cut back on research funding due to the tax. (Jonathan Gruber is an MIT professor who has made controversial remarks about the Affordable Care Act.)\n\nLastly, the actual collection from this tax has been lower than estimated. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found the number of tax filings and the amount of revenue associated with this tax was lower than expected during the first two quarters after the tax took effect. So at least in the first two quarters, the tax did not create the anticipated impact on the industry, calling into question some of the estimates that have been touted.", "lang": "en"}
