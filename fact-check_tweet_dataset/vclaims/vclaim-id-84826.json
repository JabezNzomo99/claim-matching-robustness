The debate has been further complicated by the fact that Sanders has given confusing statements as to whether Sandy Hook families have the right to sue the manufacturer.\n\nDaily News: There\u2019s a case currently waiting to be ruled on in Connecticut. The victims of the Sandy Hook massacre are looking to have the right to sue for damages the manufacturers of the weapons. Do you think that that is something that should be expanded? Sanders: Do I think the victims of a crime with a gun should be able to sue the manufacturer, is that your question?\n\nOf course they have the right to sue. Anybody has the right to sue. And they just won an initial decision in their favor last week. But if you go into that discussion a little bit longer, do I end up believing that, if a gun store owner, a small gun store owner in rural Vermont or anyplace else, sells you a weapon legally, you come in with all the proper identification, you pass the instant background check, you legally purchase the gun, and you go out and you shoot somebody, that that small gun store owner should be held liable? No, I don\u2019t. I really don\u2019t. But I have got to tell you also, on this issue of these assault weapons, let\u2019s be clear. \u2026 Those weapons should not be made available in the United States of America. So, in that sense, I agree with the Sandy Hook parents. But it\u2019s a question of how you go forward.\n\nIt\u2019s a difficult argument to make for several reasons. For one, plaintiffs are trying to sue the manufacturer over the legal sale of a gun that did what it was supposed to do (shoot many bullets rapidly). The negligent entrustment exception applies when the seller knew that \u201cthe person to whom the product is supplied\u201d (i.e., Lanza\u2019s mother) would cause harm. Further, large-capacity magazines aren\u2019t just limited to AR-15-type rifles and such rifles aren\u2019t the only guns used in mass shootings like Sandy Hook.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons why the PLCAA is seen as such an obstacle,\u201d Vernick said. \u201cIt prevents you from even going far enough to start the discovery process to get your day in court. Without the PLCAA, it might still be hard to win some of the cases, but at least you get a chance. And we\u2019ll see what happens with the Sandy Hook case.\u201d\n\nClinton criticized Sanders\u2019s answer during the Daily News interview, during which he said he does not believe \u201cvictims of a crime with a gun should be able to sue the manufacturer.\u201d He has since revised that answer, saying he agrees with the families that assault weapons (similar to the AR-15) should not be made available. Still, he says he believes gun shop owners who legally sell guns should not be held liable for a crime by a third party. But that\u2019s not the question in the Sandy Hook case; the lawsuit is against the gun manufacturer for allowing the sale of AR-15 in the civilian market.", "lang": "en"}
