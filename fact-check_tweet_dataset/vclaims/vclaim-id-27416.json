The Tumblr account links to a post on another website, which refers to a \u201c22nd Circuit Court of Appeals Justice\u201d named \u201cHansam al Alallawalahi-Smith.\u201d But neither the court nor the judge exist.\n\nWe\u2019ve written about many hoaxes stemming from America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, which employs a network of different websites and publishes content that can mislead social media users. While the websites include satirical labels \u2014 for those who click beyond the headline \u2014 other websites, as in this case, often republish the stories without any such disclaimers. We\u2019ve previously debunked similar stories from America\u2019s Last Line of Defense that also claimed that Trump had fired made-up Muslim judges.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, while presidents nominate federal judges and the Senate confirms nominees, the power to remove a federal judge is held only by Congress. Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution says federal judges \u201cshall hold their offices during good behaviour,\u201d which \u201chas been interpreted to mean that the only way federal judges can be removed from office is if the House of Representatives impeaches them, and the Senate convicts them, of \u2018treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,'\u201d as the National Constitution Center explains on its website.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
