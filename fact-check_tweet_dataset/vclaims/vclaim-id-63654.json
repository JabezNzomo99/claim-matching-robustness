Through this article lets fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Picture showing the struggle of a mother and child during the floods in Bihar. Fact: This image was captured on 25 September 2011, when an Indian woman carried her injured son through flood waters at Pahanga village in Orissa\u2019s Jajpur district. The image has nothing to do with the recent Bihar floods.

The credits of the image has been given to \u2018AP Photo\u2019.\n\nWhen searched on the Associated Press stock images website with the relevant keywords, we found the same image on the website stating that the image was captured on 25 September 2011, during the floods at Pahanga village in Orissa\u2019s Jajpur district.\n\nTo sum it up, 2011 image captured during the floods at Pahanga village in Orissa\u2019s Jajpur district is falsely shared as that from the recent floods in Bihar.\n\nThis article was updated to include the the image details from the Associated Press stock images website.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
