Chuck Fleischmann, R-Tenn. On the evening of Dec. 12, Fleischmann (or a member of his team) posted the photograph to both his Twitter and Facebook accounts:\n\nThe photograph appears to have been snapped at the White House Congressional Ball, which took place on the evening of Dec. 12, as we could find no earlier instance of the photograph other than those posted online by Fleischmann on that date. The image appears to be authentic, since Fleischmann is a strong supporter of Trump\u2019s, and it seems unlikely he would arrange for the image to be digitally altered before publication so as to create the false appearance of a non-existent skin tone demarcation on the president\u2019s face.\n\nHowever, we cannot rule out the possibility, however unlikely, that either Fleischmann or a member of his staff \u2014 for whatever reason \u2014 arranged for the photograph to be digitally manipulated, or that the photograph was not originally posted by the Congressman, that he or his staff found the image posted elsewhere after it was edited by a third party, and that they subsequently reposted it. The original post could have been deleted, leaving the impression that Fleischmann was the original poster.\n\nSince we can\u2019t rule out the possibility that Fleischmann or his team either digitally altered the photograph or reposted an already-altered version, we are issuing a verdict of \u201cUnproven\u201d regarding the authenticity of the image.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that any possible digital alteration need not have been malicious. Various smartphones and apps feature editing software that allows users to apply filters or color schemes to photographs, modifications which can artificially change the appearance of images.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that the photograph was not edited but that the angle from which it was taken, perhaps in combination with the lighting in that part of the room, contributed to exaggerating a color gradient on Trump\u2019s face which was, in reality, much more subtle. Several other photographs of the president from that same event do not exhibit him with the same stark demarcation in skin tone, although they do show the opposite side of his face:\n\n\n\n We made repeated attempts to seek clarification from Fleischmann\u2019s spokesperson, but unfortunately we did not receive a response in time for publication. If we receive information which clarifies the photograph\u2019s origins and rules out the possibility that the Congressman\u2019s staff either digitally altered the photograph or posted an already-altered image, we will update this fact check accordingly.", "lang": "en"}
