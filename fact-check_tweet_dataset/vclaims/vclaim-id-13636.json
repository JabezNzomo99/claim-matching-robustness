(From 2007-2010, in three short years, Biliran experienced development. I gave myself, all my knowledge, all my abilities, and all my goodwill in order to raise more than half of poor Biliran citizens from extreme poverty).", "author": "tsek.ph", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-13636", "url": "http://tsek.ph/article/chong-makes-wrong-claim-biliran-poverty", "vclaim": "Senatorial candidate Glenn Chong falsely claimed he cut poverty in Biliran by half when he was the province\u2019s representative in the House from 2007 to 2010.\n\nAccording to the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB), poverty incidence among families in Biliran was 22.6 percent in 2006, a year before Chong was elected congressman. While he was in office in 2009, poverty incidence in his province increased to 31.8 percent. In 2012, two years after he served as Biliran representative, it declined to 20.9 percent.\n\nWhen measured against provincial population, poverty incidence in Biliran was 29.8 percent in 2006, 39.2 percent in 2009 and 27.5 percent in 2012.\n\nWhile poverty incidence in Chong\u2019s province indeed decreased from 2009 to 2012, it was not by more than half as he claimed, but by 34.3 percent among families and 29.8 percent among individuals.\n\nThe difference between 2006 and 2012 poverty incidence is even smaller: It dropped by 7.5 percent among families and 7.7 percent among individuals.\n\nMoreover, Chong was not the Biliran representative from 2009 to 2012. He lost his the re-election bid in 2010 to Rogelio J. Espina.\n\nIn 2006, 8.1 percent of families in Biliran lived without enough income for food, according to NSCB subsistence incidence data, which followed a trend similar to poverty incidence. It rose to 9.9 percent in 2009 before easing into 6.1 percent in 2012. Among individuals, it was 12.1 percent in 2006, 13.5 percent in 2009 and 8.3 percent in 2012.\n\nSubsistence incidence among families dropped in 2012 by 38.4 percent from 2009 and 24.7 percent from 2006. Among individuals, it decreased by 38.5 percent from 2009 to 2012 and 31.4 percent from 2006. As in poverty incidence, the decrease did not go over 50 percent.\n\nThe NSCB was one of the four agencies that were merged into Philippine Statistics Authority in 2013 through Republic Act 10625.\n\nAs of posting, Chong\u2019s Facebook video, which features \u201cLahing Kayumanggi,\u201d a song paying tribute to overseas Filipino workers, has garnered more than 164,000 views, 8,100 shares and 6,000 reactions.\n\nThe views and information in \u2018Tsek.ph\u2019 are those of their respective authors and owners and do not reflect the official policy or position of the media and academic partners of Tsek.ph.", "lang": "en"}
