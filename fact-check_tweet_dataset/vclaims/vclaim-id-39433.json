The cafeteria prepares nutritious free diets, and the dormitories are fully equipped with radio, TV, air conditioning, bathroom and shower. Indoor and outdoor sports venues for basketball, volleyball and table tennis have been built, along with reading rooms, computer labs, film screening rooms, as well as performance venues such as small auditoriums and open-air stages,\u201d Zakir said.\n\n\u201cVarious activities such as contests on speech, writing, dancing, singing and sports are organized. Many trainees have said that they were previously affected by extremist thought and had never participated in such kinds of art and sports activities, and now they have realized that life can be so colorful.\u201d\n\nMental health care, access to garment making and ethnic cuisine catering courses, and a paid basic income are all purportedly on offer.\n\n\"I didn't understand the country's common language, nor did I know about the laws,\u201d Zakir cites one trainee as allegedly saying. \u201cI wouldn't even have known that I had made mistakes. But the government didn't give me up. It has actively saved and assisted me, giving me free food, accommodation and education. Now I have made great progress in many aspects. I will cherish this opportunity and become a person useful to the country and society.\"\n\nHis comments followed a statement by outgoing U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who described the reeducation camps in Xinjiang as \"straight out of George Orwell.\"\n\n\"At least a million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities have been imprisoned in so-called 're-education camps' in western China,\" Fox News cited her as saying at the Chiefs of Defense Conference Dinner in Washington on Tuesday, October 16. She added that detainees are \"tortured ... forced to renounce their religion and to pledge allegiance to the Communist Party.\"\n\nHaley\u2019s comments echoed similar sentiments expressed by a member of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, Gay McDougall, who said Beijing had \"turned the Uighur autonomous region into something that resembles a massive internment camp.\"\n\nGay and other rights experts expressed alarm over \u201ccredible reports\u201d that China had interned one million people in counter-extremism centers and forced another two million into \u201cre-education camps for political and cultural indoctrination.\u201d\n\nYu Jianhua, China\u2019s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Office in Geneva, denied that such \u201creeducation centers\u201d exist and that arbitrary detention is practiced. He said \"the argument that a million Uighurs are detained in re-education centers is completely untrue.\"\u200b\n\nThen, last week, the South China Morning reported that the regional government in Xinjiang had \u201clegalized\u201d the use of vocational and training centers to combat extremism.\n\n\u201cGovernments at the county level and above can set up education and transformation organizations and supervising departments such as vocational training centers, to educate and transform people who have been influenced by extremism,\u201d the newspaper cited a new clause in the \u201cXinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region Regulation on Anti-Extremism\u201d as saying.\n\nBut the legality of what has been described as a \u201cretrospective justification\u201d for the camps has been called into question.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the authorities \u2018legalized\u2019 these camps \u2014 the regional authorities have no legal authority to authorize detention systems, only the national legislature has that authority, and the latter has not legalized these facilities. These camps remain illegal under Chinese law,\u201d Maya Wang, a senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch, told Polygraph.info.\n\nGovernment Control of the Press in Xinjiang\n\nFollowing Beijing\u2019s most recent volte-face, it remains difficult to separate fact from fiction due to the opaque media environment. As Wang noted, all Chinese journalists know to \u201csteer clear\u201d from XinJiang, while foreign journalists \u201care heavily surveilled if they set foot in the region, making reporting very difficult.\u201d\n\nVisits by Western journalists to Xinjian are rare, making it difficult or impossible to independently verify the government\u2019s rosy picture or the claims of human rights groups and Western governments. Reporters for the Wall Street Journal traveled to the province 10 months ago, finding one detention facility \u201csurrounded by imposing walls topped with razor wire, with watchtowers at two corners\u2026 Villagers describe it as a detention center.\u201d\n\nReporters Without Borders (RSF) ranked China 176th out of 180 countries in its most recent annual World Press Freedom index.\n\nLast month, a deputy editor, a head of a subsidiary newspaper, and two directors of the Xinjiang Daily group were arrested for being \u201ctwo-faced\u201d \u2013 a vague term \u201cadopted by the Chinese authorities to accuse those who allegedly secretly oppose government policies,\u201d RSF said.\n\nAlso in September, the Uighur editor-in-chief of a state-run literature magazine reportedly committed suicide \u201cout of fear\u201d of being detained in a political \"re-education camp,\" sources told Radio Free Asia (RFA).\n\n\u201cNot satisfied with having virtually banned the region\u2019s access to foreign media, President Xi Jinping is obviously trying to gag local media that does not print his propaganda,\u201d C\u00e9dric Alviani, the head of RSF\u2019s East Asia bureau, said.\n\nIn March, China detained the close relatives of five reporters for RFA\u2019s Uighur service in alleged \u201cretaliation for their coverage of the Xinjiang region,\u201d sparking condemnation from human rights and press freedom groups.\n\nIn August, Buzzfeed\u2019s China bureau chief, Megha Rajagopalan, was effectively expelled from China after the country\u2019s foreign ministry declined to issue her a new journalist visa \u2013 a move she linked to \u201creporting on and speaking about state surveillance, repression and incarceration of millions of Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.\u201d\n\nIn December 2015, China\u2019s foreign ministry refused to renew the accreditation of Ursula Gauthier, the Beijing-based correspondent for French news magazine L'Obs, claiming she had\" flagrantly championed acts of terrorism and acts of cruelly killing innocents.\u201d\n\nDespite a near media blackout, reports do trickle out.\n\nIn August, the Wall Street Journal reported eye-witness accounts that \u201cdozens of people had been crammed into one room, forced to share a single toilet, being fed one meal of cabbage per day and told not to talk to anyone else.\u201d\n\nDilxat Raxit, spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress, told RFA harsh consequences await those who resist reeducation.\n\n\"People have been tortured to death, while others have been beaten to death, or prevented from sleeping, or refused food or water,\" Raxit said. \"Either that or they do whatever would be most humiliating to that person's psychological profile. Sometimes they humiliate them physically, and have been known to employ electric batons.\"\n\nMurat, another Muslim from Xinjiang, told RFA \u201cpolitical education centers are generally like prisons.\u201d He added: \u201cElectric shocks, beatings, and humiliation all take place in there. It's very cruel.\"\n\nBencosme noted an interview that Amnesty International had conducted with Kairat Samarkan, who outlined his treatment in a \u201cre-education\u201d camp.\n\n\u201cKairat said when he was detained at one of these camps he was hooded and made to wear shackles on his arms and legs,\u201d Bencosme said. \u201cThey attached an iron bar with his arms spread wide and his body fixed in place so that he had to stand straight, unable to bend. They were forced to sing political songs and study the speeches of the Chinese Communist Party and praise the country. Kairat tried to take his own life while he was detained.\u201d\n\nAnd despite the alleged right to freedom of religious belief, Human Rights Watch claimed that with \u201cunprecedented levels of control over religious practices, the authorities have effectively outlawed Islam in the region.\u201d\n\nFor the 10-million strong Uighur population, the control reportedly extends far beyond camp walls.\n\nA high-tech system of digital and biometric surveillance, checkpoints at virtually every corner, and the policing of individuals\u2019 clothing and hair \u201care just some of the ways in which residents of Xinjiang experience restrictions on their individual rights even outside these camps,\u201d Jessica Batke, a senior editor with the ChinaFile online magazine and a former research analyst at the U.S. State Department, told the Congressional Executive Commission on China, an independent U.S. government agency, in July.\n\nUltimately, the fact that there is a relatively small stream of eyewitness accounts aids China in its attempt to deny or obfuscate what is going on inside the camps.\n\nBenscome said the restrictive nature of the camps forces rights groups to rely on interviews of those who have been released, making it difficult for those groups from independently verify many of the accounts of former detainees.\n\nBut Chinese authorities\u2019 initial denials, followed by alleged ad hoc legal justifications for what is going on in the detention camps, point towards a concerted effort to shape public perceptions of what is really going in in Xinjiang.\n\n\u201cThere is not enough lipstick on a pig that could hide the systematic repression that is going on in [Xinjiang] with up to one million people being arbitrarily detained. The Chinese government cannot continue to hide from the international community the ongoing human rights crisis occurring,\u201d Benscome said.\n\nWang said HRW makes certain to \u201ctriangulate\u201d its findings, not relying solely on accounts by eyewitnesses and families, but also examining documentary evidence, such as official documents and official social media posts.\n\n\u201cAll of these point to an abusive campaign of mass arbitrary detention and other severe abuses in Xinjiang,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the authorities are so confident that their detention camps are, in fact, just idyllic summer camps, then they should allow UN investigators, journalists and human rights organizations unfettered access to the region, including to these facilities, so we can see it for ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe lack of verifiable information leads us to the verdict of \u201cunclear.\u201d However all signs point to a much darker conclusion. And with China itself stifling every effort at openness and transparency in Xinjiang\u2019s allegedly life-affirming vocational schools, Polygraph.info finds its latest claims to be dubious at best.", "lang": "en"}
