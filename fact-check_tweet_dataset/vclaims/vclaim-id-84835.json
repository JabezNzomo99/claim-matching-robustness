Are you crazy?\u201d he said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be good if we actually got along with countries, wouldn\u2019t it be a positive thing? Do we always have to fight?\u201d\n\nAfter Putin\u2019s annual news conference in December, he was cornered by a reporter for ABC News and asked what he thought of Trump. You can see the images were captured on what appears to be an iPhone. Here\u2019s how ABC News translated his remarks:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very colorful person. Talented, without any doubt, but it\u2019s not our affair to determine his worthiness \u2014 that\u2019s up to the United States voters. But he is absolutely the leader in the presidential race.\u201d\n\nRussian is notoriously complex to translate into English, so various news organizations rendered the quote in slightly different ways. Here\u2019s how our colleague Andrew Roth cast the first part of the quote: \u201cHe\u2019s a very lively man, talented without doubt.\u201d\n\nBut there was also a translation offered by Interfax, a Russian nongovernmental news agency. In a tweet, the news agency appeared to say Trump \u201cis a very bright and talented man and the absolute leader of the presidential race.\u201d (At least that\u2019s how the tweet was translated by Bing.) A handful of news reports went further and said he called Trump \u201cvery brilliant.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian newspaper originally went with \u201cbright\u201d but then realized this was being misinterpreted. It corrected its headline and offered this explanation: \u201cAn earlier version quoted Putin as saying \u2018bright and talented.\u2019 To clarify: The word he used was \u2018yarkii\u2019 (\u044f\u0440\u043a\u0438\u0439), which can mean bright or brilliant, but not in the sense of intelligent; it can also be translated as colorful, vivid or flamboyant.\u201d\n\nRoth added: \u201cAnother point sometimes missed is that Putin didn\u2019t even say this during the press conference, but only after the broadcast was over, when an American reporter filming on an iPhone approached him in a scrum with a question. So the idea that he took time during a nationally televised presser to call Donald Trump \u2018brilliant\u2019 is totally false. He hasn\u2019t called him brilliant or intelligent in other cases either.\u201d\n\nWe can find no examples of a news report saying Putin called Trump a \u201cgenius.\u201d As usual, the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for evidence to back up Trump\u2019s claim. But Trump appears to have stretched a mistranslation into something far afield from its actual meaning.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t surprise us that Trump has exaggerated \u201cbright\u201d into \u201cgenius.\u201d But in reality, that\u2019s not what Putin meant at all. Instead, the Russian president said he regarded Trump as a \u201ccolorful\u201d figure, which is not the same thing as someone with a 140 IQ.", "lang": "en"}
