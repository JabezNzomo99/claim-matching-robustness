The image has been shared in a misleading context; the hardware store chain, Bunnings, told AFP it was an \u201cisolated decision\u201d by a single store to sell the product and the chain no longer sells it.\n\nThis Facebook post was shared on March 15, 2020.\n\nIt shows a 48-pack of Scott brand toilet paper for sale at AUD$74.25 inside a store.

Any customer who has been disadvantaged can pop in with their receipt and be refunded and receive an AUS$50 gift card to compensate them for any inconvenience.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by AFP what the current price of the toilet paper product was, the Bunnings spokesperson responded that the product was \u201cno longer for sale.\u201d\n\nAFP found the product being sold by other retailers in Australia, including Officeworks and Kaplan Distributors, at about AUD$44; but a search on the Bunnings website did not show the product for sale online.", "lang": "en"}
