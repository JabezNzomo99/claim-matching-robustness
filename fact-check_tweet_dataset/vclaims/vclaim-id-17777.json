The article placed the Congress at the second position.\n\nThe list shared by Singh was created by a fake news website posing as the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The distinction between \u2018bbcnewshub.com\u2019 and the official bbc.com website is clear.\n\nFurthermore, the poorly worded article is replete with grammatical errors. \u201c\u2026political parties do hire member or contenders, these parties are also to run and organize elections to decide the government of any country in the world,\u201d reads its first paragraph.\n\nThe ludicrous \u2018About us\u2019 section of BBC News Hub also gives away its falseness. It states, \u201cbbcnewshub.com is best place to provide complete, brief, correct, healthy and strong content for the respectable visitors which are related to all over the world. It provides the national and international current and all type of information.\u201d\n\nAlt News had earlier debunked the same list of \u2018most corrupt political parties in the world\u2019. Chairman of Manipal Global Education Mohandas Pai had fallen for this article that has been doing rounds on social media since July this year.\n\nBBC News Hub had produced one more list that placed Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the 7th place among the most corrupt politicians worldwide. Another fake news website \u2018foxnewspoint.com\u2019, imitating American news organisation Fox News, called PM Modi\u2019s family the second most corrupt political family in the world.\n\n[Watch: The menace of impostor websites and parody handles]\n\nDespite debunking BBC News Hub in the past, Giriraj Singh shared its list to target Congress. The Union Minister had earlier claimed that a tweet by Rahul Gandhi was retweeted by Pakistan\u2019s official defence account. This too turned out to be false as the handle belonged to an online forum that discussed the country\u2019s defence issues.", "lang": "en"}
