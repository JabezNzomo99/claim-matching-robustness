This article is a fact check of the claims made.\n\nWhat is the MUDRA scheme?\n\nThe first claim is that \u2018MUDRA: This scheme provides collateral free loans to entrepreneurs\u2019.\n\nThe Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) is a scheme launched in April 2015 for providing loans up to Rs. 10 lakhs to the non-corporate, non-farm Micro & Small enterprises (MSEs). All such loans are classified as MUDRA loans under PMMY. These loans are extended by Commercial Banks, RRBs, Small Finance Banks, Cooperative Banks, MFIs and NBFCs. The borrower can approach any of the lending institutions mentioned above or can apply online through the portal.\n\nThe application for loans under the MUDRA scheme require proof of identity, proof of residence, quotation of machinery etc but the Banks are not supposed to take any processing fee and are not supposed to ask for any collateral.\n\nHowever, it has to noted that the focus on the MSME sector is not a new phenomenon. The first NDA government launched the Credit Guarantee Fund Scheme for MSMEs in August 2000 to provide guarantee cover for collateral free credit facilities extended to micro and small enterprises (MSEs). During the UPA, the Government had constituted a Prime Minister\u2019s Task Force on Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) in September 2009, which submitted its report in January 2010. The report had made recommendations in the areas of credit, marketing, labour issues, rehabilitation and exit policy, infrastructure/technology/skill development, taxation and special measures for North-Eastern Region and Jammu & Kashmir.\n\nAmong other things, the recommendations of the task force also include advice to the banks to achieve a 20% year-on-year growth in credit to MSEs and a 10% annual growth in the number of micro enterprise accounts. The banks have also been advised that the allocation of 60% of the MSE advances to the micro enterprises is to be achieved in stages viz., 50 per cent in the year 2010-11, 55 per cent in the year 2011-12 and 60 per cent in the year 2012-13. Many other steps were also recommended and some were implemented during the previous government.\n\nThe PMMY being implemented by the current government is a dedicated scheme for MSEs that led to the establishment of Micro Units Development & Refinance Agency Ltd (MUDRA). MUDRA bank is essentially a refinancing institution and does not directly lend loans to end customers. Rather, the loans are given by Commercial Banks, RRBs, Small Finance Banks, Cooperative Banks, MFIs and NBFCs.\n\nAre 70% of the MUDRA beneficiaries\u2019 Women?\n\nThe second claim is that \u2018MUDRA: More than 70% of the beneficiaries are women\u2019.\n\nThe PMMY website has year wise performance reports on the website. Data from these reports suggests that out of a total of 12.27 crore loan accounts under the MUDRA scheme between 2015-16 and 2017-18, 9.03 crore belong to women entrepreneurs and 6.71 crore belong to SCs/STs/OBCs. Hence the percentage of loan accounts belonging to women is around 74%.\n\nWhat is Stand up India initiative?\n\nThe third claim is that \u2018Stand up India: This initiative provides loans of up to 1 crore rupees to women/SC/ST/OBC entrepreneurs\u2019.\n\nGovernment of India launched the Stand Up India scheme in April 2016. Stand Up India scheme caters to promoting entrepreneurship amongst Women, SC & ST category i.e. those section of the population facing significant hurdles due to lack of advice/ mentorship as well as inadequate and delayed credit. The scheme intends to leverage the institutional credit structure to reach out to these underserved sectors of the population in starting greenfield enterprise. It caters to both ready and trainee borrowers. The Scheme facilitates bank loans between Rs.10 lakh and Rs.1 crore to at least one Scheduled Caste/ Scheduled Tribe borrower and at least one Woman borrower per bank branch of Scheduled Commercial Banks for setting up greenfield enterprises in trading, manufacturing and services sector.\n\nTo extend collateral free coverage, Government of India has set up the Credit Guarantee Fund for Stand Up India (CGFSI). The scheme is built on the concept of providing handholding support to those borrowers who might have a project in mind but lack the confidence and capability to start up. It also provides for convergence with Central/State Government schemes. Applications under the scheme can also be made online. An online tracking system in the dedicated Stand Up India portal is being utilized. As of December 2018, more than 68000 loans have been sanctioned under the scheme out of which 53,284 are disbursed.\n\nIt also has to be noted that there are multiple schemes for the economic development of the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and the Scheduled Tribes (STs) that have been implemented even during the UPA.\n\nDid 9 crore women benefit from MUDRA and Stand up India?\n\nThe fourth claim is that \u20189 crore women have benefitted jointly from MUDRA and Stand up India\u2019.\n\nThe PMMY website has year wise performance reports on the website. The data shows that 9.03 crore accounts under the MUDRA scheme belong to women. The annual report (2017-18) of the Standup India mission shows that 41,639 women have benefitted from the scheme. This means that a total of more than 9 crore women have benefitted from both the schemes.\n\nThis story is part of a larger series on the 4-years of the Modi government.
