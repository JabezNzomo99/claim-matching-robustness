Those actions included the cyber-theft of private data, the placement of propaganda against particular candidates, and an overall effort to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process.\n\nMembers of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have held open and closed door hearings to probe Russia\u2019s actions. The congressional investigations are ongoing.\n\nFacebook, Google and Twitter have investigated their own networks, and their executives have concluded \u2014 in some cases after initial foot-dragging \u2014 that Russia used the online platforms in attempts to influence the election.\n\nAfter all this, one man keeps saying it didn\u2019t even happen.\n\n\"This Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won,\" said President Donald Trump in an interview with NBC\u2019s Lester Holt in May.\n\nOn Twitter in September, Trump said, \"The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?\"\n\nAnd during an overseas trip to Asia in November, Trump spoke of meeting with Putin: \"Every time he sees me, he says, \u2018I didn't do that.\u2019 And I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.\" In the same interview, Trump referred to the officials who led the intelligence agencies during the election as \"political hacks.\"\n\nTrump continually asserts that Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election is fake news, a hoax or a made-up story, even though there is widespread, bipartisan evidence to the contrary.\n\nWhen the nation\u2019s commander-in-chief refuses to acknowledge a threat to U.S. democracy, it makes it all the more difficult to address the problem. For this reason, we name Trump\u2019s claim that the Russia interference is a hoax as our Lie of the Year for 2017.\n\nReaders of PolitiFact also chose the claim as the year's most significant falsehood by an overwhelming margin.\n\nIt seems unlikely \u2014 though not impossible \u2014 that Russia interference changed the outcome of the election. We at PolitiFact have seen no compelling evidence that it did so.\n\nTrump could acknowledge the interference happened while still standing by the legitimacy of his election and his presidency \u2014 but he declines to do so. Sometimes he\u2019ll state firmly there was \"no collusion\" between his campaign and Russia, an implicit admission that Russia did act in some capacity. Then he reverts back to denying the interference even happened.\n\nIt\u2019s not so much that Trump trades in falsehoods \u2014 it\u2019s more that he tries to create a different version of reality simply by asserting it.\n\nThat denial is of a different order from most presidential posturing, said Nicholas Burns, who served as ambassador to NATO under President George W. Bush.\n\n\"I've worked for both parties,\" Burns said during public testimony to the Republican-controlled Congress this summer. \"It's inconceivable to me that any of President Trump's predecessors would deny the gravity of such an open attack on our democratic system.\n\n\"I don't believe any previous American president would argue that your own hearings in the Senate are a waste of time or, in the words of President Trump, a witch hunt. They're not; you're doing your duty, that the people elected you to do.\"\n\nCountries have meddled in each other\u2019s internal politics before. But 2016 was different.\n\nNew cyber tools had come online, with Facebook putting robust sharing options in the hands of its users. In previous presidential cycles, online organizing had been innovative or unusual. In 2016, the sharing of political information online was widespread, cheap and easy to execute.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia was concerned about its standing after conflicts with the former Soviet republic of Georgia. International sanctions resulted from Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea, which Putin wanted to see lifted.\n\nPutin also had particular animosity toward Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee who had served as secretary of state. Putin openly blamed Clinton for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012. A publicly available intelligence assessment said that Putin also \"holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw as disparaging him.\"\n\nIn July 2016, Wikileaks released thousands of emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee. The release led to DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz stepping down after grassroots activists accused her of favoring Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary. Both intelligence officials and cybersecurity specialists concluded the hack had all the marks of a Russian operation. In October, Wikileaks began publishing the emails of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta.\n\nMeanwhile, media websites connected to Russia, such as RT and Sputnik, spread suspicious or even fake news reports during the election, aided by online trolls and bots. Sputnik published an article that claimed Podesta\u2019s email included incriminating information about events in Benghazi, an allegation that turned out to be incorrect. (Trump himself repeated this false story.)\n\nRussian hackers attempted to get into the computer systems of local elections officials around the country. The attempts never penetrated vote tallying systems, according to federal agencies, but the federal government warned local officials to redouble efforts to secure their systems.\n\nIf Trump wanted to address the Russia controversy head on, he could argue that he was correcting a lack of action on the part of the Obama administration, which learned in summer 2016 that election-related hacks could be traced back to the Russian government.\n\nPresident Barack Obama personally confronted Putin at the September G20 Summit in China; other high-level contacts took place as well. Back home, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson warned state-level elections officials to protect voting-related systems from cyber intrusions.\n\nBut the overall response of the Obama team before the election was muted \u2014 perhaps due to concerns about the appearance of playing politics, or because they thought Clinton would be the certain winner of the election.\n\nAs it turned out, the most significant actions the Obama administration took happened after the election. In late December, Obama ordered 35 Russian diplomats and suspected operatives to leave the United States, and he ordered more sanctions.\n\nThose actions have reverberated into the Trump administration.\n\nSoon after Obama moved against Russia, Michael Flynn, then named as Trump\u2019s incoming national security adviser, contacted Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn asked that Russia not escalate the situation with a specific response to Obama\u2019s actions.\n\nLater, in January 2017, Flynn told the FBI falsely that he hadn\u2019t spoken about sanctions with Kislyak. That wasn\u2019t true. On Dec. 1, Flynn made a plea deal with special prosecutor Robert Mueller, pleading guilty to one count of making false statements to federal investigators.\n\nMeanwhile, technology companies spent 2017 investigating how much activity from Russian interests unfolded on Facebook and Twitter. Facebook estimated that 126 million people were served Russia-influenced content during the two-year period before the election.\n\n\"The Russians tried to use our tools to sow mistrust,\" said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in November. \"We build these tools to help people connect and bring us closer together. They used them to try to undermine our values. What they did is wrong, and we're not going to stand for it.\"\n\nCongressional committees have in recent months released some of the ads that Russia-affiliated groups placed on Facebook; they seemed aimed at stoking anger on both the right (\"I want Sharia law banned in every state across America!\") and the left (\"Black Panthers were dismantled by US government because they were black men and women standing up for justice and equality\").\n\nSome ads were overtly anti-Clinton. One depicted an image of Jesus Christ boxing Hillary Clinton wearing devil\u2019s horns under the words \" \u2018Like\u2019 if you want Jesus to win!\"\n\nAs 2017 has marched on, a key point that Trump and his team once insisted upon has proved false. After first claiming that no one from the campaign met with the Russians, they\u2019ve admitted to several meetings, including a June 2016 meeting attended by Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr.; then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort; and Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n\nTrump\u2019s labeling of the Russia story as a hoax fits in with his pattern of dismissing critical coverage as \"fake news.\" He\u2019s used the term when he believes his administration doesn\u2019t get complimentary coverage, such as hurricane cleanup in Puerto Rico, or even when his comments have been reported accurately, such as his remarks about white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nSince the beginning of 2017, President Trump has publicly invoked the phrase \"fake news\" more than 170 times. Virtually every instance has been in response to critical news coverage.\n\nTrump has insisted there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia. Some legal experts have said that it would be far-fetched to think the Trump campaign has broken laws.\n\n\"Even if it were to turn out that the Trump campaign collaborated, colluded or cooperated with Russian agents, that alone would not be a crime, unless the campaign asked them or helped them to commit criminal acts such as hacking,\" said attorney Alan M. Dershowitz in an op-ed for the New York Times.\n\nBut Trump has gone further than simply saying the campaign didn\u2019t break laws. He has said the whole story is fake.\n\nIt\u2019s that characterization \u2014 that Russia\u2019s interference in the election doesn\u2019t even exist \u2014 that is contradicted by a mountain of evidence, say foreign policy experts.\n\n\"There certainly has been some speculation in the media that has gotten ahead of the facts. That always happens. The media is littered with pundits who get paid to make speculation ahead of the facts,\" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a right-leaning foreign policy think tank. \"That doesn\u2019t make it fake news. That doesn\u2019t make the story as a whole \u2018fake news.\u2019 \"\n\nInvestigations should go forward until all the facts come out about Russia\u2019s role in the election, said Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and editor in chief of Lawfare, a national security blog.\n\n\"It\u2019s possible that the president obstructed justice. It\u2019s also possible the president behaved wildly inappropriately without obstructing justice,\" Wittes said. \"And it\u2019s important to find out exactly what happened.\"\n\n\"Once you say, we don\u2019t mind foreign governments interfering with your elections, then you\u2019re on your way to yielding up significant aspects of sovereignty,\" he added. \"It\u2019s an important line to defend.\"\n\nAngie Drobnic Holan is PolitiFact Editor.
