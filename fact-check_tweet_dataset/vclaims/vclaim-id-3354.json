Children from every income level whose health is especially threatened right now because of something you\u2019ve probably never heard of; it\u2019s called CHIP. CHIP is the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. It covers around 9 million American kids whose parents make too much money to qualify for Medicaid but don\u2019t have access to coverage, affordable coverage, through their jobs, which means it almost certainly covers children you know.\n\nCHIP was created in 1997 during the Bill Clinton administration as part of a balanced-budget deal signed by the president. By all accounts, the prime mover behind CHIP was the late senator Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). He was inspired by a similar Massachusetts program and then enlisted Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) as his partner in the effort. The original idea was to fund children\u2019s health care with money raised from taxes on tobacco products. Hatch is still in the Senate and chairman of the Finance Committee, making him a key player in the negotiations.\n\nThe federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, which is why funding technically ran out when CHIP was not reauthorized. But states may continue to spend unspent 2017 allotments and funds from earlier years. Only three states and the District were projected to exhaust their funds by the end of December; more than half the states would run out of funds if fiscal year 2018 funding is not set by the end of March. That\u2019s the kind of deadline that focuses the attention of lawmakers.\n\nThe GOP-led House of Representatives on Nov. 3 passed a CHIP reauthorization bill by a vote of 242-174, with most Democrats voting against it because of funding offsets. In particular, they objected to shortening the grace period for Obamacare enrollees who fail to make premium payments. House Republicans have complained that Democrats have not countered with their own funding proposals, while Democrats have said offsets should not be necessary when the tax bills will add to the federal budget deficit. They have instead pushed for a \u201cclean bill\u201d rather than one with \u201cpoison pills.\u201d\n\nAgain, Kimmel\u2019s frame of reference is off. CHIP funding is being negotiated even as Congress is debating a tax plan. Both the House and Senate have signaled they support reauthorization of CHIP. The impasses over funding had led to some uncertainty in a handful of states, but there is no immediate crisis \u2014 and the recent stopgap funding bill provides flexibility to keep CHIP programs running in states. (Update: the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission says that in order to have an orderly shutdown some states, such as Colorado, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Texas, Alabama and Connecticut, have sent notices or announced they will send notices about possibly ending the program if funding is not renewed.)\n\nThe bottom line: CHIP is completely unrelated to the tax legislation; in fact, it won\u2019t be and was never going to be part of the tax bill. Congress is able to work on several issues at once \u2014 and most of the outstanding issues get wrapped up just before important holidays.", "lang": "en"}
