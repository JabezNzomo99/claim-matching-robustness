He would not mention his name unless he was condemning him.\"\n\nThe record on the first part of Stewart\u2019s statement - that Gillespie would not appear with Trump - doesn\u2019t lend itself to a fact-check because it requires us to get into Gillespie\u2019s head. Gillespie never did appear on stage with Trump in Virginia, but there\u2019s no evidence he refused to do so. Gillespie\u2019s campaign says he was never invited by Trump\u2019s camp and we\u2019ve found no information to contradict that.\n\nSo we\u2019ll fact check the second part of Stewart\u2019s statement - that Gillespie only mentioned Trump\u2019s name when he was \"condemning him.\"\n\nWhen we reached out to Stewart, he repeated that Gillespie kept Trump at an arm\u2019s length and \"never mentioned Trump\" in a positive light. Stewart said that early in the campaign, Gillespie simply made a generic vow to support the GOP nominee.\n\nThe only time Gillespie mentioned Trump by name, Stewart said, was to take the him to task following a release of a 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which Trump made vulgar comments about groping women.\n\nGillespie did criticize Trump for that, the candidate\u2019s comments \"incredibly offensive and demeaning.\"\n\nBut contrary to Stewart\u2019s statement, there were a few times when Gillespie did mention Trump\u2019s name - tepidly - while voicing support for the GOP ticket. Matt Moran, Gillespie\u2019s campaign spokesman, pointed out those occasions.\n\u2022A May 4 in The Washington Post that noted Gillespie issued a one-sentence, prepared statement of support for Trump. The statement said, \"Republican voters have nominated Donald Trump for president, and I will vote for him against Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders in an election that will not only affect control of the White House but the U.S. Supreme Court for a generation or more.\"\n\u2022A May podcast with Bearing Drift, a conservative blog. Gillespie said, \"It\u2019s very important that we help Donald Trump carry the commonwealth against Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders because we play a critically important role in the Electoral College.\"\n\u2022An Aug. 23 with the Loudoun Times that was recorded by Gillespie\u2019s campaign. \"I\u2019m voting for Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton,\" Gillespie said. \"That is our choice in this election. It\u2019s not just about the control of the executive branch for the next four years, but control of the judiciary for the next 30 years.\"\n\nNo doubt, Gillespie\u2019s actions on Trump will be an issue in next year\u2019s GOP primary for governor. Stewart isn\u2019t the only Trump supporter accusing Gillespie of shunning the president-elect this fall. John Fredericks, who served as chairman of Trump\u2019s campaign during the final month after Stewart was ousted, also said that Gillespie kept Trump at arm\u2019s length.\n\n\"This was a cold, calculating political decision that he made that he\u2019ll have to live with now,\" John Fredericks said of Gillespie. Fredericks became chairman of Trump\u2019s Virginia campaign in October, after Stewart was fired for making unauthorized comments.\n\nBut Fredericks also acknowledged that he never asked Gillespie to appear with Trump and, therefore, can\u2019t say definitively if Gillespie \"would not\" do so.\n\nFredericks told us that that Gillespie did attend two rallies held by Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. They were held in on Oct. 5 and at on Nov. 5. At the latter event, Fredericks said he introduced Gillespie, who never mentioned Trump in his speech.\n\nWhile Gillespie is taking hits from Republicans for distancing himself from Trump, the state Democratic Party is trying to tie him to the president-elect. The Democrats started a \"Trump for Virginia governor\" that claims Gillespie, Stewart and other GOP gubernatorial candidates are \"YUUGE Trump supporters.\"\n\nFinally, we should finally note that Stewart was fired as the Trump campaign\u2019s Virginia chairman on Oct.10 after joining a rally in front of the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington where he accused GOP \"establishment pukes\" of failing to sufficiently support Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nStewart said Gillespie \"would not mention\" Trump\u2019s name \"unless he was condemning him.\"\n\nGillespie certainly did not praise Trump, and he did criticize the presidential nominee for making a vulgar statement about women.\n\nBut there are several instances where Gillespie mentioned Trump while voicing support of the GOP ticket, saying it was important to keep conservative control of the U.S. Supreme Court.", "lang": "en"}
