The photograph is doing the rounds with several netizens hitting back at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) supporters who have called out Banerjee for her alleged appeasement towards the minorities of the state. BOOM found that the photo has been edited to include the Islamic skull caps on PM Modi and Amit Shah. \n\n\n\nThe morphed photo has been captioned as, \"This image is not for everyone. Those Bhakts who address our Mamata Banerjee as Mamata Begun, it is for them. There is one question for those people, why don't you give a moniker for these leaders as well. We do not hide and do something. Even you all could not hide this.\" (Original text in Bangla: \u098f-\u0987 \u099b\u09ac\u09bf\u099f\u09bf \u09b8\u09ac\u09be\u09b0 \u099c\u09a8\u09cd\u09af \u09a8\u09df\u0964 \u09b8\u09c7\u0987 \u09b8\u09ae\u09b8\u09cd\u09a4 \u09ad\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09c7\u09b0 \u099c\u09a8\u09cd\u09af \u09af\u09be\u09b0\u09be \u09ac\u0999\u09cd\u0997\u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09be \u09ae\u09ae\u09a4\u09be\u0995\u09c7 \u09ae\u09ae\u09a4\u09be \u09ac\u09c7\u0997\u09ae \u09ac\u09b2\u09a4\u09c7 \u09aa\u099b\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6 \u0995\u09b0\u09c7\u09a8\u0964\u09a4\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b0 \u0995\u09be\u099b\u09c7 \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09b6\u09cd\u09a8 \u098f\u09a8\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b0 \u09a8\u09be\u09ae \u0997\u09c1\u09b2\u09cb \u0986\u09aa\u09a8\u09be\u09b0\u09be\u0987 \u09a6\u09bf\u09a8\u0964 \u0986\u09ae\u09b0\u09be \u0995\u09bf\u099b\u09c1 \u09b2\u09c1\u0995\u09bf\u09df\u09c7 \u0995\u09b0\u09bf\u09a8\u09be \u0995\u09b0\u09a4\u09c7\u0993 \u099a\u09be\u0987\u09a8\u09be\u0964 \u09b2\u09c1\u0995\u09be\u09a4\u09c7 \u09aa\u09be\u09b0\u09b2\u09c7\u09a8 \u09a8\u09be\u09a4\u09cb?)\n\nThe same image was viral on Twitter with a similar narrative.\n\nAlso Read: Akhilesh Yadav Tweet Against Construction Of Ram Mandir Is Fake\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search on the photograph and found that it has been morphed to include the religious skull caps.\n\nThe photograph was taken during PM Modi and Amit Shah's visit to former minister of Corporate Affairs Arun Jaitley's house, after the latter's demise.
