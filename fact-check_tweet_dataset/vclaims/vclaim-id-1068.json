While a woman did attempt to set the flag on the Cenotaph on fire during an anti-racism protest on June 7, she is clearly not the same person as the man pictured holding the placard. The woman can be seen in photographs here and here .\n\nThe two people clearly have different physical features, and while they are both wearing similar jackets, the patterns and colours are not exactly the same.\n\nFalse. The man in the photograph is not the person who attempted to burn the Union Flag on June 7.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
