This is nearly three times that allocated in 2013/14, the first full fiscal year of Kenyatta\u2019s presidency.\n\n, Sicily Kariuki, Kenya\u2019s cabinet secretary for health, claimed funding to the sector had increased dramatically.\n\n\u201cThe Kenyan government has also increased [the] health sector budget by more than 30% in the last two fiscal years,\u201d she\n\non 21 May 2019 while attending the\n\nThis, Kariuki said, was a step towards reaching sustainable domestic financing for health at both the national and county levels.\n\nBut do the numbers add up?\n\nHow were the numbers calculated?\n\nAfrica Check contacted the health ministry to get details of the minister\u2019s calculations. We were asked to send an email but have not yet received a response. We will update this report should we get one.\n\nAt the start of every budgeting cycle in September, government departments submit their budgets. The\n\nby the health sector shows that at the national level it is made up of the health ministry and\n\nor parastatals such as the Kenyatta National Hospital and the National Health Insurance Fund.\n\nPrimary healthcare and county health services are managed by the country\u2019s 47 county governments, as set out in the\n\nBoth county and national governments must be included\n\nTo evaluate how much has been allocated for health, the budget amounts for both the national and county governments must be considered. This,\n\n\u201cIf you want to talk about the health sector budget for the whole country, you have to include the budget allocations set aside for health at the two levels of government,\u201d Mutua said. He\n\nWhat do the numbers show?\n\nNational treasury data shows that the health ministry budget increased from KSh47.4 billion in\n\nIn the last two financial years, the health ministry\u2019s budget rose from KSh60.3 billion in\n\nBut that is just for the national government. At the county level, the budget allocation rose from KSh95.8 billion in 2016/17 to KSh112.9 billion, or 17.8%. (\n\nThe change in the total budget allocation for the two financial years is 29.9%, which can be rounded up to 30%. But it isn\u2019t \u201cmore than 30%\u201d, as the minister claimed. We therefore rate Kariuki\u2019s claim as mostly correct.\n\n\n\n \n\n Kenya health budget still under 15% of African target\n\n\n\n Health spending should however be looked at against the total budget, Prof Lukoye Atwoli, the of the school of medicine at Kenya\u2019s \n\n\n\n found this has ranged between 7.9% and 9.7% of the total budget in the last five financial years. \u201cIn real terms, the allocation has reduced,\u201d argued Atwoli. This is when the \u201cincreased need for health and other economic forces including inflation\u201d is considered. \n\n\n\n Kenya\u2019s healthcare budget had not met the provisions of the , a 2001 pledge by African countries to allocate at least 15% of their annual budgets toward healthcare, he said. \n\n\n\n \u201cWhen that 15% percentage was arrived at, it was acknowledged that health expenditure affects all sectors of the economy. \n\n\n\n \u201cThe understanding is that if this 15% is utilised appropriately, it will result in improvements in infrastructure, security, education and governance. \n\n\n\nAt a recent international meeting, Kenya\u2019s health cabinet secretary Sicily Kariuki claimed the country\u2019s health budget had increased by \u201cmore than 30%\u201d in the last two financial years.\n\nWe checked the numbers. When the allocations to the two levels of government are considered, they back up her claim. The increase is 30% though, not \u201cmore than 30%\u201d.\n\nWe thus rate Kariuki\u2019s claim as mostly correct. But an expert said that as a share of Kenya\u2019s total budget, healthcare financing is still short of the 15% target set by African countries known as the Abuja Declaration.", "lang": "en"}
