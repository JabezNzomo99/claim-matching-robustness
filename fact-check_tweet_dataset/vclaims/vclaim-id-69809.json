We lost thousands of plants,\" Trump said. \"We lost millions of jobs. NAFTA was a disaster.\"\n\nOn several occasions, we\u2019ve looked at the tricky question of how to tally the employment impacts of the trade deal between the United States, Canada and Mexico enacted in 1994. In this case, Trump exaggerates the highest available estimate of lost jobs as a result of the deal.\n\nEstimates of jobs lost from NAFTA ranges widely, but we have not seen any estimate as high as \"millions.\"\n\nThe biggest number comes from a report by the liberal Economic Policy Institute, which receives support from labor unions. A 2014 report from the group found that from 1993 to 2013, \"the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico and Canada increased from $17 (billion) to $177.2 billion, displacing 851,700 U.S. jobs. All of the net jobs displaced were due to growing trade deficits with Mexico.\"\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the only estimate that\u2019s been offered.\n\nAnd as you\u2019ll see, the numbers vary widely.\n\nBusiness groups argue that trade deals actually boost employment, pointing to a 2010 report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The chamber found that the 14 trade deals in place in 2008 supported 5.4 million jobs, with the lion\u2019s share of those jobs stemming from NAFTA.\n\nAssessments not aligned with either business or labor have generally suggested that the trade deal had a modest overall impact on jobs, though with certain industries \u2014 such as cars and electronics \u2014 suffering more than others.\n\nNAFTA \"had particularly heavy, negative impacts on employment in the auto and parts industries, and a few others, such as electric appliances,\" said Robert Scott, who authored the EPI report. He added that the upper Midwest suffered disproportionately, though some of the production was moved to non-union locations in the South.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan policy arm of Congress, concluded that \"the net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest.\" A similar review published by the international Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reached the same conclusion.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that assigning blame for job losses is not always clear. The U.S-China Business Council and the Financial Times have argued that the loss in manufacturing jobs were not due to trade with China so much as gains in technology and productivity, as well as the result of a more sophisticated economy.\n\nAnd during the last year of his presidency, Bill Clinton signed legislation granting China permanent normal trade relations. From 2000 on, this had an enormous impact on trade between the two nations \u2014 and it overlaps with about half the period when analysts have tried to gauge the effect of NAFTA. This complicates any analysis of NAFTA\u2019s specific impact.\n\nFor all its faults, Scott said, NAFTA\u2019s impact pales compared to the job losses from expanded trade with China.\n\nThe Economic Policy Institute has estimated that the United States has lost 3.2 million jobs between 2001 and 2013 to trade with China, so it\u2019s possible that Trump was conflating NAFTA and trade with China.\n\n\"Trump\u2019s intense focus on renegotiating NAFTA, and his claim that under NAFTA \u2018millions of jobs were lost,\u2019 is not only wrong, but a vast overstatement, and a misleading misstatement of the principal sources of our trade problems,\" Scott said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.\n\nTrump said that under the North American Free Trade Agreement, \"we lost millions of jobs.\"\n\nWe did not find any study that estimates that NAFTA alone cost \"millions\" of jobs. The largest estimate is about 800,000, and other studies show smaller negative, and sometimes positive, impacts.\n\nEditor's note, Sept. 24, 2018: PolitiFact has joined an effort with other North American fact-checkers to examine statements about trade and tariffs.
