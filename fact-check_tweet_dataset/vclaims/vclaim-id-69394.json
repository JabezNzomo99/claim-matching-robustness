Joe Kennedy III bemoaned the seismic income gap between top executives and the average employee, even as he celebrated the current bullish economy.\n\nEmphasizing the need for greater economic fairness, Kennedy said workers should take home a larger share of corporate profits, relative to that of their bosses.\n\n\"We choose an economy strong enough to boast record stock prices,\" he said, \"and brave enough to admit that top CEOs making 300 times the average worker is not right.\"\n\nWe wondered if the pay gap between top executives and the average employee was as wide as Kennedy claimed.\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted previously, the gap between CEOs and workers is vast, but there\u2019s no standard formula for computing the figure, which means there\u2019s room to quibble over the numbers.\n\nResults vary based on which corporations \u2014 and how many of them \u2014 are used in a study, and researchers use different definitions to define workers and stock options, and to compute salaries.\n\nAt the high end is the AFL-CIO. The labor union\u2019s analysis compared the 2016 compensation of CEOs of S&P 500 Index to those of production and nonsupervisory workers.\n\nIt found top executives, on average, received $13.1 million in total compensation, while the average employee earned $37,632. That\u2019s a ratio of 347 to 1.\n\nAn analysis by the liberal Economic Policy Institute also produced a large disparity in pay, though relatively smaller than that of the AFL-CIO.\n\nThe institute\u2019s study of 2016 compensation used two different measurements, which varied in their treatment of executives\u2019 stock options.\n\nThe first measure assumed stock options were cashed in, and therefore were added to CEOs salary, bonuses and other payouts. Under that measure, CEO compensation was found to 271 times the average worker\u2019s pay.\n\nUnder the second measure, in which stock options were granted but not cashed in, the ratio was 224-to-1.\n\nBloomberg analyzed 2017 income data and found CEOs made 265 times more than the income paid to average workers.\n\nKennedy\u2019s office did not reply to our request for comment.\n\nKennedy said, \"Top CEOs (are) making 300 times the average worker.\"\n\nHis numbers describing today\u2019s ratio, while credible, are on the high side of research.\n\nThe AFL-CIO put the ratio at 347-to-1. The liberal Economic Policy Institute said CEOs make either 271 or 224 times that of average employees, depending on how you measure stock options. Bloomberg pegged the ratio at 265-to-1.\n\nWe rate his claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
