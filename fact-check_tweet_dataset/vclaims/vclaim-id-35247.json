The Wuhan coronavirus seems to have a low fatality rate, and most patients make full recoveries.\"\n\nIt also said that many patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV have already made full recoveries and that most of those who have died were elderly or had compromised immune systems.\n\nThey added that experts say that panic is unwarranted and unproductive, and that people can avoid getting sick by frequent washing of hands and not touching your face.\n\nRappler's story \"Novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV: What we know so far,\" published on January 21, said: \"With 212 deaths and a total of 8,236 cases as of January 31, 2019-nCoV has a [case fatality rate] of about 2.6%. This is lower than SARS, whose CFR was 10%, and MERS, whose CFR was about 35%. But this figure is not unshakeable, as figures continue to rise.\"\n\nThe Philippine Star, quoting WHO country representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe, said the same in their report about the first case of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines on January 31. They said the same in a story published two days earlier.\n\nForeign media have also spoken about the low fatality rate of the 2019-nCoV. A February 1 headline on Business Insider read: \"The Wuhan coronavirus seems to have a low fatality rate, and most patients make full recoveries. Experts reveal why it's causing panic anyway.\"\n\nAlso, 1,141 of 28,078 infected globally have recovered from the virus, including one of the 3 confirmed cases in the Philippines as of Thursday, February 6. Another patient from the Philippines is recovering, while the other died. There have been 564 deaths due to the virus worldwide. \u2013 Vernise L Tantuco/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
