The Russian ambassador to the United Nations in the U.N. Security Council has systematically blocked resolutions calling for joint international investigations of chemical weapons use in Syria.\n\nAccording to the \u201cSecurity Council Veto List,\u201d accessible on the website of the United Nations Dag Hammarskjold Library, Russia has vetoed 12 Syria-related resolutions during the seven years since the conflict there began.\n\nAlong with the \u201cVeto List,\u201d the Dag Hammarskjold Library provides access to the texts of U.N. resolutions and transcripts of U.N. meetings.\n\nDuring the seven years since the beginning of the Syrian conflict in 2011, Russia has used its veto power in 16 cases: two concerning Ukraine, one concerning Bosnia and Herzegovina, and one concerning Yemen.\n\nThe remaining 12 Russian vetoes blocked U.N. actions involving the situation in Syria.\n\nRussia exercised six of its vetoes on Syria on the following chemical weapons-related resolutions:\n\nApril 10, 2018 \u2013 a resolution seeking a new mechanism for accountability on chemical weapon attacks in Syria.\n\nApril 12, 2017 \u2013a resolution on the April 4 chemical weapons attack on Khan Sheikhoun.\n\nUnder the Joint Investigative Mechanism, the U.N. and the Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) from 2015 to 2017 worked together to determine the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Russia blocked its renewal three times, claiming bias.\n\nAfter Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution on April 10 aimed at creating a new mechanism for accountability on chemical weapon attacks in Syria, U.S. Ambassador the United Nations Nikki Haley responded:\n\n\"Russia has trashed the credibility of the Council. They are not interested in unity or compromise. Whenever we propose anything meaningful on Russia, Russia vetoes it. It\u2019s a travesty. They have now officially vetoed resolutions that would hold these barbaric uses of chemical attacks by Assad six times. It did not need to turn out this way.\"\n\nThe UN measure was in response to reports about a chemical attack carried out on April 7 in the Syrian town of Douma -- the\u201cawful consequences\u201d of which, according to Peskov, are \u201cnot based on real data.\u201dPolygraph.info debunked Russia\u2019s claims that the chemical attack in Douma was \u201cfabricated.\u201d\n\nRecords of every UN Security Council veto going back to 1949 can also be found on the www.securitycouncilreport.orgwebsite.", "lang": "en"}
