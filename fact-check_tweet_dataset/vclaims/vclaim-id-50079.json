His stepping back came after Giuffre claimed Epstein made her have sex with several prominent men, including the prince, an allegation Prince Andrew has denied.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Newsnight, Prince Andrew said he has \u201cno recollection\u201d of meeting Giuffre, despite a photo showing him with his arm around her waist, according to The Associated Press. A post shared on Facebook now claims to show three additional photographs of the two together, with the caption saying, \u201cPrince Andrew forgets ever meeting Virginia Roberts & this is simply to jog his memory.\u201d\n\nBut this woman is not Giuffre. Multiple media reports identify the woman as Von Aspen, an American socialite. The photos first emerged in 2007 and were taken at a party that year in Saint Tropez, a town on the French Riviera, according to Reuters.

Maxwell, who has pleaded not guilty, will go on trial in 2021, according to BBC News.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
