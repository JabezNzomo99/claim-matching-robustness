Specifically, former state Rep. Edward Lindsey, R-Atlanta, said the state may need to revoke local governments\u2019 ability to levy sales taxes for nontransportation services such as education.\n\n\"The following two statements are both true: We have one of the lowest taxes on gasoline for transportation purposes in the country,\" he said. \"And we have some of the highest taxes on gasoline in the Southeast.\"\n\nHow can that be? We decided to check it out.\n\nFirst breaking the claim into two pieces, does Georgia have one of the nation\u2019s lowest gas taxes?\n\nYes, according to state motor fuel tax data from the Federation of Tax Administrators.\n\nGeorgians pay $19.3 cents in state taxes for every gallon of gasoline. That includes a 7.5-cent excise tax \u2013 or a special fixed tax paid on the purchase of specific items such as gasoline, alcohol and tobacco products.\n\nThe rest comes from a 4 percent sales tax the state levies on gasoline. As of January, that 4 percent sales tax translated into 11.8 cents.\n\nOnly 14 states had lower state tax rates, including both excise and state sales taxes. Three of them are our neighbors: South Carolina (16.75 cents per gallon), Florida (17.1 cents) and Alabama (18 cents).\n\nMotorists in our other two neighboring states paid more, 37.75 cents in North Carolina and 21.4 cents in Tennessee.\n\nSo far, so good. Georgia does in fact have some of the lowest taxes earmarked for transportation in the nation.\n\nBut to Lindsey\u2019s point, the state collections do not include the local sales taxes that drive up the cost at the pump but do not always end up fixing roads.\n\nThat\u2019s because Georgia state law allows all counties to levy a 1 percent special purpose local option sales tax, or SPLOST, for specific projects ranging from transportation to education.\n\nVoters must approve a SPLOST by referendum. Although some jurisdictions, such as Forsyth County, have successfully included road projects in their referendums, voters in metro Atlanta and some other regions in the state defeated a penny sales tax for transportation two years ago.\n\nThat is part of what has left roads, bridges and rails without enough money for repairs and growth \u2013 and why a study committee of politicians and business leaders is slated to recommend a new proposal by year\u2019s end.\n\nLindsey, who serves on that committee, unofficially known as the Plan B Committee, said he hopes drawing attention to the local sales taxes will show the state should wean local governments off those funds while simultaneously increasing the state collections, specifically for transportation projects.\n\n\"When we put a tax or a fee on gasoline, the average voter probably thinks those taxes are going to transportation and they\u2019re not,\" Lindsey said.\n\nBut are Georgians really paying some of the highest gas taxes in the region \u2013 and could therefore afford such a shift?\n\nThat\u2019s where the numbers get tricky.\n\nAn October breakdown of motor fuel taxes by the American Petroleum Institute -- including fees and local taxes -- pushes what Georgians pay to 27.49 cents per gallon.\n\nThose local taxes and fees have a dramatic effect in Florida, as anyone who has trundled down to Disney World can attest. The API shows motorists there pay a state average of 36.02 cents per gallon.\n\nNorth Carolina motorists pay even more, 36.75 cents per gallon, according to the API data (although less than what the Federation of Tax Administrators\u2019 data show).\n\nWes Clarke, a senior associate at the Carl Vinson Institute of Government at the University of Georgia, co-wrote a 2010 study that showed Georgia had one of the lowest gas taxes in the nation,\n\nThe API data, he said, show that Georgia still ranks third-highest of its neighbors (and all other Southern states, except Kentucky) when it comes to gas taxes.\n\nThe ranking is misleading, though.\n\nBased on the API data, Georgia could increase its gas tax by 8 cents a gallon \u2013 more than doubling the current excise tax \u2013 and remain in third.\n\nIn fact, the Fiscal Research Center in 2010 recommended a somewhat smaller increase to the excise tax \u2013 a penny a year for six years \u2013 to help solve Georgia\u2019s transportation woes.\n\nThat would bring Georgia up to the national average on excise taxes, without changing its ranking among neighboring states, said Peter Bluestone, a senior research associate at the Fiscal Research Center. That would result in less than a 0.3 percent increase at the gas station.\n\n\"Even if you add in the local taxes, we\u2019re in the middle,\" Bluestone said. \"We do recommend an increase that would keep us there.\"\n\nSo that means Lindsey is right in saying that Georgia has one of the lowest state tax rates in the nation.\n\nOther data show that, factoring in local taxes, Georgians still pay the third-most in the region when it comes to filling up at the pump.\n\nLindsey errs in thinking a third-place ranking means the state is on par with the top two, which are among the highest in the nation.\n\nHe undercuts his larger point about local gas taxes by ignoring Georgia falling a distant third in the region on what motorists pay for gasoline.\n\nBut looking at rankings alone, Georgians do pay among the highest at the pump for the region but the lowest in the nation.\n\nWe rate his statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
