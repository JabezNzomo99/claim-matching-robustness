Yet one of the major ways\n\nhappens when we touch a surface previously touched by an ill person or touch their hands directly.\n\nwent round to schools in October 2017 to teach children about the value of good hand hygiene.\n\nThe article contained several claims about the toll of diarrhoea and we zoomed in on two. Both were attributed to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (\n\nare a broad category which includes all infections that can be spread from one person to another, whether directly or indirectly. Included in this category are diarrhoea and a number of respiratory infections, such as pneumonia or flu. (\n\nThe CDC page Dettol provided as source does not contain the claim. It states that \u201cwashing hands with soap and water could reduce diarrheal disease-associated deaths by up to 50%\u201d and that it \u201ccan reduce the risk of respiratory infections by 16%\u201d.\n\nAfrica Check asked Dettol\u2019s public relations company for the correct citation, but is yet to receive it from Ogilvy SA\u2019s Brenda Sono.\n\nWhen we only look at diarrhoeal illnesses, a recent pooling of 22 studies including 54,006 participants across the globe by the\n\nof 30% (at least during the period that hand-washing was actively promoted).\n\n\u201cThe degree of infection-reduction obtained by hand hygiene depends on the type of communicable disease, disease transmission and context,\u201d Prof\n\n, director of the department for hospital hygiene at the\n\n\u201cIn healthcare settings, infection reduction studies report between 30% to 100% reduction, depending on the type of intervention and handwashing-agent used,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, the quality of the research conducted on general communities is not nearly as rigorous. The implication is that any data on the reduction of infection risk is dependant on the specific disease being studied, as well as the context in which the analysis takes place.\n\nFurthermore, the kind of handwashing required to really make a difference involves more than a quick splash. The Center for Disease Control\u2019s\n\nexplains you need to scrub for at least 20 sec with soap and water before and after you\u2019re likely to handle germs - for example, before preparing food or after playing with an animal.\n\nse claims this statistic was sourced from a 2015 study called \u201cMaking Common Infections Uncommon Study\u201d by the\n\n, an advocacy and research group funded by Dettols\u2019 parent company,\n\nAfrica Check was unable to find a copy of this online, but Ogilvy promised to trace it. We are yet to receive it, though.\n\nHowever, the same claim appears on the CDC\u2019s\n\npublished in The Lancet medical journal. As part of this study, global death statistics for children under five were examined. Data was drawn from 2010 estimates, with any gaps filled in by extrapolating from existing trends from 2000 onwards.\n\nThe 2010 data contradicts the claim, however. Of the 7.6 million deaths in children under five around the world in 2010, nearly two-thirds (64%) were due to infectious causes. Among these, diarrhoea was responsible for 801,000 deaths, with malaria (564,000), AIDS (159,000) and measles (114,000) taking a greater toll at 837,000 deaths.\n\n\u201cWhile you are right that the claim is not correct using the data for 2010, that reference is very out of date,\u201d one of the study\u2019s co-authors, Prof\n\n, told Africa Check. he is a professor of international health at the\n\nin the US.\n\n(for 2015), shows diarrhoeal deaths leading at 526,000 child deaths, with the other three causes add up to 466,000 deaths - malaria (306,000), AIDS (86,000) and measles (74,000).\n\nWhat about South Africa, where the article appeared?\n\nHere the claim does not hold up. The most recent figures\n\nshows HIV alone was responsible for 20.1% of under-5 deaths (9,600) in 2012, while diarrhoeal illnesses made up 16.5% (7,880).", "lang": "en"}
