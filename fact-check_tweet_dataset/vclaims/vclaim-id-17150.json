No, that's not true: the pictures were taken in 2015 during the Obama administration and show adult immigrants in overcrowded holding cells in Arizona.\n\nThe photos appeared in a tweet published on June 21, 2019 by Nancy Lee Grahn on Twitter (archived here) with the caption:\n\nThese are the two images in question:\n\nHowever the images were released as part of a lawsuit against conditions in holding cells in 2015 during the Obama administration:\n\nSeveral people on Twitter also criticized Grahn for leaving out the timestamp on the images that indicated they were from 2015, for example here:\n\nThis does not mean conditions in 2019 are any better (or worse). Recent reports from 2019 have indicated some pretty terrible conditions in two facilities in Texas where children were being held:\n\nOver 300 children were recently removed from one facility that was described as \"appalling\" by lawyers:\n\nIt is perfectly valid to criticize any administration that is responsible for such situations, but if you are going to use pictures to make the point it is probably a good idea to use imagery from the right time and place and actually taken during that administration.", "lang": "en"}
