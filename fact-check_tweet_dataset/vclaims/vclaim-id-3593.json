And Volodin seems to imply that powerful American lawmakers would be immune, which is wrong.\n\nWhile several lawmakers who were accused have denied mistreatment and not stepped down, the powerful chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, John Conyers, resigned, last year following multiple allegations of misconduct. Sen. Al Franken, a prominent Democrat, also resigned in 2017. Two Republican House members said they would leave Congress, one through resignation and the other not seeking reelection later this year.\n\nVolodin and his deputy appeared to be making the female journalists the issue, rather than those who are accused.\n\nHis deputy, Igor Lebedev, took Volodin\u2019s advice to \u201cchange jobs\u201d further --calling for the three female reporters to be barred from covering the Russian Parliament.\n\n\u201c\u2026I think, the sexual harassment accusations against Leonid Slutsky are severe violations of ethics, of the criminal code and an insult. We will be, on behalf of the fraction raising the issue of revoking the State Duma accreditation for these journalists,\u201d Lebedev wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u200bWhile Russian lawmakers appeared to protect eachother over the accusations,Pavel Gusev, the leader of the Moscow Union of Journalists said the union will launch an investigation on whether the three reporters have violated the journalistic code of ethics.\n\n\u201cThey have, to say it plainly, humiliated the profession,\u201d Gusev said, referring to the three women, in an interview to New York based Russian language TV channel RTVi.\n\nIn Russia, the #MeToo movement in the U.S. has been publicly shamed, while women across society who have lodged complaints of domestic abuse say there are few repercussions for the guilty men. A year ago, Putin\u2019s government decriminalized many forms of domestic violence.\n\nIn the U.S., the \u201cparadigm-shifting power\u201d of the #MeToo phenomenon has gained public support, and the participants lately have been praised as \u201csilence breakers\u201d and for their \u201crevolutionary\u201d contribution to the gender equality.", "lang": "en"}
