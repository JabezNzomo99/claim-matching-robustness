No, that's not true: the story about the bizarre and disgusting weight loss method was invented by a Canadian website that creates stories about weird crimes, bizarre sex acts and other strange events but purely for entertainment purposes. The entire thing was made up, it is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on November 22, 2018 titled \"Man lost 200 pounds in six month by drinking menstrual blood\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA man who began drinking his wife's menstrual blood in an effort to lose weight has lost over 225 pounds in six months thanks to his unusual diet.\n\n38-year old Martin Sanders from Milwaukee in Wisconsin, weighted over 400-lbs a few months ago when he decided to try a new diet of his own design. Martin Sanders lost an incredible 225-lbs in six months thanks to his blood drinking diet. He began ingesting by ingesting small quantities of blood collected from his wife as part of a high-protein diet.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so some people might have thought it was a real news article:\n\nMan lost 200 pounds in six month by drinking menstrual blood A man who began drinking his wife's menstrual blood in an effort to lose weight has lost over 225 pounds in six months thanks to his unusual diet. 38-year old Martin Sanders from Milwaukee in Wisconsin, weighted over 400-lbs a few months ago when he decided to try a new diet of his own design.\n\nThe picture that illustrated the story was real though, but it showed Zach Moore, a man from Florida who lost 295 pounds after gastric bypass surgery and drastic changes to his diet and habits (and not by drinking menstrual blood, to be clear):\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories. The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Trans-species Man Did NOT Identifies as Turkey & Does NOT Want to Ban Thanksgiving Day\n\u2022 Fake News: Drug Dealer NOT Busted After Calling 911 to Report 150-lbs of Cocaine Stolen\n\u2022 Fake News: Hells Angels Did NOT Sue Canadian Government For $2 Billion Revenue Loss Over Legalization of Marijuana\n\u2022 Fake News: Alleged Son of Adolf Hitler NOT Planning to Write Sequel to Mein Kampf\n\u2022 Fake News: Woman Did NOT Sue Ex-roommate For $1.2m For Training Her Parrot to Sexually Harass Her", "lang": "en"}
