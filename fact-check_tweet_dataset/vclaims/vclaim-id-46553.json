The viral video is old and was in circulation since 2014 on social media. The incident has nothing to do with West Bengal.\n\nFacebook user Rajesh Rawat\u2019s post was shared by more than 52,000 people at the time of writing this article. More than 4,000 users commented on it. While most users believed the claim, others doubted if the incident was from Bengal.\n\nIn the 30-second video, a man in red shirt tied up in chain is being thrashed by a police officer in presence of other policemen. The officer is talking in Hindi and using expletives while thrashing the man with a stick. The man can be heard saying Jai Bajrang Bali repeatedly.\n\nSplitting up the video in key-frames through InVid and using reverse image search, we found that the video was in circulation on YouTube for the last five years.\n\nIndia Zone published the video on YouTube on September 30, 2014. YouTuber Virender Roj uploaded it in 2015.\n\nIn 2016, a YouTube channel called Akhil Bhartiya Chutiyapa Department uploaded the same video with the caption, Police in UP beats hell out of people and no one has daring to stop him.\n\nIn 2017, Fact Check website Alt News debunked a separate claim made on the same viral video.\n\nThe claim was originally made by a Bengal BJP leader on Facebook and circulated in other social media platforms. It claimed that a Hindu man was beaten up on Hanuman Jayanti (April 11, 2017) by two Muslim IPS officers in Birbhum.\n\nTarun Sengupta, BJP\u2019s IT cell head in Asansol, posted the fake claim along with the viral video on his Facebook page on April 17, 2017. The post is not available on Facebook now.\n\nThe Bengal CID, who handled this case, later tweeted and confirmed that Sengupta had been arrested for spreading fake news and creating communal disharmony. CID attached the screen shot of Sengupta\u2019s FB post, which shows an image of the viral video.\n\nBengali news website Zee 24 Ghonta published the same news in July, 2017.\n\nFact Checker Fact crescendo recently did a report on the same video.\n\nWe could not independently confirm the exact location and date of the incident. But it is confirmed that the video is over five years old and the incident was not from West Bengal.", "lang": "en"}
