Republicans have only 52 senators, so only two can oppose a deal for Vice President Pence to cast the tie-breaking vote. Thus far, the negotiations on a bill to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a new law have been conducted in secrecy, leaving critical details unclear.\n\nWhen the Affordable Care Act was debated in 2009-2010, the process initially was different. There were 58 Democrats and two independents who voted with them, meaning that if the party stood together, the majority could avoid a filibuster by Republicans. The bills were drafted in various committees, numerous amendments were offered by Republicans, and there were efforts to win Republican support. (One Republican, Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, even voted to approve a health-care bill at the committee level.) We described that process at length in a previous fact check.\n\nIn the Senate, the bills that emerged from the committees were ultimately merged into a single bill in the office of Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) \u2014 what was decried at the time by Republicans as an overly secret process. The Senate held days of public debate, but the real work went on behind the scenes as Reid cut deals to win the support of moderate Democrats. On Christmas Eve, five days after the negotiated text was unveiled, the Senate passed the bill on a partisan vote of 60 to 39. (For more on this process, read our history lesson.)\n\nBefore the House and Senate versions of the health-care law could be merged through a conference committee, however, the Democrats lost their 60-vote majority when a Republican won a special election in Massachusetts. With just 59 votes in the Senate, Democrats opted to get over the finish line by using the reconciliation process in the Senate, prompting renewed outrage of legislative sleight-of-hand from Republicans.\n\nIn both cases, the party in power opted for reconciliation (50 votes) to pass a bill. McConnell in 2010 denounced it as a \u201cpartisan route\u201d and \u201clegislative sleight-of-hand.\u201d McConnell\u2019s staff argues that he faced from the start absolutely no cooperation from Democrats \u2014 who have insisted that the Senate focus on repairing the Affordable Care Act, not repealing it. But Democrats have charged that McConnell, in 2009-2010, shut down efforts at bipartisan cooperation, forcing them to rely only on Democrats. In any case, in 2009-2010, Democrats briefly did obtain one Republican vote, though not on final passage.\n\nDuring the Affordable Care Act process, McConnell repeatedly decried closed-door negotiations, especially for a bill that fared poorly in opinion polls. But polling indicates the Republican replacement is even less popular \u2014 the House version polls at 29 percent, with opposition in every state in the nation \u2014 and the bill-writing process has become even less transparent.\n\n\u201cThe extreme secrecy is a situation without precedent, at least in creating health law,\u201d Rovner wrote, though noting that the Democrats had helped lay the track in earlier legislative debates. \u201cRepublicans plan to move more quickly and less deliberatively than Democrats did in drafting the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Kliff wrote. \u201cThey intend to do this despite repeatedly and angrily criticizing the Affordable Care Act for being moved too quickly and with too little deliberation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s often a chicken-or-egg question about which party is responsible for the latest partisan outrage. The ACA ultimately was passed on a partisan vote, crippling it from the start because Republicans had no incentive or inclination to ever help fix it. That is now often cited as justification for repealing the law in a strictly partisan manner.\n\nBut it\u2019s also clear that McConnell\u2019s position has changed, even though he will not acknowledge it. He was against the reconciliation process for health care in 2010; he has embraced it now. He was against secrecy and closed-door dealmaking before; he now oversees the most secretive health-care bill process ever. And he was against voting on a bill that was broadly unpopular \u2014 and now he is pushing for a bill even more unpopular than the ACA in 2010.", "lang": "en"}
