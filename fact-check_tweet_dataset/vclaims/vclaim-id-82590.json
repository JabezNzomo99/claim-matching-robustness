Later, we see Kumar Vishwas, who appears to be recording a voice over, speaking to Kejriwal in Hindi. The duo are having a conversation on issues related to the campaign ahead of the Delhi polls.\n\nThe video is accompanied by a message in Hindi which translates to, \"Managed to find this video with great difficulty. Please watch, all.\"\n\nThe archived versions of the post can be accessed here and here.\n\nWhile the message implies that the footage was meant to be a secret, the video is nothing but a clip from the 2017-socio-political documentary 'An Insignificant Man', which traces the journey of the Aam Aadmi Party from a movement to taking the reigns of Delhi in the 2015 Delhi legislative assembly election.\n\nThis is not first time that the video has gone viral. The same video was earlier posted on Facebook page Mission Modi 2019 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0947 100 \u092e\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u091c\u094b\u0921\u093c\u0947\u0902 on February 4, 2018. The post had been shared over 1,70,000 times since then.\n\nClipped from the documentary An Insignificant Man, you can see the visuals below.\n\nIt was also debunked by ABP News' Virach Sach in 2018.", "lang": "en"}
