The clip carries the news that Amit Shah had said to the VHP cadre that they (government) would not allow a state to have Muslim majority population when the whole of India is a Hindu majority; so, they (government) would change the demography of Kashmir in just four years. Let\u2019s check the authenticity of that news clip.\n\n\n\nClaim: Amit Shah had said to the VHP cadre that they would change the demography of Kashmir in just four years. Fact: The newspaper clip of \u2018Hindustan times\u2019 carrying that news is an edited one. The original article carried the news that Amit Shah has reworked Kashmir\u2019s domicile law by including those who were residing in the state for 15 years. The writer of the original article, \u2018Neeraj Chauhan\u2019, has also clarified that the information in the clip is fake and it is an edited one. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nIn the photo, it can be seen that the article in the newspaper clip was written by \u2018Neeraj Kumar\u2019 for the \u2018Hindustan Times\u2019. In the article, it was reported that Amit Shah would change the demography of Kashmir by changing the Muslim ratio in the state by allowing more Hindus into the state by offering them plots for residence, industries and commercial establishments.\n\nWhen searched on Google with the keywords in the news clip, no such article was found. But, when the image in the clip is cropped and subjected to reverse image search, an article of \u2018Hindustan Times\u2019 was found. The article was about Amit Shah reworking Kashmir\u2019s domicile law by including those who were residing in the state for 15 years. It reported that Amit Shah had assured a delegation of Kashmiri leaders last month that the apprehensions about the Union Territory\u2019s demographic changes were baseless. It also carried the information that the government has redefined domicile rules for Kashmir and ordered that only people who fulfill that criteria are eligible to be appointed to junior posts in the bureaucracy and the constabulary. The article had the same image, author, and date as that of the one in the clip. So, the news clip in the post is an edited one.\n\nAlso, the writer of the article and Associate Editor of the Hindustan Times, Neeraj Chouhan, has tweeted and clarified that the information in the clip is fake and it is an edited one.\n\nTo sum it up, a photoshopped news clip is being shared to falsely claim that Amit Shah wanted to change the demography of Kashmir in four years.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
