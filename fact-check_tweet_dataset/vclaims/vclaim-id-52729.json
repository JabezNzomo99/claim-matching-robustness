And I think they told me yesterday a number -- if you add up the rest of the world, we've done more testing,\" Trump said during a meeting with New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy on April 30, 2020.\n\nALSO READ: Did Donald Trump Tweet About Barack Obama's Handling Of H1N1 In 2009?\n\nTest results in the United States number more than 6.3 million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nBut Germany has conducted more than 2.5 million tests, Italy and Spain more than 1.3 million each, and Turkey more than one million, while Britain has tested more than 750,000 people, combining for a total of more than 6.8 million -- 500,000 above the US total.\n\nAnd other countries whose citizens have been hit by the virus -- such as India and South Korea -- are carrying out testing as well.\n\nCOVID-19 -- which is caused by the novel coronavirus -- has killed more than 233,000 people and devastated the global economy.\n\nWhile Trump has routinely praised his administration's handling of the crisis, he has been criticized for statements he made that downplayed the danger of the virus, such as comparing it to the common flu or saying that the risk it posed to the American people was \"very low.\"\n\nTrump also claimed during the meeting that \"the last administration left us nothing\" and that \"we started off with bad, broken tests and obsolete tests.\"\n\nHe repeated this claim when pressed by a journalist on how this could be true since the virus is new, saying: \"We had tests that were obsolete. We had tests that didn't take care of people.\"\n\nBut the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 \"were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019,\" according to the World Health Organization.", "lang": "en"}
