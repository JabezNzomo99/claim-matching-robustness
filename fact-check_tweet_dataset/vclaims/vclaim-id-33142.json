The company\u2019s sales are primarily focused on the U.S. market, according to a statement from Constellation Brands. Only 2.7% of the company\u2019s $8.1 billion in sales of all its products were outside the U.S. in fiscal year 2019.\n\nMisinformation about the beer was fueled by a survey that claimed some beer drinkers stopped buying Corona beer because of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The survey about the Mexican-based lager was released Feb. 27 by 5W Public Relations and picked up by several news outlets.\n\nThe New York-based public relations firm said it conducted phone interviews with 737 beer drinkers in the U.S. and found that 38% \u201cwould not buy Corona under any circumstances.\u201d But the company did not publicize the survey questions or state why more than a third of those surveyed would not buy the beer. The percentage of regular Corona drinkers who said they wouldn\u2019t buy the beer was much smaller.\n\n\u201cAmong those who said they usually drink Corona, only 4% said they would stop drinking Corona,\u201d the firm said, \u201cbut 14% said they wouldn\u2019t order Corona in a public venue.\u201d\n\nIt also claimed that 16% of those surveyed were confused about whether the beer was related to coronavirus, which has spread to more than 700 people in the U.S. and killed more than 20.\n\nThe two names do share the common Latin root corona, which refers to a halo or crown. The beer reportedly derives its name and logo from the crown that adorns the Cathedral of Our Lady of Guadalupe in the town of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. The name of the disease refers to the crown-like spikes seen through a microscope on the surface of the virus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely unfortunate that recent misinformation about the impact of this virus on our business has been circulating in traditional and social media without further investigation or validation,\u201d Bill Newlands, president and chief executive officer at Constellation Brands, said in the company statement. \u201cThese claims simply do not reflect our business performance and consumer sentiment, which includes feedback from our distributor and retailer partners across the country. We\u2019ve seen no impact to our people, facilities or operations and our business continues to perform very well.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
