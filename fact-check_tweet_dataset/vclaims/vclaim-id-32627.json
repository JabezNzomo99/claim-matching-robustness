Comedian John Fugelsang claimed credit for the quote in 2013.\n\nCarter served as president from 1977 to 1981 and later established himself as an international humanitarian. In 1982, he and his wife Rosalynn cofounded the Carter Center, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting human rights around the globe.\n\nWhile Carter has often spoken and written about the subject of Christianity, there is no evidence that he originated the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. It does not appear in the Carter Center\u2019s archive of his many speeches and op-eds, nor in the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum\u2019s digital collection.\n\nAn internet search also revealed no credible sources linking the statement to Carter. (RELATED: Did Patrick Henry Say The US Was Founded On Christianity?)\n\nThe quote, debunked by Snopes in 2014, appears to have originated with Fugelsang, a comedian and television personality. He uttered the statement during a May 2013 segment called \u201cRevoltingly Fake Christian of the Week\u201d on the Current TV\u2019s \u201cViewpoint\u201d program. (The show is no longer available online.)\n\nIn September 2013, Fugelsang clarified via Twitter that he was the actual source of the quotation. \u201cThis quote was widely attributed to Jimmy Carter,\u201d Fugelsang tweeted. \u201cI apologize to him for it.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
