But the opposite is actually the case; employees and customers of businesses in the US state are generally required to wear masks due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, and those not following the guidelines should be reported, the department says.\n\n\u201cIf ur refused service at a store for no mask call the dept of health and report the store,\u201d says a post published on April 28, 2020, which includes a phone number for the Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH).\n\n\u201cThe masks are suggested, not required,\u201d it says.\n\nThe same claim is made in other Facebook posts here, here and here.\n\nThe phone number listed in the posts appears on the Pennsylvania DOH website, which says it can be contacted 24/7 to \u201creport a Public Health Emergency or AN IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIABLE CONDITION.\u201d\n\n\u201cStores and businesses that are not following guidance regarding wearing a mask are what are to be reported. Stores have the right, as defined in our Worker Safety Order, to refuse service to anyone not wearing a mask,\u201d Nate Wardle, press secretary of the Pennsylvania DOH, told AFP by email.\n\nPennsylvania\u2019s Worker Safety Order says essential businesses must require all customers to wear masks, and deny entry to individuals not wearing them.\n\nThere is an exception for businesses \u201cproviding medication, medical supplies, or food, in which case the business must provide alternative methods of pick-up or delivery of such goods.\u201d\n\nAnd people who cannot wear a mask due to a medical condition may enter the premises, the order says.\n\nThe Pennsylvania State Police communications director, Ryan Tarkowski, previously told AFP that businesses can be fined for not following safety guidelines.\n\n\u201cYou have to wear a mask if you go to the grocery store. If you don\u2019t wear a mask in the grocery store, the store would be fined for not ensuring that you\u2019re wearing the mask,\u201d he said.\n\nAs of May 20, Pennsylvania had more than 63,000 cases of the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 323,000 people worldwide since it emerged in China in late 2019.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 460 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus crisis.
