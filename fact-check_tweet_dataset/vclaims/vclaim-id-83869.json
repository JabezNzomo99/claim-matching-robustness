This is false; the official presidential election results, announced by the electoral commission and certified by local and international observers, handed victory to sitting President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHope For Nigeria, a Facebook page notorious for misinformation and misleading content, uploaded the screenshot of a spreadsheet claiming to show authentic results from the just-concluded poll.\n\nThat post, which has been shared at least 5,700 times, says the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) \u201chave exactly these same figures\u201d.\n\nThe post claims that Buhari polled 12,275,296 votes, while his main challenger Atiku had 14,442,550 votes to his name -- making him the winner of the election.\n\nThe same spreadsheet was shared by Eunice Atuejide, the presidential candidate of the National Interest Party (NIP). Her party was one of the smaller parties which declared support for Atiku before the election.\n\nAccording to official INEC figures, Buhari won the election with 15,191,847 votes. Atiku polled 11,262,978 votes to come in second place.\n\nThe US Mission in Nigeria and the Youth Initiative For Advocacy Growth & Advancement (YIAGA) are among a number of observers who have verified the election results.", "lang": "en"}
