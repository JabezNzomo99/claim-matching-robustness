John McCain, R-Ariz., won his Aug. 30 primary and has since shifted jabs to his Democratic challenger, U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick of Flagstaff, ahead of November\u2019s general election.\n\nA recent political advertisement attempts to portray Kirkpatrick as dishonest -- noting that she mostly votes along party lines (a pro-McCain PAC made this same claim, we rated it Mostly True) -- and turned her back on the state.\n\n\"Kirkpatrick betrayed Arizona on Obamacare, walking out on constituents when questioned about it,\" the ad, which was published Sept. 6, says, showing Kirkpatrick walking out of an Aug. 6, 2009, meeting in Holbrook, Ariz.\n\nWe wondered -- did Kirkpatrick really walk out on constituents who had questions about the Affordable Care Act?\n\nThe event in question was pegged as one of several \"Chats with Ann.\" A press release before the event notes that these chats, held at Safeway grocery stores, were meant for people who wanted to \"discuss their concerns and issues.\"\n\nMcCain campaign spokeswoman Lorna Romero pointed out that Kirkpatrick said in a subsequent interview with the White Mountain Independent that the chat was to give folks a chance to talk about \"health insurance reform and getting our economy back on track.\"\n\nBut why did Kirkpatrick walk out?\n\nPolitico reported that the event was overrun by protesters, noting that conservative interest groups had organized opposition to similar events across the country. Conservatives for Patients\u2019 Rights, an anti-health care reform group, did have the Kirkpatrick\u2019s event listed on their website.\n\nThe same White Mountain Independent article also notes people were upset because \"she wasn\u2019t addressing the crowd as a whole.\"\n\n\"Ann was trying to answer questions, and was shouted down,\" Kirkpatrick spokesman D.B. Mitchell said.\n\nWe were unable to find a full video from the 2009 chat, but an extended clip does appear to show several people shouting.\n\nOther members of Congress faced similar disruptions across the country in August 2009. NPR reported that some congressional town halls ended in \"fistfights, arrests, and even hospitalizations.\"\n\nThe ad fails to mention that Kirkpatrick went back to Holbrook for a town hall meeting on health care a month later.\n\n\"I think a key component is competitiveness and choice, but I also think we need to take personal responsibility for our health,\" Kirkpatrick said during the town hall.\n\nFrom The Associated Press:\n\n\"Kirkpatrick returned to Holbrook weeks after she walked out of a one-on-one \u2018Chat with Ann\u2019 event at a local grocery store. Protesters had urged her to make it more of a public forum and called her a \u2018nitwit\u2019 as she left.\"\n\nThe ad claims, \"Kirkpatrick betrayed Arizona on Obamacare, walking out on constituents when questioned about it.\"\n\nWhile Kirkpatrick did walk out of the Holbrook grocery store, the ad fails to mention the protesters -- and that she returned for a health care town hall a month later.\n\nOn balance, we rate the ad\u2019s claim Half True.", "lang": "en"}
