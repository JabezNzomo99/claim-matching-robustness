The comments made by Mr V\u00e9ran, who is a qualified doctor and neurologist, have been widely reported in the British press.\n\nSome health professionals have warned that paracetamol is preferable to ibuprofen, as it is less likely to cause side effects in people with underlying health issues, who are also more susceptible to Covid-19. (Cortisone is not commonly used in the UK to relieve symptoms like fever.)\n\nUntil March 16, when this article was first published, NHS advice for people self-isolating because of the new coronavirus recommended drinking lots of water and taking \u201ceveryday painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, to help with your symptoms\u201d.\n\nHowever, the NHS has now changed this guidance. Although it says there is \u201ccurrently no strong evidence that ibuprofen can make coronavirus (Covid-19) worse\u201d, it recommends using paracetamol to treat the symptoms \u201cuntil we have more information\u201d. The exception to this is if a doctor has told you not to use paracetamol.\n\nIt adds that, if you are taking ibuprofen or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAID) on the advice of a doctor, you should not stop doing so without checking first.\n\nExperts have warned paracetamol may be preferable to ibuprofen\n\nDr Charlotte Warren-Gash, associate professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that NSAIDs like ibuprofen \u201cshould be prescribed with caution for people who have underlying health conditions\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor Covid-19, research is needed into the effects of specific NSAIDs among people with different underlying health conditions, which takes into account the severity of infection. In the meantime, for treating symptoms such as fever and sore throat, it seems sensible to stick to paracetamol as first choice.\u201d\n\nDr Rupert Beale, group leader in cell biology of infection at The Francis Crick Institute, said: \u201cThere is good reason to avoid ibuprofen as it may exacerbate acute kidney injury brought on by any severe illness, including severe Covid-19 disease.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t yet any widely accepted additional reason to avoid it for Covid-19.\u201d\n\nProfessor Paul Little, professor of primary care research at the University of Southampton, said there was \u201csizeable literature\u201d from case control studies in several countries that the complications of respiratory infections - whether respiratory, septic or cardiovascular complications - can be \u201cmore common when NSAIDs are used.\u201d\n\nHe added that using paracetamol was \u201cless likely to result in complications\u201d.\n\nThe old advice from Public Health England\n\nOn 16 March, Public Health England confirmed there is not enough information on ibuprofen use and Covid-19 to advise people to stop using ibuprofen, and said there is no published scientific evidence that ibuprofen increases the risk of catching Covid-19 or makes the illness worse.\n\nFull Fact contacted PHE for more information about the decision to change the NHS guidance the next day, but has not yet received a response.\n\nAsked by the government\u2019s health and science committee about the concerns over taking ibuprofen on 17 March, government chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the warnings \u201cmay or may not be right, I don\u2019t know. But the sensible thing to do I think would be to say well don\u2019t take it at the moment. Take something else, paracetamol or something.\u201d\n\nIf taking any painkillers, you should always follow the instructions on the label and make sure you do not exceed the stated dose.\n\nPatients prescribed NSAIDs for long-term health problems should take them as directed by a healthcare professional.", "lang": "en"}
