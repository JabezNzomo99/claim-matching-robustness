Unfortunately for the measure\u2019s supporters, amendments require at least 60 percent of the vote to pass.\n\nThat close margin means that medical marijuana will continue to be debated, and not just in Florida. Two dozen states have medical marijuana laws, and Oregon and the District of Columbia voted to decriminalize recreational pot in the same general election.\n\nBen Pollara, the campaign manager for the group behind the amendment, United for Care, tweeted two days after the election that the drug proved more popular than Florida\u2019s governors.\n\nThe tweet read: \"#YesOn2 got a higher % of the vote than the last 6 #flgov including @JebBush in his 2002 landslide #tallyorbust #2016.\"\n\nWe know the last couple of elections Gov. Rick Scott hasn\u2019t even had to break 50 percent of the total votes in order to win, but is Pollara right about the last six Florida governors not garnering as much as 57.6 percent?\n\nThe Twitter shorthand \"#flgov\" generally refers to the gubernatorial campaign, but has been used interchangeably to denote any tweet about a governor, too. We reached out to Pollara to ask him to clarify whether he meant the last six governors or the last six gubernatorial elections, because there\u2019s a difference.\n\nPollara told us he meant the last six gubernatorial elections, going back to Lawton Chiles\u2019 victory over Jeb Bush in 1994.\n\nBut because of the tweet\u2019s wording, we looked at the last six governors elected, some of whom served two terms, going back to the 1978 campaign. Keep in mind, we\u2019re looking for governors who won 57.6 percent of the vote or higher.\n\nIf we were to look only at the last six elections, Pollara could be correct, because the highest margin of victory going back to 1994 was Bush\u2019s 56 percent in 2002 against Bill McBride. As Pollara noted when we contacted him, if you\u2019re counting that way, it could be the last eight elections.\n\nBut if we\u2019re going by individuals elected governor, there\u2019s one obvious outlier: Graham, who was immensely popular and beat Republican state legislator Skip Bafalis with 64.7 percent of the vote in 1982.\n\nFor comparison, Amendment 2 garnered for the measure to get that 57.6 percent. That\u2019s more individual votes than any winning candidate has ever received.\n\nPollara said Amendment 2 won a higher percentage of the vote than the last six Florida governors, including Bush\u2019s 2002 landslide.\n\nHe\u2019s right about the 2002 contest, and when you look back at the last six elections (eight, really) as Pollara intended, that\u2019s true, too. But there\u2019s a glaring outlier when you look at the last six people elected governor -- Graham\u2019s 1982 win, when he garnered 64.7 percent of the vote.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
