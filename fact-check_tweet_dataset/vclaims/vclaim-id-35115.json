The claim is misleading; the activist, Trupti Desai, has campaigned successfully for women to be given full access to both Hindu and Muslim religious sites; she told AFP she entered the inner sanctum of the Islamic shrine mentioned in the post in 2016, after a court ruling granted women access.\n\nThe photo of Desai and four other men was published here on Facebook on November 26, 2019, where it has been shared hundreds of times.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cTrupti Desai Felicitated by Muslims for her efforts to desecrate the #Sabarimala #Ayyappa Temple. But she was not allowed to Inner sanctum of Haji Ali Dargah.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nSabarimala is a famous temple dedicated to the Hindu deity Ayyappa in Kerala, a southern Indian state.\n\nThe Haji Ali Dargah is a historic mosque and the final resting place of a Muslim saint in India's financial capital Mumbai.\n\nDesai's Bhumata Brigade have campaigned for both holy sites to allow women entry.\n\nIn 2016, the Haji Ali Dargah told India's Supreme Court it would grant women access to the tomb in the 15th-century building. Here is an AFP report on the legal dispute.\n\nDesai welcomed the development in a speech posted on Facebook by Indian television channel Times Now here.\n\nIn September 2018, India's Supreme Court overturned a decades-old ban on women of menstruating age -- deemed as those between 10 and 50 -- setting foot inside the gold-plated Sabarimala temple. Here is an AFP report on the issue.\n\nDesai welcomed that ruling in an interview she streamed live on her Facebook page here on September 28, 2018.\n\nThe photo was also shared alongside a similar claim here, here and here on Facebook, and here and here on Twitter.\n\nThe claim is misleading. Desai told AFP she was allowed to enter part of the Muslim shrine's inner sanctum following the 2016 court decision.\n\nThe Bombay High court ruled on August 26, 2016 that women must be allowed access to Haji Ali Dargah\u2019s inner sanctum, which houses the tomb of the Muslim saint.\n\nIn a 56-page ruling, the court said excluding women violated the Indian Constitution and said women must be \u201cpermitted to enter the sanctum sanctorum at par with men.\u201d\n\nThe court also ordered local authorities to \u201ctake effective steps to ensure the safety and security of women at the said place of worship.\u201d\n\nThe verdict was widely reported in national and international media at that time, for example here, here and here. AFP covered the decision here.\n\nDesai entered part of the Haji Ali Dargah\u2019s inner sanctum two days after the court verdict, according to national media reports, for example here.\n\n\"As per the court verdict, both men and women are allowed access until a certain point in the innermost sanctum at Haji Ali Dargah,\u201d Desai told AFP by phone on December 4.\n\n\u201cI visited the inner sanctum as per the court mandated guidelines and was allowed entry.\"\n\nThe image in the misleading post shows a celebratory event that followed the Sabarimala decision, which was live streamed on Desai's Facebook page here.\n\nThe same individuals, wearing the same clothes, can be seen in the live stream and in the photo used in the misleading post.\n\nDesai said the people at the event were religious leaders from multiple communities, including Muslim community members, according to this report in the Quint, an India-based news site.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Facebook live video on Trupti Desai's page:\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to review its 2018 order granting women of all ages access to Sabarimala temple, a decision that has faced sustained opposition from right wing Hindu groups.\n\nLast week, Desai abandoned plans to enter Sabarimala due to security concerns after police denied her group protection, national media reported here.", "lang": "en"}
