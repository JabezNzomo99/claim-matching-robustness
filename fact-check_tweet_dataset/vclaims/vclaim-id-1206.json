The text reads \u201cPedophilia is a natural sexual orientation\u201d and the first logo below is the recognizable red letters of TED, the popular American organizer of online talks. The suggestion that TED endorses this message is false. The advertisement is fabricated.\n\nThe post has been flagged multiple times as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to curb misinformation. As of this check\u2019s publishing, recent iterations have over 2 million views. \u201cAd on Facebook today. You see what is happening?\u201d, the caption on one post reads (here).\n\nThis image was never part of any promotional material endorsed by TED. A spokesperson for TED confirmed this to Reuters via email: \u201cTED has not had a hand in creating or approving this ad.\u201d The photograph used in the Facebook posts is a stock image visible here .\n\nThe earliest iteration in high definition that Reuters was able to find stems from a 2018 4chan thread here in which users posted photoshopped images in response to a Breitbart article about a May 2018 TEDx talk at a university in Germany (here).\n\nAccording to TED, TEDx talks are created independently from TED, and TEDx content is not controlled by TED (here).\n\nThe TEDxUniversityofWurzburg talk in question featured a speaker who examined the perception of pedophilia. The video was later removed from the TEDx YouTube channel by the TEDx organiser, according to TED.\n\nIn a statement, TED said: \u201cAfter reviewing the talk, we believe it cites research in ways that are open to serious misinterpretation. This led some viewers to interpret the talk as an argument in favor of an illegal and harmful practice. TED would like to make clear that it does not promote pedophilia.\u201d (here)\n\nTED noted that the speaker stated clearly in the talk that \u201cabusing children is wrong without any doubt\u201d and added that she had requested the video was removed from YouTube due to concerns for her safety.\n\nFalse. The picture being shared in social media posts is fabricated and designed to look like an advertising campaign supported by TED.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
