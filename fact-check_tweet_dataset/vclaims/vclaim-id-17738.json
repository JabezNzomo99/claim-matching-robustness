Now, one more video of Rahul Gandhi has gone viral.\n\nIn the 10-second clip, Gandhi can be heard saying, \u201c\u0915\u0940 \u0915\u093f\u0938\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u093e \u0915\u0930\u094d\u095b\u093e \u092e\u093e\u095e \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u093e \u091a\u093e\u0939\u093f\u090f \u0915\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0902\u0915\u093f \u0905\u0917\u0930 \u0915\u093f\u0938\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u093e \u0915\u0930\u094d\u095b\u093e \u092e\u093e\u095e \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0924\u094b \u0915\u093f\u0938\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u0940 \u0906\u0926\u0924 \u0959\u0930\u093e\u092c \u0939\u094b \u091c\u093e\u090f\u0917\u0940 (Farmers\u2019 loans shouldn\u2019t be waived-off because if they are, farmers will get used to loan waivers- translation)\u201d.\n\n\n\nOn December 19, one Sunil Nehra had posted this clip on a Facebook group with a message, \u201c\u0925\u094b\u0921\u093c\u093e \u0935\u093e\u092f\u0930\u0932 \u0915\u0930 \u0926\u094b\u0917\u0947 \u0924\u094b 4 \u0926\u093f\u0928 \u092c\u093e\u0926 \u092e\u093e\u092b\u0940 \u092e\u093e\u0902\u0917\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0941\u090f \u0928\u091c\u0930 \u0906\u090f\u0917\u093e (Make it go viral and you will see him apologizing after four days)\u201d. At the time of writing this article, it had been shared close to 21,000 times.\n\nSeveral other individuals on Facebook and Twitter have shared this same video with the identical narrative.\n\nA Twitter user @Lala_The_Don had tweeted the clip on June 18, 2018 claiming, \u201cthis is what Rahul baba thinks about farmer and farmers loan waiver\u201d. It was one of the earliest instances that Alt News could trace. The same clip, shared at around the same time by Rag Darbari, a Facebook page has been shared more than 22,000 times and viewed over 500,000 times. BJP leader Atmaram Patel also shared this clip from Rag Darbari suggesting that Rahul Gandhi made such a statement.\n\nMerged clips of the same speech\n\nBoom Live had earlier fact-checked the same claim. We found that this video was clipped from a speech delivered by Rahul Gandhi at a public rally in Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh.\n\nAt 27:52 in the above video, Rahul Gandhi can be heard saying, \u201cLast year, the Indian government had waived off Rs 2.5 lakh crore debt of India\u2019s top 15 industrialists but the same government which can forgive Rs 2.5 lakhs crore for these fifteen people, cannot write off the debt of crores of farmers. Their leaders say that farmers\u2019 loans shouldn\u2019t be waived-off because if they are, farmers will get used to getting remittances. It\u2019s a strange world, where the richest people in India won\u2019t get used to their loan getting waived off.\u201d Gandhi was actually taking a jibe at BJP leaders for saying that farmers will get habituated to loan waivers.\n\nThis video was maliciously clipped to suggest that Rahul Gandhi made a statement against farm loan waivers, when the opposite was promised by him in his election campaign.", "lang": "en"}
