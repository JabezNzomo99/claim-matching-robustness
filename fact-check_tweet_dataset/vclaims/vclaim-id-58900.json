We know that we\u2019ll now right? He is of the deep state you get instructions from him. Cut the crap! All to take Trump down!\u201d\n\nBut the photo is not from \u201cthe Wuhan lab\u201d; the tweet distorts the facts regarding federal funds and the Wuhan Institute of Virology; and the image does not show Gates.\n\nA reverse image search of the picture showed the photo originated on a blog run by the National Institutes of Health. The post shows that the photo was taken in December 2014 \u2014 in the U.S.\n\nThe picture captured Obama touring the NIH Vaccine Research Center at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nObama was speaking with Dr. Nancy Sullivan, of NIAID, about Ebola research. And Fauci was speaking with former Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell \u2014 not Melinda Gates.\n\nThe tweet\u2019s claim that \u201cthey paid the lab 3.7 million for a \u2018bat\u2019 project,\u201d meanwhile, is a repeat of a distortion that we\u2019ve addressed multiple times before.\n\nThat figure refers to an NIH grant \u2014 which actually totaled $3.4 million \u2014 awarded to EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S.-based research group that was studying the risk of future emergence of coronaviruses from bats.\n\nThe organization first received the grant in 2014 and the grant was renewed in 2019 for another five years, EcoHealth\u2019s spokesman, Robert Kessler, told us previously. EcoHealth received $292,161 in 2019 (part of the total $3.4 million that it received) and NIH terminated the grant in April.\n\nEcoHealth worked with the Wuhan Institute of Virology \u2014 a collaborator approved by the State Department and NIH \u2014 but the lab received only $600,000 of the grant over the years, Kessler said in May.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
