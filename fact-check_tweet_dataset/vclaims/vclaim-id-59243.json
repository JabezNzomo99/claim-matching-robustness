Term limits prevented him from running for re-election.\n\n \n\n Recalling that lawmakers debated many contentious issues the past two years, including collective bargaining reform, bills expanding gun rights, bills dealing with abortion and election law reform, PolitiFact Ohio checked out Niehaus\u2019 claim of cooperation.\n\n \n\n Niehaus spokeswoman Angela Meleca cited 191 of the 241 bills the Senate passed in the last two years that had bipartisan support. According to Meleca\u2019s figures, the bills with bipartisan support represent just over 79 percent of the total bills passed.\n\n \n\n Meleca said the Senate clerk\u2019s office provided the figures and Vincent Keeran, the Senate clerk, confirmed the figures.\n\n \n\n Bills were considered to have bipartisan support if the majority of Senate Democrats supported the legislation, Keeran said. With 10 Democratic senators, that means bills must have received at least six Democratic votes to be considered bipartisan.\n\n \n\n Senate Democratic Leader Eric Kearney\u2019s office did not dispute the figures. But a spokesman for Kearney said Democrats were not always included in shaping high-profile bills, such as Senate Bill 5, the attempt to restrict public employees\u2019 collective bargaining power.\n\n \n\n \"A lot of the really important ones they push through probably didn\u2019t\" have bipartisan support, said Kearney spokesman Mike Rowe.\n\n \n\n Rowe\u2019s point is well taken \u2013 SB 5, for example, received zero Democratic votes \u2013 but Niehaus did not claim bipartisanship on specific bills.\n\n \n\n Niehaus\u2019 claim was that more than 80 percent of the bills the Senate passed had bipartisan support. The actual numbers showed about 79 percent had bipartisan support. But while Niehaus didn\u2019t hit the number on the nose, the driving point behind his claim certainly is accurate.\n\n \n\n The senator\u2019s point was that the two parties worked together and avoided gridlock.And since the threshold for bipartisanship is that a majority of Democrats support the bill, there clearly was bipartisan support for a significant amount of legislation.\n\n \n\n On the Truth-O-Meter, Niehaus\u2019 claim rates True.", "lang": "en"}
