We don\u2019t know enough to be as precise as saying the cost is \u00a327 billion.\n\nSome of the research underpinning the figure is over a decade old. Patterns of obesity may have changed since then, and the economy definitely has. It also relied on some assumptions that were uncertain at the time.\n\nSome of the analysis could seem a bit counter-intuitive. The \u2018total cost\u2019 combines the cost to the NHS budget for treating people with obesity-related problems with the reduction in UK economic growth because they miss work.\n\nWhere the figure comes from\n\nThe government takes its estimate of \u00a327 billion from the National Obesity Observatory, now part of Public Health England.\n\nThis took the figure from 2007 research, which in turn based its calculations in part on 2004 research by Parliament\u2019s Health Committee.\n\nThe 2004 research put the total cost of people considered obese at between \u00a33.3 billion and 3.7 billion in 2002. That was made up of the cost of treating obesity and its consequences\u2014about \u00a31 billion\u2014and the earnings lost due to sickness and premature mortality among obese people.\n\nIt said that \u201cif in crude terms\u201d the cost of people considered overweight was half that of people considered obese, and given that there are about twice as many people who are overweight as obese, the total costs of both overweight and obese people would be about \u00a36.6-7.4 billion a year. So about \u00a37 billion.\n\nSo the research found the total costs of people being overweight or obese (\u00a37 billion) were seven times the costs of treating obese patients (\u00a31 billion).\n\nThe more recent estimate from 2007 is based on the assumption that the total costs of people considered to be overweight or obese continue to be seven times the cost of NHS treatment.\n\nIt estimated that the cost of treating obesity alone would be \u00a33.9 billion by 2015, based on projections of the population\u2019s body mass index profile, the effect this would have on diseases in the population, and the cost to the NHS of treating these diseases.\n\nIt multiplied this \u00a33.9 billion by seven to reach the estimate that the total cost would be \u00a327 billion by 2015.\n\nA reader pointed out to us that the estimate didn\u2019t consider any net savings to the NHS budget if people die from obesity-related illnesses, rather than other diseases.\n\nChanges in diet since these estimates were made could have affected the number of overweight people, which in turn could have increased or reduced the costs to the NHS and to the economy. The cost of NHS care could have deviated from the forecast for other reasons\u2014for example if drugs costs went up faster than expected.\n\nSimilarly, it\u2019s not clear that total costs were or will always be seven times the cost to the NHS, as they\u2014roughly\u2014were deemed to be in 2002.\n\nFor instance changes to the labour market and to the benefits system could change the employment rate for people considered to be overweight or obese. That means the overall economic cost could change relative to the treatment costs.\n\nAs the National Obesity Observatory said of the research:\n\n\u201cWhilst modelling is helpful, it necessarily relies on existing patterns of treatment and assumptions about continued patterns of eating and physical activity as well as behavioural and social responses to obesity. It might also be helpful to look at alternative scenarios as part of modelling estimates such as: obesity trends continue; obesity continues to rise by a specified percentage per year; obesity is reduced by a specified percentage per year.\u201d\n\nFinally, the \u00a327 billion was in 2007 prices. In today\u2019s prices the cost would be higher.\n\nWe updated this piece in response to feedback from a reader. We clarified that the \u2018total cost\u2019 given by the original report combined the cost to the NHS budget with the reduction to UK economic growth, and that it didn't include any potential savings to the NHS.", "lang": "en"}
