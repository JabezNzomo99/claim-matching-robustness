In particular she highlighted the Scottish National Party.\n\nBut this is incorrect. The Electoral Commission told us that it has never issued the Scottish National Party with a fine or any kind of sanction.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked the Conservative Party for more information.\n\nWhy was the Conservative Party fined?\n\nEarlier this year the Conservative Party was fined \u00a370,000 by the Electoral Commission, the body that oversees elections in the UK. This was for failing \u201cto report accurately on how much it spent on campaigning at three by-elections in 2014 and at the 2015 UK Parliamentary general election\u201d.\n\nIn addition to the Electoral Commission\u2019s fine the issue was also investigated by the police, but on 10 May 2017 the Crown Prosecution Service announced that no charges would be brought. It said that \u201calthough there is evidence to suggest the returns may have been inaccurate, there is insufficient evidence to prove to the criminal standard that any candidate or agent was dishonest\u201d. The commission is still considering the evidence in relation to one constituency, South Thanet, during the 2015 general election.\n\nWhat about the other major parties?\n\nThe Electoral Commission also fined the Labour Party \u00a320,000 for failing to report some spending during the 2015 election.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats were also fined \u00a320,000 in December for a similar offence.\n\nDetails of past Electoral Commission investigations and fines are available on its website.", "lang": "en"}
