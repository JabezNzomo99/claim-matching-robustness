They have largely disappeared from view since they were dropped off in Doha, but eyewitnesses place Fazi, Wasiq, and Noori in Iraq and Syria fighting with ISIS.\"\n\nIf true, this would be a major story. But it\u2019s not.\n\nPresident Barack Obama at the time for releasing the five detainees, with some critics also taking issue with the ex-detainees\u2019 -- being transferred to the Persian Gulf state of Qatar with restrictions on their political behavior but relative freedom of movement within the country.\n\nWe didn\u2019t find any news reports about what the ex-detainees have been up to recently, but we quickly noticed a couple of red flags that made us suspicious of the email\u2019s claims. For starters, the claim in politicalears.com is entirely unsourced.\n\nIn addition, we\u2019d run into politicalears.com before and found the site less than credible. Earlier this month, we looked at its claim that \"over 73 percent of all donations raised\" from the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge \"are going to fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations.\" We gave it a .\n\nExperts who study the region told us the claim was wrong. The ex-detainees \"are all in Qatar. This is nonsense,\" said Barnett R. Rubin, director and senior fellow at New York University\u2019s Center on International Cooperation.\n\nDaveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said that while he doesn\u2019t doubt that the ex-detainees are dangerous to United States interests, \"there is literally zero evidence\" that the detainees have been spotted on the battlefield with ISIS.\n\nGartenstein-Ross added that the claim doesn\u2019t even make much logical sense and betrays the author\u2019s weak grasp on the region\u2019s nuances.\n\n\"The ex-detainees \"were in the Afghanistan-Pakistan theater,\" Gartenstein-Ross said. \"Based on these guys\u2019 social networks and who their points of contact were, it\u2019s pretty unlikely they\u2019d be able to quickly find a way to the battlefield and have a command\" in the Iraq-Syria border region.\n\n\"They are not native Arabic speakers, and it would be unfamiliar terrain culturally. They would face a lot of obstacles,\" he said.\n\nWhen we asked the White House if there was any evidence that one or more detainees has joined ISIS, spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said, \"There is no truth to these reports.\"\n\nBloggers said that \"three of five detainees swapped (for Bowe Bergdahl) are now ISIS leaders.\" The claim has nonexistent sourcing, has been published by sites with questionable track records for accuracy, and has been knocked down by independent experts.
