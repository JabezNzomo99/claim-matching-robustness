He does not mention churches, sports or music events.\n\n\u201cSupply chains for critical things need to be maintained. Countries are still figuring out what to keep running,\u201d Gates said in response to a question about operating businesses while maintaining COVID-19 social distancing measures. \u201cEventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine who has received it.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
