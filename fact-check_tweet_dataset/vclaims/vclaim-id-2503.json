The two are competing to represent the 7th Congressional District, which includes eastern Sacramento County and the cities of Folsom, Rancho Cordova and Elk Grove.\n\nJones, who has a law degree, has done more than just personally deny the claims.\n\nIn an August interview with Capital Public Radio, Jones said two judges had determined the allegations have no merit.\n\n\"These allegations that supposedly happened 13 years ago, but were never brought up until in this lawsuit a year or so ago, were found by two separate judges to not have merit,\" Jones said.\n\nNews coverage of the case indicates the claims about sexual misconduct never advanced to trial for procedural reasons, which is far different than Jones\u2019 assertion that they were evaluated and found to have no merit.\n\nWe decided to fact-check whether any judges found the claims against Jones have \"no merit.\"\n\nThe accusations about sexual advances are from Tosca Olives, who, beginning as a young sheriff\u2019s deputy, said she had about 30 inappropriate encounters with Jones between 2003 and 2005. Her claims were inserted into a larger lawsuit brought against the Sheriff\u2019s Department by four deputies alleging workplace retaliation, sexual harassment and sexual discrimination by their supervisors.\n\nOnly the retaliation claim advanced to trial. A jury sided with the deputies on that charge and awarded them nearly $3.6 million.\n\nBefore the trial started, deputies used Olives\u2019 subpoenaed testimony to support their claims of a hostile work environment based on sexual favoritism.\n\nSacramento Superior Court Judge David I. Brown, however, did not allow the sexual harassment and favoritism claims, including Olives\u2019 supporting testimony, to advance. He did not because the deputies \"failed to initially plead the cause of action or raise it with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing,\" according to a Sacramento Bee fact check.\n\nThe Bee examined a nearly identical claim from Jones, made in a prepared statement in July, that a judge had found Olives\u2019 allegations have no merit.\n\nIt labeled Jones\u2019 claim false and described it as \"misleading.\"\n\n\"Nothing in the court record indicates the judge passed judgment on the merits of Olives\u2019 accusations,\" the Bee fact check said.\n\nWe asked the Jones campaign to explain the candidate\u2019s statement.\n\nKyle Macdonald, Jones\u2019 campaign manager, noted that Judge Brown dismissed the charges tied to the Olives testimony before trial. He said in an email that decision \"can lead a reasonable person to conclude that the Judge found insufficient merit in them.\"\n\nOnce the trial started, Macdonald said a second superior court judge, David DeAlba, ruled Olives could not testify. He described this decision \"as close as Sheriff Jones can get to an exoneration in this format.\"\n\nMacdonald added: \"In sum, no Judge did - or would ever - say \u2018I find no merit to these allegations,\u2019 but each of the Judge's rulings in that regard is as close as it would get, and can reasonably be taken with that meaning.\"\n\nA Bera campaign spokeswoman responded to Jones\u2019 claim saying: \"Not advancing to trial is distinct from being dismissed by a judge.\"\n\nRepublican congressional candidate Scott Jones recently claimed that allegations he made unwanted sexual advances on a young, female sheriff\u2019s deputy \"were found by two separate judges to not have merit.\"\n\nNews coverage, including a Sacramento Bee fact check, found the allegations by the deputy never advanced to trial for procedural reasons. It also found there\u2019s no evidence in the court record that a judgement was made on the merits of the claims.\n\nA spokesman for the Jones campaign acknowledged that no judge has ever stated in court that the claims had no merit.\n\nWithout any evidence to point to, Jones and his campaign ask the public to make a leap of faith about the candidate\u2019s claim, and interpret what the judges might have been thinking.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
