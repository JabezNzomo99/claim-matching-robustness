John McCain\u2019s military record may have stunned the political world, but some pundits played down Trump\u2019s diss by resurrecting a similarly worded quote about McCain from a Democrat 15 years ago.\n\nPundits from to The Weekly Standard\u2019s to MSNBC\u2019s have pointed to McCain\u2019s current colleague Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., as another man who questioned the valor of McCain\u2019s POW experience.\n\nLimbaugh in particular said on his July 20 radio show that the lack of uproar around Franken\u2019s comments proves the bias of \"leftists\" and the media.\n\n\"Al Franken, back in 2002 before he was running for anything, Al Franken said almost exactly what Trump said,\" Limbaugh said. \"There hasn\u2019t been any outrage at any of this that has been said about McCain by leftists. Proving my point -- when leftists attack McCain, they are perfectly warranted because they are nice people and they are compassionate people and they\u2019re politically correct people.\"\n\nLimbaugh contrasted this to Trump\u2019s portrayal of McCain. \"He\u2019s not a war hero,\" Trump said July 18 at the Family Leadership Summit, a presidential forum in Ames, Iowa. \"He\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\"\n\nWe wanted to find out if Limbaugh was comparing apples to apples. Did Franken really insult McCain like Trump?\n\nRelevant to this fact-check is Franken\u2019s former day job. Before he joined the U.S. Senate in 2009, Franken worked as a comedy writer and actor. He was on staff of Saturday Night Live in its first few seasons and again from 1985 to 1995. After that, he wrote several books that parodied conservative politics, including 1999\u2019s Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations.\n\nIn his 2004 book Lies: And The Lying Liars Who Tell Them , Franken describes a 1999 speech he gave to the White House News Photographers Association in which he rattles off essentially the same lines.\n\nAccording to his book, the riff went like this (italics are Franken\u2019s):\n\n\"Hey, I like John McCain. And I really think he\u2019s courageous. I mean, his stance on campaign finance reform and tobacco. Wow. That takes guts. But this whole \u2018war hero\u2019 thing \u2014 I don\u2019t get it. I mean, as far as I\u2019m concerned, he sat out the war. I mean, anyone can get captured! Am I wrong, but isn\u2019t the idea to capture the other guy?\"\n\nThe line was skewered in the conservative Washington Times as \"landing with a thud.\" Franken, though, described it as getting \"big laughs\" with the news photographers and said the Times had put his remarks through the \"de-irony-izer\" to make him look unpatriotic. (We could not find more coverage of the speech.)\n\nIn the book, Franken framed the joke in the context of admiring McCain, with whom he shared a mutual friend in a Vietnam War protester.\n\nMost pundits comparing Franken's comments to Trump's aren't using this speech as their example. Instead they highlight a 2000 that featured a few paragraphs from Franken and other newsmakers about the 2000 presidential election. McCain vied for the GOP nomination that year but withdrew from the race in March 2000 as George W. Bush pulled ahead.\n\n\"I doubt I could cross the line and vote Republican. I have tremendous respect for McCain but I don\u2019t buy the war hero thing. Anybody can be captured. I thought the idea was to capture them. As far as I\u2019m concerned he sat out the war.\"\n\nLimbaugh was quick to point out the similarities between the two statements, crying foul at the perceived double standard for conservatives and liberals. But Limbaugh appears to have missed Franken\u2019s intent, even if it was not obvious\n\nAccording to Franken press secretary Michael Dale-Stein, the remark \"was a joke.\" (Michael Alvear, the author of the Salon piece, no longer works for the publication and couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.)\n\nMore than taking Dale-Stein\u2019s word for it, we looked for more evidence. The Salon piece wasn\u2019t the last time Franken used the bit about McCain\u2019s war record.\n\nIn 2004, Franken had McCain as a guest on his Air America radio show, The O\u2019Franken Factor, where he retooled the bit for a third time. Franken jokingly suggested that only McCain\u2019s political courage should be rewarded, and not his military service in Vietnam.\n\nFranken\u2019s Senate office provided only the following excerpt from the interview. We tried to locate a copy or transcript of the show but could not find one.\n\n\"Because, I mean, I consider you a hero, tremendous political courage,\" Franken tells McCain, according to a transcript provided by Franken\u2019s office, \"not, you know, the thing about five years, or five and a half years at the Hanoi Hilton\u037e as far as I'm concerned you just sat out the war. I don't consider that real heroism. Anybody can get captured, right?\"\n\nSome at the time suggested that Franken \"took considerable heat\" for talking about McCain\u2019s imprisonment so lightly. MSNBC\u2019s Scarborough recently said on Morning Joe that Trump was repeating Franken's \"despicable joke.\"\n\nSpokespersons for Limbaugh and McCain could not be reached for comment.\n\nLimbaugh claimed, \"Al Franken said almost exactly what Trump said\" about John McCain\u2019s war-hero credentials.\n\nFranken has literally used similar words as Trump in describing McCain\u2019s military record \u2014 but it\u2019s misleading to look at the comments without context. A closer look at Franken\u2019s books and coverage of the 1999 event where he used this bit \u2014 before the Salon article came out \u2014 shows Franken meant the insult sarcastically. It may be a despicable joke to some, but it\u2019s a joke nonetheless. Trump, however, has not insisted that his comment was meant as satire.\n\nLimbaugh\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context.
