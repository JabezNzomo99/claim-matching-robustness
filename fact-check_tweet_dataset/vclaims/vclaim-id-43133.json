It said that the announcement was in compliance with President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s Proclamation No. 922.\n\n\"THUS; President Duterte announced last May 1, 2020 that all EXAMINEES are automatically passed the said exam both Professional Level and Subprofessional Level. CONGRATULATIONS EXAMINEES MARCH 2020,\" the document said.\n\nClaim Check, Facebook\u2019s monitoring tool, flagged at least two posts for verification. It was shared on the platform as early as May 13.\n\nThe facts: The CSC did not release the document. On May 13, the Commission said they did not issue any directive to automatically pass registered examinees of the March 15 professional and subprofessional CSE \u2013 even if they did not actually take the test.\n\n\u201cThe CSC warns the public to IGNORE THE FAKE NEWS circulating online saying that registered examinees of the 15 March 2020 Career Service Examination are automatically deemed passed,\u201d the CSC said on its official Facebook page.\n\nThe exam scheduled on March 15 was postponed until further notice due to COVID-19, in compliance with Duterte\u2019s declaration of a state of public health emergency. It was supposed to take place in 66 testing locations nationwide with an estimated total of 293,845 registered examinees.\n\nThe Commission added that the CSE is a general ability test that objectively gauges the merit and fitness of an individual for government career service.\n\n\u201cThus, the CSC has no existing policy on considering examinees of the CSE as \u2018passed\u2019 by virtue of incidental factors or circumstances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d the CSC said. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
