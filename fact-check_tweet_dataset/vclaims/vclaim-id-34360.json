Gambhir retorts, \u201cWhat is more important, work or meetings?\u201dThe same clip was shared on Facebook by Vikas Yogi, national media coordinator of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), along with a caption saying, \u201cFor Gambhir, his work is more important than attending meetings to tackle pollution\u201d.Another AAP leader Sunny Upadhyay shared the clip accusing Gambhir of becoming an MP only to attack Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal The claim made by these users is false. The 8-second-long clip of Gambhir is a trimmed version of a longer video. The trimmed version of Gambhir\u2019s byte to news agency ANI is being shared to make the false claim. In the original, full video, Gambhir is talking about doing ground work as an MP. He was neither referring to his personal work or giving commentary.Since an ANI mic can be seen in the video frame, we used keywords \u2018Gautam Gambhir ANI pollution\u2019 and found a tweet by ANI, which had the complete quote given by the cricketer-turned-politician.In the 91-second-long byte, Gambhir can be heard saying he can \u201cLeave eating jalebis if it reduces pollution.\u201dHe then adds, \u201cIn the five months I have been an MP, I have worked a lot to tackle pollution, be it buying 70 EDMC vehicles worth 90 crores, sprinkling machines, vacuum cleaners or initiation of work at Ghazipur landfill.\u201d\u201cLike me, many other Delhiites have small daughters; We all are serious about fighting pollution except for AAP. You should ask Kejriwal what he has done in the last five years to control pollution in the city,\u201d he said.Then at 0:53 seconds, the portion that is now being clipped and shared with false claims can be heard. At this point, Gambhir asks the reporter if meetings are more important than the work he has done in the last five months.\u201d\u201cI have already told you the number of measures I have taken to curb pollution, but what has Kejriwal done in the last five years? On the 11th itself, when I was invited, I had intimated that I would not be able to make it as I was contractually bound. Instead of wasting time on trolling me, distributing jalebis, putting up posters against me, I wish the same efforts were put to fight pollution and to make the city breathable,\u201d he said.Times Fact Check has found that a small portion of Gambhir\u2019s entire quote to ANI is being circulated to falsely claim that he prioritizes commentary over attending pollution-related meetings.", "lang": "en"}
