No, that's not true: The Tuscon council passed an ordinance allowing fines for anyone who enters a restricted crime scene area and engages in activity that hinders police doing their work, but it does not make recording police with cameras a crime.\n\nThe claim appeared in a series of memes, including in a post (archived here) published by Facebook on June 8, 2020, with the title \"But they're good cops, right? We just can't film them being so good.\" It read:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nThe city council passed Ordinance 11746 in April 2020, before nationwide protests about police brutality began following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. The Tucson City Council claimed the ordinance was passed to stop citizens from interfering in police crime scenes. Tucson Mayor Regina Romero has now said officials are reviewing it amid intense backlash following nationwide protests about police brutality caught on camera.\n\nIt is true that the city of Tucson passed the ordinance in April, creating a Class 2 misdemeanor with a $750 fine that allows the police to arrest people that refuse to stay outside a crime scene boundary while they are at police calls.\n\nDespite the claims that have gone viral, though, the ordinance does not make it illegal for citizens to film the police while they are conducting police business in public. It becomes a matter of interpretation of the ordinance that passed.\n\nThe Arizona Daily Star reported on the ordinance passing unanimously on April 21, 2020. The article opened:\n\nIt explained that police were hoping to thwart the efforts of a group called \"First Amendment auditors\" who film at public events and crime scenes, and authorities claim they try to start trouble with the officers so they can film what happens.\n\nThe article describes a video from the group shown to the council members:\n\nHowever, amid the national protests after George Floyd's death, a spotlight was put on the ordinance.\n\nThis Tweet went viral bringing national attention to Tucson and the ordinance amid the national police brutality protests.\n\n\n\nRapper Ice Cube also blasted the ordinance to his 5.2 million followers on Twitter:\n\nAmid the backlash, the mayor announced that she was going to ask the city council to review the ordinance.\n\n\"I am going to recommend to ... Council that we receive more community feedback, consider additional language, and bring the ordinance back for further review,\" the Arizona Daily Star reported.\n\nThe newspaper noted Romero sent City Manager Michael Ortega a memo requesting they discuss the ordinance during a meeting.\n\nAccording to the Arizona Daily Star, the Tucson police Chief Chris Magnus addressed the council during the June 9 meeting and explained the officers always have their own body cameras on and they are aware of and used to being filmed in public.\n\n\"They can still film, absolutely,\" Magnus said. \"They just have to be a reasonable distance back and we have to be fair what that distance is and we have to be able to justify it.\"\n\nNo arrests for violations of the ordinance have been made since it passed and Romero spoke on June 8 about the situation amid the police brutality protests following Floyd's death.\n\nAccording to the Arizona Daily Star, Romero said:\n\nThis is how the newspaper's website described the ordinance:\n\nHere are excerpts from the language of the ordinance:\n\nWHEREAS, the public has a clear right to free speech and to record police activities that take place in public; and WHEREAS, in choosing to exercise these constitutional rights, people may not jeopardize the safety of law enforcement officers, suspects, victims, witnesses, themselves, or others, nor may they interfere with a police investigation or enforcement\n\nactivity. Sec. 11-70.3. Police Restricted Areas; entrance prohibited. A. Police officers or Community Service Officers conducting enforcement activity, investigations, and other police-related activities may restrict {A0277415.doc/} 2 individuals from physically entering crime scenes or areas immediately surrounding where such enforcement activity, investigations, and other police-related activities are taking place. Police Officers or Community Service Officers may establish the boundaries of a restricted area by using physical barriers, placing visual markers like caution tape, or expressly communicating that an area is temporarily restricted for police activity. B. If a Police Officer or Community Service Officer has established a restricted area, it shall be unlawful for any person to enter the restricted area without a Police Officer's or Community Service Officer's express permission to enter; or to refuse to comply with a Police Officer's or Community Service Officer's request or direction to leave the restricted area. Sec. 11-70.4. Interfering with Police Investigations or Enforcement Activity.\n\nA. It shall be unlawful for any person to interfere with enforcement activity, investigations, and other police-related activities by knowingly engaging in conduct that materially inhibits, obstructs, hinders, or delays any Police Officer or Community Service Officer in the exercise of the Officer's official duties.\n\nB. The acts of recording police activity or engaging in constitutionally protected speech alone shall not be considered prohibited conduct under this section.\n\nThe ACLU said the city reached out for input on the ordinance but the staff was not able to review it until after it was passed.\n\nThe ACLU of Arizona sent a letter to the mayor and city council saying:\n\nThe Mayor and Council asked for community input into the ordinance and will discuss the response at a June 23 meeting.\n\nLead Stories reached out to the mayor's office and will update if a response is received.", "lang": "en"}
