So, let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of the image in the post and whether banks will have Saturday off every week.\n\nFact: The image in the post shows an RBI circular on RTGS. It does not have anything regarding the 5-day work week for banks. Also, RBI had already issued a press release in April denying the claims on this issue. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched on Google with the title of the circular in the image, the circular can be found in the \u2018Notifications\u2019 section on the RBI website. So, the circular in the post is authentic but is not related to 5 days work week for banks. The circular is about extension of timings for customer transactions related to RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement). Similar fake news (without any circular/notice) was condemned by the RBI in a press release in April, 2019. Also, FACTLY has already written a fact-check article on this issue when it went viral a month back.\n\nTo sum it up, RBI didn\u2019t release a circular granting 5-day work week for banks. The circular in the post is related to extension of timings for RTGS transactions.\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
