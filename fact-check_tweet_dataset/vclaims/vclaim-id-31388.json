On Sept. 21, the right-leaning Facebook page Turning Point USA posted a meme that read:\n\n\u201c\u2018If you want to test a man\u2019s character, give him power.\u2019 Abraham Lincoln.\u201d The meme was accompanied by a caption that stated, \u201cBig government is [sic] abuses its power!\u201d\n\nThat quotation has been attributed to Lincoln for almost a century. Variations of it have appeared in multiple newspaper columns, it has been promulgated in countless memes and quotation compendiums, and it was widely shared when it was tweeted out by the writer J.K. Rowling in 2017.\n\nIt has been attributed to Lincoln in the U.S. Senate on three occasions, including two citations by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and the earliest Lincoln attribution we found was in the early 1930s.\n\nThe full quotation is usually given as, \u201cNearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man\u2019s character, give him power.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Lincoln never uttered or wrote those words, or words to that effect. Rather, they were said about him. The original version of the quotation came on Jan. 16, 1883, during a speech in Washington, D.C., by the prominent writer and orator Robert Ingersoll.\n\nAccording to newspaper reports, Ingersoll was introducing another speaker, who was scheduled to give a lecture on Lincoln, at an unspecified \u201cauditorium\u201d in the nation\u2019s capital. During the course of his introductory remarks (which were printed in full by the press), Ingersoll said:\n\n\u201c\u2026 If you want to know the difference between an orator and a speaker, read the oration of Lincoln at Gettysburg, and then read the speech of Everett at the same place. One came from the heart, the other was born only of the voice. Lincoln\u2019s speech will be remembered forever. Everett\u2019s no man will read. It was like plucked flowers. [Applause].\n\n\u201cIf you want to find out what a man is to the bottom, give him power. Any man can stand adversity \u2014 only a great man can stand prosperity. It is the glory of Abraham Lincoln that he never abused power only on the side of mercy. [Applause]. He was a perfectly honest man. When he had power, he used it in mercy \u2026\u201d\n\nA modified version of those lines later appeared in published volumes of Ingersoll\u2019s speeches and essays. For example, in his 1895 \u201cAbraham Lincoln, a Lecture,\u201d he wrote:\n\n\u201cNothing discloses real character like the use of power. It is easy for the weak to be gentle. Most people can bear adversity. But if you wish to know what a man really is, give him power. This is the supreme test. It is the glory of Lincoln that, having almost absolute power, he never abused it, except on the side of mercy.\u201d\n\nThe exact same formulation of words appeared in Volume 3 of the 12-volume \u201cWorks of Robert G. Ingersoll,\u201d which was published in 1902, three years after the well-known orator\u2019s death.\n\nFor a few decades, Ingersoll\u2019s pithy praise of Lincoln was widely cited and correctly attributed in American newspapers, but the subject of the quotation appears to have been conflated with its author, beginning in the 1930s. Newspaper archives indicate that the quotation became increasingly condensed and increasingly attributed to Lincoln over the following decades, and in the present day Ingersoll\u2019s original authorship has been almost entirely eclipsed.\n\nTurning Point USA was far from the first to mistakenly attribute the quotation to Lincoln in the site\u2019s September 2019 meme, but the error was the latest prominent example in a list that stretches back almost 100 years.", "lang": "en"}
