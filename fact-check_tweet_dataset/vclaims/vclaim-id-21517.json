But this quote doesn\u2019t give a balanced view of changes to capital gains tax or the bank levy.\n\nCorporation tax revenues are lower mainly because of cuts to the main corporation tax rate.\n\nThe government can change taxes in ways other than adjusting the main rate. For example, it can change the threshold at which people have to pay the tax, tighten up the rules to counter tax avoidance, or offer reliefs and additional allowances.\n\nThe biggest drop in inheritance tax has come from an allowance which is meant to make it easier to pass on \u201cthe family home\u201d.\n\nSometimes, the government can do these things at the same time.\n\nCuts to corporation tax rates have been been partly offset by measures to lower capital allowances or to reduce tax avoidance. Policies announced since the last general election have actually tended to increase the amount of corporation tax companies pay, despite cuts to the main rate. Corporation tax revenues are still down overall due to policies announced since 2010, but not as much as they would have been.\n\nFor capital gains tax, the main rate has fallen but policies under both the Conservative and Coalition governments have tended to push revenues up overall.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s arguably unfair to single out the cut to the bank levy on its own.\n\nThe levy was a particular kind of tax on banks, partly intended to stop them taking on risky funding strategies after the financial crisis.\n\nIt was introduced under the Coalition in 2011 and reduced from 2015, when a new surcharge on bank profits was introduced. Reducing the bank levy and introducing the surcharge will have boosted tax revenues, according to Treasury estimates.\n\nWe published a piece on whether the Conservatives had brought in \u00a370 billion of tax cuts earlier this week.
