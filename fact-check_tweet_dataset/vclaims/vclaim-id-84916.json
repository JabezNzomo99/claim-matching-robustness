John McCain (R-Ariz.) in his primary election, Trump again attacked the senator over his record with veterans. As is the case with the majority of Trump\u2019s claims, his campaign did not respond to our request for clarification or information to support this claim.\n\nIn 1991, Congress enacted the \u201cMcCain Bill\u201d to require the secretary of defense to make public information relating to those who were unaccounted for from the Vietnam War. Since then, the bill was amended to include the Korean War and Cold War. In the 1990s, McCain also worked with then-Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) to successfully restore diplomatic relations with Vietnam.\n\nMcCain was a co-sponsor of the 2014 legislation to overhaul the Department of Veterans Affairs, following the scandal that unfolded after whistleblowers alleged that dozens of veterans died at VA\u2019s medical center in Phoenix while waiting for medical care. VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General later acknowledged that wait lists may have contributed to the veterans\u2019 deaths. Patient and appointment record falsification and manipulations were then found to be a systemic, years-long problem.\n\nMcCain was not a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, but was a key negotiator for the bipartisan Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act. McCain worked with then-chairman Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to negotiate the legislation, which made sweeping changes to veterans\u2019 access to health care for the first time in two decades.\n\nThe key element that McCain pushed was the Choice Card, to give veterans more flexibility to receive medical care from private doctors if the veterans live far away from a VA facility or have been waiting for a certain number of days for an appointment. Many veterans groups supported this option at the time.\n\nAs chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, McCain was one of the original co-sponsors of the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act in 2015, which the Senate approved on a 99-to-0 vote. This bill called for VA to expand and improve its mental health services, in an effort to curb veteran suicides.\n\nArizona has a large veteran population, which means veterans issues are a major part of his office\u2019s constituent work. So far this year, the office has completed more than 2,000 cases relating to VA and is working on more than 750 veterans cases, according to his office. In 2014, when the scandal broke, the office worked 3,500 VA-related cases \u2014 about half for people living outside of Arizona, according to his staff.\n\nWhen the scandal first erupted, about 150 veterans and their supporters held a rally in Phoenix hosted by the veterans group Concerned Veterans for America. At the rally, many veterans expressed their frustrations with McCain and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who were not in attendance, yelling their names and demanding they fix VA\u2019s wait times.\n\nDan Caldwell, the group\u2019s vice president for legislative and political action, said McCain has been a visible leader on veterans issues. Some of the frustrations among veterans directed toward McCain is a reflection of their ideological differences with McCain and their frustrations in fixing wait times at VA, Caldwell said.\n\n\u201cThey hope that the person can wave a magic wand and fix all the problems they have with the Department of Veterans Affairs. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Caldwell said. He added that because veterans are generally more conservative, some have criticized McCain on his overall political record than specifically on veterans issues.\n\nThe Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) gave McCain low ratings for his record on representing the interests of the younger generation of veterans, particularly for his opposition to the 2008 G.I. bill for post-9/11 veterans. In 2010, McCain received a \u201cD\u201d grade from the group. IAVA no longer issues ratings and has criticized Trump for attacking on McCain\u2019s record.\n\nWhether McCain \u201cshould have done a much better job\u201d is more of Trump\u2019s opinion, and not readily fact-checkable. But it\u2019s clear that Trump\u2019s claim that McCain \u201chas not done a good job for the vets\u201d contradicts McCain\u2019s voting record on many veterans issues, from making POW information public to negotiating a major overhaul legislation for VA after a national scandal over wait-time delays.\n\nOver the years, veterans groups have criticized McCain for certain votes that affect various interests within the veteran community, or opposed some of his proposals. But even the organizations that have criticized parts of his voting record have recognized his overall contribution to veterans issues throughout his career.\n\nTrump\u2019s implication here is that McCain has somehow not lived up to a standard Trump has set for how a veteran in public office should represent the interests of fellow veterans. Perhaps Trump should hold himself to a higher standard, too \u2014 rather than, say, tell the public he donated $1 million to the veterans without actually doing it, and only giving the money after being called out by a reporter.", "lang": "en"}
