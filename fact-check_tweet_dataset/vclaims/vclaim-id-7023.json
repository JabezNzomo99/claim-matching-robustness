But are the education claims\n\nrecently tweeted to its over 10,000 followers the truth?\n\n\u201cSouth Africa has the 3rd worst education system in the world, 50% of students drop out of the system, while only 30% get the marks requires [sic] to get into Uni,\u201d the account\n\nThe tweet was retweeted 763 times and liked by 1,479 people by the time we published this report.\n\nAfrica Checked dug into the data behind the tweet\u2019s three claims.\n\nTo support the claim that \u201cSouth Africa has the 3rd worst education system in the world\u201d, @Sowellnomics\n\nThe article reported on the\n\ncountries for the overall quality of its education system. (\n\nMore recent data from the WEF\u2019s 2017/18\n\nout of 137 countries for the quality of its education system.\n\nBut the way the WEF assesses education quality has been severely criticised by education experts.\n\nthe rankings as \u201csubjective, unscientific, unreliable and [lacking] any form of technical credibility or cross-national comparability\u201d.\n\nThat is because the rankings are based on the opinions of unidentified \u201cbusiness leaders\u201d -\n\nfor South Africa, in the case of the Global Competitiveness Index report. No pupils were tested and educational performance was not compared to determine a country\u2019s education quality.\n\nMartin Gustafsson, a researcher in the school of economics at\n\nthat while the rankings could offer insight into business confidence, it doesn\u2019t speak to the quality of education in the country.\n\nAfrica Check. \u201cIt is like asking business experts what they think the HIV rate is.\u201d\n\nMore useful measures available\n\nA more insightful measure of a country\u2019s education system would be standardised tests, like those compiled by the\n\nIn 2007, 61,396 Grade 6 pupils from 2,779 schools were tested.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s average student maths score placed it eighth out of 15 countries, ahead of Mozambique, Uganda, Lesotho, Namibia, Malawi and Zambia. Its average student reading score placed it tenth out of the 15 countries, ahead of Uganda, Mozambique, Lesotho, Zambia and Malawi.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s education system does face serious challenges. But the claim that it has the \u201c3rd worst education system in the world\u201d is not based on rigorous data.\n\n\u201cThe dropout statistic obviously depends on how one defines \u2018dropping out\u2019,\u201d Gustafsson told Africa Check.\n\nData shows that between 2014 and 2016 an estimated\n\nof 22 to 25-year-olds had not passed matric.\n\n\u201cBut many of these youths at least attempt the [senior certificate] examinations and fail \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t consider these youths \u2018dropouts\u2019,\u201d says Gustafsson.\n\n\u201cA useful statistic [to consider] is the number of South Africans, by age, who did not successfully complete Grade 11.\u201d\n\nfrom the department of basic education found that 67.6% of people born between 1990-1992 managed to pass Grade 11, meaning 32.4% of them \u201cdropped out\u201d of the secondary education system.\n\n\u201cHardly any of these [pupils] would successfully complete the desired or ideal alternative, a qualification in a public TVET college,\u201d said Gustafsson. \u201cSome might complete other qualifications beyond school\u2026 but those numbers are not large.\u201d\n\nGustafsson told Africa Check that it is also important to look at the Grade 9 completion rate, as it is the last year of\n\nthat in 2016, 88.6% of young people between the ages of 19 and 21 had passed Grade 9.\n\nThis means that 11.4% of young people in this age bracket had dropped out of the education system before successfully completing the minimum amount of education prescribed by law.\n\nshow how many students qualify for university entrance.\n\n, a pupil must achieve at least 30% in their language of learning and no less than 50% in four other subjects.
