And does Neubauer's relationship with anti-poverty campaign organization One.org prove Thunberg is part of some \"elite\" plot? No, that's not true: Neubauer is not Thunberg's handler or supervisor so the limited involvement Neubauer has with one.org is completely beside the point in this context.\n\nThe claim about Thunberg having Neubauer as her supervisor is mainly being spread via a viral meme, an example can be seen in this Facebook post (archived here) where it was published September 20. It showed a picture of Thunberg, a picture of Neubaer and several tiny pictures of Neubauer and Thunberg appearing at rallies together, along with the text:\n\nThis is what the post looked like:\n\nAnd here is the image in question:\n\nSo who is Luisa Neubauer? She is a university student from Germany who has been organizing school strikes and other actions for the climate in Germany, inspired by Greta Thunberg's actions in Sweden. They have met on several occasions according to media reports:\n\nAt just 16, Sweden's Greta Thunberg has become a figurehead for a movement that has gone global, inspiring hundreds of thousands of other youths in dozens of countries to strike from school in \"Fridays For Future\" protests. One of them is Luisa Neubauer, a 23-year-old university student who has been dubbed \"the German Greta\". The pair have met on several occasions in recent months, including in December in Poland at the Cop24 summit and in Hamburg in March for a climate march.\n\nAnd what about One.org? According to its own website:\n\nONE is a global movement campaigning to end extreme poverty and preventable disease by 2030, so that everyone, everywhere can lead a life of dignity and opportunity. Co-founded by Bono and other activists, ONE is strictly nonpartisan. ONE is not a grant-making organisation and does not solicit funding from the public or receive government funds. ONE is funded almost entirely by foundations, individual philanthropists and corporate partners.\n\nThey list their major donors on their \"financials\" page and yes, Bono, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Open Society Foundations are indeed mentioned (as are Caterpillar, Coca Cola, Cargill and Google to name just a few).\n\nSo what is Neubauer's relationship with them? According to their search page she has been one of their \"Youth Ambassadors\", who are described on the site as:\n\nThe most recent story on the one.org site mentioning Neubauer is a May 2018 report she wrote about an event in Canada she attended:\n\nNeubauer does not appear in One.org's financial documents listing their key employees and management or on the page of their website listing their leadership.\n\nThe position as a \u201eyouth ambassador\" is voluntary, I never received any money from the ONE position - also since climate striking I don't really have any time any more to engage in ONE stuff, so I believe I am technically still a youth ambassador but not an active one. And no, Greta inspired me to start climate striking in Germany and I am glad to have gotten to know her as a friend. Thats about it. I have never been a position that could be any close to a supervisor role, I don't think there is anyone who would fit that description.\n\nSo a young German climate activist who met Greta Thunberg did some volunteer work for an anti-poverty campaign.\n\nNot really the strongest proof for an ELITE being behind all this.", "lang": "en"}
