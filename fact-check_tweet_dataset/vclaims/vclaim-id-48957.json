The post also claims that two of the assailants are Bangladeshis and all the attackers are absconding. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nFact: While it is true that Tamal Krishna Das (ex-President of a monastery in Imlitala) has been attacked, the attackers are neither Muslims nor Bangladeshis. The accused are the followers of B.P.Sadhu (current President of the monastery). Also, the Mathura Police have denied the claims made in the post. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched on the internet about the incident, it was found that the \u2018Mathura Police\u2019 have already given a clarification regarding the incident through their official Twitter account. In reply to a tweet, they have posted a video in which the officer mentions that it was an internal fight. He mentions that the followers of B.P.Sadhu (current President of a monastery in Imlitala) have beaten up Tamal Krishna Das (ex-President of the monastery). The main accused, Sacchidanand, has been arrested and the other accused (Govind, Jagannath and security guard- Govind Singh) are absconding.\n\nAs the photos went viral with the false claim that the accused are Bangladeshis, the Mathura Police have tweeted denying the claim made in the post. Also, the police clarified that the fight was over opening a room with books.\n\nTo sum it up, the saint at the monastery in Vrindavan was neither attacked by Muslims nor Bangladeshis.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
