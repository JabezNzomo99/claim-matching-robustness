And what if the pledge also concerns a plan that turns out to be different than what he proposed during the campaign? Is the pledge still valid for ridicule by the other side?\n\nBut Obama\u2019s pledge came with a very large asterisk: He was not saying premiums would fall by $2,500, but that health-care costs per family would be that much lower than anticipated. In other words, if overall costs\u2013not just premiums\u2013were expected to rise by $5,000 by 2012, they would only rise by $2,500. Yep, that\u2019s what Obama\u2019s pledge meant, even if he was not especially clear about it and frequently misstated it.\n\nWhen Obama made this claim in 2008, he was quickly called out by fact checkers. The Fact Checker awarded Obama Pinocchios for the pledge, saying it was based on shaky assumptions (such as a Rand Corp. study that was criticized by the Congressional Budget Office) and that there was no guarantee that any cost savings would be passed on to consumers.\n\nOur colleagues at FactCheck.org also thought Obama\u2019s pledge was dubious. \u201cWe find his statements to be overly optimistic, misleading and, to some extent, contradicted by one of his own advisers,\u201d the group said. \u201cAnd it masks the true cost of his plan to cover millions of Americans who now have no health insurance.\u201d\n\nMoreover, once Obama became president, the health care proposal he advocated as a candidate was significantly changed, even to the point of accepting the individual mandate that he had so criticized when Hillary Rodham Clinton promoted it. To some extent, Obama could argue that such changes should get him off the hook from his pledge, but the White House continues to claim that costs will not rise as quickly as previously estimated. But rather than $2,500 by the end of Obama\u2019s first term, the White House says it would be $2,000 in savings by 2019\u2014in part because the health care law will not even be fully implemented until 2014.\n\n\u201cWhen the President of the United States says something at least 19 times to the American people, they should be able to trust him. They should not have to check back later for the quietly whispered \u2018asterisk\u2019 and fine print,\u201d said Barrasso spokeswoman Emily Lawrimore. \u201cThe White House has moved the goal posts on the President\u2019s promise repeatedly \u2013 especially by saying that family savings won\u2019t go into effect until 2019\u2026 I know that President Obama and Administration officials have not updated the American people on the policy change at least 19 times in a row in recorded speeches.\u201d\n\nLawrimore justifies this because Obama\u2019s original statement referred to reducing costs by the end of his first term\u2014but as we noted, the health care law has not yet even been implemented. The actual impact on premiums is just now being calculated\u2014and you can pick from a range of studies to decide whether the law is boosting premiums or reducing them. Trust us\u2014no one really knows yet. But that won\u2019t stop each side from seizing on data that they think makes their case.\n\nThe Kaiser survey, in fact, makes no judgment on whether the Affordable Care Act has played much of role in the increase in premiums. Indeed, the rate of the increase under Obama, a little under 6 percent per year, is more than half the rate of premium increases in the decade before Obama took office. Health economists still are not entirely sure of the reasons for the dramatic slowdown in rate hikes, but Barrasso\u2019s use of raw numbers obscures what many would consider to be a good-news story.\n\nBeware also of averages. Generally speaking, under Obamacare, younger, healthier people should expect higher premiums while older people might see a decrease, because the law places limits on how much more an older individual pays than a younger person. The law also mandates a benefit package that is generally much more robust than what people previously buy now on the individual market. Such benefits cost money\u2014and will boost premiums\u2014but it also makes it harder to do an apples to apples comparisons over time.\n\nIn his remarks, Barrasso carefully does not directly say that the increase in premiums is the result of Obama\u2019s health care law, but the juxtaposition with Obama\u2019s pledge suggests that. He also warns that Americans are going to face \u201csticker shock\u201d when the law formally goes into effect.\n\nObama\u2019s pledge was silly and worthy of Pinocchios, in part because the fine print showed there was much less to the pledge that he suggested in his speeches. But the White House has not disavowed it\u2014and Obama will face the consequences if the American people feel misled by his langauge.\n\nEven laying that aside, Barrasso can\u2019t suggest that the rise in premiums since Obama took office is the result of a health care law that largely has not yet taken effect. By using raw numbers, the senator also glosses over the fact that the rate of increase has actually slowed significantly during Obama\u2019s presidency.", "lang": "en"}
