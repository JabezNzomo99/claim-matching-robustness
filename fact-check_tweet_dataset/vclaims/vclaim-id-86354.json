But the letter uses sleight of hand to suggest Zhang knew at the time that 180 patients were sick. \u201cOn December 27, Zhang Jixian, a doctor from Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, told China\u2019s health authorities that the disease was caused by a new coronavirus,\u201d reported the South China Morning Post. \u201cBy that date, more than 180 people had been infected, though doctors might not have been aware of all of them at the time.\u201d\n\nTaiwan is not a member of the WHO, and the WHO says the email never mentioned human-to-human transmission. \u201cPublic health professionals could discern from this wording that there was a real possibility of human-to-human transmission of the disease,\u201d the Taiwan CDC argues. \u201cHowever, because at the time there were as yet no cases of the disease in Taiwan, we could not state directly and conclusively that there had been human-to-human transmission.\u201d\n\n\u201cWHO headquarters in Geneva first learned about the outbreak in Wuhan not directly from Chinese authorities, but rather from the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED), a U.S.-based open-source platform for early intelligence about infectious disease outbreaks,\u201d according to a comprehensive timeline issued by the Congressional Research Service. Headquarters then \u201casked the WHO China Country Office to request \u2018verification of the event\u2019 from the government of China.\u201d WHO acted under regulations that it \u201ctake into account reports from sources other than notifications or consultations\u201d by countries. CRS noted \u201cit appears China may not have proactively notified WHO of the outbreak.\u201d\n\nTrump here cites a tweet by the WHO. But in a news briefing that same day, Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of the WHO\u2019s emerging diseases unit, told reporters: \u201cFrom the information that we have it is possible that there is limited human-to-human transmission, potentially among families, but it is very clear right now that we have no sustained human-to-human transmission. It is still early days, we don\u2019t have a clear clinical picture.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn March 3, 2020, the World Health Organization cited official Chinese data to downplay the very serious risk of asymptomatic spread, telling the world that \u2018COVID-19 does not transmit as efficiently as influenza\u2019 and that unlike influenza this disease was not primarily driven by \u2018people who are infected but not yet sick.\u2019 China\u2019s evidence, the World Health Organization told the world, \u2018showed that only one percent of reported cases do not have symptoms, and most of those cases develop symptoms within two days.\u2019\u201d\n\nTedros did say this at a March 3 briefing, as part of a presentation on the ways covid-19 was different from the seasonal flu. But he also said \u201ccovid-19 causes more severe disease than seasonal influenza. \u2026 Globally, about 3.4 percent of reported covid-19 cases have died. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1 percent of those infected.\u201d He urged governments to expand contact tracing because it will slow the spread of infections. \u201cWe can\u2019t treat covid-19 exactly the same way we treat flu,\u201d Tedros said, noting there would be no vaccine for some time.", "lang": "en"}
