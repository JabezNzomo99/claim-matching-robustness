This made the locals very angry.\"\n\nOn Sunday, residents of Banbhoolpura area took to the streets when a team of medical workers reached to collect samples and also quarantine an Imam from the mosque who is said to have come in contact with a few COVID-19 positive patients. According to the police, the locals created a ruckus and did not let health workers come close to the masjid or the Imam.\n\nBanbhoolpura in Haldwani, Uttarakhand has been declared a hotspot by the authorities after the area saw seven people testing positive after they attended the Tablighi Jamaat event.\n\nVideos of the incident have gone viral with a narrative of Muslims deliberately disobeying the lockdown order.\n\nIn addition, five people who are admitted in a Muradabad hospital after testing positive are also residents of Haldwani. \"We have completely sealed the area and are running tests of everybody who came in contact with the positive tested patients. We currently have 15 cases and are running tests on several people,\"said SSP, Haldwani, Sunil Kumar Meena.\n\nSSP Meena dismissed allegations online of the health workers being beaten up. \"Nobody was attacked, abused or beaten - including the police or the doctors,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the Imam himself spoke to the residents. \"He (Imam) told the residents that he was not being taken away and would be quarantined in his house itself in the premises of the masjid. Hearing the Imam speak and reassure them convinced the residents\".\n\nMeena added that the issue was being communalised only outside of Haldwani. \"Everybody who stays here knows what happened and does not believe in the communal angles. We cannot do much when Twitter and Facebook posts of people who had nothing to do with the issue paint and exaggerated communal picture.\"", "lang": "en"}
