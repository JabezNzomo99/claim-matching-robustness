They are not leaving any stones unturned in spreading Corona. How long will you be safe'.\n\nThe clip shows a man - his back turned towards the camera - pulling out bread packets from crates stacked in a delivery truck. He opens a packet, pulls out few slices, seals and keeps it back. The man repeats this with other packets throughout the video.\n\nThe man removes the twist cable used to seal the bread packet and places it between his teeth before sealing the packets again with the same cable. This action has been misconstrued as the man spitting on the bread slices. \n\n\n\nThe viral video is shared below and its archived version can be checked here.\n\nAlso read Mock Drill Video From UP Goes Viral With Communal Coronavirus Spin\n\nThe video is the latest example of misinformation targeting Indian Muslims after after several people who took part in a religious congregation of the Tabligh-e-Jamaat''s Markaz in Nizamuddin West in Delhi in March, tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nClick here for Live Updates on Coronavirus\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search on one of the screenshots extracted from the viral clip.

Several news portals also reported the incident.\n\nBOOM came across a report on Philnews.PH which said that the video was recorded in Philippines on September 20 last year.\n\nThe report further said that a deliveryman of Gardenia Bakeries was caught on the camera while tampering with bread packets. The report claimed that the deliveryman was 'stealing slices of breads from the packets'. BOOM also came across other reports about the incident.\n\nAnother article about the incident mentioned that the baker - Gardenia - had initiated an investigation into the incident.\n\nThe logo on the man's t-shirt matches the logo of Gardenia Philippines.\n\n\n\nGardenia Philippines also issued a statement about the whole incident on its Facebook page.\n\nThe company later clarified that the slices of bread taken out from the packets were from 'pulled out' loaves from stores which were meant for disposal. The company had shared another statement on its Facebook page clearing the air around the incident.\n\nRead below the statement shared by Gardenia Philippines on the viral video showing a man tampering with bread packets.\n\nThe company's statement makes it clear that the incident did not involve a communal angle.", "lang": "en"}
