The claim is false; this video has circulated online since 2014 in reports about a failed NASA rocket explosion in the US state of Virginia.\n\nThe video was published here on Facebook, on August 10, 2020. It has been viewed more than 1,400 times.\n\nThe 39-second footage shows a rocket bursting into flames moments after launch. An English-language voiceover is heard throughout the video. It describes the explosion as it occurs.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption, written in traditional Chinese characters, translates to English as: \u201c8:47 am on August 7! The United States failed to launch rockets, and the launch site was blown up. Yellow media [and] biased journalists\u2026will not report on this!\u201d\n\nThe video was also shared here on Facebook and here and here on Twitter alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim, however, is false.\n\nA reverse image search on Google using keyframes extracted with InVID-WeVerify, a digital verification tool, found a longer version of the video published here on the YouTube channel of the US television station WAVY-TV on October 28, 2014.\n\nBelow are two screenshot comparisons of the video in the misleading Facebook post (L) and the YouTube video (R):\n\nThe video's title and description reads: \u201cNASA rocket explodes during launch at Wallops Island\u201d.\n\nWallops Island, an island in Virginia, US, is where NASA rocket launch site Wallops Flight Facility is located.\n\nA keyword search found the explosion was also reported by other American media in 2014, including CNN here and National Geographic here.\n\nThe CNN report reads, in part: \u201cTeams of investigators were out at daybreak Wednesday examining damage to NASA's Wallops Flight Facility after an unmanned rocket exploded shortly after launch on the Virginia coast, NASA spokeswoman Rachel Kraft told CNN via email. NASA is warning people in the area not to touch debris if they find any.\n\n\u201cThe Antares rocket, built by NASA contractor Orbital Sciences Corp., and its Cygnus cargo spacecraft \u2018suffered a catastrophic failure\u2019 shortly after liftoff Tuesday evening, the company said. The crash caused a huge fire and scattered debris over a large area.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
