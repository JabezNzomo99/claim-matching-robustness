But given the total area of grouse moors in England, it\u2019s almost certain that total subsidies were worth significantly less than \u00a384 million a year in 2015, and remain worth less than this today.\n\nGrouse are wild birds native to the UK, many of which live on moorland specially maintained for the purpose of shooting. Grouse shooting is a structured activity which involves directing the grouse into positions to be shot.\n\nGrouse moorland is a managed environment largely consisting of heather. Grouse typically eat young heather and use old heather as shelter.\n\nGrouse moor gamekeepers manage this balance through different methods including grazing livestock on the moors and periodically burning areas of old heather to allow young heather to grow in its place.\n\nLike all EU member states, the UK follows the EU\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). This provides direct income support payments to farmers and is meant to help maintain competition, while protecting against volatility in agricultural prices.\n\nFunding is given to each member state, which then distributes payments to its farmers. In the UK the rules and administration of these subsidies are devolved in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. As the claim talked about the actions of the Conservative government, we\u2019re just focusing on the rules in England.\n\nIn England CAP payments are distributed through different schemes, but the main payment is granted under something called the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS). This is paid to farmers based on the amount of land they have entitlements for.\n\nWhy do grouse moors qualify for subsidy?\n\nWhile grouse moors may not obviously appear to be agricultural assets, they do qualify for agricultural subsidy.\n\nThe BPS rules state that only a farmer can claim BPS payments on their holdings. A farmer is defined as a person or group which produces agricultural products or keeps land suitable for grazing or cultivation.\n\nBecause moorland is often suitable to be grazed upon, grouse moors qualify for payment, regardless of whether livestock is actually being kept on the moorland.\n\nThe rules on subsidies do state that: \u201cIf agricultural and non-agricultural activities are taking place on the same land, the land won\u2019t be eligible if the intensity, nature, duration, and timing of the non-agricultural activity significantly interferes with agricultural activity.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t know how much grouse moors get in subsidies\n\nWe asked The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for the total amount of subsidy received by grouse moors. They said they didn\u2019t have a breakdown of subsidies received by grouse moors. Nor did they have a breakdown of the amount received by moorland farmers.\n\nThe claim says subsidies have increased from \u00a345 million to \u00a384 million per year, and the same article also references the change in subsidies in 2015. That year, the government increased the average subsidy on moorland from \u00a330 per hectare up to around \u00a356 per hectare.\n\nSo the \u00a345 million to \u00a384 million increase seems to be calculated by estimating that there are around 1.5 million hectares of grouse moorland and then multiplying that by the \u00a330 and \u00a356 figures.\n\nBut we think that estimate might be too high. An investigation by Guy Shrubsole of Friends of the Earth estimated there were around 222,000 hectares of grouse moor in England, not 1.5 million hectares. That would mean the total amount of subsidy in England in 2015 was significantly lower than the \u00a384 million the claim suggests.\n\nThe claim could be using an estimate of total grouse moorland across the UK and we\u2019ve asked the author for more detail. However if this is the case, it\u2019s incorrect to use the English subsidy level to estimate the total subsidy across the UK, as the levels vary. For example, Scottish farmers receive different subsidy levels to English farmers.\n\nAlso we can\u2019t be sure whether every hectare of grouse moor is eligible for subsidy, or whether moorland owners are claiming subsidy on every hectare.\n\nFriends of the Earth calculated in 2014 (before the increase in subsidy) that 30 grouse moor estate owners (accounting for an estimated 55% of English grouse moor) received over \u00a34 million in agricultural subsidies.\n\nBut that may have also included subsidy for other land they owned which wasn\u2019t grouse moor.", "lang": "en"}
