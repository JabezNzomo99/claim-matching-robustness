Five times since the start of the year Trump has asserted this, so it\u2019s clear we need to address it in detail.\n\nBut the claim that Trump has exceeded every other president since Lincoln earned only derision from prominent historians. Instead, they said Lyndon B. Johnson, who signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, is clearly the president who had the most lasting impact on the lives of African Americans. These legislative victories were not easy, requiring Johnson to build coalitions with Republicans and liberal Democrats to defeat the powerful segregationists in his own party who dominated the South.\n\nMax J. Skidmore, a University of Missouri historian who assessed the performance of every president in a 2004 book: \u201cPresidents who have done the most for black civil rights since Lincoln would include Ulysses S. Grant (securing creation of Department of Justice and empowering the attorney general to prosecute the Ku Klux Klan and racial violence, etc.), Harry Truman (de-segregating the military, using executive order to circumvent a Congress dominated by the south), LBJ (working for, and signing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights of 1965. \u2026 Additionally, it is little remembered, but when LBJ signed his landmark Medicare Act in 1965, he secured de-segregation of hospitals throughout the south, which had been universal, and anywhere else it existed. That was an enormous accomplishment. Barack Obama should be included for his success in passing the Affordable Care Act, which is one of the greatest anti-poverty measures that this country has ever enacted.\u201d\n\nDavid Greenberg, a Rutgers University scholar who has written a history of White House spin in the past century: \u201cI don\u2019t see how Trump or anyone can seriously believe this claim. Clearly, the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act were monumental achievements that changed the life of black Americans and LBJ will always be remembered for working to pass those into law. We can also point to important achievements under FDR, Truman, Kennedy, and many other presidents far more notable.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s Opportunity Zones program, for instance, was supposed to channel investments into poor neighborhoods. But the New York Times revealed the \u201cmost visible impact so far has been to set off a feeding frenzy among the wealthiest Americans. They are poised to reap billions in untaxed profits on high-end apartment buildings and hotels in trendy neighborhoods, storage facilities that employ only a handful of workers or student housing in bustling college towns.\u201d\n\nThe funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) is a congressional initiative. \u201cCongress does all this work and presents it to him in the budget, and he can choose to sign it. This year, he held off on signing some significant STEM funding, making HBCUs beg for it,\u201d said Marybeth Gasman, a Rutgers professor and one of the leading authorities on HBCUs. \u201cMost HBCU support is the result of Congress. Trump has promised all kinds of things to HBCUs and has followed through on little. Under Trump, the White House Initiative for HBCUs was moved to the White House and is quite quiet compared to the work under President Obama\u2019s administration.\u201d\n\nAs for black unemployment rates, they continued on a downward trend that started in the Obama administration \u2014 until the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cWhile it\u2019s true that economic conditions under Trump continued to improve for blacks as well as whites, the devastation wrought by the pandemic has complicated his efforts to claim credit,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cIf he gets credit for the improving economy through early 2020, why should he avoid blame for the current state of the economy?\u201d\n\nThe judgment of history is fickle and reputations rise and fall over time. But we feel confident enough that the achievements touted by Trump do not come close to LBJ\u2019s actions \u2014 let alone several other presidents \u2014 that at this time we can award this claim Four Pinocchios. Trump is never one to be modest, but this kind of bragging is simply ridiculous.", "lang": "en"}
