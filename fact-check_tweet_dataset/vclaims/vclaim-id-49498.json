The photos compared what those areas looked like during the Aquino administration, or what it tagged as \"disente time\" (decent times), with what they looked like during the Duterte administration, or what it tagged as \"bastos time\" (indecent times).\n\nThe graphics argue that things are \"better\" in the country even if the president is \"indecent,\" compared to when things are \"worse\" despite the country having a \"decent\" leader.\n\nThe graphic about Boracay was also shared by Presidential Communications and Operations Office Undersecretary Lorraine Badoy on July 2 on her Facebook account. Her post has been shared more than 1,800 times, and received 3,100 reactions and 225 comments as of writing.\n\nThe facts: The first photo was taken in 2018, already during the Duterte administration, thus making the comparison in the graphic a false one. Meanwhile, the other is undated, but had been used in some articles in 2018.\n\nThe photo of Boracay used to depict the \"disente time\" or the Aquino administration was taken on March 22, 2018, nearly two years into the Duterte administration.\n\nIt was used in an ABS-CBN News article on March 22, 2018, with the headline \"'LaBoracay' no more? Gov't agencies recommend cancellation of Boracay Labor Day parties,\" published before the 6-month closure of Boracay that started on April 26, as ordered by Duterte.\n\nThe website The Thaiger also used the photo in an article on April 6, 2018 about Boracay's then-impending closure. (Note that the website uses a European date format, where the day is stated first before the month.) \u2013 Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
