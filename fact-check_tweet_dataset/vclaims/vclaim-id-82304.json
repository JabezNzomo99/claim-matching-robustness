(DOMA allowed each state to reach its own decision about the legality of same-sex unions, and defined marriage as between a man and woman under federal law for the purposes of federal programs and benefits.) Given that then President Bill Clinton (D) had said he would sign the law, it would have been far easier, politically, to vote for it.\n\nThe only document his campaign could provide showing Sanders\u2019 support for gay marriage was an article that appeared on July 11, 2009, in the Valley News of West Lebanon, N.H. The article was mostly about the reversal by Vermont\u2019s other senator, Patrick Leahy (D), on DOMA, but it also noted that Sanders had \u201cpreviously voiced support for gay marriage laws passed this spring\u201d in Vermont and New Hampshire.\n\nBut both of these news items appeared after the Vermont legislature approved the gay-marriage law in April 2009. We can find no evidence of \u201coutspoken\u201d support before the law was passed \u2014 a process that started in 2007 \u2014 either in news clips or his Senate office press statements maintained on the WayBack Machine.\n\n\u201cObtaining Congressman Bernie Sanders\u2019 position on the gay marriage issue was like pulling teeth\u2026from a rhinoceros,\u201d Freyne said after the Vermont Supreme Court urged the Vermont legislature to draft a law. \u201cSanders publicly tried walking the tightrope \u2014 applauding the court\u2019s decision and the cause of equal rights without supporting civil marriage for same-sex couples.\u201d Freyne accused Sanders of not wanting to offend \u201chis conservative, rebel-loving rural following out in the hills.\u201d\n\nIn 2006, when Sanders first ran for the Senate, he said that the state was not ready for gay marriage, given the fact that the civil-union law had caused so much political controversy after it was approved. In an Associated Press article about Sanders\u2019 opposition to a constitutional amendment prohibiting gay marriage, he was asked whether Vermont should legalize full marriage rights for same-sex couples. He replied: \u201cNot right now, not after what we went through.\u201d\n\nIn an Oct. 26 interview with MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow, Sanders acknowledged he urged a go-slow approach on gay marriage: \u201cThere were anti-civil union demonstrations. The state was very much split. And I felt that at that time, given the fact that Vermont had gone first in breaking new ground, let\u2019s take it easy for a while. That was my reasoning.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with NBC News, Evan Wolfson, the founder and president of pro-gay-marriage group Freedom to Marry, said that Sanders has exaggerated his record on gay marriage. \u201cSenator Sanders, at points, has implied that he has been a strong and consistent supporter of the freedom to marry \u2014 but at crucial junctures, at least publicly, he was not,\u201d Wolfson told NBC.\n\n\u201cBernie\u2019s seemingly wishy-washy remarks are not that uncommon,\u201d said Doug Hoffer, the Vermont state auditor who has endorsed Sanders. \u201cIn my experience following Bernie once he was first elected to Congress, he was often a bit reluctant to wade too deeply into matters that were clearly within the purview of the state.\u201d\n\nSanders can certainly have bragging rights for having opposed DOMA when it was not a popular step. But his position on same-sex marriage was more nuanced and obscure, and he appears to have evolved on the issue until it was more politically feasible. We can find little evidence he was an \u201coutspoken proponent\u201d of or ahead of the crowd on either Vermont\u2019s 2000 civil-union law or the 2009 gay-marriage law, though we would welcome more evidence concerning his contemporaneous statements and can adjust this rating if more emerges.", "lang": "en"}
