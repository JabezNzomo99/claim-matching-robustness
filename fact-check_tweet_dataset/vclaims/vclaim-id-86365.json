The ad uses quotes with improper context and deceptively edits them with imagery from the demonstrations, skewing the original meaning of the remarks. As of June 30, it had been viewed more than 6 million times.\n\nPelosi\u2019s full quote refers to the Trump administration\u2019s practice: \u201cThey\u2019re doing away with children being with their moms. I just don\u2019t even know why there aren\u2019t uprisings all over the country. And maybe there will be, when people realize that this is a policy that they defend.\u201d\n\nThe ad goes on to show chaos, an American flag on fire and a Confederate monument being taken down. It then cuts to a quote from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), spliced together with video of police and protesters fighting.\n\nHere\u2019s Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s full quote, with the portion used by the ad in bold: \u201cThat is what the word \u2018radical\u2019 really means, by the way \u2014 it means \u2018the root,\u2019 getting to the root of problems. And that word has just kind of been co-opted as though you\u2019re just kind of some \u2014 I don\u2019t even know, some Looney Tune out here. But what it really means is that if you are radical, it means that you get to the root of problems. Which is why I\u2019ve never been offended, and I embrace that term.\u201d\n\nThe end of the ad highlights a statement from Biden with the text \u201cJoe Biden also wants a \u2018new system.\u2019 \u201d Biden is then shown saying: \u201cWe have an incredible opportunity to not just dig out of this crisis but to fundamentally transform the country.\u201d\n\nBiden was outlining a plan to address health disparities illuminated by covid-19. \u201cI\u2019ve put out a detailed plan about what I think we should be doing right now to support our front-line workers and address the disparities we\u2019re seeing with covid-19 impacts all across the country. And I truly think that if we do this right, we have an incredible opportunity to not just dig out of this crisis, but to fundamentally transform the country,\u201d Biden said.\n\nThe Trump campaign declined to comment on the ad or provide an explanation for the misleading editing. A few days earlier, the Republican National Committee released an ad that claimed Democrats were \u201cdestroying America\u201d \u2014 and it used the Pelosi and Biden clips in the same misleading fashion.\n\nRegular readers of The Fact Checker know that we\u2019re paying close attention in this campaign year to examples of manipulated video, using the metric in our guide to the practice. Both campaigns have fallen short, as we have highlighted with fact checks of misleading ads by the Trump campaign and the Biden campaign.\n\nThis ad is definitely among the worst in this election cycle, given how it mixes emotional scenes of violence with misleading clips of Democrats. The Pelosi and Biden quotes are presented as if they are about the violence, when they came weeks or years before Floyd\u2019s death. Thus these quotes are missing context, what we label as \u201cisolation.\u201d The video of Ocasio-Cortez has been deceptively edited, with a large portion removed. That\u2019s even more egregious \u2014 what we call \u201comission.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
