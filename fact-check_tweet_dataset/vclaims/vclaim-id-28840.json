The two blog entries were shared separately by at least 3 Facebook pages and have gained over 1,000 combined interactions as of writing.\n\nThe facts: None of the groups and individuals mentioned in these posts made any public statements about Kapa or made announcements regarding the alleged protests against its shutdown.\n\nSpeaking to Rappler, Bayan's Reyes denied the claim and said, \"We have not issued such statement nor conducted any action supporting Kapa. This is obviously fake and part of the disinformation campaign of the Duterte government.\"\n\nWhen asked whether Latorgo was indeed a Bayan \"chief protest organizer,\" Reyes said that he doesn't know who Latorgo is and that there is no such position as chief protest organizer in their group.\n\nGabriela also denied the claim and said that they are not familiar with Kapa and are not affiliated with them.\n\nIf you suspect a Facebook page, group, account, a website, or an article is spreading false information, let Rappler know by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
