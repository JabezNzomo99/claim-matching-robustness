The council told AFP no such warnings have been made, and the products remain approved for consumption by Muslims in the Southeast Asian country.\n\nA posting on website Kumatdata.blogspot.com in May 2017 published an article with a headline that translates as: \u201cThese are seasonings that contain and do not contain pork\u201d.\n\nThe article claimed a senior MUI had posted a document stating a review of eight widely consumed Indonesian food items had found traces of pork in seasoning from brands Masako, Sasa and Ajinomoto, as well as the Indomie instant noodle label.\n\nThe report warned \u201cmothers who like using seasonings\u201d to be careful and choose labels that were halal, meaning food that is prepared according to Muslim law.\n\nEating pork is forbidden in Islam, the predominant religion in Indonesia.\n\nThe MUI issues halal certification for products fit for consumption by Muslims in Indonesia.\n\nThe precise date the list was first published is unclear. But identical lists, purportedly from the MUI, were shared at least 35 times in different Facebook posts in July 2018, according to an AFP search on the social media platform.\n\nSimilar versions of the list have circulated for years.\n\nAn MUI document updated in August 2018 shows that all four brands alleged to contain pork have halal certification.\n\nThe deputy secretary-general of the council, Nadjamuddin Ramly, also told AFP the Kumatdata report was false.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fake news. The MUI central board has never issued any statement like [it],\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have denied making such statement many times in the past. But there seem to be some parties that continue to spread the claim, as if it was from the MUI central board.\u201d\n\nMedia groups have reported on the MUI's previous denials, including in 2016 and 2017.\n\nIn addition, Indonesia\u2019s food and drug monitoring agency, known as BPOM, issued a statement on December 30, 2016, in response to the false reports stating the products met halal standards.\n\nThe statement has an attachment identifying halal approved brands that lists the four mentioned in the false report.\n\nSpokeswoman Nelly Rachman told AFP that its 2016 statement and references to Masako, Sasa, Ajinomoto and Indomie being approved as halal remained current.\n\n\"Yes, it's still valid,\" she told AFP on August 14.", "lang": "en"}
