But he gives short shrift to safeguards in the bill that could keep many of them behind bars.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-11-30T08:00:39.539Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-14446", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/30/does-sentencing-bill-give-early-release-drug-traffickers-sex-offenders/", "vclaim": "\u201cThis bill is the best chance I have seen in decades to help begin to fix the federal prison system in meaningful ways that will reduce crime, lower prison populations, decrease costs and cut the rate of recidivism,\u201d former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed Thursday. \u201cMost important, it will help improve the lives of all Americans by giving some who are struggling with drug addiction, poverty or a lack of education the opportunity to become honest, upstanding citizens.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe biggest immediate impact of the bill would be felt by nearly 2,600 federal prisoners convicted of crack offenses before 2010,\u201d according to the Marshall Project. \u201cThat\u2019s the year Congress, in the so-called Fair Sentencing Act, reduced the huge disparity in punishment between crack cocaine and the powdered form of the drug. The First Step Act would make the reform retroactive. Those eligible would still have to petition for release and go before a judge in a process that also involves input from prosecutors. With crack\u2019s prevalence in many black neighborhoods in the 1980s, the crack penalty hit African Americans much harder than white powder cocaine users. That disparity has been a major example of the racial imbalance in the criminal justice system.\u201d\n\nPrisoners convicted of certain serious crimes would not be able to redeem time credits for early release under the First Step Act. These specific exceptions cover \u201ccrimes relating to terrorism, murder, sexual exploitation of children, espionage, violent firearms offenses, or those that are organizers, leaders, managers, supervisors in the fentanyl and heroin drug trade,\u201d as well as those with deportation orders. The list includes nearly 50 crimes in total, though not the ones Cotton pointed out.\n\nWe obtained BOP materials that say prisoners' risk levels are \u201ccomputed by summing scores for 15 predictors of serious misconduct such as prior record, seriousness of the current offense, history of violence, prison rule infractions, age, and the inmate\u2019s participation in programs.\u201d These materials also say \u201cthe two most common public safety factors bumping inmates from minimum security up to low security are being a deportable alien and being a sex offender,\u201d which mitigates Cotton\u2019s point that those convicted of sex crimes would be able to shave years off their sentences under the First Step Act.\n\nUnder this section, the prisoner would have to accumulate enough time credits for early release, file a petition, get the warden to approve it, and have shown \u201cthrough the periodic risk reassessments a demonstrated recidivism risk reduction.\u201d The warden would have to find first that the prisoner \u201cmade a good faith effort to lower their risk\u201d by participating in prison programs and that the inmate \u201cwould not be a danger to society if transferred to prerelease custody\u201d (such as a halfway house) \u201cor supervised release\u201d (meaning parole).\n\nFoy said: \u201cThe Bureau of Prisons hires wardens, trains them, oversees them, and carefully monitors the way that they comply with department regulations and guidance, especially where the release of prisoners is concerned. The legislation requires the warden to make a determination that the prisoner, among other things, \u2018would not be a danger to society if transferred to prerelease custody or supervised release\u2019 and \u2018is unlikely to recidivate.\u2019 Under the First Step Act, BOP is required to establish the risk assessment tool to make these very determinations and the warden would be extremely deferential to the risk and needs assessment program.\u201d\n\nCotton also notes that prisoners could receive time credits under the bill for \u201cproductive activities,\u201d not just for participating in the new anti-recidivism programs to be designed under the terms of the bill. \u201cProductive activities\u201d could mean anything prisoners already do, even watching a movie, he argued. But his staff could not provide examples of prisoners receiving time credits for early release for watching TV, and Lee wrote in a dueling National Review op-ed that it doesn\u2019t happen in the real world.\n\n\u201cThe way the law is written now, \u2018productive activities\u2019 are defined so vaguely that, based on what the BOP told us, almost anything the prisoner is doing fits into that definition,\u201d a Cotton representative said. \u201cWhat the BOP told us is that because this is a liberty interest ... an inmate can sue if they think they are not being treated fairly.\u201d\n\nBut his USA Today op-ed omits an important safeguard in the First Step Act: No one walks free unless the Bureau of Prisons gives the green light, and that decision must be based on metrics and numbers. Cotton\u2019s National Review op-ed does mention this provision, but he gives it short shrift. It\u2019s misleading to say BOP officials would be searching inmates' souls, and we don\u2019t see how these officials would score prisoners differently whether a Democrat or Republican inhabits the White House.", "lang": "en"}
