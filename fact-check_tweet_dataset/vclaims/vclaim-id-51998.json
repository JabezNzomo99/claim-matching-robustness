Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Eating alkaline foods of pH level above 8.5 can kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Fact: The research paper published in 1991 talks about the MHV4 virus, not about the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Some of the pH levels given in the post are not correct. Also, there is no scientific evidence to prove that eating alkaline foods can kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe 1991 research paper mentioned in the post can be found here. It can be read that it mentions about the \u2018Mouse Hepatitis Virus type 4 (MHV4)\u2019, not about the SARS-CoV-2 virus (which was first reported only in 2019).\n\n\n\nThe pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. But, in the post, it can be seen that the pH levels of some foods are above 14. Also, the pH of lemon is around 2, not 9.9.\n\nNeither WHO nor the Government of India has suggested any alkaline-based diet to kill Coronavirus. In the Africa Check article, it can be read that Oyewale Tomori (Virology Professor with the WHO) said, \u201cCoronavirus has nothing to do with the stomach, so how do these \u2018alkaline foods\u2019, like lemon, lime, avocado, and garlic, beat the virus? This claim should be ignored\u201d.\n\nTo sum it up, a message suggesting that \u2018alkaline foods can kill SARS-CoV-2 virus\u2019 is fake.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
