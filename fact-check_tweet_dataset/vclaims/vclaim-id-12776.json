No, that's not true: so far the protests against rising fuel prices have caused one death but a Belgian satire website with a history of inflating the count of deaths and injuries during breaking news events is at it again. Their counts are totally made up.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by NordPresse on November 17, 2018 titled \"Gilets Jaunes: Bilan \u00e0 10h: D\u00e9j\u00e0 12 morts\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nInterior Minister Christophe Castaner announced on television the death of 12 people in the town of Pont-de-Beauvoisin in Savoie, explaining that a mother who was driving her daughter to the doctor had panicked in front of a roadblock of the yellow vests and lightly mortally wounded 12 protesters.\n\nThe demonstration was not declared in the prefecture.\n\nNote: people being \"lightly\" killed is a trademark signature of NordPresse's satire articles.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail, with a modified screenshot from BFM TV:\n\nHowever in reality only one person was killed in the incident, which tragically did happen, and about 50 people were injured during the protests:\n\nLater on the site doubled down on the hoax, posting another story claiming 123 \"lightly dead\" and 2300 \"gravely wounded\":\n\nLe Journal Du Nord (nordpresse.be) is a satirical website that was set up to mock the (real) sudpresse.be (since renamed sudinfo.be), a Belgian media group. They were involved in a lawsuit with each other in 2017 which was eventually won by NordPresse.\n\nThey have sort of a disclaimer in their header that reads:\n\nTranslated: \"all information verified by our monkey analysts\".\n\nWe wrote about nordpresse.be before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: French Army Not Getting Ready to Stop Demonstration of Yellow Vests\n\u2022 Fake News: Halloween Purge in France, NO 1600 Cars Burned, NO 320 Wounded, NO 23 Dead\n\u2022 Fake News: NO 12 (Or 89 Or 123 Or 135) Dead, NO 870 Wounded, NO 13000 Cars Burned In French Riots Post World Cup Victory\n\u2022 Fake News: French Ex-President Sarkozy Did NOT Claim He Didn't Know Gaddafi Was A Dictator, Only Took 50 Million \"To Help\"\n\nFor more info on the \"yellow vests\" protests, see here:", "lang": "en"}
