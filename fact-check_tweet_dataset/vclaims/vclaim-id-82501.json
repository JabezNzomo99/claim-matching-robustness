The newspaper corrected its story later on.\n\nOn September 23, Amit Shah gave a speech as part of the Purvanchal Mahakumbh event in Delhi\u2019s Ramlila Maidan. Shah's anti migrant speech also drew sharp critique online for referring to migrants as \"infiltrators\" and \"termites\".\n\nAn article published on September 24 in the Indian Express misquoted Shah as having said '100 crore infiltrators entered the country'. The newspaper published an extract of Shah's speech in Hindi, \"Delhi ke andar awaidh ghuspethiyon se pareshani hai ya nahi? Inhe desh se nikalna chahiye ya nahin?100 crore ke tadad mein ghuspethiye ghus gaye hai aur deemag ki tarah chaat gaye hai desh ko. (Isn\u2019t there a problem of illegal immigrants in Delhi? Should they be removed from the country or no? 100 crore infiltrators have entered and like termites are eating up the country)\u201d\n\nBOOM accessed Shah\u2019s speech from the BJP's official YouTube account and found that Shah never used the number 100 crores but only said 'crores'.\n\nThe Indian Express corrected its story and included a note at the bottom explaining the error though the URL of the story is still the previous headline.\n\n\"(An earlier version of this report incorrectly quoted BJP president Amit Shah as saying 100 crore illegal infiltrators had entered the country. Shah had said crores of illegal infiltrators had entered the country)\" - The Indian Express\n\nScreenshot of the correction published by The Indian Express\n\nSeveral Congress functionaries tweeted the incorrect article while targeting Shah.\n\nRS Surjewala,Communications-in charge of the All Indian Congress Committee,shared the incorrect story on September 24.\n\nLike Surjewala, the official handle of the All India Mahila Congress and Karnataka Congress also tweeted the same article.\n\nThe tweet by Karnataka Congress was like by Congress President Rahul Gandhi, Karnataka Congress President Dinesh Gundu Rao and other party bigwigs.\n\nIn addition to Congress members, the incorrect statement was tweeted by Rajya Sabha member Manoj K Jha.", "lang": "en"}
