A video circulating through a Facebook page named \"News World\" would have you believe muslims are protesting in the streets in Denmark demanding a child marriage law. This is not what actually is shown in the video, that part is a complete fabrication.\n\nWe've embedded the post below for as long as it stays up, and the archived version of the video can be viewed here:\n\nThe Facebook post was published on March 6, 2018 and carried the caption \"News World | WTF!!?? Islamists marching in Denmark demanding a child marriage law\" (archived here).\n\nHowever the video appears to show a 2012 protest by the Denmark branch of Hizb Ut-Tahrir about the war in Syria. You can even see a picture of the event we found directly on Hizb Ut-Tahrir Denmark's own website which we've embedded below through Google's Image Search (archived here):\n\nThat doesn't mean Hizb Ut-Tahrir is just a harmless religious organisation: already back in 2015 there were calls to have the organization banned in Denmark. But not for calling for child marriage laws, that is completely made up.", "lang": "en"}
