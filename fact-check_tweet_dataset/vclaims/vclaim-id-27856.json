No, that's not true: the police force in Kenya just got new uniforms in September of 2018 (with pockets). Most articles claiming uniforms without pockets are coming do not cite any sources and seem to be mostly based on humorous comments made after the introduction of the current blue uniforms which said the pockets were made bigger to be able to accept more bribes.\n\nThe story went viral via an article published on February 7, 2019 by CelebritiesBuzz, a site from Ghana, titled \"Kenya to remove pockets from police uniforms to fight corruption\" (archived here) which read:\n\nReports have it that authorities in Kenya are planning to remove\n\npockets from police uniforms as part of President Kenyatta's\n\nfight against corruption in the country. The new set of police uniforms will have no pockets.\n\nIt is believed that the proposal, if implemented, would make it\n\ndifficult for Kenyan police officers who take bribes on the roads,\n\nto keep the cash they collect. However, sources within the Police Command say the officers will\n\nresist any attempt to make their uniforms pocketless, because the\n\npockets also beautifies the total appearance of a police officer.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nNote that the \"sources\" or \"reports\" are not named. The story itself seems to have appeared on several sites that apparently all copied it from each other:\n\nSeveral sources claimed Afrikan Daily was the source but it appears the Hivipunde article was earier (February 4, 2019).\n\nThe story went viral and appeared on Reddit and even on the radio in Belgium (at the 6:30 mark) at one point.\n\nHowever we found no trace of the \"news\" on the official website of the Kenyan police:\n\nWe also found no trace of the story in mainstream media sources from Kenya, although we did find plenty of reports about the new uniforms issued to police in September of 2018:\n\nThat story contained this quote:\n\nThe Kenyans praising the new outfit like the former senator, however, were few and far apart in Twitter and Facebook conversations. The criticism was intense and widespread, even crossing Kenyan borders. Tanzanians online, for instance, had a field day on Thursday poking fun at Kenyans after Mr Kenyatta unveiled the new uniform. It all started when BBC Swahili asked its followers to comment on the new uniforms with a majority of those commenting being Tanzanians. They made fun of not only the colour but also the design of the jackets, whose large pockets, they said, were ideal for stashing cash collected from bribes.\n\nSo it seems like someone took the criticism and turned it into a satire article or a joke which then got spread around as real news by other sites copying the story.\n\nWe have asked the Kenyan police for a comment but did not receive a reply in time for publication, this article will be updated if we receive one.", "lang": "en"}
