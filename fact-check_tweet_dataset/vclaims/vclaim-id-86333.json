In 1956, Morocco gained its independence from France and in 1975 invaded Western Sahara. In the power vacuum, Morocco, Mauritania and the Polisario, a pro-independence movement, fought over Western Sahara. Mauritania eventually renounced its claim and backed the Polisario. In the aftermath, the Moroccan government and the Polisario sporadically fought over the territory until the United Nations brokered a cease-fire in 1991.\n\nWalid Elbatal identifies as a media activist \u2014 someone who films and uploads videos and photos of Moroccan police violence online. Friends and relatives claim that although he doesn\u2019t have any bylines, he is well known by Moroccan authorities \u2014 so much so that his movements are monitored. Many Sahrawi activists claim to be living under Moroccan surveillance, which is one reason Sahrawi media activists and journalists do not put their names on their work.\n\nIn collaboration with the UC Berkeley Human Rights Center Lab, the Fact Checker confirmed the video\u2019s authenticity by comparing landmarks in the video to Google Earth satellite imagery. The video was taken June 9, a couple of blocks away from Lebsir\u2019s reception. There are many features that suggest that the men beating Elbatal were police officers in plainclothes. Elbatal was surrounded by police vehicles, one man is wearing a police helmet, and at the end of the video, one of the men escorts a woman from the vehicle Elbatal was in to a police car.\n\nThe front of the car carrying Elbatal was not damaged, as seen in photos published in a Moroccan news outlet and the video of the beating. This means it\u2019s unlikely that Elbatal and his friends hit the police vehicle. In fact, the front of the police car and the left side of the car Elbatal was in were damaged, supporting the claims of eyewitnesses.", "lang": "en"}
