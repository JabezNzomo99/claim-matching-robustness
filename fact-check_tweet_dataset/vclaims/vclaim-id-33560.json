Its analysis showed constituencies in London and the South East made up 60% of the government\u2019s planned funding on flood defences, despite making up 32% of England\u2019s population.\n\nBut those figures are skewed because of the different timescales some programmes are funded on. Some\u2014notably those on the Thames estuary in London\u2014are ongoing programmes that are scheduled to continue well into the future. Others were scheduled to be completed by 2020/21\u2014the end of the current programme of investment by the Environment Agency. That has the effect of making it look like some areas are getting more money simply because their funding stretches over a much longer period of time.\n\nLooking just at the spending up to 2021, Carbon Brief found more funding per person going to Yorkshire than any other region.\n\nThere are two drawbacks with applying these figures to the present day debate.\n\nOne minor point is that the figures are now dated. They will still reflect projects completed and underway by 2017, and planned projects for future years as they stood in 2017. But we don\u2019t know how much project spending plans or amounts have changed since then.\n\nSecondly, and more significantly, looking at spending \u201cper person\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily the best measure here, as not everyone in England is at equal risk of flooding. For example, Carbon Brief\u2019s data shows that large sums were allocated to constituencies containing the Thames Barrier, while some parts of the Midlands received no funding.\n\nData on flood defence spending has got worse in recent years\n\nThe Environment Agency currently publishes figures for capital investment on flood protection (so not including maintenance spending) by local area in England from 2019/20 to 2020/21. But less data is available than there used to be.\n\nCarbon Brief used the same source of data for its analysis from 2017, but back then there seemed to have been more historical data available.\n\nAs they stand, these figures can\u2019t tell us anything useful about regional investment spending. These show spending on individual projects, which will come and go across the country over a matter of years and won\u2019t always reflect the bulk of investment going into an area.\n\nLooking at one or two years of spending does not give a clear picture of what\u2019s going on with flood defence spending overall.\n\nInvestment spending is \u201clumpy over time\u201d, as different schemes are built in different years, according to Daniel Johns, then-head of adaptation at the independent Committee on Climate Change, speaking to the BBC\u2019s More or Less in 2016. \u201cTaking a snapshot in time and trying to look just at the capital investment programme rather than the total flood defence budget doesn\u2019t give you a true sense of the North-South divide\u201d.\n\nThe Labour Party also offered a specific view earlier this week:\n\nWe\u2019ve asked Labour for the source of its figures but have yet to receive a reply.\n\nOne possibility is data from the Treasury which breaks down identifiable spending by the Environment Agency on flood spending by UK region. This gives a broad picture of flood protection spending but doesn\u2019t include all sources of funding, so can\u2019t give a complete picture. We haven\u2019t been able to replicate Labour\u2019s figures, which in any case will only give a two-year snapshot of funding.", "lang": "en"}
