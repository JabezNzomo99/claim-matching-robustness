Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to combat online hoaxes.\n\nThe Facebook post comes with a photo collage of FBI agents in jackets and a mugshot of Barack Obama.\n\nBut this story has nothing to do with the former president. Neither does the FBI.\n\nIn January, the South Carolina Department of Revenue arrested Murad A. Alhanik, owner of Obama Mart in Columbia, S.C., of tax evasion. According to the state agency, \"From tax years 2013 to 2016, Alhanik filed monthly sales tax returns reporting a total of $971,935 in gross sales. However, the SCDOR investigation revealed actual sales to be $2,688,533. Due to the underreported sales, the defendant evaded paying $136,753 in sales taxes due to the state of South Carolina.\"\n\nMaxipolitics.com took that real story and distorted it by adding details about the FBI and an image of the former president.", "lang": "en"}
