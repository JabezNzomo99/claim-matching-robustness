In the photo, a banner could be seen beside the road with the photos of PM Narendra Modi, U.P Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and other BJP leaders. Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Photo of a road full of stagnant knee-deep rainwater in PM Narendra Modi\u2019s constituency Varanasi. Fact: In August 2018, a railway bridge underpass in Allahabad city was full of stagnat knee-deep rainwater. The photo shared in the post was shot during rains in Allahabad city and it is not related to PM Modi\u2019s constituency Varanasi. BJP leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi is the elected Lok Sabha member from the Allahabad constituency. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn reverse image search of the photo shared in the post, a similar photo was found in an article published by \u2018Patrika\u2019 newspaper on its website. In that article, it is mentioned that the photo was related to a railway bridge underpass in Allahabad city, Uttar Pradesh. It is also mentioned that a railway bridge underpass was filled with rainwater during monsoon 2018. BJP leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi represents the Allahabad Lok Sabha constituency. Hence the photo shared in the post is not related to PM Narendra Modi\u2019s constituency Varanasi.\n\nIn the article published by \u2018Patrika\u2019, it is mentioned that the photo was shot by Rajesh Kumar Singh.
