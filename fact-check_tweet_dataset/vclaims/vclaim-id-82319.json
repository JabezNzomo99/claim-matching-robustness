The initiative is funded by the Omidyar Network and the National Endowment for Democracy, and headed by Alexios Mantzarlis, co-founder of Pagella Politica, Italy\u2019s largest political fact-checking organization.\n\nTwelve fact-checking outlets from 10 countries, including The Fact Checker and PolitiFact in the United States, participated in the Factcheckathon, verifying claims made by respective political leaders. Not all fact-checking outlets use a rating system. Below are summaries from each fact-checker and this Poynter roundup, with links to the original pieces.\n\n\u201cOn the humanitarian front, our nations agreed that we have to do even more individually and collectively to address the agony of the Syrian people. The United States is already the largest donor of humanitarian aid to the Syrian people, some $4.5 billion in aid so far.\u201d\n\nWhile Obama says the humanitarian aid goes to \u201cthe Syrian people,\u201d a portion of the aid is given to host countries so that they have enough resources to accept and support refugees. The United States consistently has been the largest donor of humanitarian aid for the Syria conflict, using raw dollars. Of course, there are other ways to calculate the donation \u2014 as a percentage of GDP, for example. But no other country comes close when comparing the actual dollars contributed, committed and/or pledged. We rated this claim true, and awarded a Geppetto Checkmark.\n\nThis is similar to the claim above, but Obama spoke in general terms. PolitiFact found that America gives more humanitarian aid than any other country, and ranks first in supporting the United Nations in helping refugees. While this is true in financial support, countries also host refugees and provide humanitarian assistance in ways that can\u2019t easily be tallied. PolitiFact found it\u2019s important to acknowledge other forms of assistance. PolitiFact rated this \u201cMostly True.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish president was way off. Eurostat data as of July 2015 show the only country with minimum wage under 200 euros is Bulgaria (194 euros). The average amount of minimum wage for 23 EU countries whose minimum wage data is available is approximately 790 euros. This claim is rated \u201cFalse.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe measures that have been put into place in Europe up to now respect the Schengen Agreements. The decisions of the French President to reimpose controls on borders are expressly permitted by Schengen as a reaction to an event of this type.\u201d\n\nSchengen is considered one of the biggest accomplishments for European Union integration. With the recent refugee crisis, many member states decided to limit the freedom of movement introduced by the agreement. Juncker stated that France\u2019s decision to reimpose controls on borders is something permitted by Schengen. The agreement itself does include the possibility to reintroduce controls for maximum one month. With a 2013 regulation, under exceptional circumstances, member states were given the possibility to extend this period, from six to 24 months. This statement is rated \u201cTrue.\u201d\n\nAos Fatos and Lupa (below), fact-checking organizations in Brazil, checked numerous claims by Rouseff. One of the claims was that Brazil \u201cwas the government that has decreased taxes the most. It\u2019s not a matter of opinion, but numbers.\u201d But Aos Fatos found the numbers don\u2019t support this claim. It was unclear exactly which governments were being compared, either. This claim is rated \u201cFalse.\u201d\n\nLupa checked five claims by the Brazilian president, including a claim that in 2015, there were more than 1 million new openings for students at technical schools. Yet there was no public data available to verify the information. Lupe found that the 2015 census of basic education and higher education (a public document that show the number of registrations made in each segment of Brazilian education) has not been published yet. This claim is rated \u201cUnsustainable.\u201d\n\nPark said that in the first half of 2015, 46,000 companies were created through the Creative Economy plan, and that the policy was deemed successful by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. \u201cFact Check\u201d host and reporter Kim Pil-Gyu found that while the number of newly established start-ups is increasing, it is difficult to say it was the result of the Creative Economy plan. And the plan was named a case of \u201cinnovative economy strategy\u201d in the OECD report, but the word \u201csuccessful\u201d could not be found.\n\nThe claim that the British government is the second-largest contributor of humanitarian aid to Syria is correct, according to the United Nations. It gives details for \u201ctotal funding (appeal and non-appeal) to the Syria crisis\u201d over the past four years. At over $1.5 billion, Britain has contributed more than any other individual country bar the United States.", "lang": "en"}
