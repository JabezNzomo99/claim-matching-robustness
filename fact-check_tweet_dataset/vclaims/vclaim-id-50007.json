This claim is false; the photo shows dogs rescued from the meat trade in the southern Chinese province of Yunnan in 2012.\n\nThe photo was published here on Facebook on June 30, 2020. It has since been shared more than 180 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads, in part: \u201cThis is Yulin, China. / Dogs and cats are boiled alive, beaten into convulsions, set on fire.... all while being conscious. Many of these animals are stolen from loving families / This photo was taken 6/23/2020.\u201d\n\nYulin is a city in southern China\u2019s Guangxi province, which hosts an annual dog meat festival during the summer solstice.

On board were found more than 550 dogs packed into around 150 small cages.\u201d\n\nThe photo in the report is credited to Rex Features, a UK-based photo agency now called Shutterstock Editorial.\n\nA subsequent search found the photo published here on the Shutterstock Editorial website.\n\nThe photo description reads: \u201cTruck full of caged dogs heading for dog meat restaurants stopped, Yunnan Province, China - 19 Apr 2012.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison between the photo in the misleading post (L) and the Shutterstock Editorial photo (R) \u2013 AFP has circled identical parts in red:\n\nThe incident was also reported by the Yunnan-based news website GoKunming here on April 24, 2012.", "lang": "en"}
