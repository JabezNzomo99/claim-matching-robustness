On 22 May 2020, an aeroplane carrying 91 passengers and 8 crew members from Lahore to Karachi crashed in a residential area near Jinnah international airport minutes before landing, claiming the lives of nearly 97 people. But FACTLY has found the video in the post to be old and not related to any recent incident. The video is of a bus accident that took place on 28 September 2019. FACTLY tried to find more details about the incident but could not find any information from official sources. As the video is known to exist on the internet prior to the PIA passenger jet crash (22 May 2020), the claim is false.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
