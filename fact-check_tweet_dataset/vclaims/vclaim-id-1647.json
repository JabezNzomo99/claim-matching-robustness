It says yesterday\u2019s speech offered more certainty about the kind of Brexit the UK is aiming for, and investors like certainty.\n\nSaying the pound saw its biggest rise in years is very different from saying it rose to its highest level in years. A pound at $1.24 is still well below the levels it\u2019s seen in recent years.\n\nAt one point in 2014 a pound could have bought you over $1.70 and last year\u2014just before the EU referendum\u2014it was worth about $1.50, before falling to below $1.40 by the day after.\n\nMs Dorries is right that the share index of the 100 biggest companies on the London Stock Exchange is up today. But it fell yesterday when Mrs May made her speech.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the FTSE 100 tends to rise when the pound weakens, since many of the companies are multinationals that earn their profits in dollars abroad. If the value of the dollar goes up compared to pounds, their profits increase and the firms become more valuable to investors.", "lang": "en"}
