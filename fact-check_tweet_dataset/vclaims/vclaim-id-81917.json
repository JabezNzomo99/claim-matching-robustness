No Republican is running.\n\nBut although she worked with prosecutors in the Fresno County District Attorney\u2019s Office in California, even Swanigan doesn\u2019t say she worked as a prosecutor. Neither does the office.\n\nWhat the ad says\n\nThe ad is sponsored by Milwaukeeans for Self-Governance, which the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has described as a secretive group led by longtime conservative political operative Craig Peterson. In the April 2016 City of Milwaukee elections, the group ran attack ads against Mayor Tom Barrett, who easily won re-election, and backed the opponents of at least two Milwaukee aldermen, both of whom were re-elected.\n\nSwanigan\u2019s latest campaign finance report, filed in July 2016, says Peterson printed $476 worth of campaign brochures for her. Her previous report says Peterson contributed $250 to her campaign and provided $1,681 in printing and food and beverages for a Swanigan fundraiser.\n\nThe ad makes several attacks on Chisholm before making the claim we\u2019re checking. It was included in this section:\n\n\"Verona Swanigan is licensed to practice law in five states, holds a master\u2019s degree in forensic psychology, has worked as a prosecutor, and a probation and parole officer, and she is the daughter of a 32-year veteran of the Milwaukee Police Department. She has never lost a trial. The current DA has never even taken a bar exam.\"\n\nAs for the claim we\u2019re checking, Peterson told us that while employed by the Fresno DA, Swanigan \"filed cases, extradition motions and documentation,\" and made court appearances, which sounds like some of the things prosecutors do.\n\nWhat they say\n\nFresno County Assistant District Attorney Steve Wright told us Swanigan was classified as a legal assistant/paralegal when she worked in the office from March to December 2006. He said he did not know her job duties, but that she was not a sworn prosecutor.\n\nSwanigan had earned her law degree from Northern Illinois University in 2005, but hadn\u2019t yet passed the California bar exam when she was hired in Fresno.\n\nShe said that under the program she worked in, she filed criminal complaints, although they were done in the name of a sworn prosecutor; and made court appearances on her own, though under the supervision of a prosecutor.\n\nUnlike Peterson, Swanigan said she would not call herself a former prosecutor.\n\n\"I personally would not describe it that way,\" Swanigan told us, referring to the ad. \"He could make a legal argument for it to be described that way, but I would not.\"\n\nIndeed, the biographical section of Swanigan\u2019s campaign website says she worked at the Fresno County District Attorney\u2019s Office, but no position is listed.\n\nMilwaukeeans for Self-Governance says in a radio ad that Swanigan \"has worked as a prosecutor.\"\n\nSwanigan made court appearances and assisted prosecutors in other ways when she worked in the the Fresno County District Attorney\u2019s Office in California. But she was classified as a paralegal, not a sworn prosecutor, and does not describe herself as a former prosecutor.", "lang": "en"}
