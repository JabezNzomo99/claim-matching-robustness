And his claim about revenues is incorrect, although the claims about debt repayments and the amount debt takes out of revenue are correct. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOur government is broke. And it\u2019s official.\u201d This was the\n\nTitled \u201cWhen government goes for broke\u201d, the column was republished in\n\nand made a fascinating read as the former\n\nMailafia is an economist who\n\n. He gave debt and revenue figures for the first three months of 2020 as evidence for his claim.\n\nWe fact-checked these numbers, as well as two key claims in the article.\n\nMailafia said the country\u2019s finance minister had \u201crevealed\u201d that in the first quarter of 2020 \u2013 January to March \u2013 99% of the Nigerian government\u2019s revenue went to repaying debt.\n\nBut is this enough to say the government is broke? Mailafia told Africa Check he meant that the Nigerian government was \u201cgetting close to being broke\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat is why I said \u2018goes for broke\u2019 in the headline. One cannot say a country is completely broke. The government can sell land, print money or borrow, which is what our government is doing now.\u201d\n\nMailafia said his claim was based on figures from\n\nThe cheque is in the mail\n\nA straight comparison of debt to income is not enough to declare a country bankrupt, experts told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cYou cannot make such a conclusion using revenue and debt servicing figures for one quarter,\u201d said Olusegun Ajibola, professor of monetary economics at\n\n\u201cGovernment revenue accrues over time and so revenue recorded for the first quarter of 2020 may be from the last quarter\u201d of 2019, he said.\n\nHis gist was that a government\u2019s revenue in a particular quarter is not always from transactions in that quarter \u2013 it could be payment of a bill issued months before. For example, oil sold this month might be paid for months later.\n\nAjibola said this was the same for debt repayment. \u201cThe debt paid in the first quarter may have fallen due in the previous quarter. You must also consider the debt components being serviced, whether principal or interest.\n\n\u201cBefore one can consider a government to be broke, you must consider data from two, three or more quarters.\u201d\n\nTo get a bigger picture, assets such as\n\nshould also be considered, Ajibola said. The reserves include foreign currency and treasury bonds. As of 4 August, they were valued at\n\nalso count, the economist said. The most\n\n, for January and February, shows that Nigerians living abroad sent $3.1 billion home. In 2019 it was $19.2 billion. These amounts add up to trillions of naira. (\n\nin north-central Nigeria, agreed that foreign reserves were important in assessing a country\u2019s ability to repay debt.\n\nThe debt burden in relation to the gross domestic product and export earnings should also be considered, Odedokun said.\n\nWe therefore rate Mailafia\u2019s claim as misleading.\n\nThat being said, there is little doubt that the country\u2019s economy is in a tough phase at the moment, Shehu Aliyu, professor of financial economics at northern Nigeria\u2019s\n\n\u201cNigeria has been affected mainly because of the impact of\n\non the global oil market. But that is picking up gradually, so the current difficult economic situation will not last long.\u201d\n\n10% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP, but half of government revenue and 90% of export earnings. In 2019, the government took in\n\nof the revenue it predicted it would earn from oil and gas.\n\nits finances as being \u201ccritically constrained\u201d.\n\nBeyond Covid-19\u2019s impact on oil, Nigeria\u2019s economic woes have been caused by other internal factors, said Sarah Anyanwu, an economics professor at the\n\n\u201cThe impact of Covid-19 is global so the Nigerian government can\u2019t be blamed for that,\u201d Anyanwu said. \u201cBut factors like corruption, insecurity and reliance on oil for foreign exchange need to be addressed.\u201d\n\nAnyanwu added that the threat of violence in some parts of the country was reducing farmers\u2019 productivity. Agriculture is an important part of the economy. In a rare interview in July, president Muhammadu Buhari\n\ninsecurity in the country\u2019s north as \u201cvery, very disturbing\u201d.\n\nCaleb University\u2019s Ajibola agreed that Nigeria needed to diversify its economy to reduce its dependence on oil.\n\nWe traced this figure to the budget office\u2019s\n\nNigeria\u2019s constitution says revenue must be\n\namong its three levels of government: federal, state and local.\n\nThe government earned N2.2 trillion in the first quarter of 2020. This was N1.38 trillion in oil revenue and N825.37 billion from non-oil taxes, such as income, value added tax and custom revenues.\n\nThis was before deductions, mainly a 13% deduction from oil revenue for states that produce crude.\n\nfrom the main pool of the\n\nwas shared among the three levels of government.

But Nigeria\u2019s entire revenue that quarter was in fact N2.2 trillion. If he had said\n\nrevenues stood at N950 billion, he would have been on surer footing. We therefore rate the claim as incorrect.\n\nMailafia described this amount as \u201cstaggering\u201d.
