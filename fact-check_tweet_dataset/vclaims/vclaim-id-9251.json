The event was an otherwise unremarkable campaign stop, save for one portion of Trump\u2019s speech (transcribed below) in which he apparently started out attempting to criticize the nuclear deal that the Obama administration negotiated with Iran but veered into a minute-and-a-half long sentence that spanned his uncle\u2019s academic qualifications, his own education, Democrats\u2019 denying Republicans\u2019 credentials, the power of nuclear technology, the number of American prisoners freed by Iran in conjunction with the nuclear deal, and the adeptness of \u201cPersian\u201d negotiators (particularly women), before circling back to how the Iranians \u201ckilled us\u201d in the nuclear deal:\n\n\u201cLook, having nuclear \u2014 my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart \u2014 you know, if you\u2019re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I\u2019m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world \u2014 it\u2019s true! \u2014 but when you\u2019re a conservative Republican they try \u2014 oh, do they do a number \u2014 that\u2019s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune \u2014 you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we\u2019re a little disadvantaged \u2014 but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me \u2014 it would have been so easy, and it\u2019s not as important as these lives are \u2014 nuclear is so powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what\u2019s going to happen and he was right, who would have thought? \u2014 but when you look at what\u2019s going on with the four prisoners \u2014 now it used to be three, now it\u2019s four \u2014 but when it was three and even now, I would have said it\u2019s all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don\u2019t, they haven\u2019t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it\u2019s gonna take them about another 150 years \u2014 but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us, this is horrible.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe one thing that puzzles us the most about this sprawling statement is this: Donald Trump\u2019s late uncle, Dr. John Trump, was indeed a renowned professor at MIT, and among his many notable contributions to science were developing methods for treating cancer through radiation and studying how to radiate deep tumors without harming nearby healthy tissue. But what did he reveal to his nephew about \u201cnuclear\u201d 35 years ago that it would have been surprising for anyone to think of?\n\n\u201cMy uncle used to tell me about nuclear before nuclear was nuclear\u201d and \u201cHe would tell me, \u2018There are things that are happening that could be potentially so bad for the world in terms of weaponry,'\u201d Donald Trump has claimed, even though the U.S. had already developed and used nuclear weapons before he was born (1946). Could anyone have really been unaware or doubtful that \u201cnuclear is powerful\u201d in the 1980s, when Dr. Trump supposedly informed his nephew of that fact?", "lang": "en"}
