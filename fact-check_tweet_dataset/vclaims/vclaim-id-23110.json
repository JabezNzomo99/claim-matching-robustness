Here, even saying \u2018Bharat Mata Ki Jai\u2019 puts Islam in danger- translation).\n\nThe above message is being circulated widely on social media, claiming that the Government of Saudi Arabia has released an Arabic translation of the Bhagavad Gita. It has been shared on both Twitter and Facebook. Accompanying the message is a picture of a book cover showing Krishna and Arjuna on a chariot, along with what appears to be Arabic text.\n\nThe above tweet has been retweeted close to 1000 times since June 24 when it was posted. Another tweet has been \u2018liked\u2019 over 600 times.\n\nOn Facebook, a page named Hindutva Meri Shaan posted this message on June 24. It has been shared over 1600 times since then. It has also been posted by several individual users on their timelines.\n\nWHAT IS THE TRUTH?\n\nThe claim that an Arabic translation of the Bhagavad Gita has been released by the Saudi Arabian government, is utterly false. A simple Google search with the keywords \u2018Saudi Arabia Bhagavad Gita Arabic translation\u2019 throws up not a single news report. An event of this kind would be covered extensively by mainstream media organisations. This itself suggests that the claim is a figment of imagination.\n\nFurther, Alt News reverse searched the accompanying image of the book, and found a website dedicated to a ISKCON devotee. Ravanari Prabhu was a ISKCON devotee who was born in Palestine and joined the Krishna cult in Germany in 1973.\n\nAccording to several sources online, Prabhu had translated the Bhagavad Gita into Arabic. We also found a Facebook post of 2015, reiterating the same.\n\nRavanari Prabhu also has a website, www.ravanari.com wherein the Arabic translation of the Bhagavad Gita is available.\n\nThat is not all. Translation of the Bhagavad Gita into Arabic was also undertaken by Osmania University, Hyderabad which has been publishing it for several years now. According to a 2017 report by Times of India, \u201cIt was Dairatul Ma\u2019arifil Osmania (Centre for Research and Editing of Manuscripts) that had translated and published the Holy Gita in Arabic in 1918.\u201d The university had celebrated 100 years of the Arabic translation of the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nThe translation of the Bhagavad Gita into Arabic is not simply a modern day project. It was undertaken as early as the 11th century CE by Al Biruni, a scholar and traveler who was born in 973 C.E in Khwarizm, a region spread over modern day Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Al Biruni accompanied Mahmud of Ghazni to India at the turn of the 11th century CE and wrote extensively on his travels in the sub-continent. Al Biruni wrote in Arabic.\n\nCarl W. Ernst in his book \u2018Refractions of Islam in India: Situating Sufism and Yoga\u2019 writes, \u201cAl Biruni translated a number of Sanskrit works into Arabic (including selections from Patanjali\u2019s Yogasturas and the Bhagavad Gita) in connection with his encyclopedic treatise on India\u201d. Arvind Sharma\u2019s \u2018Studies in Alberuni\u2019s India\u2019 has an entire chapter titled, \u2018Al Biruni and the Bhagavad Gita\u2019, which talks at length about Al Biruni\u2019s citation of the Holy book.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that the Government of Saudi Arabia has commissioned an Arabic version of the Bhagavad Gita, is false. Moreover, translation of the Gita in Arabic has been available for several years, and is not recent.", "lang": "en"}
