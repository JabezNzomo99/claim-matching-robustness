Offenders have been prosecuted for upskirting offences under the existing voyeurism clauses in the Sexual Offences Act, and the common law offence of outraging public decency.\n\nBut there are criticisms that these laws don\u2019t go far enough.\n\nFor example, the offence of outraging public decency has to be witnessed by two or more other people. And to be an offence under the voyeurism clauses, the upskirting would have to record a \u201cprivate act\u201d.\n\nThe upskirting bill would add to the existing Sexual Offences Act, specifying that recording an image or \u2018operating equipment\u2019 beneath the clothing of another person without their consent, for the purposes of sexual gratification or to humiliate or distress the person, is an offence.\n\nThe bill applies to the law in England and Wales as justice matters are devolved in Northern Ireland and Scotland. Northern Ireland\u2019s voyeurism laws under the Sexual Offences Order 2008 are currently the same as in England and Wales.\n\nIn Scotland taking photographs under a person\u2019s clothing is already a specific crime under the Sexual Offences Act 2009.", "lang": "en"}
