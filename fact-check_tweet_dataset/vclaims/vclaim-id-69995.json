July 2020,\" reads the description of an image showing a street littered with debris.\n\n\"Photo on the right: The aftermath of Sturgis, SD after 460,000 bikers. August 2020,\" the post says about another image showing a tidy intersection.\n\nThe photo that claims to be Seattle isn\u2019t Seattle, though. It\u2019s Brooklyn.\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe did a reverse image search for the photo that the Facebook post says is the \u2018CHOP Zone,\u2019 referring to the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest, which was also known as the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, or CHAZ. Protesters occupied several blocks in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s killing. Police cleared the area in July.\n\nThe search led us to an Aug. 13 post on the neighborhood blog Greenpointers, which reports on news in the Greenpoint neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nThe headline: \"How a photo of trash in Greenpoint became a photo of Seattle\u2019s \u2018Autonomous Zone.\u2019\"\n\nA Brooklyn resident brought the photo to Greenpointers\u2019 attention after noticing what he thought was a sign for a local parking garage, according to the post. A video in the post taken by another Brooklyn resident shows the scene captured in the Facebook image. The trash sprawled across the street resulted from a lit, discarded cigarette that set a pile of trash bags on fire on June 2.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find the original image that the Facebook post describes as Sturgis, S.D., which hosted a motorcycle rally in August. But as Reuters points out in its fact-check of a similar post, it appears to be a screenshot of a live feed of the intersection where Junction Avenue and Main Street meet in the city. We don\u2019t know when the screenshot was taken.\n\nRegardless, this Facebook post misuses a photo of the aftermath of a trash fire in Brooklyn to claim that Seattle protesters were responsible for the mess. That\u2019s wrong.", "lang": "en"}
