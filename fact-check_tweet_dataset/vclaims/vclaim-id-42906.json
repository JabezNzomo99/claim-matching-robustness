What a hero,\" Kimmel says, \"and since it was going so well, and also because he didn\u2019t realize he had a mic on, Magic Mike decided to keep it going. Listen in closely here.\"\n\nKimmel cuts back to Pence. Audio picks up one of the workers telling the vice president that the rest of the boxes in the van are empty. Pence can be heard responding, \"Can I carry the empty ones? Just for the camera?\"\n\nThe video ends, and Kimmel says, \"Mike Pence pretending to carry empty boxes of PPEs into a hospital is the perfect metaphor for who he is and what he's doing: A big box of nothing delivering another box of nothing.\"\n\nBefore deleting it, the Occupy Democrats group re-shared the clip on Facebook with the headline: \"OMG: Mike Pence caught on hot mix \"delivering\" EMPTY boxes of PPE to hospital... and PRETENDING THEY ARE HEAVY!\" Other websites quickly followed suit.\n\nBut the video is deceptively edited. The Kimmel clip cuts the video off at a selective point, just before Pence shuts the door to the van. Pence doesn\u2019t touch or pretend to lift any empty boxes.\n\nThe clip was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe video was taken on May 7, 2020, as Pence helped deliver equipment from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to the Woodbine Rehabilitation & Healthcare Center in Alexandria, Va.\n\nWe found the full 29-minute video on CSPAN. Pence\u2019s empty boxes quip comes around the 9-minute mark.\n\nAfter unloading a few boxes, Pence walks back to the van and is told that the rest of the boxes in it are empty. He then asks if he can carry the empty ones for the cameras and smiles after people around him laugh.\n\nOne man helping unload the boxes says, \"Absolutely, they\u2019re a lot easier,\" to more laughter before Pence shuts the van doors.\n\nPence\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nJon Thompson, Pence\u2019s campaign communications manager, tweeted that the Kimmel clip is \"garbage\" and said Pence is \"clearly joking about empty boxes & if Kimmel showed the full clip from CSPAN, not the one he selectively edited, you see and hear it.\" (Kimmel apologized via Twitter, sort of.)\n\nPosts used video from Jimmy Kimmel to claim Pence was caught on a hot mic delivering empty boxes of PPE to a nursing home and pretended they were heavy. That\u2019s not what happened.", "lang": "en"}
