Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nWhen searched for the tweet shared in the post using Twitter Advanced Search, it is found that no such tweet was made by Amit Shah from his official Twitter account. It is a morphed one. When the tweet in the screenshot is carefully observed, one can notice that the alignment of text and profile picture is not the same as the format of a normal tweet. Also, Amit Shah always used his official twitter handle either from his iPhone or from his twitter media studio. But, the tweet shown in the screenshot could be seen posted from an Android device.\n\nWhen this morphed tweet went viral on social media, the official twitter handle of Spokesperson, Minister of Home Affairs (@PIBHomeAffairs) clarified that the tweet is a fake one. They clarified that no such tweet was posted by Union Minister Amit Shah.\n\nEarlier in May 2020, during the Handwara Encounter operation, Mobile Internet services were completely suspended in the Valley of Jammu and Kashmir. On 27 May 2020, Indian Government restricted Internet services in Jammu and Kashmir to 2G Network only, extending the ban on 4G network services till 17 June 2020. Yet Again, on 17 June, Government extended the ban on 4G services till 08 July 2020. So, the Indian Government has only banned 4G Internet services in Jammu and Kashmir and not Internet services as such.\n\nTo sum it up, a morphed tweet of Home Minister Amit Shah is shared as Government passing an order for complete suspension of Internet services in Ladakh & Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
