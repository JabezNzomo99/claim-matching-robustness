Roosevelt\u2019s four terms in office. She is widely credited with transforming the role of first lady from one in which the president\u2019s spouse mainly acts as a \u201cgracious hostess\u201d to one in which she champions social causes more actively.\n\nThroughout her life, Roosevelt delivered speeches and published articles on numerous topics, including female empowerment. However, the quote attributed to her in the image does not appear in any of her writings.\n\nIt actually originated with a scholarly article written by Ulrich in 1976, appearing in the opening paragraph. She penned the saying \u201cwell-behaved women seldom make history\u201d in writing about the Puritan women celebrated in funeral sermons.\n\nThough figures like Roosevelt or Marilyn Monroe often have the saying misattributed to them, Ulrich confirmed that she is the source of the quote.\n\n\u201cI actually wrote a book explaining the origin of the quotation and then exploring some of the many ways women make history,\u201d she told The Daily Caller in an email.\n\nAccording to Ulrich\u2019s book \u201cWell-Behaved Women Seldom Make History,\u201d journalist Kay Mills introduced the quote to popular culture in 1995 when she used a slightly altered version as the epigraph for her own women\u2019s history book. Mills changed the word \u201cseldom\u201d to \u201crarely.\u201d\n\nThe altered version of the quote has since appeared on t-shirts and bumper sticks, as well as other retail products. Feminist groups utilize the phrase, too.", "lang": "en"}
