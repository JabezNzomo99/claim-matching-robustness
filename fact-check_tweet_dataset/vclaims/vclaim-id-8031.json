Emmanuel \u201cManny\u201d Pacquiao Jan. 16 in his sponsorship speech recommending for approval Senate Bill 1620 for such purpose.\n\nOther legislators had similarly proposed abolishing the board, which through the years has come under fire for corruption allegations in managing the motor vehicle user\u2019s charge (MVUC) funds, an amount collected from owners of motor vehicles, and the government\u2019s third largest income source.\n\nThe board in response has made one curious claim: it said it is now under the \u201ccontrol and supervision\u201d of the Office of the President.\n\nPrior to Pacquiao\u2019s bill, Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez and House Majority Leader Rodolfo Fari\u00f1as filed House Bill 6236 also seeking to abolish the Road Board, saying MVUC funds \u201cbecame an avenue for graft and corruption.\u201d\n\nThe board Aug. 25 responded with a press release bearing Malaca\u00f1ang\u2019s seal and using an \u201cOffice of the President\u201d letterhead:\n\nIn a Sept. 18 budget hearing, Sen. Loren Legarda asked Road Board Executive Director Luisito Clavano to support the claim and show an executive order issuing its transfer under Malaca\u00f1ang.\n\nThe Road Board is not under the Office of the President, according to Malaca\u00f1ang itself.\n\nVERA Files checked with the Malaca\u00f1ang Records Office, which forwarded the query to the Office of the Deputy Executive Secretary for General Administration (ODESGA) \u201cfor further clarification.\u201d\n\nIt said it had received a letter from the board, but declined to provide a copy, citing \u201cinternal communication\u201d:\n\nFour other bills in addition to Pacquiao\u2019s and Alvarez-Fari\u00f1as\u2019 seeking to abolish the Road Board had been filed during the 17th Congress, all pending at the committee level.\n\nEfforts to address MVUC funds corruption issues go back since 2009, when former Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago issued a resolution urging the Ombudsman to prosecute the board\u2019s \u201cunconscionable multibillion anomalies.\u201d\n\nTwo bills were also filed previously seeking to either improve or scrap the board.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte himself in a speech Sept. 9, two weeks after the Road Board issued the press release on Malaca\u00f1ang letterhead, said he will abolish the board:\n\nSince 2014, the Commission on Audit (COA) has been noting the Road Board Secretariat goes beyond its mandate and implements projects despite its role limited only to \u201cmonitoring the collection, deposit and utilization of MVUC funds.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, only 68 of 223 target projects were completed in addition to 156 incomplete projects from prior years, according to COA, attributing this to \u201cineffective planning and supervision.\u201d\n\nSenate of the Philippines, Sen.
