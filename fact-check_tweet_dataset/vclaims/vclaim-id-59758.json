Bihira lang ang isang hari na purihin ang President natin sa magandang nagawa nya sa Pilipinas. Mabuhay Duterte! Proud DDS!\u201d (Thank you King Johan Konrad III for praising our president. It is rare for a king to praise our president for the good he is doing for the country. Long live Duterte! Proud DDS!)\n\nTwo of these graphics had the logo of Inquirer.net and were dated April 6, 2020 and April 26, 2020, respectively. Another bore the logo of The Philippine Star and was dated May 20, 2020.\n\nAs of writing, two of these quote cards are no longer available, and may have been deleted or removed.\n\nThough some users identified the posts as satire, other users appeared to believe them to be true, with comments like, \u201cThank you King Johan Konrad. God bless you,\u201d and \u201cMabuti pa ang mga dayuhan maganda pa ang sinasabi sa nagpa lakad sa pamahalaan.\u201d (Foreigners are better than Filipinos, they can appreciate how our government runs the country better than the locals do.)\n\nThe images on the quote cards are actually Swedish YouTuber Felix Kjellberg (also known as \"PewDiePie\") and his wife, social media personality Marzia Kjellberg. The reigning Swedish monarchs, King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia, have not recently said anything about President Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nThe graphics manipulated the quote cards of Inquirer.net and The Philippine Star. These news outlets did not release any quote cards of the Swedish YouTuber or his wife with these photos. There are also no news reports or statements containing these quotes attributed to PewDiePie.\n\nSweden's reigning monarchs have not said anything about President Duterte. However, Swedish Ambassador to the Philippines Harald Fries said in 2016 that Sweden was concerned over the number of killings in the Philippines. Fries also said at a forum in 2019 that he did not find Duterte's rape jokes funny.\n\nRappler found the original photos of Pewdiepie and Marzia by performing a Google reverse image search of the graphics. The photo in one of the graphics was lifted from a photo posted on Marzia\u2019s Instagram account in August 2019.", "lang": "en"}
