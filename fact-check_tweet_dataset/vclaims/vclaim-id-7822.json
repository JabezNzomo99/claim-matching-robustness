The image of the \"burned server\" used to illustrate the story actually comes from the website of KrollOntrack, a company advertising data recovery services (including from fire-damaged computers). An actual news report from local news source lohud.com makes no mention of servers or papers and indicates the fire wasn't even in the actual Clinton house:\n\nThe small fire started in the second-floor ceiling of a facility used by the Secret Service, which is in a detached structure behind the Clintons' home, the Secret Service said in a statement. The fire was put out by fire extinguishers, and firefighters inspected the area to ensure it was completely out, the Secret Service said.\n\nSo it is pretty safe to say the story about the servers and the hard drives is a hoax, especially given the reputation of YourNewsWire. The site has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt.\n\nTheir articles are often copied by other fake news sites or conspiracy-related Youtube channels, in many cases without proper attribution.\n\nThe site was recently profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.", "lang": "en"}
