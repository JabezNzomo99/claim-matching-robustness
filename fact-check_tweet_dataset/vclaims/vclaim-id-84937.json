Eickelman of Dartmouth College, who is a member of the journal\u2019s advisory board, described it as a \u201cfairly innocuous journal.\u201d He said it was \u201canything but radical, within the golden mean of what academic journals do.\u201d He said most of the articles are written by emerging scholars who are relatively early in their academic careers. \u201cThe authors can vary in quality, as is the case with most academic journals,\u201d he said. \u201cSome are more edgy than others, but you can learn some fresh things.\u201d He added that no one works on the journal full time.\n\nAli Asani, another advisory board member who directs the Islamic Studies program at Harvard University, said that Abedin\u2019s father was especially interested in issues concerning Muslims who live as minorities in countries, as well as Muslim sects that are minorities in Muslim communities. That interest continues to be demonstrated in the recent issue, with five articles on Muslim life in Australia.\n\nAsani described Syed Abedin as a model of a \u201cmoderate Muslim\u201d (though he dislikes the term), who was educated at Aligarh Muslim University in India, founded as a forward-thinking, even liberal institution. Syed later received a PhD from the University of Pennsylvania. Asani said that he attended a conference organized by Syed that featured a speech by Bernard Lewis, the Princeton University scholar whose advice was sought by neoconservatives before the 2003 Iraq invasion. (Lewis at one time also was an advisory board member of the journal.)\n\nSyed Abedin in 1978 founded the Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs, a think tank which began publishing the journal a year later, with the support of Abdullah Omar Naseef, at the time president of King Abdulaziz University. Later, between 1983 and 1993, Naseef was secretary-general of the Muslim World League, a pan-Islamic nongovernmental organization. (Interestingly, in 1983, Naseef was also awarded the Bronze Wolf, bestowed by the World Scout Committee for \u201coutstanding service to the World Scout Movement.\u201d)\n\nNaseef thus was secretary-general when the Muslim World League, after heated debate, in 1990 endorsed Saudi Arabia\u2019s decision to call in U.S. troops to help defend the kingdom after Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait. Naseef\u2019s name also appeared on the advisory board of the journal until 2004, though members say their duties are limited to reviewing an occasional article before publication.\n\nIn 1988, during his tenure at the Muslim World League, Naseef authorized a Pakistani charity called the Rabita Trust at a time when the United States and its allies funded the mujahideen fighting the Soviet troops occupying Afghanistan. Years later, the fund became associated with al-Qaeda (which, after all, emerged from the mujahideen) and was frozen in 2002 by the Treasury Department after the 9/11 attacks. But that distant connection, a quarter-century later, is now used to tar Abedin.\n\nMeanwhile, Abedin\u2019s mother founded an aid organization in the 1990s called the International Islamic Committee for Woman and Child, which at one point was said to be affiliated with International Islamic Council for Da\u2019wa and Relief. IICDR was banned in Israel years later for allegedly supporting Hamas, a Palestinian offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, under the auspices of yet another group, the Union of Good. The Union of Good was designated by Treasury in 2008 for aiding a terrorist organization.\n\nJames Piscatori, an Islamic scholar at Durham University in England who said he was involved with the Institute for Muslim Minority Affairs from its earliest days, described both parents as \u201cpioneers\u201d in the studies of Muslim minorities who edited a serious academic publication. \u201cAssociational blame ignores the nuance and contextualisation that individuals bring to their analysis, and seeks to delegitimise them by an unreflective linkage to \u2018radicalism,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, the connections are so tenuous as to be obscure. Harvard\u2019s Asani said the alleged connections to the Muslim Brotherhood are \u201ccrazy\u201d when you consider the stated purpose of the journal. \u201cThe Muslim Brotherhood was the last organization interested in this issue\u201d of the rights of minority Muslims, he said. \u201cSyed Abedin was far from the Muslim Brotherhood. It makes absolutely no sense.\u201d\n\nDuffy asked why the alleged Muslim Brotherhood connections to Huma Abedin are not being talked about. Perhaps it\u2019s because they are bogus. Abedin has lived in the United States for 23 years, working in the White House, the Senate and the State Department. Vague suggestions of suspicious-sounding connections to her parents don\u2019t pass the laugh test, even at the flimsiest standard of guilt by association.", "lang": "en"}
