The claim in the screenshot is that the head of Goliath, a character in the Bible, was exhumed at the feet of Mount Elah as discovered by German Archaeologist Dr. Martin. Let\u2019s check the authenticity of the claim.\n\n\n\nClaim: Image of Goliath\u2019s skull exhumed at the feet of Mount Elah as discovered by German Archaeologist Dr. Martin. Fact: The image of \u2018two men exhuming a skull\u2019 is an entry of a photoshop contest seeking hoax archaeological discovery. The image is not related to any true event. And, the news clip in the screenshot is that of \u2018Weekly World News\u2019, a tabloid ill-reputed for publishing sensational and fake news. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe screenshot had a news clip of \u2018Weekly World News\u2019. So when searched for that article, it was found and known to have been published in June-1993. In the article, it was written that a leading Archaeologist Dr. Martin has claimed to have found Goliath\u2019s skull in a valley west of Jerusalem. So, when looked for other news reports about it, a few other websites were found to have carried news regarding the same news clip of Weekly World News (WWN). But, there are no reports of any prominent newspapers regarding the exhuming of Goliath\u2019s skull discovered by archaeologist Dr. Martin. When looked for the credibility of WWN, reports were found that the tabloid was known to be ill-reputed for publishing stories based on sensationalism and fake news. More information about the nature and credibility of the news that was published by WWN tabloid can be read here. \n\n\n\nFrom an article of \u2018Snopes\u2019, it was found that the photograph of \u2018two men exhuming a skull\u2019 is actually an entry of a photoshop contest seeking hoax archaeological discovery. So, the image is not that of a true event.\n\n\n\nTo conclude, the image of an entry of a photoshop contest is being shared as Goliath\u2019s skull exhumed at Mount Elah. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
