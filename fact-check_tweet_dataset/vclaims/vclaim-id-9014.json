The Republicans painted a picture of a nation beset by losses, pounded by violence at home, threatened by immigrants and terrorists and abused by feckless leaders.\n\nFor the Democrats, it was infinitely sunnier in Philadelphia.\n\nEven as they talked about the pains of ordinary people, they spotlighted gains made over the past eight years and spoke with boundless optimism of Americans\u2019 capacity to pull together and solve problems.\n\nIn the course of a dozen days, we checked scores of claims. A handful or two capture the competing visions that shaped the nominating conventions.\n\nDonald Trump told the party faithful that he would be the law and order candidate and his policies would \"liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.\"\n\nTrump said, \"Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration\u2019s rollback of criminal enforcement. Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America\u2019s 50 largest cities. That\u2019s the largest increase in 25 years.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s numbers are right, but misleading. Homicides didn\u2019t go up in all 50 cities. They were up in some and down in others. Most of the increase came from sharp rises in four cities, Chicago, Houston, Baltimore and Washington.\n\nSeasoned criminologists told us that the numbers can change from year to year, but since 1993, the trend has headed down. The also said the number of murders was unusually low in 2014, making a rise this year more dramatic.\n\nTrump said his tax proposals are the exact opposite of what Clinton has in mind.\n\n\"While Hillary Clinton plans a massive tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for president this year, Democrat or Republican,\" he said.\n\nClinton has proposed an increase in taxes, but experts said it will likely only significantly affect the rich, not the middle class. Whether the increase is \"massive\" is up for debate.\n\nAn analysis by the Tax Policy Center found his plan would decrease government revenue more than any other candidate running in 2016. (But also add trillions to the deficit.)\n\nOn balance, we rated this claim Mostly True.\n\nFormer presidential candidate and current New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie played the role of prosecutor to convict Hillary Clinton of lying about her use of a private email server as secretary of state.\n\n\"She said all-work related emails were sent back to the State Department,\" Christie said. \"The FBI director said that's not true.\"\n\nA Clinton campaign fact sheet does state all work-related emails were provided to the State Department. The FBI investigation, however, came to a different conclusion.\n\n\"Several thousand work-related emails that were not in the group of 30,000 that were returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014,\" FBI director James Comey said.\n\nHe did add, however, there was no evidence Clinton intentionally concealed the emails, because she might have deleted them \"like many email users.\"\n\nChristie got the facts right, so we rated his claim True.\n\nTrump\u2019s running mate Indiana Gov. Mike Pence went after Clinton for her perceived callous response to the Benghazi attacks.\n\nPence charged that \"it was Hillary Clinton who left Americans in harm's way in Benghazi and after four Americans fell said, 'What difference at this point does it make?\u2019\"\n\nThis significantly distorted what actually happened.\n\nClinton made the comment during a hearing months after the attack. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., pressed Clinton on why State Department officials in Washington didn\u2019t call their counterparts in Libya immediately to determine the cause of the attack.\n\nClinton told Johnson her priority was figuring out how to rescue Americans, not pressing them for information. When Johnson continued to press her for a more straightforward answer, Clinton gave an exasperated answer.\n\n\"With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they\u2019d they go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make?\" she said.\n\nActor Antonio Sabato Jr.questioned Obama\u2019s religion, saying the president is \"absolutely\" a Muslim.\n\n\"We had a Muslim president for seven and half years,\" he said in an interview with ABC News after his speech.\n\nWe\u2019ve debunked this claim any number of times, but it keeps coming back.\n\nObama\u2019s Christian roots go back far, including his formal declaration of his faith when he worked as a community organizer in Chicago.\n\nWe rated this Pants on Fire!\n\nWhen it was the Democrats\u2019 turn, they recast the Republicans\u2019 claims in a new light.\n\nObama said that for Trump, \"it doesn\u2019t matter to him that illegal immigration and the crime rate are as low as they\u2019ve been in decades, because he\u2019s not offering any real solutions to those issues.\"\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to know the precise number of illegal immigrants, but in 2015, the number of people apprehended by the U.S. Border Patrol dropped to 337,117. In 2000, the number was 1.6 million.\n\nOn crime, FBI data show a steady decline in violent offenses and property crime since 1993. Preliminary data for 2015 might show an uptick in some categories, but there is no question that the numbers are better than they were a decade ago.\n\nHillary Clinton touted how much things got better under Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\"Our economy is so much stronger than when they took office. Nearly 15 million new private-sector jobs,\" Clinton said.\n\nHere\u2019s the issue with that statement.\n\nYes, the country gained nearly 15 million jobs from the absolute low point of the recession, but that was in February 2010, about year into Obama\u2019s first term.\n\nIf you count from \"when they took office,\" as Clinton said, the gain is about 10 million.\n\nClinton also talked about how the Middle East became at least a bit safer with the deal that rolled back Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\n\"I'm proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot,\" she told the crowd in Philadelphia.\n\nIt\u2019s true enough that no shots were fired. The question is, did the agreement \"put a lid on\" the nuclear program.\n\nAccording to a number of experts, the general answer is yes. Critics worry about the deal, but Iran gave up 97 percent of its enriched uranium and a lot of the equipment needed to enrich more.\n\nWith inspections, it\u2019s now much harder for Iran to violate the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and experts say, so long as it sticks to the rules, it won\u2019t be able to build a nuclear weapon.\n\nWe rated this claim Mostly True.\n\nNevada Sen. Harry Reid used this perennial club to beat up on the Republican ticket.\n\n\"Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to gamble with your retirement benefits in the stock market,\" Reid said.\n\nThe problem is, Trump has said he has no plans to change Social Security.\n\nBack in 2000, he did say it should be privatized, but Trump has changed his tune.\n\nPence did support a 2005 plan that would have given workers the option to put a portion of their social security withholdings into the stock market, and he has said he is open to raising the retirement age.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if those two elements add up to gambling with retirement benefits. In any event, Trump is at the top of the ticket, not Pence.\n\nWe rated this claim Mostly False.\n\nIndependent analysts, Kaine said, \"found Trump's tax plan, given to the wealthy and big corporations, would rack up $30 trillion in debt.\"\n\nIt\u2019s true that the top 1 percent would see an estimated 17 percent tax cut, while taxes on the middle class would go down about 5 percent.\n\nWhat\u2019s less clear is whether the national debt would go up by $30 trillion. That figure comes from a reliable group, the Tax Policy Center, but the center based that on a 20-year timeframe, which is twice as long as forecasters normally use.\n\nFor the more typical 10-year period, the estimate is about $11 trillion. Another group\u2019s estimate was about $9 trillion.", "lang": "en"}
