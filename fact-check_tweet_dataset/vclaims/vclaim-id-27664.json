The quotation is actually from Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, co-authors of The Communist Manifesto.\n\nIn recent weeks, some social media users have posted a meme with a quotation that supposedly comes from former President Ronald Reagan.\n\n\u201c\u2018Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered; any attempts to disarm the people must be stopped, by force if necessary\u2019 \u2014 Ronald Reagan,\u201d the meme says.\n\nAlthough the meme, which includes a photo of the former president, was shared thousands of times on Facebook, we found no evidence that Reagan said it. A search of Reagan\u2019s speeches archived by his presidential library turns up no such quotation.\n\n\u201cWe searched all of our archival records and could find no reference to this quote at all,\u201d Melissa Giller, chief marketing officer at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute, told us. The foundation oversees the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, which houses a collection of the former president\u2019s statements, speeches, and papers.\n\nAlthough Reagan didn\u2019t say it, there is evidence that the statement originated from Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, co-authors of The Communist Manifesto.\n\nIn an 1850 speech titled \u201cAddress of the Central Committee to the Communist League,\u201d which was written by Marx and Engels, a slightly different quote appears: \u201cUnder no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered; any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated, by force if necessary.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nGiller, Melissa.
