But most COVID-19 cases do not lead to an x-ray result like the one pictured in the posts, and other medical conditions can cause similar results, experts say.\n\n\u201cMaybe staying home is clearer to understand now,\u201d the caption of a Facebook post shared thousands of times since April 2020 says. Below it, four numbered x-rays show a human chest cavity in different conditions.\n\nThe first photo shows a clear chest, while a white fog covers parts of the thorax in the second and third images, which are said to show influenza and pneumonia-afflicted chests.\n\nIn the fourth image, which claims to show the x-ray of a patient with COVID-19 -- the disease caused by the novel coronavirus -- the chest is almost entirely hidden behind a dense white fog.\n\nAlthough most versions of the posts on Facebook and Twitter credit Erin Meyler, Meyler shared an April 22, 2020 post by Glenn Levine, a nurse in New Jersey, who appears to be the first to have shared the images.\n\nLevine did not answer requests for comment by the time of publication.\n\nExperts told AFP the photos can represent the conditions mentioned in the posts, but that the majority of COVID-19 patients do not experience lung damage as drastic as that shown in the fourth photo.\n\n\u201cMost COVID-19 cases do not look like (photo) #4. However, it is possible #4 is from a patient with severe COVID-19,\u201d John Eng, a professor of radiology at John Hopkins University\u2019s School of Medicine, told AFP by email.\n\nGary Horn, a radiologist at the Baylor College of Medicine, said by phone: \u201cIt seems misleading. Any one of these four chest x-rays could be COVID.\u201d\n\nHorn explained that findings on chest x-rays, like the opacity in the photos, can represent a variety of things, such as accumulations of abnormal fluid, pus, blood, or cells.\n\n\u201cAnything that blocks the x-rays from getting through the body is going to be white,\u201d he said.\n\nArash Bedayat, a radiologist at The University of California, Los Angeles, said by phone that \u201ceven in the most severe cases of COVID, in the first 48 hours, the chest x-ray can be completely negative.\u201d\n\nBedayat, who works daily with COVID-19 cases, pointed out that some patients with the novel coronavirus may not show any opacity on a chest x-ray. Other asymptomatic patients who came in for different treatments had x-ray findings that were later linked to the virus.\n\nIn confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, 58.3 percent of chest x-rays were normal, according to an April 2020 study published in the Journal of Urgent Care Medicine that looked at 636 patients.\n\nBoth Bedayat and Horn said that in chest x-rays from COVID-19 patients that do show signs of the disease, the opacity is often found in the lower zone of the chest, and away from the heart.\n\nThis is consistent with the findings of a March 2020 study from Hong Kong\u2019s Queen Mary Hospital that looked at 255 chest x-rays of COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe study includes examples of chest x-rays from novel coronavirus patients, none of which look like the fourth photo in the online posts.\n\n\u201cIt does matter because it\u2019s wrong,\u201d Bedayat said of the post, calling it \u201ca bad image for a good cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe good aspect I see in that image is that it emphasizes that this disease is serious and we should make sure we do everything not to get it, because it can get very bad,\u201d Bedayat said.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 450 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus crisis.
