Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity in this post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Video of the boat accident at Papi Kondalu. Fact: The video is of some fishermen who went to fishing in the Bay of Bengal, but because of the unfavorable weather and harsh sea conditions, the boat they were traveling sunk. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nBased on the article published by \u2018Firstpost\u2019, it is understood that a tourist boat sunk in the Godavari river on 15 September, 2019 at Devipatnam region in East Godavari district. But the shared video has no relation to this accident.\n\n\n\nWhen multiple screen shots of the video in the post were taken and searched using Google reverse image technique, many search results were obtained which showed that the video is related to a fishermen\u2019s boat that sank in the Bay of Bengal. With this information, when searched on Youtube using keywords, a video aired by \u2018India TV\u2019 was found which had the same video clip. According to this report, in July 2019 when some fishermen of Bengal went fishing, their boat sank because of unfavorable weather and harsh sea conditions.\n\n\n\nSo, the video is not related to the tourist boat that sank in the Godavari river, but is that of fishermen\u2019s boat that sank in the Bay of Bengal.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
