If it does enter the earth's atmosphere, it is expected to burn up before making impact.\n\nAn asteroid will approach Earth on Nov. 2, 2020, the day before Election Day in the U.S. Asteroid 2018 VP1 is expected to come within about 3,000 miles of the Earth and has a slight chance (1 in 240) of entering the planet's atmosphere.\n\nWhen the words \u201casteroid,\u201d \u201cimpact,\u201d and \u201cEarth\u201d make their way into news headlines circulated on social media, it\u2019s easy to see why some internet users may come away with the impression that a catastrophic event will soon befall the planet. This was especially true in 2020, as many internet users felt \u2014 with a global pandemic, forest fires, volcanic eruptions, murder hornets, civil unrest, and heightened political tensions \u2014 that humanity\u2019s luck had simply run out.\n\nIt\u2019s true that an asteroid will approach Earth on the day before the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. However, this is a small asteroid with an even smaller chance of causing any damage to our planet.\n\nAsteroid 2018 VP1 is expected to come within 3,000 miles from Earth on Nov. 2, the day before Election Day in the United States. There\u2019s a small chance (1 in 240, or 0.41 percent) that the asteroid will make an even more direct approach and that it could even find its way into the planet\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nHowever, Asteroid 2018 VP1 is very small. According to NASA, this asteroid is only about 6.5 feet long. If it does head directly toward Earth, this asteroid will burn up in the planet\u2019s atmosphere before making impact.\n\nDonald Yeomans, a senior researcher at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told The New York Times: \u201cClose approaches by small objects of this size are not rare, and even if something of this size were to impact, the object would not likely survive the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\u201d\n\nNASA\u2019s official Twitter account, @asteroidwatch, dedicated to potentially hazardous space objects, posted a message to explain that Asteroid 2018 VP1 does not pose a danger to the planet:\n\nWhile there\u2019s a chance that 2018 VP1 will enter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, in all likelihood it will pass by Earth without incident.\n\nThis year\u2019s flyby will be the asteroid\u2019s first close approach to Earth since it was discovered in 2018 by the Zwicky Transient Facility at Palomar Observatory near San Diego. But while scientists call the event a close approach, the space rock will remain quite far away from Earth: more than 260,000 miles (420,000 kilometers) away. That\u2019s about the same distance at which the much larger moon orbits Earth.\n\nNASA is constantly monitoring the skies for potentially hazardous objects. Asteroids that pose a serious threat to the planet are classified as Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs). Asteroid 2018 VP1 is much smaller (6.5 feet) than the required 500 feet to be classified as a PHA.\n\nHere\u2019s a description of the PHA requirements from NASA (emphasis ours):\n\nPotentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) are currently defined based on parameters that measure the asteroid\u2019s potential to make threatening close approaches to the Earth. Specifically, all asteroids with an Earth Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance (MOID) of 0.05 au or less and an absolute magnitude (H) of 22.0 or less are considered PHAs. In other words, asteroids that can\u2019t get any closer to the Earth (i.e., MOID) than 0.05 au (roughly 7,480,000 km or 4,650,000 mi) or are smaller than about 140 m (~500 ft) in diameter (i.e., H = 22.0 with assumed albedo of 14%) are not considered PHAs.", "lang": "en"}
