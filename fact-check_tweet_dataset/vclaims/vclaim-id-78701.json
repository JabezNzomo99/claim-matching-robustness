So we took a closer look.\n\nWe turned to the most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which, among other things, tracks the median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers by race.\n\nThe bureau\u2019s data for the third quarter of 2015 shows that the median weekly earnings for African-American workers was $624. If you divide that by the standard 40 hours in a workweek, it works out to $15.60 per hour.\n\nThat means that half of African-American workers earned less than $15.60. So Sanders was close on this but exaggerated slightly. His claim is off by a little more than 4 percent.\n\nWhen we asked Sanders\u2019 campaign for their source, they pointed us to a report issued earlier this month from the National Employment Law Project that found that 54.1 percent of African-American workers earned less than $15.00 an hour.\n\nThe group calculated that figure using data from 2012 through 2014. That\u2019s a reasonable measurement, but while our figure covers a briefer period of time, it\u2019s also more current, reflecting the continued economic growth since the end of 2014.\n\nSanders said that \"over half of the black workers in this country earn less\" than $15 an hour.\n\nDepending on the time frame used, the data shows that roughly half of black workers earn less than $15. The most recent data shows that half earn less than $15.60, which is a little higher than what Sanders said, but his number is not far off. We rate his claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
