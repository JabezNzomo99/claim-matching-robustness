Kennedy, with whom she supposedly \"had an affair for seven long years.\"\n\nNo evidence suggests that Pelosi, then 20 years old, had an affair with JFK.\n\nIn May 2020, social media users circulated an old black-and-white photograph picturing U.S. President John F. Kennedy standing with a young woman, with a caption that reads, \u201cNancy Pelosi and JFK, whom she had an affair with for 7 long years. He was 43 years old in 1960, she was 20\u201d:\n\nThe image does show House Speaker Nancy Pelosi standing next to JFK. Pelosi posted the picture to her Facebook account on January 20, 2011, along with a caption reading:\n\n50 years ago today, I was a young Trinity College student standing outside in the sunlit cold, listening to a young President\u2019s inaugural call to \u2018the energy, the faith, the devotion \u2026 that will light our country and all who serve it \u2014 and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.\u2019 The leadership of President John F. Kennedy is not just a memory, but a living force that still asks every citizen to lead \u2014 and perhaps that is the most precious gift of all.\n\nThe 35th President of the United States reportedly had numerous extra-marital affairs with women (allegedly including actress Marilyn Monroe) but nothing suggests that Pelosi was among them.", "lang": "en"}
