Here\u2019s our review of some of his claims.\n\nTrump flips on Reagan tax cuts: \"Under this pro-America system, our economy boomed. It just went beautifully right through the roof. The middle class thrived and median family income increased.\"\n\nTwenty-five years ago, Trump sang an entirely different tune about tax reform signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986.\n\nIn blistering testimony before a Congressional panel in 1991, Trump, then a New York real estate developer, spoke in bombastic terms about how the removal of tax shelters for investors had wrought crippling economic consequences. Dismantling the crucial market incentives that flowed from these provisions had spelled \"absolute catastrophe for the country, for the real estate industry,\" Trump told lawmakers.\n\nIn effort to lobby Washington to relax some of the Reagan-era rules, Trump accused the tax reform of 1986 of helping to plunge the country \u2014 and the real estate industry in particular \u2014 into a depression.\n\n\"I truly feel that this country right now is in a depression. It's not a recession. People are kidding themselves if they think it's a recession,\" he said. \"In the real estate business we're in an absolute depression, and one of the reasons we're there is what happened in 1986.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s Cold War-era testimony even went so far as to paint the 1986 tax reform package as a betrayal of capitalism itself.\n\n\"We are not different right now than the Soviet Union,\" Trump said. \"They have no incentive, and we have no incentive.\"\n\n\"The amount of money (parked overseas) we\u2019re talking about is anywhere from $3 trillion to $5 trillion.\"\n\nIn July, Trump substantially overshot this estimate, saying there was anywhere from 4 (trillion) to 5 or even more trillions of dollars sitting offshore.\" We rated his claim False.\n\nIn Missouri, he expanded the possible range to include a more accurate estimate, but floated the higher figure too.\n\nBased on the work of the Joint Committee on Taxation and private researchers, the highest reported number of offshore earnings is $2.8 trillion. That could be off by a couple hundred billion dollars due to undisclosed untaxed earnings. But experts agreed the discrepancy could not add up to Trump\u2019s $4 trillion or $5 trillion estimate.\n\n\"When it comes to the business tax, we are dead last. Can you believe this?\"\n\nTrump means that the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the world. On paper, he\u2019s correct.\n\nAccording to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, at 35 percent, the United States does have the highest statutory rate among developed countries. (France comes in second at 34.43.)\n\nFactor in state taxes and the rate rises to 39.1 percent. However, the United States\u2019 corporate tax rate doesn\u2019t appear to be the highest once deductions and other exclusions are taken into account. The latest Congressional Budget Office analysis puts the average effective corporate tax rate at 18.6 percent.\n\nThat puts America fourth, behind Argentina, Japan and the United Kingdom.\n\n\"On a yearly basis, as you know, the last administration, during an eight-year period, never hit 3 percent.\"\n\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, during the Obama administration, there were eight quarters when Gross Domestic Product grew by at least 3 percent from the previous quarter. However, in no year did annual growth reach 3 percent, although 2015 came close with 2.9 percent growth.\n\nTrump was correct when he talked about the annual growth rate.\n\n\"The tax code is so complicated that more than 90 percent of Americans need professional help to do their own taxes. \"\n\nAccording to 2014 testimony by Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen, 90 percent of Americans seek \"some form of assistance\" in preparing their taxes.\n\nThat figure includes both the 56 percent of filers who use tax preparers, as well as the 34 percent of taxpayers who use tax preparation software.\n\nReasonable people can disagree on whether the use of programs like TurboTax count as professional help.\n\nTrump doubled down on a few pledges of his campaign, such as lowering the business tax rate to 15 percent and cutting taxes for everyone including the middle class. But he didn\u2019t offer specifics.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump promised to eliminate the carried interest loophole, eliminate the marriage penalty and create targeted child care tax credits. These promises haven\u2019t yet been rated on the Trump-O-Meter.\n\nHe also promised to create a one-time, 10-percent tax on corporate profits coming into the U.S. from other countries, eliminate the estate tax and cut the number of tax brackets. We\u2019ve rated these promises In the Works.\n\nNote: This article has been corrected to show eight quarters of GDP growth of 3 percent or higher during the Obama administration.", "lang": "en"}
