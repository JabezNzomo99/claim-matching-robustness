Vishvas News investigated and found that the tablets are not for the consumption as a medicine but it is actually the tissue paper packed in the form of tablets. The viral claim is false.\n\nThe post shared on Facebook claims: \u201cAlert: This before you eat any tablet as it can take your life. This video has shocked the entire world. Do not forget to forward after seeing the video.\u201d The man in the video states that medicine\u2019s composition is not written on the cover of the medicine. Neither there is the manufacturing date of the medicine nor there is an expiry date. Only the name of the medicine, Zota is mentioned. The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nVishvas News used Invid tool to investigate the video. Using Invid magnifier, we found the name \u2018Zota\u2019 written on the cover of the tablet strip.\n\nWe spoke to Himanshu Zota, Director, Zota Healthcare. He stated: \u201cIn the viral video, it is pure tissue paper. It is not medicine. We had procured that tablet tissue for gifting purpose to doctors. We had already mentioned the instruction on that pack but unfortunately, someone had misused & destroyed our image. These were compressed wipes and not tablets, and they had distributed these to doctors are part of a promotional plan.\n\nTissue tablets are actually quite popular and easy to buy online. These tissues are also given in several restaurants to customers. Simply pouring some water on them does the magic. The tablet unravels into a tissue.\u201c\n\nThe complete fact check of the post can be read here.\n\nThe post is shared on Facebook by a user named Umesh Singh. We scanned the profile of the user and found that the user is based out of Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh.\n\nConclusion: The tablets shown in the video are not for the consumption as a medicine but it is actually the tissue paper packed in the form of tablets. The viral claim is false.", "lang": "en"}
