No NRC, No CAA.\n\nIndia Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The video is three months old and from Sultanpur Lodhi in Punjab.\n\nTill the filing of this story, the video, which was posted on February 4, received more than 17 lakh views and over 1,26,000 shares.\n\nThe misleading post is being shared like wildfire on Facebook.\n\nWe could not find any news report regarding this video on internet, but a closer look shows that the incident is from Punjab.\n\nIn the video, the registration number plate of a motorcycle passing by shows the RTO number (PB08BA 8747) of Punjab's Jalandhar. A vehicle of Punjab Police can also be seen.\n\nOur reporter and local police in Jalandhar told us that this was the procession of Namdhari Sikhs, an India sect of Sikhism, who mostly wear white turbans, kurtas and pyjamas.\n\nOne of the users also commented on the viral video that it is 'Nagar Kirtan', a Sikh custom involving processions by the community.\n\nWith the help of related keywords, we found some YouTube videos from November last year showing a similar procession and a police vehicle as seen in the viral video.\n\nThe details of these YouTube videos show that it is a procession by Namdhari Sikhs on the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev in Sultanpur Lodhi, a holy town in Kapurthala district of Punjab.\n\nTo investigate further, India Today reached out to the DSP of Sultanpur Lodhi, Sarwan Singh Bal.\n\nHe told us that the viral video is of a procession led by Namdhari Sikhs in the town on the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev in November, 2019.\n\nWe also contacted Sultanpur Lodhi MLA Navtej Singh Cheema to further authenticate the video. Cheema confirmed to us that the video is from his constituency and was shot in November last year.\n\nCheema said he had organised the celebration in the city, and the procession seen in the video was going to Gurudwara Ber Sahib, a famous holy spot for Sikhs in Sultanpur Lodhi.\n\nHe also sent us some more videos of the procession.\n\nThe incident was also reported by Punjab Kesari on November 2, 2019.\n\nAFWA, therefore, concludes that the video has no relation to the Shaheen Bagh protests against NRC and CAA.", "lang": "en"}
