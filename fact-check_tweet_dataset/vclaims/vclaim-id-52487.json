A huge crowd has assembled from the mosque after namaz. The police was manhandled when they reached the area. We are showing you these visuals\u2026\u201d said Devgan, 33 minutes into the broadcast.\n\nNews18 had also tweeted the said portion of the broadcast claiming that police was manhandled in Mumbai\u2019s Kurla while dispersing a crowd that emerged from a mosque. The tweet was later taken down.\n\nThe clip is floating on social media with the same claim. One Yana Mir on Twitter claimed that the police was abused because they stopped locals from offering Friday prayers.\n\nAlt News reached out to Mumbai police and was sent a press release dated May 2, 2020. According to the press release, the incident occurred on Wednesday, April 29. This debunks the first part of the claim that \u201cFriday prayers\u201d led to the scuffle.\n\nThe press release says that sub-inspector Kakasaheb Nagwe and his team was patrolling in Kurla Pipe Road when Rizwan Zuber Memon alias Rizwan Tunda began abusing them from the second floor of a building. He asked the cops to not shut down shops in the locality. Rizwan claimed that he works with the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and threatened the policemen of getting them fired from their jobs. A crowd gathered due to the commotion and Rizwan fled the scene. An FIR was filed against him under sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Disaster Management Act and Maharashtra COVID-19 Prevention Measures. Therefore, the second claim that the altercation was between worshippers exiting a mosque and the police is also false. This was also pointed out by Twitter user @adil14384.\n\nAccording to ANI, the police is yet to arrest the accused. PTI also covered the incident. Ironically, its feed, which has no mention of \u2018Friday prayers\u2019 or \u2018mosque\u2019, was republished by News18.The report quotes an official saying, \u201cThe incident took place in Bafati Lane on Pipe Road when a police team led by a sub-inspector asked locals to adhere to the lockdown rules.\u201d\n\nNews18 anchor Amish Devgan falsely claimed during a broadcast that policemen were manhandled in Kurla, Mumbai while attempting to disperse a crowd gathered at a mosque during the lockdown.", "lang": "en"}
