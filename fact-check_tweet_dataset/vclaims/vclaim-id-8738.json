No, that's not true: the story was made up by a Canadian website that specializes in making up stories about bizarre crimes and weird sex acts (purely for entertainment purposes). None of it is real\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on September 27, 2018 titled \"Janitor who worked at sperm bank suspected of fathering 20,000 children over 20 year period\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nToronto police have opened an official investigation after the administrators of a Canadian sperm bank have accused a former employee of replacing hundreds of sperm donors' specimens with his own. Robert Casgrain, 58, who has worked as a janitor at the Toronto-based fertility clinic since 1996, is suspected by administrators of switching hundreds of semen specimens with his own sperm over a 20 year period. Administrators claim in the official police report that they estimate Casgrain could potentially be the father to over 22,000 children over a period stretching two decades. Although Robert Casgrain's motives for replacing the sperm donors' samples with his own are not clear at the moment, legal experts believe these revelations could unleash a potential class-action lawsuit against the former janitor.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so it looked like a real news report to them:\n\nThe man in the picture is not a janitor at a sperm bank an dnis name is not Robert Casgrain but Timothy Poole and he has quite a different claim to fame:\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories.
