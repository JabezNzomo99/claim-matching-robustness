Fast-forward to February 2019, and the unemployment rate for African Americans had jumped back to 7 percent, erasing all the gains it had made over the previous year.\n\nThe two data sets (before and after 1972) are not apples-to-apples, but several experts told us that it\u2019s still useful to compare them. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the same measure but is the best that exists and even then \u2018negro and other races\u2019 is higher than whites,\u201d said Omari H. Swinton, chair of the economics department at Howard University.\n\nSo it seems as if Trump\u2019s claim to a historical record is sketchy at best. He was president when the BLS\u2019s current statistic for tracking black unemployment reached a record low of 5.9 percent in May 2018. But an older set of government data suggests black unemployment went much lower in the 1950s.\n\n\u201cWe should never celebrate the fact that black folks are just working,\u201d said Andre M. Perry, an expert at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying: \u2018Look, you have a job. Why should you complain?\u2019 And I think that\u2019s what Trump is signaling. He\u2019s saying to the black community, \u2018Look what I\u2019ve given you,\u2019 and not necessarily saying, \u2018Let\u2019s look at the percentage of people in poverty, let\u2019s look at the percentage of people rising to the middle class.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt also notes: \u201cAlthough there is further progress to be made in closing the racial and ethnic employment gaps, it is apparent that the economic growth during the current business cycle is having the largest positive effect on the employment of blacks and Hispanics. The average difference of 4.6 percentage points between the prime-age employment rates of blacks and whites in 2018 and of 3.5 percent between Hispanics and whites are each the smallest annual gaps ever recorded since the BLS began publishing prime-age employment-to-population ratios by race in 1994.\u201d (Notice how this passage focuses on prime-age employment, rather than the overall working-age population.)", "lang": "en"}
