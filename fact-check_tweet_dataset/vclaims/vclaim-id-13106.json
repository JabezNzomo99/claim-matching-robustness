These boots do match the pattern of the footprint image. You can see the moon boot\u2019s tread in other pictures too.\n\nBoth astronauts\u2019 moon boots are on the list of many items that were left on the moon. Similar moon boots from the later Apollo 17 mission were brought back to Earth.", "lang": "en"}
