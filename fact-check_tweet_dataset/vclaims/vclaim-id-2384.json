She came home from Paris this morning to the news from Universal Worldwide that she will NOT be returning as the beautiful blue \u201cMystique\u201d in the next chapter of X-Men movies. Lawrence, a notorious crybaby, is said to have broken down when she heard that the decision came from Stan Lee himself, the mastermind behind the Marvel Universe. Lee told TMZ: \u201cThat young lady needs to learn some respect. Even if you don\u2019t agree with Trump, you still have to respect him and treat him like he\u2019s the President. He called and asked me to fire her, so I fired her. Done.\u201d\n\nThe article refers to comments Lawrence made to a British television station in which she said that human activity had caused global warming, and that hurricanes felt like \u201cnature\u2019s wrath.\u201d She also, without referring to Donald Trump by name, said \u201cthe only voice we have is through voting.\u201d Several outlets drummed up a nontroversy by claiming she had linked the hurricanes to Trump.\n\nStan Lee did not fire Jennifer Lawrence.
