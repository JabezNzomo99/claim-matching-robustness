In response, Yadav challenged Malviya saying he would withdraw from public life if Malviya was able to produce any evidence to back his claim.\n\nYadav had responded to Malviya saying that his grandfather was murdered in the presence of his father by a Muslim mob. Yet, instead of holding bitterness and grudge, inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, he chose to give Muslim names to his children, adding that he doubted if a person like Malviya had the sensitivity to understand this.\n\nA day later, Amit Malviya hit back at Yogendra Yadav, posting a video in which Yadav is seen and heard speaking to a crowd in Muslim dominated Mewat about his Muslim identity. \u201cI usually don\u2019t carry TV debates to social media but making an exception to expose Yogendra Yadav\u2019s Janus face\u201d he tweeted attaching a short video clip. The clip ended with the question, \u201cWhen are you withdrawing from public life?\u201d\n\nIn the clip, Yadav is heard saying \u201cmaaf kijiyega sirf ek minute lunga. Aap mein se kai logo ko pata hai, mere dadaji hindu-muslim fasad mein mare gaye they 1936 ki baat hai, Hisar mein unka katal kar diya tha ek muslim bheed thi jisne maar diya tha. Ab sochiye mere pitaji, woh 7 saal ka baccha jisne apne baap ko apni aakhon se samne katal hote hue dekha. Woh chahta to zindagi bhar musalmano se nafrat kar sakta tha, lekin usne tay kiya ki main apne bachho ko muslim naam dunga. Usse mera naam salim pada tha, jo kissa bataya jata hai.\u201d\n\nTranslation: Pardon me, I shall take a minute. Many among you know that my grandfather was killed in Hindu-Muslim conflict in 1936. He was killed in Hisar by a Muslim mob. Now think, my father, that seven year old child who saw his father murdered before his eyes. If he wanted he could have hated Muslims all his life, but he decided that he will give Muslim names to his children. That is how I was named Salim.\n\nThe same video clip was tweeted by one Chowkidar Ankur Singh, who juxtaposed it with Yadav\u2019s video of the India Today debate in order to mock him.\n\nBased on this clip, Malviya made the allegation that Yadav was playing identity politics by referring to his Muslim name in front of a Muslim audience. \u201cWhen are you withdrawing from public life?\u201d was a jibe aimed at Yadav\u2019s assertion in the TV debate that he would withdraw from public life altogether if Malviya could substantiate the claim that Yogendra Yadav was playing caste politics. Is there any truth to Malviya\u2019s claim?\n\nThe short video shared by Malviya is edited. Here is what Yadav had said.\n\nTranslation: \u201cIf he wanted, he could have hated Muslims all his life. If he wanted he could be RSS. It would have been a very ordinary thing. But that person decided that neither Hindu nor Muslim, they will become human. And so he decided that he will give Muslim names to his children. That is how I was named Salim.\u201d\n\nThe video was posted live on Facebook on the page of Swaraj India party, on July 29, 2018. The relevant portion begins from 8:33 minutes. The video is captioned \u2018\u092e\u0947\u0935\u093e\u0924 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0930\u0915\u092c\u0930 \u0916\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u093f \u0939\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0926 \u0935\u0939\u093e\u0901 \u0915\u0947 \u092a\u0902\u091a\u093e\u092f\u0924 \u0915\u094b \u0938\u0902\u092c\u094b\u0927\u093f\u0924 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0947 \u092f\u094b\u0917\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u092f\u093e\u0926\u0935\u2019 (Yogendra Yadav addressing the panchayat in Mewat after murder of Rakbar Khan- translation).\n\nHe then went on to explain the context saying he is telling this story because \u201cnafrat ja jawab nafrat se dena bahut aasaan kaam hai, chota kaam hai, nafrat ka jawab Mohabbat se dena bahut bara kaam hai aur main yeh chahta hun ki yeh ilaaka jisne bahut barey kaam kiye hain, nafrat ka jawab mohabbat se de\u201d (It is easy to respond to hate with hate, it is a small thing, it is a big thing to answer hate with love and I wish that this place, which has accomplished a lot, respond to hate with love- translation).\n\nThe part where Yadav had said \u201cNa Hindu banega na Musalman banega, insaan ki aulaad hai insaan banega\u201d was conveniently left out of the video clip which was posted by Malviya, thus suggesting that Yadav was pandering to Muslims by appealing to their identity. On the contrary, he was sharing his own experience about his family which had witnessed the brutality of Hindu-Muslim conflict, yet chose to make peace with themselves and the world around them.\n\nYadav took to Twitter to refute Malviya\u2019s allegations and shared the unedited clip.\n\nIt is clear that the edited clip tweeted by Malviya has removed the context of the statement as well as bits from the speech itself to make it appear that Yadav was informing the crowd about his Muslim name for votes.\n\nIt is important to note that this gathering at Mewat was not an election rally but a protest meet after the lynching of a Muslim man by a Hindu mob. It is in this context that Yadav told the crowd about his story and talked about responding to hate with love. The appeal to the crowd not to respond to hate with hate has been edited out in the version shared by Malviya.\n\nAmit Malviya started his tweet by saying that he doesn\u2019t like to carry TV debates on to social media but in reality he not only carried the TV debate to social media, but he carried an edited version of it. Ironically he was trying to \u2018expose\u2019 Yogendra Yadav for using his Muslim identity for votes with the help of a clip that was not only edited but was also not of an election rally.", "lang": "en"}
