Multiple users on Facebook also circulated the video.\n\nAlt News performed a keyword search and found a July 13 report by The Quint which stated that three juveniles stabbed a 25-year-old man to death in Raghubir Nagar, West Delhi. This incident happened on July 8. According to the report, the three killed the victim because he had scolded them for performing bike stunts. Raghubir Nagar is around three kilometres away from Madipur, per Google Maps.\n\nDeputy Commissioner of Delhi Police (West) Deepak Purohit told Alt News that social media claims suggesting the perpetrators hail from the Muslim community are false. \u201cAll of them are minors and from the majority community,\u201d he said.\n\nDCP Purohit has also been quoted in a report by The Times of India stating that a case for murder was registered at the Khyala Police Station. The victim sustained 28 stab wounds, including severe injuries on his chest, torso and other minor wounds on his arms and legs. As per the article, \u201cThe deceased has been identified as Manish, a resident of Raghubir Nagar. He worked as a private car driver.\u201d An officer at Khyala Police Station confirmed to Alt News that none of the perpetrators is a Muslim.\n\nA report in Live Hindustan stated that the accused juveniles attempted to flee to Nepal however they were caught and sent to a juvenile correction facility.\n\nTherefore the social media claim that members of the Muslim community were behind killing the man is false.", "lang": "en"}
