Dubai authorities have said no such incident took place in the emirate and a reverse search found the video showed an incident in Morocco.\n\nThe video has been posted on YouTube and Facebook, including here on a Philippine account where it has been viewed more than a million times and shared more than 32,000 times since it was published June 7, 2018.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption, when translated to English, says: \u201cBe careful when charging and using your cell phone because a man in Dubai had to fight off fire when his cellphone, which he was charging in his pocket using a powerbank, overheated and caught on fire, those who saw him helped douse the flames\u201d.\n\nThe post says in Arabic: \u201cThe Directorate General for Civil Protection stated that the video circulating of the explosion of a mobile phone was filmed outside the country, and denies that an explosion happened in a Dubai mall or any other shopping centre in Dubai or in the Emirates\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe tweet says: \"The General Command of the Dubai police denies that the video, which shows a burning person, happened in a Dubai mall and asks that members of the public not spread rumours if they wish to avoid being prosecuted\u201d.\n\nIt says that the man who set himself on fire was around 30 years old and lived in a small town near Agadir, a tourist city in the south of Morocco.", "lang": "en"}
