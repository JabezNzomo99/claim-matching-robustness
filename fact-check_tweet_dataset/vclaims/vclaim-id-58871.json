The claim is misleading; experts say COVID-19 swab tests are not placed near the blood-brain barrier and do not pose a risk to human health.\n\n\n\nThe illustration was published in this Facebook post on July 7, 2020. It has been shared hundreds of times.\n\nA screenshot taken on July 10, 2020, of the misleading post\n\nThe text overlaid above the illustrations reads: \"I was wondering why the PCR test for COVID-19 had to be so far back and it got me thinking\u2026how far does it go? So I did some research and found these two pictures and overlapped them. The suprising evidence was shocking! The blood brain barrier is exactly where the swab test has to be placed.\" \n\n\n\nAlso Read: No, Influenza Vaccines Do Not Contain Coronaviruses\n\nThe Facebook post's caption includes a similar message: \"Do NOT CONSENT TO NOSE SWAB TESTING!\n\n\"Avoid the Covid-19 test at all costs. These swabs may be (and probably are) contaminated with something dangerous, like viruses or something we don't understand. People should be just as concerned with the swab as they are about the vaccine.\"\n\nThe PCR test -- formally known as the reverse transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction test -- is a type of COVID-19 testing technique that directly detects the virus in a person's nasal secretions or saliva, Australia's Department of Health explains here and here. The test requires a deep and vigorous swap in the mouth and nose that can be quite uncomfortable.\n\nThe images were shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook here, here, here and here; and on Instagram here, here and here. The claim also circulated on Facebook pages in other languages, including Danish, Dutch, French and Portuguese.\n\nThe claim is misleading, according to experts.\n\n\"The swab is not placed on the blood brain barrier and does not compromise the blood brain barrier and thus does not pose any threat to our nervous system,\" Professor John Dwyer, an immunologist and Emeritus Professor at University of New South Wales, told AFP in a July 10 email.\n\nDwyer added that while the PCR test can be \"momentarily unpleasant,\" there is \"no way that a simple swab could damage the blood brain barrier.\"\n\nThe Queensland Brain Institute explains here that the blood\u2013brain barrier \"provides a defence against disease-causing pathogens and toxins that may be present in our blood.\"\n\nProfessor John Mathews, an epidemiologist at the University of Melbourne, also stated that the PCR swab \"does not compromise the blood brain barrier in any way.\"\n\nAlso Read: No, Vaccine Trials Did Not Cripple Children In Africa\n\n\"Routine nasopharyngeal swabs to test for other viruses or for other laboratory results have been collected safely for many years,\" he said in an email to AFP on July 10.\n\nHoaxes about possible contamination of COVID-19 tests, and those that raise doubts about their accuracy, were previously debunked by AFP here and here.", "lang": "en"}
