That study showed that federal criminal prosecutions of all types reached a peak in 2011 and had fallen to the lowest level in two decades. As the president said, drug charges fell by 23 percent, with 24,638 defendants in fiscal 2016, compared with 32,062 in fiscal year 2011.\n\nBut these numbers are for all drug prosecutions \u2014 and the data does not break out opioid-related prosecutions. Instead, the data shows only two categories: marijuana and then all other drugs. Because marijuana was legalized in some states during President Barack Obama\u2019s term, marijuana prosecutions fell 39 percent from 2011 to 2016. Without marijuana in the totals, the decline for drug prosecutions between 2011 and 2016 is 18 percent.\n\n\u201cIn 2013, for example, after two states legalized the recreational use of marijuana, the department announced new charging priorities for offenses involving the drug, which remains illegal under federal law,\u201d the Pew report noted. That same year, Pew noted, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. announced a policy change that prosecutors make sure each case \u201cserves a substantial federal interest,\u201d a reason overall federal prosecutions may have fallen. Under the \u201cSmart on Crime Initiative,\u201d prosecutors were told to focus finite resources on more serious drug cases and leave low-level offenders to state prosecutors. (Many drug cases are handled in state courts, and there is even less data on that.)\n\nTrump\u2019s statistic thus does not really tell you much about Obama\u2019s handling of opioids. Our colleagues at FactCheck.org cited data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission \u2014 which shows how many people were actually sentenced for drug crimes \u2014 that indicates Trump is falsely attacking the former president.\n\nAgain, there are not good breakdowns for opioids. But there is data for heroin, which shows the number of people who were sentenced for federal heroin offenses rose by 56 percent from fiscal 2011 to 2016. Separately, the number of people convicted of trafficking in oxycodone rose sharply from 2008 to 2014, before falling in 2015 and 2016. But there isn\u2019t data on other crimes involving oxycodone, hydrocodone or fentanyl.\n\nObama\u2019s handling of the crisis is certainly open to criticism. If Trump wanted to be specific, he could have cited a Washington Post investigation that showed the Drug Enforcement Administration, under pressure from drug companies, softened enforcement of wholesale companies that distributed pills to the corrupt pharmacies that illegally sold the drugs for street use.\n\nThe jury is still out on whether Trump can improve on Obama\u2019s numbers. In a report released July 27, the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University said that drug prosecutions have continued to decline during the first five months of the Trump administration, so that \u201cfewer drug offenders were federally prosecuted over the past 12 months than at any time during the last quarter century.\u201d\n\nThis is a good example of data being used incorrectly. Federal prosecutions have gone down since 2011, but that does not indicate that the Obama administration ignored the opioid epidemic. The number cited by Trump was the result of a decline in marijuana prosecutions and a change in policy to focus on bigger, more important cases. Moreover, there is not enough detail in the data to show whether opioid prosecutions declined, as Trump suggested.", "lang": "en"}
