Last year I wrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning.\u201d\n\nAccording to Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine, sometime between 8 April 2020 and 15 April 2020, Mr Cummings\u2019 2019 blog on pandemics was updated to include a paragraph on SARS (which, along with Covid-19, is also caused by a coronavirus). The added paragraph says:\n\n\u201cAmong other things, the GAO report called attention to a well-publicized incident in which a Defense Department laboratory \u201cinadvertently sent live Bacillus anthracis , the bacterium that causes anthrax, to almost 200 laboratories worldwide over the course of 12 years. The laboratory believed that the samples had been inactivated.\u201d The report describes yet another well-publicized incident in China in which \u201ctwo researchers conducting virus research were exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus samples that were incompletely inactivated. The researchers subsequently transmitted SARS to others, leading to several infections and one death in 2004.\n\nThe GAO identified three recent releases of Ebola and Marburg viruses from BSL4 to lower containment labs due to incomplete inactivation.\u201d\n\nThis is also confirmed by the website\u2019s sitemap information. This shows that this particular blog post appears to have been edited on 14 April 2020.\n\nPrior to this, his blog made no mention of coronaviruses. According to BBC economics editor Faisal Islam, an unnamed Number 10 source confirmed the post had been edited, but that the original post did include a link to an article which discussed coronaviruses and from which the added quote was taken. The older version of the blog post also contained quotes from this article.\n\nWayback Machine is a digital archival service that captures numerous web pages across the internet.
