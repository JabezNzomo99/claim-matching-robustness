Ben Sasse, would amend the federal criminal code, instituting penalties and jail time for health care practitioners who don\u2019t provide certain medical care \u201c[i]n the case of an abortion or attempted abortion that results in a child born alive.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the bill would require that a \u201chealth care practitioner present at the time the child is born alive\u201d to \u201cexercise the same degree of professional skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child as a reasonably diligent and conscientious health care practitioner would render to any other child born alive at the same gestational age.\u201d It also would require that the child be \u201cimmediately transported and admitted to a hospital\u201d following that professional \u201cskill, care, and diligence.\u201d Violators could be fined and/or jailed for up to five years.\n\nThere\u2019s also a reporting requirement for anyone with knowledge of such violations. Another provision bars mothers from being prosecuted under the bill and allows mothers to bring a civil action against health care practitioners who violate the legislation.\n\nThe bill specifies that an \u201cintentional killing\u201d through an \u201covert act\u201d would be punishable under already existing federal law on murder.\n\nHow does that compare to the 2002 born-alive law?\n\nDemocratic Sen. Tim Kaine argued that the bill was unnecessary, as a 2002 born-alive bill had \u201creaffirmed\u201d that \u201cinfanticide is already illegal in every state.\u201d Kaine said in a statement: \u201cI support that law, which is still in effect. There is no need for additional federal legislation on this topic. \u201c\n\nIn 2002, the \u201cBorn-Alive Infants Protection Act\u201d easily passed Congress \u2014 through a voice vote in the House and unanimous consent in the Senate. It became law on Aug. 5, 2002. It defined a \u201cperson\u201d (or \u201chuman being,\u201d \u201cchild\u201d and \u201cindividual\u201d) for the purposes of any act of Congress or any agency ruling/regulation as \u201cevery infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development.\u201c\n\nThe act went on to define \u201cborn alive\u201d as: \u201cthe complete expulsion or extraction from his or her mother of that member, at any stage of development, who after such expulsion or extraction breathes or has a beating heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut, and regardless of whether the expulsion or extraction occurs as a result of natural or induced labor, cesarean section, or induced abortion.\u201d\n\nAre either of these laws necessary to prosecute the intentional killing of a baby as a homicide?\n\nNo. Killing a baby is a homicide. \u201cStates can and do punish people for killing children who are born alive,\u201d Mary Ziegler, a professor at Florida State University\u2019s College of Law and the author of two books on the abortion debate, told us in a phone interview. \u201cMost criminal laws are at the state level not the federal level.\u201d\n\nZiegler said Sasse\u2019s bill would add uniform federal criminal penalties for health care practitioners, so it does include new measures. \u201cIt\u2019s more just of questionable importance given that state law prosecutions are already happening.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, for instance, Kermit Gosnell was found guilty of three counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of three babies born alive in his Philadelphia abortion clinic and one count of involuntary manslaughter for the death of a woman whom he treated.\n\nWhat is the aim of the legislation?\n\nA spokesman for Sasse told us the bill is aimed at \u201cpassive\u201d situations in which there\u2019s a \u201cbacking away\u201d from providing medical interventions for a baby born alive. He cited the testimony of an OB-GYN doctor in the Gosnell case who said that if a baby were born alive as a result of an abortion procedure, the baby would \u201ceventually pass.\u201d According to reporting at the time by the Philadelphia Inquirer, she said that in such a rare instance, \u201ccomfort care\u201d would be provided until the child died.\n\nThe 2002 law, Sasse\u2019s office says, didn\u2019t mandate medical care. The senator\u2019s website says the recent bill would require that if \u201ca botched abortion results in the live birth of an infant, health care practitioners must exercise the same degree of professional skill and care to protect the newborn as would be offered to any other child born alive at the same gestational age.\u201d\n\nWhat statistics are available on cases of failed abortions in which a baby is born alive? How often does this happen?\n\nThere is some limited data on babies born alive as the result of an abortion procedure, but it\u2019s unclear what the medical circumstances were in each of these cases. There is more extensive data on when abortions are performed. We\u2019ll go through the available numbers.\n\nFirst, in terms of a baby\u2019s viability \u2014 the ability to survive outside the womb \u2014 one 2015 study in the New England Journal of Medicine on preterm births said: \u201cActive [lifesaving] intervention for infants born before 22 weeks of gestation is generally not recommended, whereas the approach for infants born at or after 22 weeks of gestation varies.\u201d The study noted the \u201cextremely difficult\u201d decision on whether to use treatment for infants \u201cborn near the limit of viability,\u201d saying that while in some cases treatment is clearly indicated or not, \u201cin many cases, it is unclear whether treatment is in the infant\u2019s best interest.\u201d\n\nThe study looked at the cases of 4,987 infants \u201cwithout congenital anomalies,\u201d or birth defects, born before 27 weeks gestation. It found that 5.1 percent of babies born at 22 weeks gestational age survived and 3.4 percent survived \u201cwithout severe impairment.\u201d Several weeks further into gestation, at 26 weeks, 81.4 percent of babies survived, 75.6 percent without severe impairment.\n\nAbortions in such later stages of pregnancies (which typically are 38 to 42 weeks full term) could be performed because of congenital anomalies, but that study provides some sense of when a fetus without birth defects could be viable and when decisions on medical interventions could be made.\n\nLate-term abortions are rare. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 1.3 percent of abortions in the U.S. were performed after 21 weeks gestational time, according to 2015 data. The CDC\u2019s report showed that 65 percent of abortions that year occurred in the first eight weeks of pregnancy.\n\nForty-three states have banned \u201csome abortions after a certain point in pregnancy,\u201d according to the Guttmacher Institute, which researches reproductive health issues.\n\nWhat about abortions that result in a live birth? One CDC report on death certificates for infants for 2003 to 2014, showed \u201c143 deaths involving induced terminations\u201d of pregnancies during that 12-year period, 97 of which \u201cinvolved a maternal complication or, one or more congenital anomalies.\u201d The data \u201conly include deaths occurring to those infants born alive; fetal deaths (stillbirths) are not included.\u201d\n\nThe CDC notes that the 143 number could be an underestimate of induced terminations of pregnancies. In looking at the data, the CDC found some cases where it was unclear whether a pregnancy termination was induced or spontaneous. In such cases, if congenital anomalies and maternal complications also were involved, the CDC assumed those were spontaneous terminations, due to the \u201cstrong association between severe congenital anomalies or maternal complications and premature labor and birth.\u201d In other words, the CDC assumed such cases were premature labor as opposed to a decision to induce labor or end the pregnancy.\n\nSix states require some reporting on abortions that result in a baby born alive: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Texas.\n\nIn Minnesota, there were 10,177 abortions in the state in 2017 and three resulted in an infant born alive. None survived, according to the report from the state Department of Health. One infant was given \u201ccomfort care\u201d; another was given no specific care; and the third had a low APGAR score, a measure of a newborn\u2019s well-being.\n\nArizona enacted a law in August 2017 requiring physicians to report born-alive cases and to \u201cdocument that all available means and medical skills were used to promote, preserve, and maintain the life of such fetus and embryo.\u201d A state Department of Health Services report says: \u201cFrom August 2017 to December 2017, 10 abortion reports involving fetus or embryo delivered alive were submitted to ADHS along with the physician\u2019s statement documenting the measures taken to preserve the life of the fetus or embryo.\u201d There were a total of 12,533 abortions performed for the full year.\n\nAnd in Florida in 2018 there were six reported born-alive cases out of 70,083 abortions, according to state reports. As for late-term abortions, two occurred in the third trimester, one due to life endangerment and the other due to serious fetal defect.\n\nIn Oklahoma, there were no reports of infants born alive due to an abortion from 2012 through 2014 and again in 2016. For 2015 and 2017, the state reports don\u2019t contain figures for that reporting requirement. Also, Texas reported zero live births as a result of an abortion for the three years for which that information is available, 2013 to 2015.\n\nWhat is an \u201cabortion\u201d under the bill? Would the recent legislation pertain to cases of preterm births? What about induced labor for reasons of fetal abnormalities?\n\nThis is one of the matters of dispute. Sasse\u2019s office says the bill is aimed at \u201cbotched abortions,\u201d but a doctor speaking on behalf of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which opposed the bill, told us it would pertain to difficult situations in which parents make the decision with clinicians to induce labor for medical reasons such as fetal abnormalities.\n\nThe New York Times published an opinion piece on Feb. 26 by Dr. Jen Gunter, an obstetrician and gynecologist, who told her personal story of making the decision to forgo medical intervention when her 1-pound son was born prematurely at 22 weeks. \u201cAs Aidan\u2019s parents we had decided that invasive procedures, like intravenous lines and a breathing tube in a one-pound body, would be pointless medical care. And so, as we planned, Aidan died,\u201d Gunter wrote. \u201cAnd that is the reality for so many parents. Some have known for weeks or even months that there will be no life after birth. With that knowledge some choose an abortion and others the blanket and embrace. Both are brave decisions.\u201d\n\nSasse\u2019s spokeman told us S. 311 wouldn\u2019t apply to a \u201cheartbreaking\u201d situation like Gunter\u2019s because that was a premature birth. The bill specifically says it pertains to cases involving \u201cabortion.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the definition of \u201cabortion\u201d in the bill:\n\nSasse\u2019s spokesman said inducing labor pre-viability wouldn\u2019t fit that definition. But if induction occurred to \u201ckill the unborn child\u201d and it resulted in a live birth, \u201cthe legislation would mandate that the baby receives the same medical care that any child with similar gestational age and circumstances would receive if they were born any other way.\u201d\n\nDr. Colleen McNicholas, an obstetrician and gynecologist speaking on behalf of ACOG, told us that \u201cabsolutely\u201d the definition of abortion in the bill would fit circumstances where labor is induced because of fetal abnormalities.\n\nThe \u201cvast majority\u201d of late-term abortions, McNicholas said, would be performed with dilation and evacuation, which \u201cis not survivable,\u201d or in conjunction with medication that stops the baby\u2019s heart. The \u201conly conceivable situation\u201d she could imagine the bill being relevant would be \u201ccatastrophic pregnancies\u201d in which the parents and care team \u201cintend to deliver the baby,\u201d but know that there\u2019s a chance the baby won\u2019t survive. In such cases, there may be a plan in place, a \u201cchoice by the care team and the patient to not explore extraordinary measures\u201d for a fetus with conditions that aren\u2019t survivable, she said. The care team would provide \u201ccomfort and compassion\u201d in such a circumstance.\n\n\u201cEven those heartbreaking stories are abortion stories,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom a medicine standpoint, it\u2019s an abortion regardless of the indication.\u201d\n\nBut the bill does say health care practitioners should use the same care as they would for other infants at the same gestational age. Wouldn\u2019t that mean comfort care could be the appropriate medical course of action?\n\nTheoretically, yes, McNicholas said. But, she added, the bill \u201cputs physicians in a terrible situation\u201d where they know the appropriate medical care but wonder what the legislative interpretation of the circumstance would be, under the threat of criminal penalties. \u201cIt makes clinicians and physicians incredible uncomfortable to know that they \u2026 ultimately aren\u2019t the ones who will decide whether that clinical situation should have or could have fit.\u201d\n\nWhy did most Senate Democrats vote against it? Why did Republicans introduce it?\n\nS. 311 was defeated on Feb. 25 in the Senate by a 53-44 vote, short of the votes necessary to overcome a filibuster, with just three Democrats in favor of it.\n\nSen. Patty Murray called the bill \u201cgovernment interference in women\u2019s health care, in families\u2019 lives, and in medicine on steroids.\u201d Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said: \u201cThis is an effort to intimidate doctors with the threat of criminal liability for performing safe and legal abortion, which will have a chilling effect on the ability of women to access the services they need in the United States.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, ACOG and 16 other medical groups said in a letter to the Senate that the bill amounted to \u201canother restriction on women\u2019s access to reproductive health care.\u201d\n\nBut Republicans maintained it was \u201ca straightforward piece of legislation to protect newborn babies,\u201d as Sen. Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor. And Sasse\u2019s spokesman said the issue wasn\u2019t controversial in 2002, when that \u2014 albeit more limited \u2014 bill was easily passed.\n\nZiegler, at Florida State University\u2019s College of Law, told us that to some extent this was about politics. \u201cI think they knew that this wasn\u2019t going to pass,\u201d she said of the Republicans. But politically it was advantageous, and it came in response to Democratic states passing laws to expand abortion rights, such as a recent law in New York.\n\n\u201cFraming the conversation around born-live abortions and late-term abortions is something that will make more people view the abortion issue in a way that\u2019s favorable to Republicans,\u201d she said.", "lang": "en"}
