Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of the claim.\n\nClaim: Nita Ambani has donated Gold and Silver ornaments for the construction of Ram Temple at Ayodhya. Fact: The news that Nita Ambani has donated Gold and Silver ornaments for the construction of Ram Temple at Ayodhya is fake. The \u2018Trust\u2019 which has to foresee the construction of the temple is yet to be set up completely. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched on Google if Nita Ambani has made any donations to the Ram Mandir that is to be constructed at Ayodhya, no information confirming it was found. Earlier, when a few posts went viral claiming about donations to Ram Mandir, \u2018FACTLY\u2019 had debunked them and those articles can be seen here and here. \n\n\n\nIn the Ayodhya\u2019s mandir-masjid case verdict, the Supreme Court has directed the central government to set up a trust that would foresee the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya. Recently, PM Modi has announced in the Parliament about the setting up of a 15-member trust \u2013 \u2018Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra\u2019 for the construction of Ram temple. But, in \u2018The Hindu\u2019 article, it can be read that the trust is yet to be set up completely as few members are yet to be selected. The trust has also not solicited any funds.\n\nTo conclude, Nita Ambani hasn\u2019t donated Gold and Silver ornaments for the construction of Ram Temple at Ayodhya. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
