The claim is false; several health experts warn consuming baking soda could be harmful to human health; the hoax has circulated online in Thailand since at least 2018.\n\nThe post was published here on Facebook on September 20, 2019.\n\nThe text superimposed in the image in the post reads: \u201cExercise with more stamina! Baking soda, Amount usage 0.4:1\u201d\n\nPart of the Thai-language caption translates to English as: \u201cBaking soda will help us exercise longer and increase endurance!\n\n\u201cThe feeling of tiredness from exercise is partly due to the fact that your body changes to a more acidic state. This brings to the idea of \u200b\u200bmaintaining the pH balance level in your body. Because if you change your body to become less acidic, you will feel less tired and able to exercise more.\u201d\n\nA similar claim was also shared on Facebook here in 2015 and here in 2018 and recirculated online in 2020 here and here.\n\nThailand\u2019s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published this infographic on Facebook on April 28, 2020, saying the claim is \u201cincorrect\u201d.\n\nThe image reads: \u201cIs it true? Eating baking soda before exercising will help you exercise longer? Incorrect.\n\n\u201cThe reason why you can\u2019t exercise for so long is because of muscle pain which is caused by lactic acid that happens in the muscle areas. However, the baking soda that you take can\u2019t be absorbed into the muscles.\u201d\n\nIt discourages people from consuming baking soda, listing possible side effects: \u201cSide effects that might happen when eating baking soda: stomach, bloating, nauseation.\u201d\n\nDr. Tirayut Vilaivan, a professor of chemistry at Thailand\u2019s Chulalongkorn University also told AFP via phone on July 9, 2020: \u201cEating baking soda can\u2019t make you exercise longer. On the contrary, it can mess up your digestive system. Also, baking soda or sodium bicarbonate has a sodium element which can be harmful to your kidneys.\n\n\"When we exercise, our body produces lactic acid to burn calories and people have misunderstood that using baking soda, which is a base, can balance that.\"\n\nThe false claim was also debunked by Thailand\u2019s Anti-Fake News Centre, a government-run platform within the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society, here on July 7, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
