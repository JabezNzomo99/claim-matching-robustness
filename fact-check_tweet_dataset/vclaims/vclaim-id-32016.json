A search of the \u201cPapers of Thomas Jefferson\u201d returned no matches, and it doesn\u2019t appear in a collection of his quotes and letters.\n\nFurthermore, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which maintains his estate at Monticello, categorizes it as a \u201cspurious quotation.\u201d Monticello cites Reagan\u2019s speech for National Library Week in 1981 as the likely source for the misattributed saying.
