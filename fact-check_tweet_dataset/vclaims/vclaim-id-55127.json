The claim originated on a satirical news website.\n\nThe post claims Dr. Joe Barron of the Dunning-Kruger Institute conducted a study that found \u201cpeople who subscribe to the notion that masks will protect them have a lower IQ.\u201d The three-month study supposedly consisted of two parts: a test to measure the IQs of participants and a test to measure their basic scientific knowledge, according to the post.\n\n\u201cAfter an intense three-month study, we have found conclusive evidence that people that wear masks have a lower IQ,\u201d the excerpt of the alleged study says. \u201cThis was clearly demonstrated in all of our studies.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no record of such a study with those findings. The Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any media reports about a study finding \u201cconclusive evidence that people that wear masks have a lower IQ.\u201d Searching resources like Google Scholar and PubMed, a repository of biomedical literature from the National Institutes of Health, turned up no matching scientific papers.\n\nThe Dunning-Kruger Institute also doesn\u2019t appear to exist, further adding to the post\u2019s dubiousness.

Yet, while the article, filed under \u201cSilly Tater Satire,\u201d clearly disclaims the satirical nature of the content, the Facebook post does not, portraying it as real news.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Caller has debunked a number of false claims related to face masks, including those about masks causing dangerous levels of carbon dioxide in the blood and masks containing 5G antennas. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people wear face coverings in public settings, especially where social distancing cannot be maintained, to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus.", "lang": "en"}
