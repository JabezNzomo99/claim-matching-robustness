The claim is false; the video is actually made up of different clips of South Korean and US military planes and weapons; some of the footage has circulated online since before Pakistan acquired JF-17s.\n\nThe four-minute 15-second video was published in this Facebook post on September 8, 2019. It has been viewed more than 1.9 million times.\n\nThe misleading post's Urdu-language caption translates to English as: \u201cPraise to Allah. Look at the aim of Pakistan\u2019s JF-17 Thunder B jet and please share the video.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe video was also shared here, here and here on Facebook and on YouTube here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video does not show Pakistani military jets.\n\nA reverse image search of keyframes from the video obtained using the InVID analysis tool found different clips had been compiled to create the video in the misleading posts.\n\nThe first portion of the misleading Facebook video, which lasts for one minute 45 seconds, has been taken from this YouTube video published on February 11, 2019.\n\nThe video's caption states: \"This compilation footage shows jets from the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) firing multiple types of precision-guided munitions.\"\n\nThe YouTube channel that posted the footage describes itself as \"an unofficial channel dedicated to collecting and uploading South Korean Military-related contents for the sake of international audience.\"\n\nThe footage used in the misleading post corresponds exactly with the footage in the Korean YouTube video -- including Korean subtitles -- from the 46 second mark to the one-minute 42-second mark.\n\nThe Korean YouTube channel identifies this section of the footage as dating from 2015 and says the jet and bomb seen in this section of the footage are \"F-15K Slam Eagles - GBU-28 Bunker Buster\".\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the misleading Facebook video (L) and the Korean YouTube video F-15 (R):\n\nSeoul's defence ministry declined comment on the YouTube footage, saying it had not been edited and released by them.\n\nIn both the misleading footage and the Korean video, a red five point star on a white background is clearly visible on one of the target buildings.\n\nBelow is a comparison of the star in the misleading footage (L) and the Korean video (R) as highlighted by AFP:\n\nThe North Korean flag contains a five point red star against a red background.\n\nBelow is an AFP image showing the North Korean flag:\n\nThe next section of footage in the misleading video, from the one-minute 45-second mark to the one-minute 56-second mark, actually shows a Boeing Small Diameter Bomb (SDB).\n\nThe exact same footage that is used in the misleading post has circulated online since at least 2006 -- for example here and embedded below:\n\nThe first operational JF-17 Thunder jet, which was developed by Pakistan and China, was not delivered to Pakistan until 2007, according to the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the misleading Facebook video (L) and the earlier footage on YouTube (R) :\n\nThe third clip, which appears from the two-minute 12-second mark to the three-minute 30-second mark in the video in the misleading posts, shows an American air force B-2 bomber dropping a non-nuclear bunker buster bomb.\n\nThe same footage was published in this YouTube video on May 17, 2019.\n\nIt was also published in this article by US based automotive and technology site thedrive.com on May 17, 2019, which said the footage had been released by the United States Airforce.\n\nThe article\u2019s headline states: \u201cNew Video Of B-2 Bomber Dropping Mother Of All Bunker Busters Sends Ominous Message.\u201d\n\nThe article states in part: \u201cThe B-2 Spirit is still America's silver bullet over 20 years after it entered operational service and 30 years since it began its flight test program.\n\n\u201cIn the past, we have seen some lower quality video of a B-2 dropping a MOP for testing, but now the USAF has posted a very high-quality video of a recent test showing two of the giant weapons being employed near-simultaneously.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading posts (L) and the YouTube video of the B2 bomber (R ).\n\nThe last part of the misleading video from the three-minute 31-second mark to the four-minute 15-second mark has been taken from this US Air Force video published on the US Air Force website.", "lang": "en"}
