The Logical Indian reached out to Tajinder Singh Bagga on Twitter. On being asked if he was in the photos, he said \"No\".

Kada is a steel or cast iron bangle worn by Sikhs who have been initiated into the Khalsa. It is one of the five Ks. Addressing this, Tajinder Singh Bagga tweeted that, \"...Every Sikh wear Kada, Kada is Daat of Guru Gobind Singh Ji and it's compulsory for Every Sikh to wear...\"\n\n\"Those who do not know about Sikhism can make such comparisons on the basis of strictness,\" the spokesperson of BJP's Delhi wing said.\n\n Bagga added that he has never been to Leh. According to an Economic Times report, which also carried the viral photo, Modi, during his visit had praised the soldiers for giving a befitting response to the attackers. \"Enemies of India have seen the fire and fury of our forces. I pay homage to mother India and to the mothers of all those brave soldiers and security personnel who serve India with unparalleled diligence,\" said Modi.
