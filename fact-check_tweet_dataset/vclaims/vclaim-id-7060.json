There is no change in that assessment now, however, a new demographic report shows a change remarkable enough to revisit the issue of life and death in Russia.\n\nThe Russian Federation government shows in January 2018, the gap between death and birth is growing. In short, many more people are dying than are being born. More on that later but first the information on life expectancy, which remains current.\n\nIn 2016, the Russian Federal State Statistics Service reported life expectancy in Russia to be an average of 71.87 years. This number roughly equals French and British statistics of the 1960s.\n\nLife expectancy numbers have shifted dramatically in recent decades. In Soviet times, the highest level reached was in 1987 when life expectancy in the USSR went above 70 years. In the early 1990s, after the break up of the Soviet Union, it dropped sharply and the worst index was registered in 1994 (63.98 years). By 2012, it swung back up, surpassing the record of the the late 1980s.\n\nEarly this year, the director of the of Institute Demographics of the Higher School of Economics, Anatoly Vishnevsky, said, \u201cOur life expectancy is rising after it plummeted to the bottom. In the last 20 years we have been, essentially, restoring what we had lost. We have just surpassed the level that we achieved twice. In other words, in the mid 1960s we could have the same life expectancy as now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we\u2019ve made it to the list of countries with life expectancy of 70 years and higher. It\u2019s a list of 51 countries and we\u2019re number 51,\u201d Vishnevsky said.\n\nPutin\u2019s comments came at his annual news conference on Thursday, December 14, as he explained Russian economic and health demographics in the context of the upcoming presidential election.\n\n\u201cEven though there has been tremendous improvement within Russia in recent years,\u201d said Mark Schrad, assistant professor of political science at Villanova University, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. \u201cThey still lag far behind their neighbors.\u201d\n\nSchrad, who is the author of the book Vodka Politics, told Polygraph.info Russian public health has improved in recent years, \u201cdespite Putin, rather than because of him.\u201d\n\nIn 2007, Russia adopted a \u201cA Concept of Demographic Policy\u201d which set a target of raising life expectancy to 75 years by 2025.\n\nLife expectancy and other public health demographics can be driven by economic ups and downs as well as public behavior. Schrad explains \u201cone of the main drivers of Russian health trends is the excess consumption of alcohol, primarily vodka. The professor credited the three upticks in Russian life expectancy to periods when the government clamped down on consumption of high alcohol liquors like vodka. Schrad says in recent years the Putin government undermined public health reforms in order to increase state revenues.\n\n\u201cRussian life expectancy while still far behind Europe, is at its highest ever and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Schrad told Polygraph.info. And yet he points to new trends in lagging fertility rates that indicate a possible \u201cecho\u201d of the 1990\u2019s, that \u201ca long downward trend of Russian demographics has begun again.\u201d In 2017, he wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine, fertility in Russia was running ten to 15% lower than the year before.\n\nAccording to estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO), the highest average life expectancy in the world is in Japan (83.7 years).WHO data for 2015 show the average global life expectancy was 71.4 years while it was 70.5 in Russia.\n\nRussia\u2019s average life expectancy rose in the first nine months of 2017 to 72.6 years, according to the minister of health, is made possible in part due to high numbers from a handful of densely populated, urban areas such as Moscow. In those regions, government statistics show people living, on average, beyond 75 years and in one instance to 80 years. Yet, in more than half of Russia\u2019s statistical regions, people do not even reach age 70 and in some places the number is much lower.\n\nThe Russian Federal State Statistics Service in January released a report on demographics and other socio-economic trends in Russia for the preceding year. It showed a sharp growth in the gap between the country\u2019s mortality and birth rates.\n\nRussia, which currently has a population of 146 million people, had 8% more deaths than births last year. That was an eight-fold increase over 2016, when the gap between deaths and births was 0.1%.\n\nHowever, some indicators showed improvements. For example, 6,800 people in Russia died from alcohol poisoning in 2017, compared with 14,000 in 2016. And the number of murders dropped from 10,600 in 2016 to 8,800 in 2017.\n\nThe 2017 report finds Russians are not dying earlier, but that women are having fewer babies. Overall, in part thanks to migration, Russia grew in 2016 by 257,700 people, while in 2017, population growth amounted to only 77,400.\n\nWhile Vladimir Putin has set as a goal extending Russia\u2019s life expectancy to 78 years by 2024, a new United Nations analysis of demographic trends in Russia paints a less rosy picture.\n\nOn May 17, the Population Division of the United Nations\u2019 Department of Economic and Social Affairs released the \u201c2018 Revision of World Urbanization Prospects,\u201d which projects that Russia\u2019s population will decline from 146 million to 132 million people by 2050 \u2013 a loss of 14 million people, or almost 10% of the current population.\n\nThe reasons for Russia\u2019s population decline include emigration and health problems. According to Russia\u2019s Federal State Statistics Service, 350,000 Russians left the country in 2015, ten times more than in the previous decade. Almost 700,000 Russians emigrated over the period of 2015-2016.\n\nHeart disease remains the biggest cause of death for Russia, with over half a million people losing their lives to heart-related problems in 2017.", "lang": "en"}
