Threats of retaliation by key U.S. allies like Canada and the European Union prompted President Donald Trump to exempt a large group of countries from the steel and aluminum duties it announced last month, which means they will likely hit China hardest.\n\nThe president himself doesn\u2019t seem to mind. He recently tweeted that \u201ctrade wars are good.\u201d\n\nBut what exactly is a trade war and what are its consequences?\n\nAs a historian of trade, I thought it would be worth recalling some illuminating examples, each of which led to disastrous results.\n\nFrance and Italy go to \u2018war\u2019\n\nSoon after Italy\u2019s unification in 1871, the young nation turned to protectionism to foster its \u201cinfant\u201d industries, whereupon it terminated its trade agreement with France in 1886.\n\nItaly raised tariffs as high as 60 percent to protect its industries from French competition. The French government responded by refusing to negotiate and instead threatened the Italians with punitive tariffs if Italy did not lower its own.\n\nTariff retaliation followed tariff retaliation. In France, this resulted in the passage of the highly protectionist M\u00e9line Tariff of 1892, which famously signaled the death knell of the country\u2019s flirtation with free trade.\n\nBoth nations felt the costs of the trade war, but the damage extended more widely. Franco-Italian trade fell drastically, followed by dislocations in countries where they got supplies.\n\nAnother unintended result was that it pushed Italy closer to Germany and Austria-Hungary in the years leading up to the First World War.\n\nThe GOP takes on the Canadians\n\nAlthough the GOP has in recent times called itself the \u201cparty of free trade\u201d \u2013 before Trump anyway \u2013 it wasn\u2019t always thus. In the years following the U.S. Civil War, for example, when Republicans dominated the presidency, it was the proud party of protectionism and took efforts to solidify its economic nationalist platform.\n\nThe U.S. abrogated its reciprocity treaty with Canada in 1866, following which Canadian economic nationalists sought to pay their southern neighbor back \u201cin their own coin\u201d \u2013 that is, through tariff retaliation.\n\nBy 1879, Canadian Conservatives consolidated around their own national policy of protectionism. Some American companies \u2013 Singer Manufacturing, American Tobacco, Westinghouse and International Harvester \u2013 decided to move their production to Canada rather than pay the high import taxes. By the late 1880s, 65 U.S. manufacturing plants had relocated to Canada. In this case, far from halting outsourcing, protectionism caused it.\n\nTrade tensions reached a breaking point in 1890. Republicans, in charge of the executive and the legislative branches, passed the highly protectionist McKinley Tariff. Agricultural exports to Canada fell by half from 1889 to 1892.\n\nAnd when the Republicans passed the even more protectionist Dingley Tariff in 1897, Canada decided that the best response was a double dose of tariff retaliation and closer trade ties with the British empire rather than the United States.\n\nIt thereafter took nearly a century for free trade between the U.S. and Canada to develop.\n\nSmoot-Hawley wars and the age of protectionism\n\nTrade wars were by no means unique to the late 19th century. Far from it.\n\nThe trade wars that followed the Republican passage of the protectionist Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which raised duties on hundreds of imports, similarly contain illustrative lessons for today. Canada responded with tariff increases of its own, for example, as did Europe.\n\nIn a widely cited study from 1934, political economist Joseph M. Jones Jr. explored Europe\u2019s retaliation. His study provided a warning about the trade wars that can arise when a single nation\u2019s tariff policy \u201cthreatens with ruin\u201d specialized industries in other countries, arousing \u201cbitterness\u201d throughout their populations.\n\nTo provide but one example from Jones\u2019 study, the Italian public responded violently to the Smoot-Hawley Tariff. American-made cars were attacked and befouled on the streets of Italy. And in June 1930, Benito Mussolini vowed that \u201cItaly will defend herself in her own way.\u201d Tariff duties were increased on U.S. goods, and total U.S. exports to Italy plunged from US$211 million in 1928 to $58 million in 1932.\n\nAn indignant Italy added insult to injury by signing a commercial treaty with Soviet Russia in August 1930, followed by a nonaggression pact two years later.\n\nMore broadly, economist Douglas Irwin notes how the 1930 tariff \u201cwas very damaging from the standpoint of U.S. commerce\u201d because it sparked tit-for-tat trade discrimination against the U.S. and \u201cdiverted existing trade away.\u201d\n\nEconomist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has similarly reminded us that, although the Smoot-Hawley Tariff did not cause the Great Depression, the resulting international trade wars played a critical part \u201cin preventing a recovery in trade when production recovered.\u201d\n\nThis article was updated on April 4 with new tariff details.", "lang": "en"}
