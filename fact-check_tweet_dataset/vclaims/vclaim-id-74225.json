Every leaders (sic) of each nation could learn from him.\"\n\nTwo readers sent this claim to Rappler for verification. Facebook's Claim Check tool for detecting potentially false content also flagged at least two posts containing this graphic.\n\nThe post with the most engagement acquired 11,000 reactions, 2,400 comments, and 16,000 shares as of writing. Many commenters tagged the post as fake, but some of those who commented or shared the post also seemed to believe that a British princess really said this quote.\n\nAnother said, \"O hayan ah ibang bansa pa pumupuri tapos kayong kapwa Pilipino wala nang naitutulong puro pambabatikos pa simple pagsuot face mask ['di makasunod] reklamo pa ng reklamo.\" (See, other countries are praising him but you fellow Filipinos offer no help, instead you just criticize. Just the simple act of wearing a face mask you cannot follow, you just complain and complain.)\n\nPrincess Beatrice did not say anything about Duterte's COVID-19 response. The photo used in the quote card is that of an actress.\n\nNo reports contain the supposed quote from Princess Beatrice, nor any other instance wherein she mentioned Duterte.\n\nA reverse image search of the photo used in the graphic showed that it was actress Alba Flores, who plays Nairobi in the series Money Heist.\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
