In the post, they have even cautioned the public to stay on alert as the situation is dangerous all over the city. Let\u2019s try to verify the authenticity of the image posted.\n\nClaim: The wave hitting the Mumbai beach in the image is \u2018Cyclone Vayu\u2019 hitting the Mumbai coast. Fact: The image was uploaded in 2018 by an Instagram user. So it is not related to the latest \u2018Cyclone Vayu\u2019. Hence, the claim stands FALSE.\n\nOn doing a Google Reverse Image Search, the photo was found in an Instagram account. When one checks the date of publishing the image, it was found to be July 16, 2018. So, the image posted on Facebook is an old one and is in no way related to the recent \u2018Cyclone Vayu\u2019.\n\nHence, the image is not related to \u2018Cyclone Vayu\u2019 hitting the Mumbai coast.\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
