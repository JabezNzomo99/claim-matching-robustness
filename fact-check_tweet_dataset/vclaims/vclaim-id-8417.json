To some Australians, this date is known as Invasion Day, or Survival Day.\n\nThe Australian Greens party has renewed its campaign to change the date of Australia Day. Greens leader Richard di Natale has lent his voice to the argument that January 26 marks \u201cthe beginning of an invasion\u201d.\n\nIn an opinion piece, WA Liberal Party policy committee chairman Sherry Sufi said Di Natale was \u201cattempting to undermine native title by implying that Australia was invaded and conquered\u201d.\n\nSufi argued that \u201cnative title can only exist if Australia was settled, not invaded\u201d.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the law.\n\nWhen asked for sources and comment to support his statement, Sherry Sufi provided this response:\n\nDisclaimer: My article in Fairfax Media and the correspondence with The Conversation are not statements on behalf of the WA Liberal Party or any of its constituent bodies. The views expressed are my own. As one of the 193 member states of the United Nations, Australia exists as part of a rules-based world order. Land conquests through war of aggression were only criminalised after World War II. This prohibition does not apply retroactively. Doing so would throw the entire world map into turmoil. It applies on future attempts to conquer. The status quo of international borders at the time was deemed \u2018frozen\u2019. Lands conquered before the Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928) are deemed lawful conquests. So it follows that if Australia was invaded, then it has been conquered. This would technically negate claims to separate land rights for descendants of native populations. Yet the Mabo decision rested on the presumption that Australia was settled, not invaded. Therefore, native title is safe.\n\nYou can read Sufi\u2019s full response and references cited here.\n\nSherry Sufi\u2019s claim that \u201cnative title can only exist if Australia was settled, not invaded\u201d is incorrect.\n\nNative title is the legal recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples\u2019 property rights to Australian land that existed when the English took possession of the territory in 1788. Native title was recognised by the Australian High Court in the 1992 Mabo case.\n\nHad Australia originally been deemed to be conquered \u2013 or \u201cinvaded\u201d \u2013 rather than settled, native title would indeed have existed.\n\nUnder English law, if Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples were conquered, they would have retained their interests in land \u2013 or native title \u2013 under their own laws, until those laws were overturned by the English.\n\nAs to whether the law deems Australia to have been settled, not invaded, the sources Sufi has cited in his full response to The Conversation are correct.\n\nHowever, Sufi\u2019s response contains the reason that his claim that \u201cnative title can only exist if Australia was settled not invaded\u201d is incorrect.\n\nAs Sufi has cited from the 1992 Mabo decision, \u201cthe acquisition of property [native title] is chiefly the province of the common law\u201d. Following this, Sufi does not examine the common law rules about land ownership that would apply if Australia had been deemed conquered.\n\nThis is the missing link in his original argument, and why the claim is incorrect.\n\nIn his article, Sufi justified his claim, in part, on the grounds that \u201cinternational law recognises all territories acquired through invasion and annexation by force, prior to World War II, as lawful conquests\u201d.\n\nWhether or not that statement in itself is accurate is a matter for an international law expert to determine.\n\nBecause even if this is now the status of international law, it concerns the basis of sovereignty in modern times. To the extent that the means of acquiring sovereignty is relevant to native title law, it is sovereignty in 1788 that is relevant.\n\nThe High Court of Australia in the 1992 Mabo decision found that an Australian court does not have the power to challenge the basis on which the English claimed sovereignty in 1788.\n\nThe status of Australian land law, including native title, is a different matter: it is determined under domestic law, not international law. Australian courts do have the power to alter domestic law, which is what the Court did in Mabo.\n\nSo Sufi\u2019s statement about international law, whether correct or incorrect in itself, is not relevant to native title in Australia. The justification does not stand.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the relevant law.\n\nTo assess Sufi\u2019s primary claim, we need to look at what happened when Europeans arrived in Australia in 1788, and at the 1992 Mabo case heard in the Australian High Court, which formed the basis of native title in Australia.\n\nThe Mabo case decision is the primary source document for this FactCheck.\n\nIn 1788, England sought to establish itself as sovereign \u2013 or the governing body \u2013 over Australian territory.\n\nThere are a number of ways to become sovereign under international law. In considering what happened in Australia in 1788, Justice Brennan \u2013 who wrote the leading judgment in Mabo \u2013 focused on the three most relevant. They were:\n\u2022 conquest \u2013 the acquisition of a territory by force,\n\u2022 cession \u2013 an existing state transfers sovereignty over its territory to another state, or\n\u2022 occupation \u2013 taking possession of a territory not under the control of an existing sovereign.\n\nIn his article, Sufi talks about the consequences of \u201cinvasion\u201d. The international law described in Mabo refers to \u201cconquest\u201d rather than invasion. So that\u2019s the term I\u2019ll use in this FactCheck.\n\nOf those pathways to becoming sovereign over Australia, the English considered themselves to be 'occupiers\u2019.\n\nThe concept of \u2018occupation\u2019 relies on the land being \u2018terra nullius\u2019 \u2013 or belonging to no one. In its literal sense, this means there were no prior inhabitants in the territory.\n\nOf course, that was not the case in Australia \u2013 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples had been living in the country for at least 65,000 years before the First Fleet arrived.\n\nBut the arriving Europeans took the approach that Australia\u2019s Indigenous peoples were \u201ctoo low in the scale of social organisation to be acknowledged as possessing rights and interests in land\u201d, and were deemed not to have laws, or to be sovereign over Australia.\n\nThis allowed for the application of what Justice Brennan described as an \u201cenlarged notion of terra nullius\u201d, and for the English to deem that they had occupied the land.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that in this case, terra nullius, and therefore occupation, is a \u2018legal fiction\u2019: an assertion of a state of affairs deemed by the law to be valid, even though it may not be factual.\n\nHaving established sovereignty, England needed to determine what law applied in the new colony \u2013 and in particular, what law applied to the ownership of land.\n\nThis was a question for English law, rather than international law.\n\nUnder English law, in territories that were conquered or ceded, the existing laws of the original inhabitants would continue to apply until they were overturned by the English.\n\nTherefore, if Australia had been deemed to be conquered, or \u201cinvaded\u201d, the existing laws of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, including laws about land ownership, would have continued to apply until the English repealed them.\n\nHowever, for territory that had been occupied or settled \u2013 as was declared to be the case in Australia \u2013 English law would be imported, including English land law. Under that law, the Crown owned all land.\n\nThese concepts were challenged in the Mabo case in the Australian High Court in 1992.\n\nIn the Mabo decision, Justice Brennan stated that the concept of terra nullius ignored the reality of the existing inhabitants of the territory.\n\nThe Mabo decision found that the legal fiction that Australia was uninhabited could no longer stand. It acknowledged that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples did have a recognised system of laws.\n\nThe Mabo decision did not change the international law position that Australia had been occupied. What the Court did do was create a new English law category for working out what law applied: the territory was settled, but inhabited.\n\nBased on this new category, sovereignty and land ownership were separated. The Crown was no longer automatically the owner of all the land.\n\nInstead, the original occupants of Australia \u2013 the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples \u2013 remained the owners until the Crown extinguished their interests, or they were otherwise lost. This is native title.\n\nSo, what does that all mean for Sufi\u2019s claim?\n\nSufi said \u201cnative title can only exist if Australia was settled, not invaded\u201d.\n\nIn 1788 Australia was, under English law, deemed to be settled. In 1992, the Australian High Court deemed Australia to have been settled, but inhabited. Because of that decision, native title as we know it today does exist. Land law stopped being English land law, and became Australian land law.\n\nHad Australia been deemed to be conquered (or \u201cinvaded\u201d), the interests in the land \u2013 the native title \u2013 would also have existed. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples would have continued to own the land until the Crown extinguished those interests.\n\nEither way, whether Australia was deemed to be \u201cinvaded\u201d or settled, Australian land law would recognise Indigenous interests in land \u2013 that is, it would recognise native title. \u2013 Kate Galloway\n\nThe verdict is clearly correct.\n\nIt is not the case that \u201cnative title can only exist if Australia was settled, not invaded\u201d.\n\nAs this FactCheck points out, it is to the contrary. It has long been a rule of English law that in a colony acquired by conquest the former laws continue to apply until altered by the conqueror, and rights to land continue until they are extinguished.\n\nSome elements of the Mabo decision have been contested by scholars. This is not one of them. It is very clear that native title could exist if Australia were characterised as conquered. \u2013 Leon Terrill\n\nThe Conversation\u2019s FactCheck unit is the first fact-checking team in Australia and one of the first worldwide to be accredited by the International Fact-Checking Network, an alliance of fact-checkers hosted at the Poynter Institute in the US.
