Many of those so-called \u201cpredictions\u201d were simply hoaxes (created by altering screenshots or misrepresenting the timing of episodes), and even those that might have rung true weren\u2019t astonishingly remarkable for a show that lampoons American culture, society, and many aspects of the human condition \u2014 \u201canticipated\u201d might be a better word than \u201cpredicted\u201d for such cases.\n\nNonetheless, in April 2020 a 1993 episode of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d was claimed to have predicted both the outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease and the incursion of \u201cmurder hornets\u201d into the U.S. \u2014 events that were prominent news items some 27 years after \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d episode in question originally aired:\n\nThis item is \u201ctrue\u201d in the sense that the referenced clip is unaltered and dated correctly, but the predictive powers attributed to it are rather weak.\n\nThe episode this clip was taken from, \u201cMarge in Chains,\u201d originally aired on May 6, 1993. In that episode, Springfield was hit by an outbreak of \u201cOsaka Flu,\u201d transmitted via an infected worker in Japan who boxed up packages of Juice Looseners to be shipped to customers in the U.S.:\n\n\n\n When townspeople gather at Dr. Hibbert\u2019s medical clinic to demand a cure for the Osaka Flu, the doctor informs them that the only useful treatment for the illness is bed rest, and that anything he gave them would just be a placebo. The gathered crowd then tips over a nearby truck in search of \u201cplacebos,\u201d thereby breaking and unleashing a crate full of \u201ckiller bees\u201d:\n\nAlthough some similarities to events of 2020 are evident here \u2014 the spread of an illness believed to have originated in Asia and an insect with a homicidal name \u2014 they\u2019re rather loosely connected and are more commentary on past events than predictors of future ones, as \u201cMarge in Chains\u201d co-writer Bill Oakley told the Hollywood Reporter (THR):\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like [the episode] being used for nefarious purposes,\u201d Oakley told THR of \u201cMarge in Chains,\u201d which he wrote with Josh Weinstein. \u201cThe idea that anyone misappropriates it to make coronavirus seem like an Asian plot is terrible. In terms of trying to place blame on Asia \u2014 I think that is gross.\u201d \u201cI believe the most antecedent to [Osaka Flu] was the Hong Kong flu of 1968,\u201d Oakley says, adding he was aware of that flu from news headlines during childhood. \u201cIt was just supposed to be a quick joke about how the flu got here.\u201d He continues, \u201cIt was meant to be absurd that someone could cough into a box and the virus would survive for six to eight weeks in the box. It is cartoonish. We intentionally made it cartoonish because we wanted it to be silly and not scary, and not carry any of these bad associations along with it, which is why the virus itself was acting like a cartoon character and behaving in extremely unrealistic ways.\u201d (At one point, one cloud of the virus waits at a red light when another cloud goes down the street with a green light.)\n\nOakley also opined that, \u201cThere are very few cases where \u2018The Simpsons\u2019 predicted something. It\u2019s mainly just coincidence because the episodes are so old that history repeats itself. Most of these episodes are based on things that happened in the \u201960s, \u201970s or \u201980s that we knew about.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
