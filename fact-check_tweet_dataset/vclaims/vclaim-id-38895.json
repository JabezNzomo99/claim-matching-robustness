The PTV screenshot at the bottom of the graphic is true and still exists on PTV\u2019s official YouTube channel as of March 2020, but Elago was not mentioned in that report.\n\nRappler also reached out to Wanted Kapayapaan - Inner Peace to ask for the source of their post, but we only received an automated response that did not answer the question.\n\nThis is not the first time Elago was targeted by posts that attribute false statements to her. In August 2019, she was falsely quoted as saying that parents of student activists are \u201ccowards and are lapdogs of Duterte.\u201d In November 2019, another post wrongly quoted her as saying that the \u201cyouth have no future with Duterte.\u201d \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
