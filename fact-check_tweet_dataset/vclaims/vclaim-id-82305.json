They [moderators] can easily find out that any videos I did with them [Mannatech] were not paid for, were things I truly believed. That would be easy to do. If they had another agenda, they could investigate and say, \u2018See, there\u2019s nothing there!\u2019 But if they have a gotcha agenda, they conveniently ignore all the facts and try to influence public opinion.\u201d\n\nCarson was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2002, and had it surgically removed that year. In 2002 and 2003, he said in interviews that he had changed his diet significantly to include mostly organic fruits and vegetables. He found there was a \u201cdietary connection to cancer rates,\u201d especially of prostate and breast cancers. He became interested in how diet and stress affect people\u2019s health, and the importance of preventive care rather than relying on surgeries to cure disease.\n\nIn his 2004 speech at a Mannatech event, Carson said he was introduced to glyconutrients through a patient after his diagnosis, and began taking the product. Glyconutrients are plant extracts that the company says are nutritious, natural and healthy sugars that boost the immune system. \u201cWithin about three weeks, my symptoms went away, and I was really quite amazed. And I actually toyed with the idea of not having surgery done,\u201d Carson said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a Mannatech associate,\u201d Carson continued. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be appropriate for me to be one. I\u2019m not a Mannatech spokesman. I don\u2019t think that would be appropriate, either. I do refer people to appropriate people. I do not make any claims of being an expert in the area of glyconutrients. \u2026 I still take the products today, every single day. My wife takes them, too. We\u2019re on a regular plan where we get our stuff every month.\u201d\n\nIn his 2007 book, \u201cTake the Risk,\u201d Carson explains he believed after taking glyconutrients that he could manage or even cure the disease with nutritional supplements and a healthy diet. After surgery, Carson found out that his cancer was one millimeter away from his prostate gland and metastisizing throughout his body. Had he waited on surgery just a few months, he could have died.\n\nThe Fact Checker asked Mannatech to release its donation information to the school, and the company replied that there is \u201csimply no record of Mannatech Inc., providing a donation to Johns Hopkins or Dr. Carson\u2019s endowed chair at Johns Hopkins. If Dr. Carson said that Mannatech had provided a donation to his endowed chair at Johns Hopkins, he was mistaken.\u201d Watts said Carson misspoke, as he was doing fundraising at the time for Johns Hopkins and had confused his information.", "lang": "en"}
