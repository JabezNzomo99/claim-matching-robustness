This claim is partly false. Some pubs did indeed receive this private message but the person who sent it is not a known representative for Antifa.\n\nSome examples of the post shared on social media show a message sent to The Crown pub (here , here). Others are addressed to The Blacksmiths Arms (here , here , here).\n\nThe message to The Crown says \u201cYour establishment has appeared on our list as contains [sic] the words \u2018The Crown\u2019 which has strong connotations to west African slaves who had a crown burnt into their skin to show their ownership. As we are sure, this is deeply offensive and we demand that you change your name, signage and promotional material to accommodate us.\u201d\n\nThe screenshot shows a similar message sent to The Blacksmiths Arms, saying \u201c\u2018Blacksmiths\u2019 has strong offence to the black community\u201d.\n\nThe message is signed off: \u2018Kris, ANTIFA Regional Organiser - Midlands.\u201d\n\nAnti-racism campaigners have been particularly active recently following the death of African American George Floyd on 26th May.\n\nThe Crown pub on Talke Road, Stoke-on-Trent, which posted a screenshot of the message, confirmed to Reuters that this was a real message sent to the pub\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nThe Crown pub told Reuters that they could no longer click through to the profile of the user, named \u2018Kris Nemmington\u2019 who sent the message to them. A Google search for this individual showed no results.\n\nAn admin of the Antifa UK Facebook page confirmed to Reuters that nobody from the Midlands Antifa group knew of Kris and that he did not speak for that group. The Antifa page admin added that there was no such thing as a regional organiser at Antifa.\n\nPartly false. At least one British pub did receive a message telling them to change their name because of racist connotations, however the messages were not sent by a known representative of Antifa.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
