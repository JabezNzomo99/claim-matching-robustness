Bernie Sanders included a mandate that would get rid of windows on buildings.\n\nTrump said that Biden plans to \"mandate net-zero carbon emissions for homes, offices and all new buildings by 2030. That basically means no windows, no nothing.\"\n\nThe Biden-Sanders recommendations set a goal for having all new buildings achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. They don't say anything about a mandate. The plan also doesn\u2019t mention windows \u2014 and the presence of windows in a building does not mean that a building can\u2019t achieve net-zero carbon emissions.\n\nThe White House and Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\"Mandate net-zero carbon emissions for homes, offices and all new buildings by 2030.\"\n\nThe Biden and Sanders task force recommends setting a goal to reduce buildings\u2019 impact on climate change, but not a mandate.\n\nThis is what the task force recommendation says: \"We will set a bold, national goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for all new buildings by 2030.\"\n\nThat target is included in Biden\u2019s sustainable energy and infrastructure plan, which his campaign released July 14. The plan seeks to achieve a \"net-zero emissions standard for all new commercial buildings by 2030.\"\n\nThe Energy Department defines \"zero energy buildings\" as those that \"combine energy efficiency and renewable energy generation to consume only as much energy as can be produced onsite through renewable resources over a specified time period.\"\n\nResidential and commercial buildings contributed to 35% of U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2019, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nBiden plans to invest in companies to incentivize them to update four million buildings to make them more efficient, according to the task force recommendations. In addition, the task force expects Democrats to work on state and city levels to make buildings more energy efficient.\n\nThe Green New Deal, a far-reaching climate proposal introduced in February 2019 by Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., set out to upgrade all buildings in the U.S. to make them as energy efficient as possible. The plan wasn\u2019t brought to a vote in the House and failed to advance in the Senate.\n\nBiden\u2019s clean energy and environmental justice plan, released in June 2019, called the Green New Deal \"a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.\"\n\n\"That basically means no windows, no nothing.\"\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 task force document doesn\u2019t mention windows at all, and buildings with windows can have net-zero emissions.\n\nSteve Capanna, director of U.S. Climate Policy and Analysis at the Environmental Defense Fund said that Trump\u2019s claim that Biden and Sanders want to get rid of windows is \"preposterous.\"\n\n\"President Trump\u2019s claim is not accurate,\" Capanna said. \"The Biden-Sanders team certainly is not proposing eliminating windows.\"\n\nCapanna said that Biden\u2019s target is ambitious, but there are already programs in place that push for energy efficient buildings. Those plans include measures for efficient windows.\n\nThe Energy Department\u2019s Zero Energy Ready Home program certifies homes that have more energy-efficient heating and cooling, insulation, and water distribution systems. The department also certifies zero-energy commercial buildings. The agency and the Environmental Protection Agency have a related program to encourage energy-efficient products and practices that includes guidelines for energy-efficient windows.\n\nEfforts to make buildings more energy-efficient don\u2019t center around getting rid of windows. Rather, they include using \"sufficiently insulated windows,\" as outlined by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nCapanna said that older, less efficient windows can let warm or cool air escape a building. That contributes to energy loss, \"which means you have to heat the building more.\"\n\nHowever, improvements that made windows more efficient in recent years include having multiple panes and allowing in more natural light, which reduces the need for artificial light, Capanna said.\n\nTrump said that the Biden-Sanders task force \"mandate net-zero carbon emissions for homes, offices and all new buildings by 2030. That basically means no windows, no nothing.\"\n\nBiden has a net-zero emissions goal for new buildings by 2030, but his plan doesn\u2019t mention a mandate. Neither the task force recommendation nor Biden\u2019s new climate plan say anything about getting rid of windows, and net-zero emissions buildings can have windows (and many do).\n\nTrump\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t align with the facts. We rate it False.\n\nCORRECTION, July 20: This fact-check wrongly described how energy efficient windows allow more light into a building. The post has been updated to clarify that allowing more natural light reduces the need for artificial light.", "lang": "en"}
