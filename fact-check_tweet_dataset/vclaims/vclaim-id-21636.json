Facebook flagged a post with the misleading headline as part of its efforts to identify fake news.\n\nIn this case the headline is misleading, but the contents of the story are not necessarily fake.\n\nThe spliced video clips of Morgan first circulated about four years ago, said Amber Southard, a spokeswoman for Morgan, who was re-elected to a third term in November 2016.\n\n\"Nowhere in the video does he say\" what the headline says, she said.\n\nMorgan has been in the news for controversial statements or practices involving African-Americans, but the claim that he did made the statement in the headline is wrong. We didn\u2019t hear that statement in the videos, and we searched for it in Nexis and found no evidence that Morgan said it. We attempted to reach someone at the website where we saw this headline and were unsuccessful.\n\nWe can\u2019t fully evaluate Morgan\u2019s comments because they appear to stem from partial videos and not full speeches. However, here is a summary of what he did say in the clips with some added context from other news accounts.\n\nPolitiFact Florida examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as \"not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts -- and fact-checking -- in politics, journalism, and everyday life.\"\n\n\u2018Let me take issue with the title of African-American'\n\nIn the first video clip, Morgan appears to be speaking in a sheriff\u2019s office.\n\n\"First off, let me take issue with the title of \u2018African-American,\u2019\" Morgan begins. \"We\u2019re Americans.\"\n\nMorgan then explains that he is \"fourth-generation Welsh\" and doesn\u2019t refer to himself as a \"Welsh-American.\"\n\n\"I was not born in Wales and the blacks that currently reside in the United States of America are not from Africa,\" he says. \"Those sorts of terms that society has come to use are divisive in nature.\"\n\nMorgan then says many issues in the minority community in Escambia County are real while \"most of them are perceived.\"\n\nMorgan then says that not that many years ago, the thought of an African-American president would have been unthinkable but Barack Obama won election twice by getting the votes of people of various races -- not just blacks.\n\n\"If we\u2019re such a racist nation, why do we currently have an African-American president?\" he says.\n\nThe video shows Morgan offering his critique of the black community:\n\n\"We have unfortunately in the black community embraced a thug culture -- one that aggrandizes, again, foul language, shooting cops, abusing women and if you don\u2019t think those things have an effect on our children, you need to get a grip.\"\n\nOne of the video clips appears to come from part of a speech that Morgan made at a Rotary Club meeting in August 2013.\n\nHis speech followed an incident in which two white Escambia deputies shot an unarmed black man who was looking for cigarettes in his mother\u2019s car parked in his driveway. The deputies fired multiple rounds and two bullets struck 60-year-old Roy Middleton, shattering his leg. The deputies were responding to a burglary call. (A grand jury later found insufficient evidence to prosecute the officers but called for more intensive training for deputies.)\n\nThe video clip circulating on the Internet shows Morgan recounting three violent crime incidents that involved black perpetrators and white victims.\n\n\"Last night we had four black male teenagers attack a 77-year-old white man,\" he said. \"Where is the public outrage in that?\"\n\nHe also recounted a homicide in which he said three black people beat a white woman to death and a time a black man shot an unarmed white man \"execution style.\"\n\nMorgan then calls for \"equality across the board\" and calls for working together with families, schools and churches to bring back \"character and integrity to our communities.\"\n\nHe says that criminologists have identified the \"rise of the superpredators\" -- people who are \"not tethered to faith, family, religion or community.\"\n\n\"It's about me, it's about my personal wants, needs and desires to the exclusion of anyone and everything and most assuredly institutions,\" he said.\n\nWe read news articles about other portions of Morgan\u2019s speech that were not included in the video clips.\n\n\"I'll share with you a political axiom that I think is appropriate today for what the Escambia County Sheriff's Office is currently facing,\" he said, according to the Pensacola News Journal. \"When forced to swallow (excrement) ... it is recommended to swallow it whole and for God's sake, don't chew it. We've been handed a couple of these here recently, and I'm doing my best to choke them down.\"\n\nThe audience laughed, and Morgan then discussed the apparent \"lack of race relations\" in the county.\n\n\"I was of the opinion, until just recently, that we have built some bridges in the community, and obviously we have not,\" he said. \"No one is more appalled by this than I ... I will also tell you that we intend to stay the course.\"\n\nA headline that appeared on many websites quoted a Florida sheriff as saying \"blacks should learn to act like white people in order to stay alive.\"\n\nThe articles include video clips of Escambia Sheriff David Morgan giving a Rotary Club address about black-on-white crime and the local outrage over the shooting of a black man by two white police officers.\n\nThe stories use real quotes from Morgan, but not the one given most prominence in the headline. We listened to the clips and did not hear Morgan make that particular statement.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
