Other outlets, like Seven News and ABC7, also published similar articles this week, though those have since been updated.\n\n\u201cFINLAND is introducing a FOUR-DAY working week and SIX-HOUR days under a massive reform by the world\u2019s youngest prime minister, Sanna Marin,\u201d wrote The Sun reporter Les Steed. \u201cThe 34-year-old\u2019s reform will let workers spend more time with family and enjoy their lives, culture and hobbies.\u201d\n\nContrary to The Sun\u2019s article, neither Marin nor the Finnish government plan to reduce the average working time for full-time employees to four six-hour days. The Finnish government debunked this claim on Twitter Jan. 7.\n\n\u201cIn the Finnish Government\u2019s program there is no mention about 4-day week,\u201d reads part of the tweet. \u201cIssue is not on the Finnish Government\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nPirita Ruokonen, a special adviser to the Finnish prime minister, told the Daily Caller that Marin floated the idea of Finland some day adopting either a four-day work week or six-hour work days at a Social Democratic Party event panel in August.\n\n\u201cHowever, this was more of a future vision and a potential future goal for the SDP (who has also in the past played a key role in reducing working hours) than something concrete for the near future,\u201d Ruokonen said in an email to the Caller. \u201cThese proposals haven\u2019t been and are not official government policy nor are included in the government\u2019s policy programme (sic).\u201d\n\nIt was also at this event marking the Finnish Socialist Democratic Party\u2019s 120th anniversary that Marin, then the minister of transport and communications, made the comment quoted in The Sun\u2019s article.\n\n\u201cPeople deserve to spend more time with their families, loved ones, hobbies and other aspects of life, such as culture,\u201d The Sun quoted Marin as saying. \u201cThis could be the next step for us in working life.\u201d\n\nMarin also discussed shorter work weeks on Twitter Aug. 19, just days after floating the idea at that event. (RELATED: Is Europe The US\u2019s Largest Trading Partner?)\n\n\u201cEfforts must continue to be made to improve labor productivity and the benefits to the average person,\u201d Marin tweeted, according to an English translation. \u201cShorter working hours can and should be discussed. A 4-day week or a 6-hour day with a decent wage may be a utopia today, but may be true in the future.\u201d\n\nReports that Marin\u2019s government was set to introduce four six-hour work days may have originated with a since-revised Jan. 2 article from New Europe, a Belgian newspaper. That story noted Marin mentioned the idea in August 2019 but had been silent on it since becoming prime minister.\n\nZoi Didili, the author of the New Europe article, told The Associated Press that she relied on a translation from original Finnish news sources that, among other details, wrongly claimed Marin suggested the work week changes together.\n\n\u201cThe basis of the story was that we wanted to see whether the Finnish prime minister would uphold her earlier views,\u201d Didili told The Associated Press. \u201cThis time we fell into the trap of not cross-checking this information properly.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
