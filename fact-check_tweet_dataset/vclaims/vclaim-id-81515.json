Adding insult to injury, the official is forced to apologise and touch the feet of the accused.\n\nBOOM was able to verify that this video is from Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh when six men assaulted and humiliated a forest beat officer - Jyothi Swarup - for stopping them from consuming alcohol in a reserved forest area.\n\nIn the video one of them can be heard pointing to another accused and saying in Telugu, \u201cHe is the MLC\u2019s son\u201d, following which the officer is made to touch the feet of one of the accused.\n\nThe incident that happened on the eve of Independence Day at Sunnipenta in the Nallamalla Tiger Reserve when the six accused were stopped by the forest officer Swarup for drinking in a protected forest area.\n\nThe six accused have been identified as Raju, Srinivas, Dayanand, Abhinay Reddy, Ashok Kumar and Kausar all hailing from Hyderabad. The accused have been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and remanded to judicial custody.\n\nBOOM reached out to the Madhav Reddy, Additional Superintendent of Police, Atmakur Sub-Division, Andhra Pradesh where the incident happened and he explained that none of the accused have political connections.\n\n\u201cIn the video one of the accused Abhinay Reddy claimed to be the distant relative of former Congress MLC Ranga Reddy from Telangana. He said his (Abhinay's) father Hanumantha Reddy is the cousin of Ranga Reddy,\" the police official told BOOM.\n\nHe added that during the investigation the police found Abhinay's claim of being a kin of a politician to be misleading. \u201cAfter his arrest, his father Hanumantha came to the station as part of the investigations and when asked, he (Hanumantha Reddy) clarified that the ex-MLC Ranga Reddy is a distant cousin but they last spoke many years ago.\u201d\n\nThe senior officer added that none of the accused or their families are into active politics or working with any political party.\n\n\u201cThey are all small times businessman and in the video were bragging falsely because they were drunk.\u201d The police official added that they even reached out to Ranga Reddy via their sources to be sure and he too denied having any connection to the said accused or the family. Ranga Reddy was not immediately reachable for a comment. A story by Deccan Chronicle in November 2016 indicated that Ranga Reddy's term was set to end before MLC polls in Feb-March 2017 in Telangana.\n\nThe viral video, which is believed to be shot by a few locals, has also caused a headache for the Andhra Pradesh police. The police have been flooded with calls asking whether the accused have been arrested and to which party they are connected do, he said. \"Each party has received it with the name of another political party when the truth is that the accused are not even remotely connected to any politician or party.\u201d\n\nThe department is now trying to trace who spread the misinformation about the video. \u201cSome of the forwarded videos are mocking the police department for getting beaten up. We don\u2019t know how six drunk men beating an innocent forest official turned into the fault of the police department.\"", "lang": "en"}
