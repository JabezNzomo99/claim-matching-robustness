We are going to create conditions so that nobody wants to fight against us.\u201d\n\nPutin initiated the military annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula in 2014 and the subsequent aggression by Russian-backed forces Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region. Although most of the latter territory was recovered by Kyiv, two major cities \u2013 Luhansk and Donetsk \u2013 remain in the hands of Russian proxies, and the Russian-Ukrainian border along these territories are controlled by Russia.\n\nAlso on the orders of Putin, the Russian military became directly involved in the conflict in Syria in 2015 and has since increased its activities there. In 2018, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry boasted that it had tested over 200 weapons systems on Syria\u2019s battlefields.\n\nUnited Nations investigators have suggested Russia may have committed war crimes in Syria by repeatedly bombing civilian targets indiscriminately. In 2019, Russia was blamed for the bombing of four hospitals within a 12-hour period.\n\nRussia has also intervened in Libya\u2019s civil war by supporting the Libyan National Army leader General Khalifa Haftar. As many as 200 Russian mercenaries are believed to be assisting and fighting alongside Haftar\u2019s Libyan National Army against the Government of National Accord.\n\nIn Georgia, where Russia fought a five-day war in August 2008, Russian forces occupying the two breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have been subtly moving those separatist territories\u2019 border fences deeper into Georgian territory. This has led to cases like that of Data Vanishvili, who woke up to find his house no longer on the territory of his native country, Georgia.\n\nAll of these military adventures have taken place on Putin\u2019s watch.", "lang": "en"}
