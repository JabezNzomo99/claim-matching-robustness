Kate Snow, the ABC reporter conducting the interview with Biden, starts out discussing Obama's plan to roll back the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, effectively raising taxes on families making more than $250,000.\n\nSnow begins: \"Anyone making over $250,000\u2026\" Biden finishes her thought: \"\u2026 is going to pay more. It's time to be patriotic, time to jump in, time to be part of the deal, time to help get America out of the rut.\"\n\nBiden made the same point at a Sept. 3 town hall in Sarasota, Fla. One woman wondered what to tell friends who worry that an Obama-Biden victory will mean higher taxes.\n\n\"It's time to be patriotic. That's what you say to them,\" Biden answered.\n\nIt's a debatable argument Biden makes, but clearly he is not praising Obama's patriotism for planning to raise taxes. Rather he's invoking the patriotism of those wealthy taxpayers footing the bill.\n\nStill, McCain's twisting of Biden's words isn't totally off base, given that Biden brought up patriotism while justifying Obama's plan to raise taxes on some wealthy Americans. We rule McCain's claim Barely True.", "lang": "en"}
