Herman Mashaba has often spoken of his plans to clean up the central business district of South Africa\u2019s city of gold.\n\nBut one claim keeps resurfacing.\n\n\u201cAs many as 80% of the inner city residents are undocumented foreigners,\u201d Mashaba told business news publication\n\n. He said something similar in a\n\naid the mayor\u2019s statement had to be understood in relation to his experience with hijacked buildings in the inner city. (\n\nMfeka told Africa Check that raids on abandoned buildings revealed \u201cthat a large portion of the specified buildings\u2019 inhabitants are undocumented foreign nationals\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the instance of the Cape York building, a formerly hijacked building within the inner city, of the 343 residents in the building, 303 residents were identified as undocumented foreign nationals,\u201d said Mfeka. \u201cThat is just over 88% of the inhabitants.\u201d\n\nThe mayor had attended a raid of the Cape York building in May\n\n. It was evacuated in early July after\n\nMashaba\u2019s office was unable to provide information on how the residents\u2019 nationalities were established, referring us to the department of home affairs. But director of deportations,\n\nNolwandle Qaba, told us that they \u201care unable to say how many undocumented migrants live in a particular building\u201d, including Cape York.\n\nCity of Joburg Group Forensic Investigative Services spokesman Lucky Sindane told Africa Check that \u201cno data was collected at Cape York\u201d.\n\nSindane said that a planned raid at the building was put on hold as a result of the fire.\n\n\u201cIt is during these crime prevention operations (raids) that we work with the social development department and other stakeholders [and] that data is collected on the residents,\u201d he said. (Note: Mfeka responded to our findings. We posted his full comment at the bottom of this piece.)\n\nMigrants make up 26.2% of inner city residents\n\n(GCRO) is a partnership between the Universities of\n\nas well as the\n\n. The GCRO builds datasets that can be used to inform the development of cities in the province.\n\nEvery two years, the GCRO conducts a Quality of Life survey. During the most recent one, carried out between July 2015 and May 2016, about 30,000 respondents from across Gauteng were surveyed. According to the GCRO, the sample of respondents was designed to be representative at ward level for each of the 508 wards in the province.\n\nA researcher at the GCRO, Christian Hamann, told Africa Check that the\n\n\u201cdoes not point to proportions as large as 80%\u201d of inner city residents being immigrants.\n\nAccording to GCRO director Rob Moore, migrants who participated in the survey were not asked whether they are documented or not, so both documented and undocumented cross-border migrants would have been included.\n\nHamann analysed data for the inner city\u2019s wards from the Quality of Life survey for Africa Check. It showed that\n\nof the respondents in the inner city wards\n\u2022 None 25.4% had migrated from another province,\n\u2022 None 48.5% had been born in Gauteng. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that these figures from the Quality of Life survey are average figures for the wards in the Johannesburg inner city and do not necessarily reflect the population demographic that might be found in hijacked buildings,\u201d Hamann said. \u201cThis would require a dedicated study of its own to determine.\u201d\n\nThe report stated that 183 residents were profiled, with only 30.6% of them being foreign nationals. The majority were undocumented (47) and the department of home affairs detained them. (\n\nData from South Africa\u2019s last census in 2011 similarly contradicts the mayor. Africa Check used\n\nan interactive website that provides access to census data, to pull data on the estimated share of people born outside the country in the inner city wards.\n\nThe highest share of foreign-born was in\n\n(Berea and Hillbrow), where 43% of the respondents indicated they were born outside South Africa.\n\nDuring the census, people were asked where they were born, not whether they are documented or not. It is therefore expected that \u201call types of immigrants\u201d will be counted,\n\nat the University of Witwatersrand said that Stats SA may undercount the number of foreigners but that \u201cthere is no reason to believe that their estimates are off by an order of magnitude\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe mayor\u2019s statement is an absurd and dangerous distortion of the truth. While there may be buildings or maybe even blocks in Johannesburg that are 80% foreign-born, even the inner city remains primarily South African.\u201d\n\nConclusion: Available data does not back up claim\n\nWhen Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba told a publication that as many as 80% of the inner city\u2019s residents are undocumented foreigners, he was basing it on his experience of hijacked buildings, a spokesman told Africa Check.\n\nThree different sources of data contradict this. A province-wide survey of all wards suggested that\n\n26.2% of residents in Johannesburg inner city wards migrated from another country.\n\nA report on raids of 5 hijacked buildings in an inner city ward showed that the majority of residents were South African. Furthermore, results from South Africa\u2019s last census indicate that the share of foreign-born residents in the inner city wards does not exceed 43%.\n\nWhile researchers say that the share of foreign nationals may be as high as 80% in individual buildings, no data supports the mayor\u2019s blanket claim about the inner city.", "lang": "en"}
