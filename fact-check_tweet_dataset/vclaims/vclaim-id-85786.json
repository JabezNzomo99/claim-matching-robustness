That\u2019s because they at least were based on something real, such as a tale of woe from someone who did not benefit from the health care law. Such ads certainly earned Pinocchios, because critical information or context was missing, but they did not invent facts with little or no basis in reality.\n\nAlison Lundergan Grimes (D): False claims about her opponent being bought off by \u2018anti-coal billionaires\u2018\n\nThe Democratic candidate challenging Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) stands in front of the camera and utters statements that she must have known are false. Her central claim \u2014 that McConnell had pocketed $600,000 from anti-coal groups \u2014 had already earned Four Pinocchios. The claim was based on money earned by McConnell\u2019s wife, much of which came from being on a board of bank that finances coal companies. But Grimes also accused McConnell of failing to get the right environmental equipment for a privately-held power plant \u2014 which is not a senator\u2019s job.\n\nCassidy, who is challenging Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.), also addresses the camera in this ad \u2014 and makes a whopper of a claim, alleging that Landrieu chose illegal immigrants over veterans. But there was no such vote in the Senate \u2014 and Cassidy himself had voted for (and defended) the same cuts in military pensions that formed the basis of his attack on Landrieu. Note to campaign consultants: This kind of advertising doesn\u2019t do much for your candidate\u2019s credibility.\n\nThis deceptive and sleazy ad from embattled Rep. Nick Rahall (D-W.Va.) used an ordinary man-in-the-street interview to put words in his opponent\u2019s mouth. \u201cWhen I hear Evan Jenkins say that he\u2019s gonna take away our black lung benefits, it just bothers me to no end,\u201d says coal miner Jackie Counts Jr. But Jenkins never said that; in fact, he said he would seek to keep key black lung benefits even if the Affordable Care Act was ever repealed.\n\nPerdue, after being endorsed by former president George H.W. Bush, ran ads claiming that the Bushes Points of Light Foundation once run by Michelle Nunn, his opponent in the Georgia Senate race, \u201cfunded organizations linked to terrorists.\u201d His evidence was only a leaked campaign plan for Nunn that said that this would be a bogus attack by Republicans. There was no terrorist link. Points of Light was simply a pass-through for donations from eBay buyers and sellers to various charities, including one well-regarded group that had the word \u201cIslamic\u201d in its name.\n\nMany Democrats aired false attacks on the House GOP plan for Medicare, but Grimes goes a step further by having an ordinary citizen, Don Disney of Cloverlick, Ky., ask McConnell: \u201cI want to know how you could have voted to raise my Medicare costs by $6,000.\u201d There was no such vote, and even if there was, 75-year-old Disney would not have been affected under the GOP proposal. Moreover, the GOP plan has been substantially changed since it was unveiled in 2011 \u2014 and the $6,000 figure was based on a Congressional Budget Office analysis that has since been withdrawn. So the whole attack is rather stale \u2014 but that didn\u2019t stop Democrats from raising it across the country.\n\nNational Rifle Association (R): A vote by Landrieu might get you killed\n\nThis ad opens with idyllic scenes of a mother in an upper-middle-class home checking on her baby in the crib and texting a spouse who\u2019s away: \u201cLove You. Good Night.\u201d Then an intruder is shown breaking through the front door \u2014 and the next scene depicts yellow police-line tape and an armed police officer. The ad suggests that Landrieu, in voting for enhanced background checks, made such a tragedy more possible. But even the NRA\u2019s own lawyers acknowledged that nothing in the bill would have prevented the mother in this ad from buying a weapon to defend herself, even on short notice.\n\nSenate Majority PAC (D): The Koch brothers want to \u2018protect tax cuts for companies that ship our jobs overseas\u2019\n\nSenate Majority PAC is affiliated with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), and its ads often won Four Pinocchios. Here, SMP tried to claim that Cassidy is \u201cbought and paid for\u201d by the billionaire Koch brothers. But the ad not only mischaracterizes an ordinary tax deduction as a special \u201ctax cut\u201d but then it falsely asserts that \u201cprotecting\u201d this tax break is part of the Koch agenda. It turned out this claim was based on a tenuous Koch link to an organization that never even took a position on the legislation in question. Such sloppy research is almost political malpractice.\n\nRep. Tom Cotton (R): My opponent voted to let illegal immigrants get Social Security\n\nIn the nasty Senate race in Arkansas, Rep. Tom Cotton claimed that Sen. Mark Pryor (D) wants to give Social Security benefits to undocumented immigrants \u201cfor work they did with forged identities.\u201d But this claim was based on a 2006 vote \u2014 and it had already been debunked years ago by fact checkers when GOP operatives tried this gambit in other races. Pryor often voted against undocumented immigrants on this issue. Moreover, the law was changed in 2008 to make it difficult for the Social Security Administration to process past claims from illegal immigrants who become legal residents.\n\nSenate Majority PAC (D): Claiming someone is in the pocket of his opponents\n\nThis is another nonsensical attack on the Koch Brothers, also in the Louisiana Senate race. This deceptive ad strings together a variety of true (or semi-true) statements in an effort to mislead viewers. Essentially, it claims that Cassidy would be in the pocket of the Koch Brothers, even though he fought them on a flood insurance issue that is the central point of the ad. In reality, Cassidy could run an ad saying that he took on the Kochs \u2014 even though they are backing him \u2013 and beat them.\n\nPro-GOP organizations: Democrats voted to allow first-class travel for lawmakers.\n\nDifferent Republican groups have attacked Democrats for supposedly voting to give themselves first-class travel at taxpayer expense. This attack can only be aimed at a small group of lawmakers who did not vote for either the Democratic or Republican budget blueprints, both of which had nonbinding language saying congressional funds could not be used for first-class travel. But all of the members under attack have sponsored a bill that would actually prevent first-class travel \u2014 but Republicans will not allow it to come up for a vote. Republicans claim that Democrats started this silliness, but that\u2019s not an excuse to continue it.", "lang": "en"}
