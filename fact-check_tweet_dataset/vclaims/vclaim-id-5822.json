The posts claim that Hitler considered America\u2019s Black citizens the \u201ctrue Hebrews\u201d and further claim that Hitler\u2019s death would prompt a new global conflict. This is inaccurate.\n\nOne instance of the claim has been shared over 10,000 times and is visible here . Other examples of the claim are visible here and here .\n\nThe posts on social media provide no source for the quotation.\n\nOnline, the quote surfaced in the 2016 book \u201cJerusalem\u201d by Dennine Barnett, which cites Robert Edwin Herzstein\u2019s \u201cThe Nazis\u201d as its original source bit.ly/33N5gQb .\n\nThis quotation, however, does not appear in Herzstein\u2019s text ( here ).\n\nThe quote on social media also shows up in the 2018 book \u201cThe Hidden Treasure That Lies in Plain Sight 4: The Day of the Lord and the End of America\u201d by Jeremy Shorter ( bit.ly/2XS7o5r ).\n\nShorter provides no source in his book for the quotation.\n\nShorter\u2019s author biography indicates his connection to the Biblical Hebrew Israelites movement and Israelites Unite, an organization dedicated to teaching about \u201cthe culture of Negros in America and the 12 tribes of the Bible\u201d ( here ).\n\nThe Biblical Hebrew Israelites movement has roots in Black Judaism, and the idea that America\u2019s emancipated slaves were the \u201ctrue Hebrews\u201d ( here ). The Southern Poverty Law Center reports that the movement has a complicated history, with some of its sects enacting hateful and racist practices ( here ).\n\nThere is no evidence that the quotation attributed to Hitler is genuine, while existing evidence does not back up the assertion that Hitler considered Black people the \u201ctrue Hebrews.\u201d\n\nAccording to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Black individuals faced targeted persecution by the Nazis, despite being a relatively small population in Germany prior to the 1930s ( here ).\n\nThe Holocaust Encyclopedia notes that though the Nazis did not have an explicit plan to eliminate African Germans, they were seen as a threat to the purity of the Germanic race. The entry highlights that in Hitler\u2019s biography \u201cMein Kampf\u201d, he wrote that \u201cthe Jews had brought the Negroes into the Rhineland with the clear aim of ruining the hated white race by the necessarily-resulting bastardization.\u201d\n\nAn unknown number of Afro-Germans were forcefully sterilized and subjected to medical experiments, while others \u201cdisappeared\u201d ( here ).\n\nFalse. This quote is incorrectly attributed to Adolf Hitler.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our work to fact-check social media posts here .", "lang": "en"}
