Modi ke 4.5 saal ka sashan, 61 aam loge mare, 303 jawan Shaheed hue aur 1701 aatanki mare, (During 10 years of Manmohan Singh's regime, 1,788 civilians were killed, 1,177 army men were martyred and only 241 terrorists were killed. In four-and-a-half years of the Modi government, 61 civilians were killed, 303 jawans martyred and 1,701 terrorists were killed).\"\n\nIndia Today Fact Check found that the entire claim is false and the newspaper clipping is photoshopped.\n\nThe claim in the viral image has been shared by many users on Facebook. A page named BJP Munger also shared it.\n\nIndia Today Fact Check used reverse search tool Yandex and found a tweet by user Aman Ansari posted on June 28, 2018. The figures mentioned in the newspaper clip tweeted by Ansari are completely different from the image that has gone viral.\n\nWe searched various Hindi newspaper reports to look for articles related to terrorists killed in Jammu and Kashmir and found an article by Bhaskar.com with same figures posted by Twitter user Ansari.\n\nComparing the original newspaper clip with the viral one, we confirmed that the viral one has been photoshopped.\n\nThe Bhaskar article states that 4,241 terrorists have been killed in 10 years of Manmohan Singh's rule while 701 terrorists were killed in four and half years of Modi's government.\n\nThe statistics given in the viral newspaper clipping do not match with the Home Ministry's report too. According to the data published in the 2017-18 annual report by Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), 100 civilians and 581 terrorists lost their lives while 248 jawans from security forces were martyred between 2014 and 2017. Alt News has also debunked this claim.\n\nMHA Annual reports of 2004-05 and 2013-14 mention that from 2004 till March 2014, a total of 4,029 terrorists were killed; 1,058 men from security were martyred and 2,085 civilians lost their lives.\n\nIndia Today found that the viral claim with a newspaper image comparing the terror situations in Jammu and Kashmir between the two regimes of Prime Minister Modi and of his predecessor Manmohan Singh is totally false.", "lang": "en"}
