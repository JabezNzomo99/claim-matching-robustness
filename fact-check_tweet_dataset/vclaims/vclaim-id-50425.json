The claims are false; the World Health Organization and other experts said there was no evidence to support these claims.\n\nThe claims have been shared more than 30,000 times on Facebook in more than a dozen countries, including India, Nigeria and the USA.\n\n\"Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds,\" reads a post shared more than 24,000 times on a Cambodian Facebook page.\n\n\"If you can do this successfully without coughing ... it shows that you do not have fibrosis and generally indicate (sic) no infection\".\n\nThe post also recommends drinking water every 15 minutes to \"wash\" the virus \"into the stomach\", where it will apparently be killed by hydrochloric acid.\n\nMany Facebook users commented on the post, expressing gratitude for the \"relevant precautions\" or sharing their own advice to avoid infection by the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe disease has killed more than 4,000 people around the world, mostly in China, since emerging late last year.\n\nSimilar claims have been circulating in Spanish, Portuguese and Cambodia's official language Khmer.\n\nContacted by AFP, Karla Ronchini, infectologist at the Gaffr\u00e9e e Guinle university hospital in Rio de Janeiro, said that holding one's breath is simply \"not a method\" to test for COVID-19.\n\n\"There is nothing people can do to know if they are infected, except have the test,\" she told AFP.\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said there was \"no evidence\" to support the claims.\n\nWHO recommendations for preventing COVID-19 include washing hands regularly, covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze and staying at home if you feel unwell.\n\nContacted by AFP, Fernando de la Hoz, an epidemiologist at the National University of Colombia in Bogota, said claims that successfully holding one's breath to show the absence of \"fibrosis\" and therefore of the novel coronavirus were incorrect.\n\n\"There is not enough time for the patient to develop fibrosis\" in cases of COVID-19, he said. \"It is a lung disease caused by chronic exposure, sometimes for years, to industrial pollutants.\"\n\nAFP previously debunked claims that drinking water every 15 minutes can fend off the virus.\n\nThe WHO said on Twitter that while drinking water is important, it \"does not prevent coronavirus infection\".\n\nManuel Vargas, a virologist at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, said it was \"not possible to wash away a virus\" as it is found inside cells and is therefore impossible to reach.\n\n\"It is not yet known if the structure of the virus is able to resist stomach acid,\" he added.\n\nAFP has published more than one hundred fact checks reporting on misinformation surrounding the novel coronavirus outbreak.", "lang": "en"}
