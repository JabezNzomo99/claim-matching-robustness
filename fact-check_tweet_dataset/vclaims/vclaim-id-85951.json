He said that, more than any other lawmaker, McConnell was essential to passage of the legislation that created a compensation fund for workers and former workers at DOE plants. In the Senate, he said, there were three key senators\u2014McConnell, Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) and Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.)\u2014and \u201cMitch, of the three, helped the most.\u201d He said the bill had stalled, and \u201che got it done. I have to give him credit. The bill was going nowhere.\u201d\n\nRichardson said he become concerned about the plant because of a lawsuit that had been filed by workers a few months before Warrick\u2019s stories were published. He was also moved by a constant stream of letters from the widow of a man who was convinced he had been poisoned at the plant. But when he tried to come up with a plan to compensate workers who had been harmed, it was blocked by the White House Office of Management and Budget as an unaffordable entitlement.\n\nOf course, the question arises whether McConnell should have done more before The Post expose was published. Mark Donham, who for six years chaired the plant\u2019s Citizens Advisory Board on the cleanup, wrote an opinion article in 2008, when McConnell last ran ads featuring the Paducah plant. \u201cMcConnell did little or nothing to further environmental concerns at the plant until he was so embarrassed about his failures that he felt compelled to do something,\u201d he argued.\n\nDonham, in an interview, said that McConnell was responsible for \u201cbenign neglect\u201d because \u201che was aware that people were saying there were problems with the plant and he should have held a congressional hearing.\u201d But he conceded, \u201cit was not just McConnell. There was a hear-no-evil, see-no-evil, speak-no-evil attitude about the plant\u201d because of its importance to the local economy.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to reach a definitive conclusion about whether McConnell should have done more about the conditions at the plant. Certainly the political failure was collective, especially at the Department of Energy, which had fought long and hard to dismiss the concerns of workers. But at the same time, McConnell took a leading role once the problems were documented.\n\nThe version of the ad that lacks the crucial modifier of \u201chelped\u201d goes a bit too far, as it suggests it was McConnell alone who did this. The compensation plan was a Clinton administration initiative, though it appears it would have failed without McConnell\u2019s intervention. At worse, that would be a One Pinocchio violation.\n\nThe other ad, with the word \u201chelped,\u201d stands up well by the standards of such ads. We will leave to political pundits the irony of McConnell running an ad that features what is, in effect, an entitlement program. We have been critical of McConnell\u2019s campaign ads in the past, but the longer version of this ad earns a coveted Geppetto.", "lang": "en"}
