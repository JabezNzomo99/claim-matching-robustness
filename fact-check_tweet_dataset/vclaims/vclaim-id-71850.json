Double points if it comes from a founding father.\n\nAnd so we have another questionable statement posted on Facebook and attributed to the first U.S. president, George Washington.\n\nThe quote reads as follows:\n\n\"When any nation mistrusts its citizens with guns, it is sending a clear message. It no longer trusts its citizens because such a government has evil plans.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence to support that Washington ever said or wrote this.\n\nWashington\u2019s Mount Vernon estate includes the quote in its \"spurious quotations\" list of sayings misattributed to the first president: \"The quote seems to originate from an online publication: The American Wisdom Series presents Pamphlet #230, \u2018President George Washington's Thoughts on Firearms.\u2019 The author provides no citation for the quotations used.\"\n\nThe statement was written in that \"Pamphlet #230\" under the byline Joe Spenner.\n\nThe quote appears to belong to the author \u2014 Spenner \u2014 not Washington. It shows up in the introduction of the pamphlet and does not have quotation marks encasing it. Below the introduction, the author instructs readers to \"read the attached comments about \u2018The Role of Firearms,\u2019 by President George Washington and help spread their wisdom.\"\n\nWhat follows is a line across the screen and a series of quotations that appear to be attributed to Washington. But at least some of those quotations are also included on Mount Vernon\u2019s spurious quotations page.\n\nBarry Popik, an etymologist and consulting editor for the Oxford English Dictionary, also researched the quote in 2014. Based on information from the Wayback Machine tool of the Internet Archive, he surmised that the quote was written around 2002.\n\nWe rate this bad quote Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
