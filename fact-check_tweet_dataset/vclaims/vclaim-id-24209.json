He spoke for almost an hour about his plans for increasing every Native American\u2019s present standard of living. Though vague in detail, he spoke about his ideas for helping his \u2018red sisters and brothers.\u2019\n\nAfterwards, the Tribes presented him with a plaque inscribed with his new Indian name, \u2018Walking Eagle,\u2019 which he proudly accepted.\n\nAfter Trump left, a news reporter asked the chiefs how they came to select this name.

Bush version of the joke in the 2008 book, \"Celebrity Smackdown: A Very Rude Joke Book\" by Luther Blisset, though it likely didn\u2019t originate there, as there have been versions of the joke reported as early as 2004.\n\nIt is simply a regurgitated joke that routinely swaps out the politician. It is just as untrue now as it was 15 years ago.\n\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
