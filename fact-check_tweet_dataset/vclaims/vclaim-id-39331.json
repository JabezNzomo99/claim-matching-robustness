Now, the Chancellor is citing a figure four times that amount, for apparently the same thing. Always curious about numbers which look out of place, we decided to investigate further.\n\nWe\u2019ve found that while the figures used by the Chancellor are correct they\u2019re not a very helpful way of looking at the numbers. \u00a384 billion is roughly the figure you get to if you add up the extra money for the English NHS in each year to 2023/24 compared to 2018/19, adding in extra fundin g for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that results (a \u2018cumulative\u2019 increase).\n\nThat\u2019s as opposed to the more conventional method, which is simply to take the difference in spending between 2018/19 and 2023/24\u2014which is the more familiar \u00a320 billion the government has claimed in the past.\n\nHow we got here\n\nIn his speech the Chancellor said that the NHS would be receiving a real-terms funding boost of \u00a384 billion. NHS England\u2019s budget was around \u00a3110 billion in 2017/18, so an increase of that amount would be quite considerable.\n\nHealth spending is devolved, so the UK government is only responsible for how money is spent on the NHS in England. NHS England\u2019s spending makes up most of the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s budget, with the rest spent on things like public health initiatives, education, training, and infrastructure.\n\nIn June this year the government announced that the NHS in England would receive a funding increase of \u00a320.5 billion between 2018/19 and 2023/24. That figure accounts for inflation (the fact that prices will change over the years and so it will become more expensive to buy things with the money).\n\nSo where did \u00a384 billion come from?\n\nWe spoke to the Treasury, and it told us that Mr Hammond was referring to the \u201cthe cumulative cash cost of the NHS settlement\u201d\u2014that\u2019s the \u00a320.5 billion announced earlier this year. It also told us it includes extra money which would go to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland through the Barnett formula.\n\nThis formula aims to make any changes in government funding for English services have the same pound-per-person effect on the money which goes to the rest of the UK for those services. So increasing the money that the NHS in England has to spend means the Treasury needs to increase the amount of money the devolved governments in the rest of the UK have to spend.\n\nAt the time the Treasury told us that the details of the \u00a384 billion figure weren\u2019t published anywhere (though some of the information has since been published along with the 2018 Budget). Along with the Nuffield Trust we tried to work out how the number might have been achieved for ourselves and checked our calculations with the Treasury.\n\nThe Treasury confirmed to us that other than some small differences in terms of rounding the figures and how inflation was calculated, our figures were in line with theirs.\n\nHow was the \u00a384 billion calculated?\n\nIn 2018/19 the NHS England budget will be about \u00a3115 billion (in 2018/19 prices).\n\nIn its June announcement the government set out the percentage that the NHS England budget would increase by each year\u2014after accounting for inflation. It will be between 3.1% and 3.6%. Based on this the NHS budget will be around \u00a3135 billion in real terms by 2023/24.\n\nThat\u2019s where the usual claim about NHS funding increases\u2014\u00a320.5 billion in total by 2023/24\u2014comes from.\n\nWe can then compare how much the budget will have increased by in each year compared to 2018/19. Adjusting this for inflation we can get the cash increase for each year.\n\nTo that we add the extra money going to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as a result of the Barnett formula.\n\nWe then add the additional \u00a31.25 billion a year which the government announced would be put towards the expected increase in NHS employer pension contributions from 2019/20 onwards.\n\nAdding all of these total annual increases together comes to \u00a384.8 billion by our calculations.\n\nUsing the newer figures published alongside the budget we can see that the cumulative cash increase in the whole policy\u2014the increase in the NHS budget in England, the extra money for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and the money for pensions\u2014comes to \u00a383.6 billion by 2023/24.\n\nBut there are problems with this method\n\nThere are a number of problems with this method of explaining the increased spending on the NHS over the next few years, some of which we\u2019ve looked at below.\n\nFor one, adding several years of spending together is simply not the normal way politicians talk about spending increases. They most commonly refer to spending on a per-year basis, or talking about the difference between the first and final year of spending (as the government have usually done with this announcement too ). It\u2019s not factually wrong\u2014but it could be misleading.\n\nThis method also allows you to claim big numbers about health spending without context, and in a way that\u2019s difficult for people to make sense of. Adding just a few years extra to the time period covered, for example, would let you cite even bigger sounding numbers without any \u201cextra\u201d money going in per year in real terms.\n\nThe figures being cited by the Treasury aren\u2019t obviously coherent with the published figures on health spending and aren\u2019t easy to calculate. That\u2019s bad news for anyone who wants to hold the government accountable for its spending announcements.\n\nIt\u2019s also only part of the picture on health spending in England. Looking just at the English NHS\u2019s budget in isolation from the rest of the money spent by the Department of Health and Social Care doesn\u2019t tell you about other health spending that\u2019s going down.\n\nPrior to the announcement of new funding in June public health spending was expected to fall up to 2020/21 and spending on social care was also set to fall short of what experts think is needed. We\u2019ve written more about the implications of this here.\n\nAnother issue is that the money going to the rest of the UK through the Barnett formula won\u2019t necessarily be spent on the NHS in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, so it\u2019s potentially misleading to describe it this way. Even though the devolved governments in each of those regions get the money because of increased NHS spending in England, they can spend the money however they wish.", "lang": "en"}
