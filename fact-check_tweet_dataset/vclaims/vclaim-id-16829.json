Although this is typically an honor for any band asked to participate, there is nothing typical \u2013 or honorable \u2013 about Trump being named president-elect.\n\nThe Facebook group \u201cAmerican News X\u201d distorted the truth even further when they published a meme stating that \u201cnot one high school marching band\u201d was willing to perform at the inauguration:\n\nHigh school marching bands, both inside and outside of Washington D.C., have not \u201cboycotted\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. The rumor is a sensationalized and exaggerated version of a genuine news report published by NBC Washington\u2019s Andrea Swalec, which stated that interest in playing the 2016 inauguration appeared lower than normal, and that bands in the D.C. area did not apply to participate:\n\nAt least one D.C. public school marching band has participated in the past five inaugural parades, but none applied for consideration this year. Ballou High School\u2019s Majestic Marching Knights performed Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s \u201cLose My Breath\u201d at George W. Bush\u2019s second inaugural parade in 2005, and stepped along Pennsylvania Avenue as they played James Brown\u2019s \u201cI Got You (I Feel Good)\u201d at Barack Obama\u2019s second inaugural parade eight years later. But the beloved band decided to take a break in January and not apply to play in the inaugural parade after several other recent performances, the principal said. Dunbar High School\u2019s band marched in Obama\u2019s first inauguration in 2009 but the school will sit this one out because they are rebuilding the band, the principal said. Eastern High School also chose not to participate, the principal said, without elaborating. A D.C. Public Schools spokeswoman said she was not aware of any band in the district that had applied to participate in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural parade Jan. 20.\n\nHowever, that is not the same as an organized boycott. While it is true that high school bands in the D.C. area did not apply to play Trump\u2019s inauguration, the schools cited a variety of reasons to miss the event (a boycott not being one of them). Furthermore, the area\u2019s involvement in the last five inaugurations may speak to the lack of interest this year:\n\nBut politics may not explain the low interest in the inaugural parade; an unwritten rule of the band world may play into why some bands didn\u2019t apply. University of Maryland band director Eli Osterloh said that after performing in an inaugural parade, some bands opt to wait about 10 years before applying again, as a courtesy to other applicants.\n\nNone of this means that the event will be missing a marching band. Drum Corps International events director Sue Kuehnhold said that bands from the president\u2019s hometown could be selected to play at the 20 January 2017 inauguration.", "lang": "en"}
