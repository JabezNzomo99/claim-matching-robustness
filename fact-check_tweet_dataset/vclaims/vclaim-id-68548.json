As part of negotiations to reopen the government, President Donald Trump has requested $5.7 billion for his wall project along the southern border.\n\nTrump and other Republicans, including Rep. Ted Budd of North Carolina, have characterized the issue as a humanitarian crisis. In a tweet on Jan. 9 and his newsletter on Jan. 11, Budd said many migrants are being exploited.\n\n\"We have a crisis at our border with 2,000 inadmissible migrants arriving every day,\" he also said.\n\nIs it true that 2,000 \"inadmissible\" migrants arrive every day at the southern border?\n\nPolitiFact NC looked at data provided by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency (CBP), which operates under the Department of Homeland Security. It turns out the word \"inadmissible\" has a very specific meaning in the Customs and Border Protection agency.\n\n\"Inadmissible\" migrants are those who are turned away by border agents at ports of entry for any of a variety of reasons (such as lacking the proper paperwork).\n\nThe agency also tracks \"apprehensions,\" which refers to unauthorized migrants taken into custody between ports of entry.\n\nA chart, recent press release and other stats from the border protection agency provide useful information for rating Budd\u2019s statement.\n\nTurns out, Budd\u2019s claim is true only if readers group together \"inadmissible\" and \"apprehended\" migrants (which they\u2019re likely to do, since most are unfamiliar with government lingo), and if the daily average is measured using a specific time frame.\n\nLet\u2019s look at how Budd is way off if we look exclusively at inadmissible migrants.\n\nIn fiscal year 2018, from October 2017 to September 2018, 124,511 inadmissiblemigrants tried to enter the U.S. along the southwest border. That\u2019s about 341 people per day.\n\nBudd\u2019s claim remains off if we look at the rest of calendar year 2018. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) counted 9,771 inadmissible migrants in October, 10,600 in November, and 10,029 in December.\n\nThat totals 30,400 inadmissible migrants over 92 days, which averages out to about 330 per day. That\u2019s nowhere near the 2,000 figure Budd mentioned in his newsletter.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at what happens when we conflate inadmissible migrants with those who were apprehended.\n\nCBP counted a combined 521,090 inadmissible and apprehended migrants in fiscal year 2018 (October 2017 through September 2018) which equates to 1,428 per day.\n\nWhat about calendar year 2018? By our calculations, an average of 1,618 people per day were either apprehended or denied entry by border agents in 2018.\n\n\u201cJust for the record, the Biden Administration IS separating children and parents.\u201d That equals 590,659 in 2018. Divide that by 365 (the number of days in a year) and we get 1,618. Using the aforementioned CBP data, the only way PolitiFact NC could get Budd\u2019s math to work was by considering the average number of both inadmissible and apprehended migrants in the fourth quarter of the 2018 calendar year. CBP counted a total of 184,010 inadmissible and apprehended migrants over October, November and December. That averages out to approximately 2,000 migrants apprehended or stopped by Border Patrol over the last 92 days of 2018. The daily average hits 2,020 migrants per day if you cut out October and look at inadmissible migrants and apprehensions over the two most recent months: November and December. But if you look at December, alone, the average dips down to about 1,961. But here\u2019s another piece of context that could help us understand the number of migrants who are being detained at the southern border: asylum seekers are counted by CBP among those who are inadmissible or apprehended. Seeking asylum is legal, but requests for asylum aren\u2019t always granted. CBP classifies those migrants as having \"claims of credible fear.\" In fiscal year 2018, 92,959 (18 percent) of the 521,090 apprehended/inadmissible migrants filed claims of credible fear. Jessica Bolter, a research assistant at the Migration Policy Institute, noted that, in fiscal year 2018, 27 percent of migrants who made a \"claim of credible fear\" went on to be granted the right to seek asylum. \"This does not mean that 27% of people who made credible fear claims in (fiscal year) 2018 were ultimately approved for asylum \u2026 Asylum applications filed in a given year are rarely, if ever, completed the same year due to the immigration court backlog,\" Bolter said in an email.. \"But,\" she added, \"the majority of those who made credible fear claims were allowed to stay, if only temporarily, while they waited for their asylum hearings.\" In total, about 6,000 migrants who passed through \"credible fear screening\" (27 percent of all completed cases in which an asylum application was filed) established that they should be granted asylum, according to Homeland Security spokeswoman Katie Waldman. \"The vast majority of asylum applications are not meritorious,\" according to a statement Waldman relayed to PolitiFact. And that can be problematic, the statement says. \"Low standards for claiming a fear of persecution have allowed aliens with meritless claims to illegally enter our country, claim \u2018credible fear\u2019, and then in many cases be released pending lengthy proceedings though the statute calls for mandatory detention,\" Waldman\u2019s statement says. \"A combination of resource constraints and questionable court decisions leading to loopholes in our immigration system have handicapped DHS\u2019s ability to detain them.\" Congressman Budd said \"2,000 inadmissible migrants\" arrive \"every day\" in the United States. There is some overall truth in Budd\u2019s claim that, every day, there are indeed hundreds of migrants who are found not admissible. But the only way to get the number he used is to use a very broad definition of \"inadmissible,\" use the most narrow time period, and disregard migrants who are granted the right to seek asylum. We rate the claim Half True. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab and PolitiFact.
