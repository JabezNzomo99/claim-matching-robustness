There is no clear evidence on how many people Universal Credit has got into work.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-39462", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/universal-credit-not-1000-people-in-work-per-day/", "vclaim": "Universal Credit isn\u2019t the reason there are 1,000 more people a day in work\n\nMs McVey, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, has repeatedly linked welfare policies introduced under the Conservative and coalition governments since 2010 to there being 3 million more people in work. This is a misleading link to draw.\n\nThe total number of people aged sixteen or over and in employment increased by 3.3 million between February-April 2010 (just before the coalition government took office) and June-August 2018 in the UK. But the increase in the total population aged sixteen or over was similar: 3 million. In short, having record numbers of people in work doesn\u2019t sound as impressive when you consider there are record numbers of people.\n\nThere are separate figures which do show employment has increased significantly under the coalition and Conservative governments: the percentage of 16-64 year-olds in employment has risen from 70% to 76% since 2010.\n\nHowever, there is not enough evidence available to know how strong the link is between welfare policies and employment.\n\nMore people in work is normal\n\nMs McVey\u2019s claim that 1,000 people a day have gone into work since 2010 is based on the increase in the total number of people in work. There were just under 3.3 million more people aged sixteen or over in work in June-August 2018 in the UK, compared to February-April 2010 (just before the coalition government came into office). That works out at around 1,000 more people in work every day.\n\nBut it cannot be said that all of that increase is down to government welfare changes.\n\nA first main reason is that the number of people in work tends to naturally rise over time, and this will account for some of the increase.\n\nFrom February-April 2010 to June-August 2018, the UK population aged sixteen and over increased by 3 million. That increase is only slightly lower (300,000 people fewer) than the increase in the number of people of that age who are in employment.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean all but 300,000 of the increase in employment figures is down to population change. It won\u2019t be, because not all of the 3 million people added to the population will be employed. Nonetheless, a significant portion of the increase in employment will just be reflected by the population increase.\n\nThe evidence is unclear on what\u2019s driving the rising employment rate\n\nUsing different figures, there is evidence that this government has been successful at getting more people into work.\n\nThe \u201cemployment rate\u201d is a better way of assessing the government\u2019s record on increasing employment. It tells us what percentage of the population is in work, rather than the total number.\n\nThe employment rate among those aged 16-64 has increased under the coalition and Conservative governments, rising from 70% in February-April 2010 to 76% in June-August 2018. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has called the rising employment rate \u201cremarkable\u201d, in the context of wider economic performance in the decade since the financial crash.\n\nBut despite this rise, there is a second key problem with claiming that changing employment figures are down to welfare changes: we don\u2019t have clear evidence for it.\n\nUniversal Credit is the benchmark welfare policy of the Conservative and coalition governments since 2010, and Ms McVey has sometimes used it to mean \u201cwelfare reforms\u201d in making the 1,000 people a day claim.\n\nThe government argues that Universal Credit increases employment by making work more financially attractive than under previous benefits, has conditions which encourage benefit claimants to search for work, and has a smoother administrative process for claimants moving into work.\n\nIf Ms McVey does mean Universal Credit when she says welfare reforms, then it certainly can\u2019t have driven all the change in employment levels since 2010, as it was only introduced in 2013, and is still not in place across the whole of the UK.\n\nThe government also argues that this will get 200,000 more people will be in work by 2024/25 (compared to ten years earlier).\n\nHowever, the National Audit Office says that, because of limitations in the methodology behind the government\u2019s calculations, \u201cthe Department will never be able to measure whether Universal Credit actually leads to 200,000 more people in work\u201d. They have also expressed \u201csignificant doubt\u201d about the main benefits of Universal Credit. You can read our fuller assessment of that claim here.\n\nThe bottom line is that we can\u2019t say with any precision what is driving changes in employment and unemployment rates.", "lang": "en"}
