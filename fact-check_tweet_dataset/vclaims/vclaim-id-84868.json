Case in point: a billboard campaign launched by Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller, tied to the recent Indy 500 motor car race (h/t Elizabeth Nolan Brown of Reason magazine). One of the billboards offered a statistic we had thoroughly debunked last year \u2014 that 13 is the average age for children to get involved in the sex trade. The false fact, which was included in a news release by the AG, was quickly recycled through the local media.\n\nIf you think about this stat for just half a minute, it makes little sense. After all, if it is the \u201caverage,\u201d then for all those who entered trafficking at age 16 or 17, there have to be nearly equivalent numbers who entered at age 9 or 10. But no one seriously believes that.\n\nA power point presentation on the AG\u2019s website indicates that the source of this statistic is the same rotten fruit that Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) had relied on when we last looked at it \u2014 an opinion article posted on the FBI\u2019s website, written by Baltimore prosecutors, that mentioned the claim that the average age was 13. That article in turn cited as a source a 2001 report written by Richard J. Estes and Neil Weiner of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nBut we had confirmed previously this was not an FBI or Justice Department figure. In fact, it is astonishing that the FBI has not pulled this article off the Web, since it continues to suggest this false claim is accepted by the FBI.\n\nThe data in the report, which was not peer-reviewed, is almost two decades old. The primary author no longer supports it, saying it is outdated. \u201cThe world of the 1990s \u2026 was quite a different one from that in which we live today,\u201d Estes told The Fact Checker in 2015.\n\nIn any case, there is just a brief mention of the \u201caverage age\u201d in the 260-page report, and the number was derived from only 107 interviews with girls, found either in the street or in the care of human-services agencies. So it\u2019s pretty slim research for such a widely cited statistic.\n\nIf anything, there is some indication that the \u201c13\u201d number may best refer to the average age of a street sex worker\u2019s first sexual encounter. This was reflected in a 1982 survey of 200 current and former juvenile and adult street sex workers in the San Francisco area in which the average age of first intercourse was 13.5 years, as well as in other surveys. But entry in the sex trade is more likely to be between 15 and 16 years old.\n\nA 2008 study of 329 sexually exploited youths in New York City for the National Institute for Justice, by researchers at John Jay College, found that the average age of entry into the sex trade was 15.15 years for females and 15.28 years for males. But the researchers warned that the data is fuzzy because there is no way to check the veracity of the accounts offered by the youth. Interestingly, 90 percent of those interviewed reported not having a pimp. (Klobuchar, to her credit, said she would stop using the statistic.)\n\n[Note: Some writers have misinterpreted this statistic to think that \u201c15\" indicates the average age of entry for sex workers. That\u2019s incorrect. As we have previously written, there is plenty of evidence the average age is around 25, since only a small percentage engage in sex work before the age of 18.]\n\nAfter The Fact Checker debunked the \u201caverage age\u201d statistic, one of the most influential anti-trafficking organizations, the Polaris Project, looked in the issue and confirmed our findings. \u201cThis stat is not actually supported by any data,\u201d Polaris declared in early 2016. \u201cWe\u2019ve looked at both our internal data and external data sources, such as open source research and media, and we don\u2019t believe that 12-14 is an accurate average age of entry into prostitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe originally created those billboards last year using the best information we had at the time,\u201d said Molly Gillaspie, a spokeswoman for the attorney general. The previous campaign was associated with the Final Four basketball championship held in Indianapolis, and they reran the same campaign for the Indy 500. \u201cThanks for bringing this to our attention.\u201d\n\nThere is little excuse for the Indiana attorney general to adorn a billboard with such a false statistic after a leading anti-trafficking organization said it was bunk. The AG\u2019s office needs to scrub its website of any references to this claim and also explain to the Indiana media that it had spread false information.", "lang": "en"}
