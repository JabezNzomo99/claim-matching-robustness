Ronald \"Bato\" Dela Rosa misled fellow lawmakers and the public when he cherrypicked the findings of a 2017 Inquirer report to bolster his stance for the revival of capital punishment in the country.\n\nDuring the Senate plenary session on July 29, Dela Rosa, former police and corrections chief, claimed that since Republic Act 7659, which restored the death penalty, was repealed in 2006, the country:\n\nHe then said:\n\nWhile Dela Rosa did not specify the \u201cnews article\u201d to which he was referring, a Google Advanced Search using the keywords \u201ccrime rate,\u201d \u201cdeath penalty,\u201d \u201cdecrease,\u201d and the time period he mentioned led to an Inquirer.net report published on Jan. 29, 2017 titled \"Looking at the numbers behind death penalty.\u201d\n\nThe report, indeed, said the country\u2019s crime rate decreased by almost 50 percentage points, from 145.7 percent in 1993 to 98 percent in 1998. However, Dela Rosa conveniently left out other important findings in the story.\n\nImmediately after mentioning the crime rate decrease from 1993 to 1998, the Inquirer report said:\n\nThis is consistent with the crime data published by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), based on official police records, which show that the crime rate in the country fluctuated from 1993 to 2006.\n\nThe statistical yearbooks published by the agency across this period contained minor inconsistencies. Thusly, VERA Files accessed the latest available figures for each year.\n\nBased on PSA\u2019s 2005 statistical yearbook, the crime rate of 145.7 per 100,000 population in 1993 gradually sunk to 97.8 percent in 1998, but again increased to 110.5 percent the following year.\n\nThe figures continued to see-saw up to 2006, based on data from PSA\u2019s 2008 (from 2000 to 2004) and 2014 (from 2005 to 2006) statistical yearbooks.\n\nDela Rosa's claim that the country \"witnessed the horrors of [the] increasing trend of crime rate\" after 2006 was also misleading.\n\nCrime rate went down by around 14.02 percentage points the year after the death penalty was repealed, from 82.57 percent in 2006 to 68.55 percent in 2007, then slightly up again at 74.75 percent in 2008.\n\nIt ballooned to over 550 percent the following year. However, PSA yearbooks starting 2010 note that crime data from 2009 onward \u201ccannot be compared to data from previous years\u201d due to a new method of crime reporting that altered data parameters.\n\nIn 2009, the Philippine National Police (PNP) adopted the National Crime Reporting System (NCRS), which requires all PNP units to report crime incidents to the national headquarters for \u201ccentralized recording,\u201d according to PSA.\n\nSince then, PNP has depended on the Unit Crime Periodic Report, a blotter-based system of reporting, as its basis for recording crime data to \u201cpromote consistency in recording crime incidence.\u201d\n\nIn a 2012 news report, then PNP deputy director general Alan Purisima told The Philippine Daily Inquirer that:\n\nThese findings were also mentioned in the 2017 news report Dela Rosa cited in his speech.\n\nVERA Files has requested for updated crime data from PNP, but has yet to receive a response.\n\nEnacted in 1993, the death penalty was abolished over a decade later in 2006 through RA 9346, signed by then president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.\n\nFollowing the repeal, the Philippines became a party to the Second Optional Protocol, a side agreement to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which was signed and ratified on Dec. 19, 1966, and Oct. 23, 1986, respectively. The Second Optional Protocol explicitly forbids signatory states from conducting executions within their respective jurisdictions.\n\nArticle 6 of the ICCPR also specifies that the \u201csentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes\u201d in countries which have not abolished the death penalty.\n\nThe 2007 report of the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions Philip Alston stated that the UN Commission on Human Rights and UN Human Rights Committee determined \u201cdrug trafficking\u201d and \u201ccorruption,\u201d among other offenses, as falling outside the scope of the \u201cmost serious crimes\u201d for which the death penalty may be imposed.\n\nIn his fifth State of the Nation Address on July 27, President Rodrigo Duterte repeated his call for the \u201cswift passage of a law reviving the death penalty by lethal injection,\u201d specifically on crimes under the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, claiming it will not only help \u201cdeter criminality\u201d but also \u201csave our children\u201d from illegal drugs.\n\nAt least 11 bills are pending in the Senate, including Senate Bill 226 authored by Dela Rosa, and 13 in the House of Representatives seeking to revive the death penalty.\n\nSenate of the Philippines, Senate Session No. 2 (July 29, 2020), July 29, 2020\n\nINQUIRER.net, Looking at the numbers behind death penalty, Jan. 29, 2017\n\nPhilippine Daily Inquirer, PNP: Rise in crime due to reporting system, not failure of cops, Nov. 12, 2012\n\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, Dec. 15, 1989\n\nUnited Nations Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Dec. 16, 1966\n\nUnited Nations Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights, Report of the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, UN Doc.
