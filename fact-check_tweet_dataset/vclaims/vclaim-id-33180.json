A widely viral social media post claims that the preventive measures in the message were suggested by the UNICEF.\n\n\n\nBut, before fact-checking the message, let\u2019s try to know a bit about the virus.\n\nNow, let\u2019 verify the claims made in the post.\n\nUNICEF mainly caters to the needs of the children and young people across the globe. On the UNICEF\u2019s website, it can be seen that it advised the parents on how to protect themselves and their children from COVID-19. Most of the measures suggested in the viral social media message were not found on the UNICEF\u2019s website and some of the measures contradict the UNICEF\u2019s and WHO\u2019s views (on the use of mask and warm weather reducing the outbreak).\n\n\n\nClaim 2: Wearing a mask can prevent people from getting infected by COVID-19 since corona virus is large in size with a diameter of 400-500 microns Fact: According to WHO, people with no respiratory symptoms do not need to wear a medical mask. It recommends the use of masks for people who have symptoms of COVID-19 and for those taking care of individuals who have symptoms. Also, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection and other equally relevant measures should be adopted. Secondly, the size of the corona virus is not 400-500 microns, it is only 0.12 microns. Hence, the claim made in the post is onlyPARTIALLY TRUE.\n\nOn the WHO\u2019s website, in the FAQ section on Coronavirus, it can be read that people with no symptoms need not wear a medical mask. It reads, \u2018WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and misuse of masks. Use a mask only if you have respiratory symptoms (coughing or sneezing), have suspected COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms, or are caring for someone with suspected COVID-19 infection\u2019. Even CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) does not recommend masks to healthy people.\n\n\n\nIn one of the advisories released by the WHO, it can also be read that, \u2018the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide the adequate level of protection and other equally relevant measures should be adopted. If masks are to be used, this measure must be combined with hand hygiene and other IPC measures to prevent the human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCov\u2026Wearing medical masks when not indicated may cause unnecessary cost, procurement burden and create a false sense of security that can lead to neglecting other essential measures such as hand hygiene practices. Furthermore, using a mask incorrectly may hamper its effectiveness to reduce the risk of transmission\u2019. The guidelines regarding how to use masks can be watched here.\n\nTalking about the use of masks, \u2018The Guardian\u2019 writes, \u2018Wearing a face mask is certainly not an iron-clad guarantee that you won\u2019t get sick \u2013 viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is a main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly fivefold protection versus no barrier alone (although others have found lower levels of effectiveness)\u2026masks will probably make little difference if you\u2019re just walking around town or taking a bus so there is no need to bulk-buy a huge supply\u2019.\n\nOn its website, WHO writes, \u2018Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely\u2019.\n\nAccording to an article published in \u2018The New England Journal of Medicine\u2019, \u2018the electron micrographs of negative-stained 2019-nCoV particles were generally spherical with some pleomorphism. Diameter varied from about 60 to 140 nm. Virus particles had quite distinctive spikes, about 9 to 12 nm, and gave virions the appearance of a solar corona\u2019. So, the size of 2019-nCoV coronavirus is around 125 nm (0.125 microns). The smallest particles are 0.06 microns, and the largest are 0.14 microns. The electron microscopy image showing SARS-CoV-2 virus can be seen here.\n\nAn article published by the \u2018Business Insider\u2019 talks about the types of masks and their effectiveness. It can be read here. Eric Toner, a scientist at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, says the following about wearing a mask, \u2018There\u2019s little harm in it. But it\u2019s not likely to be very effective in preventing it\u2019. In the \u2018Daily Mail\u2019 article, it can be read that \u2018surgical masks, which have proved popular, rarely filter out particles smaller than 5 microns \u2013 and coronavirus is only 0.12 microns\u2019.\n\nOn the WHO website, it can be read that \u2018it is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment)\u2019.\n\nAn explainer by \u2018Reuters\u2019 on \u2018How long can coronavirus survive on surfaces?\u2019 can be read here and an analysis of earlier studies on similar coronaviruses can be read here. There is no defined answer on the topic. It is yet to be studied and confirmed.\n\nIn an article published by the \u2018National Geographic\u2019 on the topic, it can be read that, \u2018viruses that cause influenza or milder coronavirus colds do tend to subside in warmer months because these types of viruses have what scientists refer to as \u201cseasonality\u201d. But it\u2019s highly uncertain that SARS-CoV-2 will behave the same way. Those currently studying the disease say their research is too early to predict how the virus will respond to changing weather\u2019. Similar views about the virus can be also seen in the \u2018Will heat kill the coronavirus?\u2019 article, published in the \u2018New Scientist\u2019.\n\nAccording to the CDC, \u2018it is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months. At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when the weather becomes warmer. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing\u2019. The same can be seen on the WHO\u2019s website. WHO\u2019s Dr Maria Van Kerkhove\u2019s answer on the same topic can be watched here. \n\n\n\nIn a press release regarding misinformation on Coronavirus, UNICEF has clarified that the message circulating on social media as UNICEF communication is not true. Also, \u2018UNICEF Cambodia\u2019 has tweeted the photo of the message and called it \u2018fake\u2019.\n\nTo sum it up, the viral message regarding COVID-19 was not issued by the UNICEF. Most of the claims are either false or unverified. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
