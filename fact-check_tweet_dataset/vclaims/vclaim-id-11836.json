Sajjan Kumar has been sentenced to jail \u201cfor the remainder of his natural life\u201d by the Delhi High Court. In the press conference, AAP leader Jarnail Singh targeted Congress leader Salman Khurshid while claiming that he\u2019s received information that Khurshid wants to challenge the Delhi High Court verdict and defend Sajjan Kumar.\n\nAt 10:57 in the video posted by the official Facebook page, he can be heard making the same comment as reported by ANI.\n\nMeanwhile, Catch News had also reported about the AAP press conference suggesting that Salman Khurshid might be planning to challenge the verdict.\n\nNo such statement made by Salman Khurshid\n\n\n\nIn a conversation with Alt News, Salman Khurshid has rubbished the claim saying, \u201cI just did not make the statement, where is the statement. There is nothing at all that I have said. I haven\u2019t read the judgement yet.\u201d\n\nAlt News found a tweet along the same lines by a parody handle of National Herald, @NH_420. It was tweeted at least 50 mins before the press conference went live on the official Facebook page of Aam Aadmi Party.\n\nThe statement attributed to Salman Khurshid was concocted by a parody handle and was later referred to by Aam Aadmi Party in their press conference.", "lang": "en"}
