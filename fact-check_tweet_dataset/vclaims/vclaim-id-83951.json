BOOM found that Goswami appealed for mass elimination and said 'is ready for collateral damage' on his show 'Sunday Debate With Arnab' aired live on February 24, after the Pulwama Attacks.\n\nIn the 24 second long edited clip, Goswami can be heard saying, \u201cNow operation elimination will start. We will have to eliminate all these people.\u201d There is an edit cut, after which Goswami says, \u201cDo you think we have not given you, the sloganeering brigade chance enough? We now need to have a tough military option. As a proud Indian, I am now prepared for collateral damage.\u201d He then goes on to say, \u201cKill thousands, kill thousands. Kill them,\u201d as the other panelists comment.\n\nThe edited video was shared from a now deleted Twitter handle With Kashmir with the text: \"While millions of people in #Kashmir are under a military siege, Arnab Goswami says, \"AS a proud Indian, I am ready for collateral damage... kill them... kill them in thousands.\" Prime Time journalists in India are baying for the blood of Kashmiris. #StandWithKashmir.\"\n\nThe same was tweeted by multiple other users and is now viral on Facebook with the same narrative.\n\nBOOM was able to ascertain that the video, a compilation of multiple comments of Goswami from his Sunday debate show, is edited. At the 8 second mark, the sound of the video faints again to normalise at 10 seconds. Furthermore, Goswami\u2019s comments end abruptly and seem incomplete in the debate.\n\nBOOM ran a keyword search with Will Pro-Azadi Gang Unite Against Pakistan? the title of the show that reflected on top of the screen along with the hashtag #KashmirDebate, and was directed to the live debate that was broadcast on February 24.\n\nPanelists debated the topic along with Goswami, who makes a statement regarding the stone pelters of Jammu and Kashmir, whose \"wrath kill numerous soldiers on duty and tourists.\" Goswami can be heard saying, \u201cKill thousands, kill them,\u201d referring to the stone-pelters at the 55.12 mark. He later states that the only way to deal with them is to tackle them first and \"not go soft on them.\" He also states how a stone pelter, \"Zubair Ahmed Turay, escaped prison and joined a terror outfit in 15 days.\"\n\nFrom 1:07:47 mark, Goswami says, \u201cI am saying that we now need to have a tough military option and I\u2019m saying as a proud Indian, I am prepared for collateral damage to take on terrorists within Jammu and Kashmir and their supporters because now operation elimination will start and we will have to eliminate all these people.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Republic TV has come down heavily on Twitter and alleged that the handle WithKashmir is run by Pakistanis. The channel ran a hashtag #TwitterMustClarify, following which the Twitter account WithKashmir was suspended.", "lang": "en"}
