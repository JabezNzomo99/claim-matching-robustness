One caption read, \"Now this was 2001, tell me why 19 years later they say there is no [vaccine.]\"\n\nThe facts: The vaccine shown in the photo is used for dogs against canine coronavirus. It is not effective in preventing COVID-19.\n\nThe photo is labeled \"Canine Coronavirus Vaccine.\" According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, and the canine coronavirus does not infect humans.\n\nCanine coronavirus is not the same as the novel coronavirus which causes COVID-19. Instead, it affects dogs' gastrointestinal systems or causes respiratory infections in them.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the label of the vaccine shown in the photo displays the brand Nobivac 1-CV, which is a vaccine for dogs against the canine coronavirus.\n\nThere is still no vaccine or any specific antiviral medicine against COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization. Possible vaccines and specific drug treatments are under investigation and are undergoing clinical trials.\n\nThere are around 80 companies and academic institutions that are in the process of producing a vaccine for COVID-19.
