Reportedly, the agency has registered a case against Roy, his wife Radhika and RRPR Holdings for allegedly causing losses of Rs 48 crore to ICICI Bank. The searches were carried out at four places in the national capital and Dehradun.\n\nIn a strongly worded statement, NDTV decried the CBI raids and termed the accusations as false. They also pledged to fight against the blatant attempts to undermine democracy and free speech in India.\n\n\u201cWe have one message to those who are trying to destroy the institutions of India and everything it stands for: we will fight for our country and overcome these forces.\u201d\n\nMany people from the media fraternity such as Rajdeep Sardesai from India Today, N Ram who was the former Editor-In-Chief of The Hindu Newspaper, Praveen Swami from Indian Express, Sidharth Vardarajan who\u2019s the founding-editor of The Wire, came out in support of NDTV after the raids at Prannoy Roy\u2019s residences. Many even suggested that the raids on NDTV founder are reminiscent of the dark period of emergency that was imposed by Indira Gandhi.\n\nQuestions were also raised as to how did the Roys become the first choice of CBI to conduct raids when multiple companies have NPAs worth thousands of crores as opposed to the alleged 48 crores by NDTV Founders.\n\nSenior NDTV Employees also took to Twitter to condemn the raids and alleged that this was an attempt to silence independent voices in media. Vikram Chandra, former CEO of NDTV, also raised the question about billions worth of NPAs in public sector banks and also claimed that ICICI never complained and had in fact gotten back their money in full.\n\nNDTV India\u2019s news anchor Ravish Kumar in an obliquely worded statement on his Facebook page even dared PM Modi to come and face the camera.\n\nTranslation: Scare us, threaten us, put all institutions including Income Tax department at work. Look we are already trembling with fear. Get your trolls on Social Media to start a defamation campaign against us. However, at a time when many media houses are playing in your lap (Godi Media), there\u2019s one such media house that refuses to do so. Your success is that people will sing songs of how thousands of Indian media houses played in your lap. NDTV isn\u2019t an overnight phenomenon, even they know that. If you are so eager to finish us, then Sir, some day, let\u2019s sit across each other. We\u2019ll be there, you\u2019ll be there and so will be a Live Camera.\n\nIn the three years since Mr Narendra Modi has become the Prime Minister, he hasn\u2019t addressed a single press conference in India. His only public interaction with media in India has been during various \u2018melas\u2019 such as Diwali Milan. During these events, hordes of media personnel take numerous selfies with the Prime Minister, have a meal, and go back home without asking a single question.\n\nOther than the sefie-mode interaction with media at large, Narendra Modi also appeared on Times Now in an interview with Arnab Goswami. Many jokes were made about that interview regarding Arnab Goswami\u2019s docile behaviour while interviewing PM Modi as opposed to his usual loud self.\n\nThe only time PM Modi faced a real press conference in the last three years was when he addressed the joint press conference with the then UK PM David Cameron in November 2015. While the representatives of Indian media continued to be subservient, British Press gave PM Modi a tough time with David Cameron having to step in after a particularly awkward question.\n\nGiven PM Modi\u2019s reluctance to face the press, his preferred journalists being those who believe in questioning the opposition instead of the Government, it would be an incredible surprise if PM Modi does take Ravish Kumar\u2019s bait to sit across him in a chair and answer questions with a live camera rolling.", "lang": "en"}
