A meme circulated in December 2019, just after fatal shootings at a church in Texas, that posited Robertson had once declared, \u201cIf Jews don\u2019t want to be slaughtered, become Christian. Nobody is shooting up churches. Christian are protected by God\u201d:\n\nAlthough these words might sound like a declaration some critics believe Robertson would make, we found no evidence that he actually uttered them, either during a \u201c700 Club\u201d airing or in any other setting. This quote doesn\u2019t turn up in any transcripts or news articles, nor does it appear online outside of repostings of this meme \u2014 the earliest occurrence of which appears to date from November 2018:\n\nThis meme seems to be nothing more than a fabrication intended to spoof Robertson and some of the genuine controversies prompted by his outspoken opinions on politics and religion.", "lang": "en"}
