Other versions of the image which have been shared tens of thousands of times show statues of the Hindu god Shiva or the Buddha in the same location. The photographs are all doctored versions of an original image of a cave in China\u2019s Tianmen mountains, where there is no statue or shrine.\n\nThis January 27, 2019 Facebook post, which has been shared nearly 6,000 times, contains an image showing a set of stairs leading through a mountain forest to a cave where the Green Dome from the Mosque of the Prophet appears to sit in a beam of light.\n\nThe caption says: \"Muslims should share, infidels should ignore. Glory to Allah, Like, Share.\"\n\nHere is a photo on AFP Forum and here is a Getty Images photo showing the Green Dome at the Mosque of the Prophet, which is a holy site for Islam located in Medina, Saudi Arabia.\n\nThis September 13, 2017 Facebook post, which has been shared more than 82,000 times, contains an identical photo but with a huge statue of the Hindu god Shiva in the cave.\n\nThe caption of this post says: \u201cIf you believe Shiva, then like above.\u201d\n\nOther versions of the photograph show a statue of Buddha in the same location, for example here on Pinterest.\n\nThe cave in the doctored images is actually Heaven's Gate at Tianmen Mountain, in China\u2019s central Hunan province.\n\nHere is an October 2017 Google Maps image of the stairs and cave:\n\nAccording to the official Tianmen Mountain website, the area is a Level 5a National Tourist Spot and National Forest Park of China. The exact spot featured in the misleading photographs is called the \u201centrance to Tianmen cave\u201d.\n\nAFP Forum has multiple photographs of the location, for example here and here, which is a popular venue for extreme sports including wingsuit flying and mountain biking.\n\nHere is a 2007 AFP Forum photograph taken by Imagine China showing the Tianmen cave:\n\nHere is a Baidu maps photograph of the entrance to Tianmen cave\n\nThe actual image of the cave entrance used in the misleading posts has circulated widely online since at least 2016, for example here on a Spanish Google plus account, here on a Turkish Twitter feed, and here on a Hindi-language blog.\n\nBelow is a side by side comparison of the misleading images and the original photograph in which key identifying markers -- for example, the locations of people walking up the stairs and a Chinese-language sign in the left hand lower corner of the image -- are identical.\n\nFrom left to right, the purported shrine to the Prophet Mohammad, the statue to Hindu God Shiva, the statue of the Buddha, and the original image:", "lang": "en"}
