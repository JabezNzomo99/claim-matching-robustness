The original version shows her wearing a \u201cBuckle up, buttercup\u201d shirt.\n\nFeatured in the image is Goldberg appearing to wear an acrostic-style shirt that attributes the words \u201ctwisted,\u201d \u201cracist,\u201d \u201cunqualified\u201d and \u201cprick\u201d to each letter of Trump\u2019s last name. The altered photo has been shared over 16,000 times to date.\n\nGoldberg has criticized Trump on multiple occasions during his time in office. In a 2018 interview, she told CNN that she could not use Trump\u2019s name in conjunction with the word \u201cpresident.\u201d However, she does not appear to have ever worn the shirt depicted in the altered image.\n\nThe original photo of Goldberg was taken in January 2017 at the Women\u2019s March in New York City. In the unaltered version, Goldberg\u2019s shirt reads, \u201cAnd you thought I was a nasty woman before? Buckle up, buttercup.\u201d (RELATED: Did Donald Trump Send This Error-Filled Tweet About Goodyear Tire?)\n\nGoldberg showed the original image during an April 2017 episode of \u201cThe View\u201d after another doctored version of the photo that depicted her wearing a shirt with a cartoon of Trump shooting himself in the head circulated online.

Goldberg debunked it again on \u201cThe View\u201d then.", "lang": "en"}
