Maxine Waters, D-Calif., has advocated for gun control on Twitter, but she didn\u2019t tweet this message that was shared on Facebook on Feb. 20.\n\n\"Every single gun owner I have talked to has told me, \u2018As soon as I walked out of that gun store, I felt a killer growing inside of me.\u2019\" reads the screenshot of a tweet from @MaxinePWaters. \"When will we acknowledge there is no such thing as a responsible gun owner?\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nBelow the screenshot is a graphic with these words, \"I guess we are just making s--- up now.\"\n\nWaters has two verified Twitter accounts. @RepMaxineWaters is her account for her work as a representative, and it features the same user photo as the account featured in the Facebook post. @MaxineWaters is her account for her congressional campaigns.\n\nWe searched both accounts for the words in the Facebook post and came up empty.\n\n@MaxinePWaters, the account in the Facebook post, has been suspended for violating Twitter\u2019s rules.\n\nBut back in 2018, Snopes fact-checked another such tweet from the account that was fooling people. Snopes then reported that @MaxinePWaters has no connection to the lawmaker.", "lang": "en"}
