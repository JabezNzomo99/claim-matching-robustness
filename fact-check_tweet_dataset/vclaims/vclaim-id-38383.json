Rather, the photos show Alexander Soros, the son of Democratic fundraiser George Soros and deputy chairman of the Open Society Foundations.\n\nNow more social media posts are circulating those pictures with two more images of Democratic lawmakers \u2014 U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer.\n\n\"May I have your attention please,\" reads one such post from Nov. 9, \"THIS IS THE \u2018WHISTLEBLOWER.\u2019\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nAnd that\u2019s because \u2026 they\u2019re posting with Soros, not the internal government whistleblower.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop U.S. Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, from tweeting something similar.\n\n\"Adam Schiff said, \u2018I do not know the identity of the whistleblower.\u2019 @RepAdam Schiff here are four strong clues,\" King wrote, sharing the photos of Soros, Warren, Pelosi, Clinton and Schumer.\n\nSoros posted the photo with Schumer on Instagram earlier this year with this caption: \"Always a pleasure to see @chuckschumer! The #Senate is almost as important as the presidency, and we have to start working now for #2020.\"\n\nHe posted the photo with Elizabeth Warren on Instagram in 2016. \"What better way to spend #womencrushwednesday than with the woman who crushes it in Washington as well as anyone else, Senator Elizabeth Warren!\" Soros wrote.\n\nWe rate the Facebook post Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
