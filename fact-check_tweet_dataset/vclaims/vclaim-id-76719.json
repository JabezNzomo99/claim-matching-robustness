That helps, but that's not the only reason.\"\n\nIt was not the first time Trump touted endorsements from immigration officers, but did they unanimously endorse him?\n\nICE agents are represented by the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council, and border patrol officers are represented by the National Border Patrol Council.\n\nBoth unions endorsed Trump during the presidential campaign. But it is misleading for Trump to say ICE and border patrol officers unanimously endorsed him.\n\nThe National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council represents 5,000 immigration officers and law enforcement support staff. ICE has about 20,000 employees, including nearly 6,000 agents and officers in removal operations.\n\nA statement from the ICE union posted September 2016 on Trump\u2019s presidential campaign website says their endorsement of Trump was the first ever by a vote of the membership.\n\nIn that same statement, council president Chris Crane said Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton received 5 percent of that vote.\n\nThe other union, the National Border Patrol Council, represents 16,500 border patrol agents.\n\nThe union's endorsement was based on a vote of just 11 leaders of the group, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe May 2016 Los Angeles Times article reported that agents in El Paso, Texas, had asked their local union to \"disavow the endorsement,\" but that their attempt failed in a 14-13 vote.\n\nTrump said ICE and border patrol officers \"unanimously endorsed me for president.\"\n\nUnions representing ICE and border patrol agents endorsed Trump for president. Not all officers represented by the ICE union voted to endorse Trump, and some border patrol agents in Texas asked their local union to disavow the national union\u2019s endorsement.\n\nTrump\u2019s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
