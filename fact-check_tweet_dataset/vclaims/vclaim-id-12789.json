Kruk is a Ukrainian journalist, activist and a fellow at Kremlin Watch, a Prague-based organization that monitors \u201cdisinformation stories\u201d and recommends policy responses as a consultant for the Czech Interior Ministry.\n\nWhile the Washington Post website was cited by some of the advocates on social media, the article was written by the Associated Press. Polygraph.info contacted the Washington Post foreign desk seeking comment.\n\n\u201cAP and other autofeed copy go directly into the Post online system. For print, wire stories may be edited for length,\u201d Shani George, communications director of the Washington Post, wrote in a short statement.\n\nPolygraph.info also contacted the AP, which sent a statement on the matter.\n\n\u201cOur story made clear from the first paragraph on down that the legitimacy of these elections was in question,\u201d the statement from AP news deputy news director for Europe Niko Price read.\n\nIt continued: \u201cThere is also no question that the candidates were separatists: While there is significant internal debate among the factions within Donbass(sic) about whether the final goal should be unification with Russia or establishment of the DNR and LNR as nominally sovereign states, both sides agree they want to separate from Ukraine. We stand by our story.\u201d\n\n\u200bThe AP story did point out in the lead sentence that the vote was \u201cdenounced\u2026as illegitimate\u201d and later in the story referred to a statement by the German and French leaders Merkel and Macron referring to \u201cso-called\u201d elections.\n\u2022 Did not appear to include any AP reporting from Ukraine or the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.\n\u2022 Described \u201cRussian-backed separatists,\u201d but also referenced them as\u201crebel leaders\u201d in quoting misleading arguments about the Minsk II agreement.\n\u2022 Referenced the 2015 Minsk agreement, while providing no context.\n\u2022 Quoted a Kremlin official and the leaders of Donetsk and Luhansk, without further context on the accuracy of their statements.\n\u2022 Included no details on alternative candidates or the makeup of the electorate.\n\nLet\u2019s take the last point: In our search online for the official ballots for the November 11 election, Polygraph.info found evidence indicating an absence of non-\u201cseparatist\u201d candidates in the documents of the \u201cCentral Election Committees\u201d of the two pro-Russian regions. The documents are accessible on the websites of both \u201cDNR\u201d and \u201cLNR.\u201d\n\nFor instance, the \u201cDNR\u201d election committee has only published a generic sample of the ballot with the \u201cJohn Doe\u201d (Ivan Ivanov, Petr Petrov) names on it, while the actual ballot with the names and affiliations of the real candidates was not published. The reporting of the results released by the \u201cDNR\u201d election committee confirmed that no candidate opposing the separation of the region from Ukraine was put before the voters.\n\nIn the \u201cLNR,\u201d the election committee published the actual ballot, which demonstrated unusual qualities. For instance, apart from the front-runner and the eventual winner of the \u201celection,\u201d the three listed candidates represented the same social movement -- the \u201cLugansk Economic Union\u201d \u2013 a group created in 2014 after Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, according to Australia\u2019s exhaustively sourced sanctions regime.\n\nThe group\u2019s own political platform advocates \u201cintegration of LNR into the economic space of the Russian Federation and one of its leaders can be see on on Russian social media, vKontakte, as congratulating \u201call real men\u201d on the Day of Russian Army.\n\nAnd so in Luhansk there were no candidates espousing non-\u201cseparatist\u201d voters.\n\nBoth the DNR sample ballot and the LNR ballots were in the Russian language, not Ukrainian.\n\nOn the Minsk II agreement: The AP story misrepresents the agreement, signed in 2015, referring to \u201ca 2015 peace deal (that) called for local elections in Donetsk and Luhansk.\u201d\n\nThe inference is that the \u201cseparatists\u201d were merely holding elections as part of the agreement.\n\nIn reality, the Minsk II agreement does not make any reference to a Donetsk or Luhansk People\u2019s Republic. Instead, the locations are referred to as \u201ccertain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk Region.\u201d More importantly, point nine of the agreement states that local elections must be held \u201con the basis of the Law of Ukraine and constitutional reform.\u201d In a later reference to local elections, point 12 of the agreement stipulates that, \u201celections will be held in accordance with relevant OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) standards and monitored by OSCE/ODIHR.\u201d None of the conditions laid out in the agreement were met in the November 11 polling.\n\nThe U.S. State Department refers to the Crimea section of Ukraine as occupied, and the DNR and LNR republics as under \u201cforcible control\u201d of Russia.\n\nThe story includes direct quotes from Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov as well as some of the \u201crebel\u201d leaders in Russian-occupied Donbas, but no Ukrainians, rendering AP assurances of balance in the article to be null.\n\nPeskov\u2019s claim that the \u201cseparatist\u201d regions \u201cwere fighting for survival as a result of a Ukrainian blockade and a looming threat of the resumption of full-scale fighting\u201d is misleading. The economic blockade from Ukraine is a fact. But so are nearly daily military operations, making that border into Ukraine-governed territory a conflict zone, initiated by Russia. Donetsk and Luhansk \u201csurvive only due to Russian assistance,\u201d Stephen Pfier of the Brookings Institution wrote in October. Meanwhile, reports indicate that Russian military men and materiel, as well as \u201chumanitarian\u201d convoys, continue cross into the regions from Russia. OSCE monitors are blocked from inspecting the inflow.\n\n\u201cDecent media should prohibit their biased & intimidated Moscow correspondent to report on Ukraine,\u201d Atlantic Council fellow Anders Aslund posted on Twitter. \u201cThey are both too ignorant & too full of Kremlin propaganda.\u201d\n\nAslund\u2019s post came amid complaints over the AP story, datelined Moscow, though he did not respond to a question about whether he was referring to the Moscow-based wire service report.\n\nThe AP article mentions neither the fact that these elections were not monitored by any qualified election observers, nor the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission's observations about armed men in the vicinity of polling places and citizens complaining of feeling \u201ccompelled\u201d to vote.\n\nFinally, after the \u201celections,\u201d the leader of the self-proclaimed \u201cDonetsk People\u2019s Republic\u201d Denis Pushilin, announced that he would seek closer integration with Moscow. In his address, he accused Kyiv of \u201cabandoning\u201d the breakaway regions. This is an unusual characterization from a supposed \u201cseparatist\u201d leader, given that by definition separatists seek to leave or \u201cabandon\u201d an established country.\n\nWhile a daily election story by a wire service is unlikely to contain the detail in this fact check, the tenor of the article should reflect reality. Accordingly, we find the AP story and the headline on the Washington Post online feed to be misleading.\n\nAnother relevant fact is a poll reported by the independent Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske, which found that residents of the occupied areas increasingly favor reintegration into Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIn the separatist-controlled areas of the Donetsk region, 63% of surveyed in 2018 said they favor the idea of reintegrating Donbas into Ukraine, given the decentralization reform takes place,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThis is a four percent increase from 2016 when 59% supported or agreed with the idea. While the number of respondents who considered this option \u2018unacceptable in any case\u2019 reduced from 37% in 2016 to 28% in 2018.\u201d\n\nThe report stated that support for reintegration in the Luhansk region, had not changed from 2016 to 2018, but that it remains at 63%.\n\nIf accurate, this polling data indicate that a clear majority of residents in these areas favor reintegration with the rest of Ukraine. Yet, in spite of this, \u201cseparatists\u201d won the elections, and \u201cby big margins,\u201d according to the AP headline.The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, in an election day spot report, said some citizens reported feeling \u201ccompelled to vote\u201d or lose access to salaries and healthcare.\n\nA study by the University of Oxford in 2015, just after Russia launched its covert operation in Ukraine, found \u201clittle support\u201d for separatism or desire to join Russia. According to the study, fewer than 5% of respondents favored solutions \u201cthat would lead to the breakup of the country.\u201d Ostrov, a Donetsk-based publication, held its own survey in July of 2014 as the war began. It found that 75% of respondents saw their future as being in Ukraine. Only three percent saw their future in the self-proclaimed \u201cDonetsk People\u2019s Republic.\u201d However, questions remain as to how representative the survey was.", "lang": "en"}
