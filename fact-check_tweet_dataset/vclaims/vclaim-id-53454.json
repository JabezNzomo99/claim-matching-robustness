Bobby Rush would supersede constitutional rights during the coronavirus disease pandemic.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2020-05-12T10:49:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-53454", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hr6666-remove-covid-patients-homes/", "vclaim": "The COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, or H.R. 6666, would authorize federally administered COVID-19 testing groups to enter American homes and force testing against residents' will, and then \"take\" those who test positive to quarantine sites.\n\nOn May 1, 2020, as U.S. federal leaders negotiated emergency proposals to combat the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic, U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush from Illinois introduced a proposal that would set aside $100 billion to help local agencies identify people who were exposed to the coronavirus without knowing it.\n\nRush, a Democrat who represents much of Chicago\u2019s South Side, authored the so-called H.R. 6666 \u2013 COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act \u2014 a 646-word bill that would establish a new grant program under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to which local clinics, hospitals, nonprofits, and schools could apply for funding.\n\nBut soon after Rush introduced the legislation \u2014 a formality in Congressional lawmaking that precedes the committee-hearing process where federal leaders negotiate the specifics of legislation and decide whether it should advance for final votes \u2014 critics on Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit began sharing posts describing how they interpreted Rush\u2019s legislation.\n\nWhile some of those interpretations suggested the legislation would allow grant recipients to prohibit any non-vaccinated persons into their facilities (Snopes fact-checked that claim here), other interpretations focused on what the legislation would mean for COVID-19 testing.\n\nPeople claimed H.R. 6666 would violate American\u2019s constitutional rights by allowing federally-administered testing groups to enter homes against owners\u2019 will in order to conduct COVID-19 testing and force people to take the tests, even if they didn\u2019t want to. Soon, those types of fears around H.R. 6666 morphed into exaggerated claims that the legislation would allow COVID-19 testing groups to \u201center your house, test and vaccinate you against your will and take your children,\u201d as one Snopes reader said.\n\nAmong the most popular claims were those made by anti-vaccine advocate, Dr. Rashid Buttar, who asked viewers in a live video stream on May 8 to share his read on the House bill.\n\nButtar, a licensed Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine in North Carolina, said in the video:\n\nBasically this act is to allow individuals to come into your house and if you\u2019ve got a cough, or somebody in your family has a cough, or you have a fever \u2014 or anything that they determine that shows that you have COVID-19 \u2014 regardless of whether you\u2019ve been tested or not, they will also test people. \u2026 They\u2019re going to use that to pull you or your loved ones, especially your children, away under pretense of public safety. They\u2019re going to say that your child has to be removed from you because you have COVID-19 and so to protect your child, we\u2019re going to take the child. Or, we\u2019re going to take your grandmother, or your father or you and put you into quarantine.\n\nHe asked audience members to contact their U.S. representatives to advocate against H.R. 6666, much like online petitions that began circulating around the same time as Buttar\u2019s video.\n\nBut these were completely false claims based on, at best, a misunderstanding of Rush\u2019s introduced legislation.\n\nWhat Exactly Would H.R. 6666 Do?\n\nAs currently written, the legislation would set aside $100 billion in federal money for fiscal year 2020 that \u201ccommunity health centers, school based health centers, academic medical centers, non-profits (including faith-based organizations) and other entities\u201d can apply to use, according to a statement from Rush\u2019s office and the legislation.\n\nPending no amendments and final approval of the $100 billion bill (as of this writing, it was awaiting its first hearing by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce), federal health officials would prioritize grant applicants from areas that are currently underserved by medical professionals or where the rate of infections exceeds the national average. To that point, Rush elaborated on Twitter:\n\nUnder the bill\u2019s terms, chosen recipients would then have to use the money to buy COVID-19 testing equipment and personal protective gear, and hire and train people in their communities to run \u201cmobile testing units\u201d and do \u201cdoor-to-door outreach\u201d \u2014 all with the goal of helping individuals who are isolating at home and figuring out how, exactly, COVID-19 is spreading on a community-by-community basis, according to Rush and the statement.\n\nThe latter objective, known as contact tracing, involves the following, according to the CDC:\n\nContact tracing is part of the process of supporting patients with suspected or confirmed infection. In contact tracing, public health staff work with a patient to help them recall everyone with whom they have had close contact during the timeframe while they may have been infectious. Public health staff then warn these exposed individuals (contacts) of their potential exposure as rapidly and sensitively as possible. To protect patient privacy, contacts are only informed that they may have been exposed to a patient with the infection. They are not told the identity of the patient who may have exposed them.\n\nAccording to the CDC and national health security officials, that type of on-the-ground work to track COVID-19 transmission patterns is a key strategy for curbing the U.S. outbreak. Per the CDC, \u201cimmediate action is needed\u201d for communities to \u201cscale up and train a large contact tracer workforce,\u201d like what Rush\u2019s bill proposes to fund.\n\nA COVID-19 response plan by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Center for Health Security summarized the need like this:\n\nRush\u2019s legislation had 39 co-authors as of this publication, including one Republican.\n\nWhat About the Bill Is Being Misinterpreted?\n\nThe legislation does not go into detail on how, exactly, the grant recipients must conduct contact tracing nor how they must operate the \u201cmobile health units\u201d during the pandemic. It states:\n\nBased on the nature of complaints from critics, the latter point \u2060\u2014 that, as necessary, staff would visit people at their homes and provide them services \u201crelated to testing and quarantine\u201d to limit the spread of COVID-19 \u2060\u2014 was likely the source of inspiration for the claims that COVID-19 testing groups could forcibly enter homes and conduct testing.\n\nYet, a few lines lower in the bill, authors wrote \u201cnothing in this [legislation] shall be construed to supersede any Federal privacy or confidentiality\u201d requirements \u2014 which includes not only privacy protections for how grant recipients could use the medical information of individuals but also the Fourth Amendment right to privacy \u201cagainst unreasonable searches\u201d of property by the government and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which states:\n\nIn other words, the bill\u2019s language would not authorize federally-administered groups, including local recipients of the grant money, to forcibly enter homes and test Americans for COVID-19. If a team (funded by the grant) were to knock on the front door to your home, or if you noticed one of their \u201cmobile health units\u201d in your neighborhood, you would have the right to decline a COVID-19 test. All testing under the legislation would be voluntary.\n\nAdditionally, nowhere does the legislation call for the removal of people \u2014 including children or elderly Americans \u2014 from their homes, as Buttar\u2019s viral video claimed. It also does not authorize groups to force Americans to quarantine.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing in this bill that will threaten anyone\u2019s individual liberties,\u201d Rush wrote on Twitter. \u201c[It] would increase testing and outreach efforts for communities most impacted by the coronavirus.\u201d\n\nIn sum, given the bill\u2019s language that explicitly states that its provisions would not supersede existing federal protections to privacy and that rumors about the bill were based on falsified misinterpretation of the legislation, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
