The post has been shared 14,000 times with over 12,000 reactions and 5,000 comments, as of writing.\n\nThe facts: In a text message to Rappler, Robredo's spokesperson Barry Gutierrez denied that the Vice President made the statement. The proposed SOGIE bill contains no clause about indicating the gender of a newborn in birth certificates, too.

It was incorrect, it was just a guess and it was a wrong guess. Sex assignment is predictive, it is not final.\"\n\nThe LGBT advocate cited the practices in countries like Australia where birth certificates have a gender-neutral option aside from binary categories of sex that parents can choose from.
