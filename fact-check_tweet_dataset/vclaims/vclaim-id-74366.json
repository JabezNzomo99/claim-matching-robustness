(The garden's web site was recently offline.)\n\nThe memorial, titled \u201cA Heartfelt Apology,\u201d was unveiled on July 26 with little fanfare. The set of two statues depicts a girl sitting on a bench and, in front of her, a man on his knees bowing deeply to the ground. But what happened next reopened an unhealed rift between the countries.\n\nSome observers claimed the male figure resembled Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The speculation began on social media, but it soon spread to mainstream news media in South Korea, and then to Japan.\n\nMajor Japanese news networks, such as Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo Shimbun, and Yomiuri Shimbun, dubbed the statues the \u201cApologizing Abe Statue.\u201d Asahi reported that the statues signaled South Korea\u2019s intention to \u201creignite a furor with Japan\u201d over wartime issues.\n\nTensions heightened further when Japanese government officials intruded. On July 28, Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, addressed the controversy, saying the statues were \u201cunacceptable on the basis of international courtesy \u2026 If the report is true, it will have a decisive impact on Japan-South Korea relations.\u201d\n\nClaims that the statue depicts Abe are false.\n\nKim Chang-ryul, the head of Korea Botanical Garden, issued a strong denial, adding that the statue was just \u201cone of many statues at the botanical garden.\u201d The garden is a popular tourist attraction located in Pyeongchang, north of Seoul. It is privately run and has no government affiliation.\n\n\u201cThe man could be the girl\u2019s father, or maybe former (Japanese) Prime Minister Hashimoto, or just someone who feels bad about what the comfort women went through,\u201d Kim explained.\n\n\u201cI was just thinking it would be nice to have something meaningful,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no political backing or purpose whatsoever. I did not expect such controversy to arise from this.\u201d\n\nSouth Korea and Japan have had a rocky relationship over the years. Imperial Japan ruled Korea for 35 years, and the countries have disagreed over the settlement of alleged war crimes committed by the Japanese.\n\nPerhaps the most fiercely argued matter of all \u2013 more so from the Korean side \u2013 has been the matter of the comfort women, whose numbers have been estimated by the United Nations at more than 200,000.\n\nIn 2015, under Abe\u2019s government, South Korea and Japan reached an agreement to \u201cfinally and irreversibly resolve\u201d this issue, when Japan agreed to pay 1 billion yen (about $8.3 million) to surviving victims.\n\nThe deal has been widely criticized for alienating the survivors, who filed a lawsuit against the South Korean government in 2016. Although the case was dismissed, the court stated that the agreement \u201ccertainly lacked transparency or was deficient in recognizing \u2018legal responsibility\u2019 and on the nature of the one billion yen provided by the Japanese government.\u201d\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-In has rescinded the agreement, telling Abe that \"the reality is the majority of [Koreans] cannot emotionally accept the comfort women agreement.\" South Korea officially pulled out in 2018.\n\nWhen asked to comment on \u201cA Heartfelt Apology,\u201d South Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Kim In-chul said that if true, the statue would degrade \u201cinternational comity concerning foreign leaders.\u201d\n\nSouth Korean commentators have said the statues, built on private property using private funds, should not be subject to international comity.\n\nThe Korean Botanical Garden has canceled the unveiling ceremony for \u201cA Heartfelt Apology,\u201d which had been planned for Aug. 10. In addition, the Garden said it has no plans to remove the statues.", "lang": "en"}
