How can I return it, free of charge?\u201d\n\nIn its report on the Twitter exchange, Sputnik included background information on the Democratic race to become the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nominee and Comey\u2019s involvement in the investigation of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMedia in the U.S. and elsewhere published similar reports.\n\nHowever, unlike Sputnik\u2019s article, the other media reports included Bates\u2019 subsequent clarification via Twitter, in which he denied that his first tweet had been a \u201crejection\u201d of Comey\u2019s endorsement.\n\n\u201cI forgot the #1 rule of politics, which is that if you talk about anyone or anything related to 2016, common sense goes out the window. It was meant to be a lighthearted joke - not a rejection,\u201d Bates wrote in his follow-up tweet. \u201cWe appreciate the vote of anyone repelled by Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign has not officially commented on Comey\u2019s endorsement or Bates\u2019 comment, and, according to Newsweek, did not respond to the press inquiries.", "lang": "en"}
