We don\u2019t know of any research into how widespread this is.\n\nThe government\u2019s definition of terminal illness in this case is a progressive disease likely to cause death in six months or less. Though it does say it realises that predicting \u201clife expectancy isn\u2019t an exact science\u201d.\n\nWhen applying for some benefits, such as Universal Credit and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA), there are \u2018special rules\u2019 which should apply to people with a terminal illness. They are not meant to have face to face assessments to claim certain benefits, and their applications are fast tracked so they can get their payments sooner.\n\nThe government says that: \u201cSpecial rules for people who are terminally ill provide a guaranteed entitlement to benefit\u2026 We are committed to meeting the needs of terminally ill claimants, therefore these rules are kept under review on an ongoing basis.\u201d\n\nIt also said it\u2019s aware that some people have encountered \u201cissues with the service\u201d for terminally ill people trying to claim universal benefit and of \u201cconcerns raised about the process\u201d.\n\nESA is a benefit for people with disabilities or illnesses which mean they are unable to work or can only work a limited number of hours. Income-related ESA is also one of the benefits being replaced by Universal Credit.\n\nMost people who apply for ESA or Universal Credit undergo a work capability assessment to decide whether they\u2019re eligible. For ESA, if they are eligible, they will be put in one of two groups\u2014a work-related activity group which involves interviews with an advisor and working to improve job prospects, or a support group with no interviews.\n\nTerminally ill people should be assigned to the support group when they apply, in this group they can receive a higher rate of benefit. People with a terminal illness who claim Universal Credit may also be able to receive a higher rate of benefit.\n\nIn the DWP\u2019s guidelines for work capability assessments, it says that \u201cthere is no requirement for terminally ill claimants to participate in any form of work-related activity\u201d.\n\n3% of those assigned to the ESA support group after first making a claim in June 2017 were assigned to the group because of terminal illness. This was around 300 people.\n\nIf someone is declared fit for work after their ESA work capability assessment and disagrees with the decision, they can ask for a mandatory reconsideration of their case. If the decision is not revised, they can appeal again at an independent tribunal.\n\nYou can read more about fit for work appeals in our factcheck here.\n\nSome people think the definition of a terminal illness should be changed. The charity Macmillan Cancer Support asked the government to change its definition from six to 12 months over a decade ago. The terminal illness charity, Marie Curie, says the definition is not fair on those who require financial support but aren\u2019t likely to die within six months.\n\nNew laws in Scotland will replace the six month definition. For a number of benefits that are to be devolved to Scotland a terminal illness will now be defined as an illness that a clinician decides \u201ccan reasonably be expected to cause the individual\u2019s death\u201d. These devolved benefits don\u2019t include Universal Credit or ESA though.", "lang": "en"}
