He circulated the claim on both Twitter and Facebook, drawing a combined share (plus retweet) count of nearly 1,600.\n\nUpadhyay had tweeted the same article in 2015 as well.\n\nOther BJP members \u2013 the party\u2019s Delhi social media and IT cell head, Punit Agarwal, and co-convenor BJP Delhi IT and social media, Vikash Singh \u2013 also tweeted the TOI article on January 7. In fact, the claim is viral on Twitter.\n\nThe 2013 report by TOI attributed the source of the information to Huffington Post, according to which, \u201cSonia Gandhi is the 12th richest political leader in the world.\u201d\n\nAlt News found that on November 29, 2013, Huffington Post had indeed published a story on the richest world leaders and placed Sonia Gandhi in the 12th position. However, the former INC President\u2019s name was subsequently removed from the story as the information\u2019s source, as clarified later by Huffington Post, was \u201ccalled into question.\u201d\n\nA December 2013 report by India Todayhad found that Huffington Post\u2019s claims about Gandhi\u2019s net worth were based on a report published by a website called Celebrity Net Worthwhich routinely writes on celebrity finances.\n\nAccording to the website, \u201cShe (Sonia Gandhi) personally states her wealth to be between $200,000 and $500,000, but several sources including OpenSecrets.org and Business Insider have estimated that Sonia\u2019s actual wealth could be as low as $2 billion and might be as high as $19 billion.\u201d\n\nIn a March 2, 2012 report titled \u2013 \u2018Meet The 23 Richest Politicians In The World\u2019 \u2013 Business Insider placed Gandhi 4th in the list, with the article claiming that her net worth was between US$ 2-19 billion.\n\nThe Business Insider story hyperlinked a website named \u2018World\u2019s Luxury Guide\u2019 as its source. It also said that there are some disputes about Gandhi\u2019s actual net worth and that the\u2018National Election Watch\u2019put the same at US$200,000 (approximately Rs 1.35 crores at that time).\n\nThe website \u2018World\u2019s Luxury Guide\u2019 has been taken down since over a year. Accessing an archived version of the \u2018list of richest leaders\u2019 created by the website revealed that it also placed Sonia Gandhi at the 4th place. \u2018World\u2019s Luxury Guide\u2019 had provided opensecret.org, forbes.com, bloomberg.com, wikipedia.org and guardian.co.uk as its sources.\n\nForbes had published an article in 2011 titled \u2013 \u2018India\u2019s 100 Richest\u2019 \u2013 which does not include Gandhi\u2019s name. In 2012, The Guardianhad published a report on the world\u2019s richest leaders, however, it too did not include Gandhi. On Bloomberg, Alt News back-searched till 2010 but found nothing of relevance. The remaining attribution provided by Business Insider \u2013OpenSecret \u2013 has never written any report on the former Congress President.\n\nThus, none of the sources enlisted by \u2018World\u2019s Luxury Guide\u2019 had the data to back up the claim of Sonia Gandhi being the world\u2019s 4th richest politician. Moreover, the name of the website itself should indicate that it is not a source that could be trusted.\n\nThe other source mentioned by Business Insider was \u2018National Election Watch,\u2019 claiming that it put Sonia Gandhi\u2019s net worth at US$200,000 (approximately Rs 1.37 crore in 2012).\n\nAccessing the link redirected us to a report that provided the assets declared by Gandhi before 2004, 2009 and 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The latest figures (2014) put her net worth at over Rs 9.28 crore. As the Business Insider article was published in 2012, it must have referred to the figures Gandhi had disclosed in 2009 \u2013 Rs 1.37 crore. This matched the \u201cdisputed net worth\u201d claims on Business Insider.\n\nThe evidence at hand suggests that the claims that Gandhi\u2019s net worth is between $2-19 billion, more than that of the Queen of England, are unfounded. The Times of India article, recently viral on social media, had republished the report by Huffington Post, which later removed Gandhi\u2019s name as the source itself was not credible.\n\nAlt News had debunked this misinformation earlier, regardless of which it is again being circulated widely.\n\nTOI fails to clarify even after six years\n\nThe false claims about Sonia Gandhi\u2019s net worth have been floating on social media for quite some time now. As revealed through the course of this article, the misinformation originated on a flimsy website (\u2018World\u2019s Luxury Guide\u2019) which doesn\u2019t exist anymore. Media outlet Business Insider picked up the story, which was then used by Huffington Post and subsequently by The Times of India.\n\nUpon realising that the source was not credible, Huffington Post retracted Gandhi\u2019s name and added a clarification to its report. The Times of India, however, failed to do so, giving rise to the recent deluge of misinformation.\n\nBoth the article and TOI\u2019s tweet are still present on the internet.\n\nShared by users followed by top BJP brass\n\nThe claim that \u2018Sonia Gandhi is richer than Queen Elizbeth-II\u2019 was shared on Twitter by many followed by top BJP leaders. Users Rohini Shah and Voice of Assam were among those who circulated the TOI article and are followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThere were also several other such users who tweeted the claim ( 1 4 ) and are followed by the office of railway minister Piyush Goyal.\n\nThe rumours circulating on social media are based on a 6-year-old misreport. There is no conclusive evidence or data that proves Sonia Gandhi\u2019s net worth is between $2-19 billion, higher than that of the Queen of England.", "lang": "en"}
