It cast the percentage decline as tentative and requiring additional research: \u201cFrom the President\u2019s inauguration in January 2017 through February 2019, initial market data suggests that the total amount of opioids being prescribed monthly has dropped by 34 percent. While we need more data to confirm this snapshot, it shows we may have succeeded in meeting this [three-year] goal already.\u201d\n\nFirst, two monthly data points are not especially useful to measure long-term progress. We were able to review all of the monthly data, though not publish it. February appears to experience big drops \u2014 it\u2019s the shortest month of the year \u2014 and that happens to be the end point. A three-month rolling average shows a decline, though not as stark as 34 percent.\n\nBut, more important, time did not start with the Trump administration. Opioid prescriptions have been declining for years, having reached a peak in 2010 or 2012, depending on what data set you use. The declines especially began to accelerate after the CDC in March 2016 issued new guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain \u2014 10 months before Trump took the oath of office.\n\nHHS has published quarterly fiscal-year data for MMEs dispensed since the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. It shows that decline really sped up in early 2016, about the time the CDC guidelines were issued. The number of MMEs dispensed has fallen about 30 percent from the second quarter of the 2016 fiscal year (January-March) to the end of 2018.\n\nFinally, we would argue that the president\u2019s pledge was to reduce opioids by one-third in three years dating from his speech in March 2018, because he said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to cut nationwide opioid prescriptions by one-third over the next three years.\u201d We reviewed administration briefings after the speech and news coverage and can find no indication it was anything other than a three-year goal starting in 2018. Reporters identified 2021 as the end date.\n\nThat would mean at least a reduction of 12 billion MMEs \u2014 from 35 billion MMEs a quarter at the time of the speech to 23 billion. Backdating to the start of Trump\u2019s presidency seems to be moving the goal posts, as the decline in MMEs on a monthly scale since Trump\u2019s speech is about 20 percent, not 34 percent.\n\nSharfstein noted that even as prescriptions have begun to shrink in recent years, overdoses have soared. (Recent 12-month rolling provisional CDC data touted by the administration indicates the overdose increase may have plateaued and even begun to decline.) The reasons for this disconnection are in dispute among medical professionals, with some arguing that cutting back on opioid prescriptions may have led some people to switch to heroin or synthetic opioids. Other experts say the data does not support that analysis.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Trump administration deserves credit for the more cautious prescribing of opioids,\u201d said Andrew Kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University. \u201cThe reduction in prescriptions began in 2012 and improved a bit in 2016. Everything we are seeing is trending in the right direction, but no other country prescribes as much as we do.\u201d\n\nThere are several problems with the way the president framed this statistic. He should have indicated the data was tentative, as HHS responsibly did, but instead he suggested that a goal had already been achieved. (As we noted, the goal posts also appear to have been moved.) Moreover, he once again took credit for a trend that started in the Obama administration in part because of actions taken under that administration.", "lang": "en"}
