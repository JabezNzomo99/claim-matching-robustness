This they recommend be given as two spoonfuls daily for 3 days. \n\n\n\n\u201cThe medicine works. The bhang will ensure that all the body agents that cause measles are killed,\u201d one of the women told reporters as she showed them the method. \n\n\n\n\u201cThe bhang particles go deep into the layers of the skin and remove the disease-causing agents,\u201d she explained further.\n\n\n\nCan marijuana cure measles? Africa Check investigated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no\n\n, which is caused by a virus and is highly contagious, a\n\nby the World Health Organisation shows. However, measles can be prevented with a safe and cost-effective vaccine.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2015, vaccination resulted in a 79% drop in measles deaths worldwide, the UN agency stated. Despite this, measles remains one of the leading causes of death in young children, especially those under 5. M\n\nost deaths are caused by complications from the disease, such as encephalitis (an infection that causes brain swelling) and severe diarrhoea.\n\nIn Kenya, marijuana is illegal. However, in recent months lawmakers have\n\nfor it to be decriminalised for medicinal use.\n\nRigorous human trials yet to be done\n\nWhile there is global interest in the use of marijuana to treat a host of conditions, more research is needed,\n\nof carrying out well-designed studies - such as strict legal requirements - it has not yet been rigorously tested in studies involving humans. Most of the early trials are concentrated in Europe and North America.\n\nout of 505 deemed relevant. The review looked at evidence for the use of cannabinoids to treat 11 pre-specified illnesses. (\n\nto support the use of cannabinoids for the treatment of chronic pain and spasticity (unusual muscle stiffness).\n\n\u201cAs part of our review we screened all randomised trials of medical cannabinoids and I'm fairly sure that there were none targeting measles,\u201d\n\n, one of the\n\nreview authors and a senior research fellow at the University of Bristol, told Africa Check.\n\nWhiting, who specialises in reviews, added that there may be\n\nuncontrolled or non-randomised studies out there that she was unaware of\n\ncommissioned by British lawmakers found \u201cgood evidence\u201d for the use of cannabis in managing chronic pain and spasticity. Covering studies published until April 2016, it also found \u201cmoderate\u201d evidence for its use in managing sleep disorders and low appetite.\n\nThis review found varying results for 23 illnesses, but not for measles.\n\nIt is a \u201ctotal myth\u201d that marijuana can cure measles, Kenya\u2019s director of public health, Dr Kepha Ombacho, told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cWhere marijuana is being used, it is for the purpose of managing chronic pain; the cannabinoids in marijuana are a strong painkiller because of their sedative effects on the body,\u201d he said.\n\nThe deputy registrar of the\n\n, Dr Fred Siyoi, told Africa Check the \u201conly thing that will happen if you use marijuana on a child with measles is intoxicating the child. It is not proven that it has any therapeutic effect on measles.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is why we advise people to go for standardised drugs that have already been tried and tested,\u201d he said.\n\nA group of women in the western Kenyan city of Kisumu reportedly use marijuana to treat measles, a highly contagious disease and one of the leading causes of death in children under 5.\n\nWhile there have been recent petitions to decriminalise its use in Kenya, marijuana remains illegal,\n\nThere is currently more global interest in marijuana\u2019s medical value than data to back it up, although two reviews showed evidence that it could relieve pain and reduce\n\n. However, mass human trials are yet to be done to determine whether marijuana\u2019s medicinal use outweighs its known risks.\n\nExperts said the effectiveness of marijuana as a home therapy to cure measles is unproven.
