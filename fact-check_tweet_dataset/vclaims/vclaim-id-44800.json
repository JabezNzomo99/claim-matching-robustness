Many posts present the information as \u201chealth bulletins\u201d from the officials in Canada or the Philippines. However, authorities have issued no such advice.\n\nThe posts have been shared thousands of times on Facebook -- we\u2019ve archived some of them here, here and here.\n\n\u201cDOH Health Bulletin to the Public\u201d, reads one post, which claims to represent a medical laboratory in the Philippines, referring to the country\u2019s Department of Health.\n\n\u201cCanadian Department of Health Bulletin. Pls tell ur families, relatives and friends,\u201d reads another post on a Facebook page called \u201cDr. Kiddy\u201d, which offers \u201ctips about kids health\u201d.\n\nThe posts go on to recommend drinking warm water to prevent coronavirus, which has killed hundreds of people and spread around the world since emerging in a Chinese market at the end of last year.\n\n\u201cThe prevention method now is to keep your throat moist, do not let your throat dry up\u201d, read the posts, which all resemble each other almost word for word.\n\n\u201cDrink 50-80cc warm water, 30-50cc for kids, according to age. Every time you feel your throat is dry, do not wait, keep water in hand\u201d, they say.\n\nSimilar advice has been circulating on WhatsApp and Facebook in India, purportedly issued by the country\u2019s health ministry, India Today reported last week.\n\nAlthough drinking water is generally regarded as a good thing for health, AFP found no evidence that authorities have recommended it as a safeguard against coronavirus.\n\nHealth Canada -- the country\u2019s public health service -- told AFP they did not issue the advice in the Facebook posts. They offer tips on their website on preventing coronavirus infection, but they do not mention drinking water.\n\nAFP found no trace of the advice on the Philippines\u2019 health department website, including on an information page on coronavirus. The website issues a warning urging the public to \u201csource information only from official DOH channels and social media accounts\u201d.\n\nThe World Health Organization\u2019s advice on limiting the risk of infection includes frequently washing hands, coughing and sneezing into a tissue and avoiding close contact with anyone who has fever and cough.\n\nAs well as drinking water, the Facebook posts give other recommendations, such as staying away from crowded places \u201ctill end of March\u201d. However, scientists have not been able to predict how long the epidemic will last.\n\nThe SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic -- which killed 774 after emerging in Guangdong in southern China in 2002 -- was stemmed after several months thanks to strict hygiene controls and a global mobilisation.", "lang": "en"}
