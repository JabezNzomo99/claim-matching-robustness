Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Photo of Murli Manohar Joshi offering sweets to PM Modi to celebrate the commencement of construction of Ram mandir in Ayodhya. Fact: The photo in the post is not related to any recent event. The photo was taken just after BJP\u2019s victory in the 2019 General Elections. It was taken when PM Modi along with Amit shah went to meet BJP veteran leaders L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi to take their blessings. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for the image with keywords, FACTLY has found that the image shown in the post is an old one and is not related to the commencement of the construction of Ram mandir recently. In 2019, following the landslide victory in 17th Lok Sabha elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with Amit shah went to meet BJP veteran leaders L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi to take their blessings. For the great victory in the General Elections, Joshi congratulated Modi by offering him, sweets. PM Modi shared some photos of his meeting with L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi on his official Twitter account and thanked for their blessings.\n\nOn 09 November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ordered the government to create a trust to build the Ram mandir temple and form a board of trustees in three months. Following the Supreme Court orders, the government has established \u2018Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust\u2019 on 5 February 2020 and elected Mahant Nritya Gopal Das as the Chairman of the committee. On 26 May, Mahant Nritya Gopal Das announced that the construction of Ram mandir began. Ahead of the start of the construction work, he performed Ram Lallal\u2019s darshan and offered pooja. On 10 June, the official construction commencement ceremony will be conducted after an elaborate \u2018Rudra Abhishek Ceremony\u2019.\n\nTo sum it up, an image of Joshi congratulating PM Modi for his landslide victory in the 2019 General Elections is falsely shared as a celebration on the commencement of construction of Ram mandir in Ayodhya.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
