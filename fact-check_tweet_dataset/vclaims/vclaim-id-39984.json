Jeremy Corbyn has also tweeted a video featuring himself, by-election candidate Lisa Forbes and Mr Mahmood (as well as other local campaigners and members of the public) on the same day.\n\nLabour won the by-election by 683 votes after the former Labour MP Fiona Onasanya was ousted from her seat after a successful recall petition. Ms Onasanya was sentenced in January for perverting the course of justice after lying to the courts over a speeding ticket . She served four weeks in prison of a three month sentence.\n\nFollowing the 2019 by-election, the Brexit Party, which came second, called for an investigation into rumours of alleged electoral fraud. It was claimed that Mr Mahmood acted as an electoral agent for Labour, a claim which the party denied.\n\nCambridgeshire police investigated five allegations of electoral fraud and found that no offences had been committed.", "lang": "en"}
