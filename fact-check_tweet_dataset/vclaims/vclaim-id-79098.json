Spokesman Josh Schwerin pointed to Cuccinelli\u2019s support of personhood bills in and that would have granted legal rights to human embryos from the moment of conception. Those bills, he said, would have banned all abortions.\n\nCuccinelli, as we\u2019ve , did support personhood bills. But that doesn\u2019t mean he opposes abortion in every circumstance. Since his for the state Senate in 2002, he has backed a narrow exception for abortions in cases where a mother\u2019s life would be endangered by remaining pregnant.\n\nCuccinelli\u2019s position was well known to McAuliffe\u2019s campaign. In a Sept. 17 announcing the ad and justifying its claims, McAuliffe\u2019s camp noted that during a 2009 debate, \"Cuccinelli said he would support abortion only when the woman\u2019s life was at risk.\"\n\nWhile researching another abortion-related claim this summer, we asked Cuccinelli\u2019s camp if the candidate still carved out that lone exception. His advisers declined to answer.\n\nThe Cuccinelli campaign did, however, confirm for and , earlier this month that the candidate still holds that abortions should be allowed only to save a mother\u2019s life. Both organizations published articles containing the information about a week before McAuliffe\u2019s commercial debuted.\n\nStatistics are not available for the number of abortions that are performed to save the life of a mother. Neither the Guttmacher Institute nor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collect such data.\n\nGuttmacher, in a 2004, conducted a of 1,209 abortion patients. Four percent of the women cited personal health problems as the chief reason they were having an abortion.\n\nMcAuliffe\u2019s ad says, \"Cuccinelli wants to make all abortion illegal, even in cases of rape and incest, even to protect a woman\u2019s health.\"\n\nCuccinelli is an adamant opponent of abortion, but he has consistently supported one rare exception: Allowing abortion when a mother\u2019s life is endangered by pregnancy. His position was known to McAuliffe\u2019s campaign and incongruously cited in its news release announcing the ad.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to overstate Cuccinelli\u2019s objections to abortion, but McAuliffe\u2019s ad manages to do just that. We rate the claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
