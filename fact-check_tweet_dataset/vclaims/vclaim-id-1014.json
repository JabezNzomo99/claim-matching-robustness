This is not true.\n\nThe death of Floyd - an unarmed black man who was killed after a white police officer knelt on his neck - has triggered violent protests across the United States.\n\nThe post includes an image of an apparent tweet sent from Trump\u2019s official account on May 29, stating: \u201cI spoke with George Floyd\"s family. There voices told me they were honored to hear from me. I told them that I don't want to see another black man die by a knee to the neck. It looked to painful. There's better ways to die. No way is good, but that was very bad.\u201d ( here )\n\nThe tweet is not legitimate. It does not appear on Trump\u2019s timeline on May 29, nor does it appear in Twitter searches for posts with this wording.\n\nAccording to Politwoops, a project that archives deleted tweets from politicians, the tweet has also not been deleted from his page ( here ).\n\nTrump did say that he had spoken with the family of George Floyd during an event at the White House on May 29. He added that \u201cwe can\u2019t allow\u201d the demonstrations in Minneapolis \u201cto descend further into lawless anarchy and chaos.\u201d ( here ).\n\nFalse. Trump did not send a tweet saying that Floyd\u2019s family were honored to hear from him.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
