Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: ABP news reported that eating egg along with banana will lead to poisoning and death. Fact: The fact-check video of ABP news on a viral message (\u2018Eating banana and egg together will lead to death\u2019) has been trimmed to show the opposite. In the full video, ABP news channel explains the viral message at the beginning and later proves that message to be a hoax. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nIn the video, a hashtag \u2018#viralsach\u2019 can be seen at the bottom. So, when searched with keywords \u2018ABP news viral sach on eggs and banana\u2019 on Google, the full-length video of the news reported by ABP news can be found in the search results. The video posted on Facebook has been taken from this video published by ABP news on March 15th 2017 (YouTube) with the title \u2018Viral Sach: Will you die if you eat egg and a banana together?\u2019. This fact-check video of ABP news has been trimmed to show exactly the opposite of what ABP news tried to report. The total duration of the original video was around 5 minutes, in which the reporter reads the viral message at the beginning of the video and later, tries to debunk the fake news. But, only 30 seconds of this video, where the reporter reads the viral message, has been taken from the original video to show that the ABP news reported that \u201cYou will die if you eat egg and banana together\u201d. A fact-check video on a viral fake message has been turned into another fake news.\n\nWill a person die if he eats egg and banana together?
