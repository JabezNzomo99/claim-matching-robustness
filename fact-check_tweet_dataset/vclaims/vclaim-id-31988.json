Much of it originally came from an article by sports writer Nick Gholson for a Texas newspaper in 1999.\n\nRooney, a news commentator, was known for his segment \u201cA Few Minutes with Andy Rooney\u201d on the CBS program \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d (RELATED: \u2018We Are One Election Away From Open Borders, Socialism, Gun Confiscation\u2019 \u2013 Did Tim Allen Make This Statement?)\n\nThis Facebook post alleges that Rooney authored a long statement that defends Christians\u2019 right to prayer and criticizes those who ban it from public events like football games. It\u2019s paired with an image of his likeness.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that Rooney ever wrote or said anything to that effect. No credible sources link him to the statement online, and it doesn\u2019t appear in any of his writings.\n\nRooney has made his views on religion very clear, from poking fun at organized religion in editorials to identifying himself as non-religious in public appearances. During a talk at Tufts University in 2004, Rooney told the crowd that he was an atheist.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand religion at all,\u201d said Rooney. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll offend a lot of people by saying this, but I think it\u2019s all nonsense.\u201d\n\nThe original statement, tracked down by Snopes in 2004, was written in 1999 by Gholson and later republished in the Laurel Leader Call newspaper. It appears that parts of Gholson\u2019s statement have been cut, and lines from another source have been added to form the full statement attributed to Rooney in the Facebook post.\n\nFurther adding to the dubiousness of the attribution, one line references events of \u201c2019/2020,\u201d though Rooney passed away in 2011.", "lang": "en"}
