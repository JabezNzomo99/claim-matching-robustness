However, it was placed in the humor section of stores, not in the children\u2019s section, and the book\u2019s publishers, MacMillan, described the volume as an \u201cadult parody\u201d of a well-known children\u2019s book (and the book bears the descriptor \u201cA Parody\u201d on its cover). Therefore, claims that Barnes & Noble was selling or marketing \u201cIf You Give a Pig the White House\u201d to children, as a children\u2019s book, or in the children\u2019s section were wide of the mark.\n\nMacMillan released \u201cIf You Give a Pig the White House\u201d a book by author Faye Kanouse and illustrator Amy Zhing, in the U.S. on Oct. 1, 2019.\n\n MacMillan described the book as follows:\n\nAs of Oct. 8, the book was being sold by Barnes & Noble, Walmart, Google Play, Apple Books, and on Amazon. Google Play and Apple Books both listed the book\u2019s genre as \u201chumor,\u201d while Amazon placed it under the \u201cparody\u201d category. Walmart\u2019s website listed it in the \u201cpolitics\u201d section of their \u201cfunny books\u201d category. None of those major retailers categorized or marketed \u201cIf You Give a Pig the White House\u201d as a children\u2019s book.\n\nMultiple social media posts in the early days of October criticized the Target general retail chain for purportedly selling the book and included what appeared to be a listing for the book on Target\u2019s website. As of Oct. 8, that web page displayed the message \u201cproduct not available\u201d (although the Target website displays the same message even when the URL in question does not exist or never contained a listing for an actual item).\n\nWe asked Target whether they had ever sold \u201cIf You Give a Pig a White House,\u201d but a spokesperson only stated \u201cTarget does not carry this item.\u201d We made repeated attempts to press Target on whether they had previously sold the book before deciding to no longer offer it (and if so, why they dropped it). We did not receive any further response.\n\nOn their website, Barnes & Noble listed the book in the \u201chumor\u201d section, and that categorization was similar to the chain\u2019s brick and mortar stores across the country. On Oct. 8, we contacted six Barnes & Noble locations across the U.S. by phone, calling outlets in California, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas. Every store we contacted had at least one copy of the book, and every store, without exception, shelved it in the \u201chumor\u201d section and not the children\u2019s section. That data corresponds to a company-wide policy of marketing the book just as MacMillan described it \u2014 as an \u201cadult parody.\u201d\n\nIn the environment of a public book store, customers and browsing members of the public can sometimes pick up books from one section, leaf through them, and then place them in a different section. In this manner, it is possible that in some instances a member of the public might have left or spotted a stray copy of \u201cIf You Give a Pig the White House\u201d in the children\u2019s section of a Barnes & Noble store. However, this would have been an aberration, rather than the result of company policy or any attempt to market or sell the book to children.", "lang": "en"}
