To become law, the legislation must be passed by the full Senate and House of Representatives. Support from two-thirds of senators is needed to overturn a potential veto by Trump.\n\nReporting on the bill, Russia Today, a state-owned agency, quoted the head of a Moscow think tank that advises the Kremlin on U.S. policy.\n\nVladimir Batyuk, head of the Center for Military and Political Research at the State Institute of the U.S. and Canada, said the legislation should be seen as \u201cpart of a titanic battle between American nationalism and American liberal globalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald Trump embodies the first camp, and half of the Americans support him on this issue, believing that the U.S. spends too much [in terms of] manpower and resources on foreign policy,\u201d Batyuk said.\n\nThe Senate committee acted amid uncertainty over Trump\u2019s intentions toward NATO.\n\nIn May 2017, in Brussels, Trump scolded the leaders of fellow NATO member nations for insufficient military spending. As a presidential candidate, Trump suggested the U.S. might not come to the defense of NATO member states which failed to meet guidelines calling on members to spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense.\n\nIn January 2019, The New York Times quoted senior administration sources who claimed Trump privately said he wanted the United States to withdraw from NATO.\n\nVladimir Batyuk\u2019s claims are misleading on several fronts.\n\nFirst, his remark that the Senate committee\u2019s pro-NATO bill was a result of a \u201ctitanic battle\u201d between two opposing camps in U.S. politics ignores the fact that the bill passed unanimously by the committee\u2019s Republicans and Democrats.\n\nSecond, the priority that Americans place on domestic affairs over foreign policy is not exclusive to Trump administration; it has been a decades-long trend with \u201conly modest partisan differences,\u201d polling agencies say.\n\nA Pew Research Center survey conducted in July 2019 found that 69 percent of respondents agreed that, \u201cit is more important for the president to focus on domestic policy than foreign policy.\u201d Only 15 percent supported focusing on foreign policy.\n\nThe result was \u201clittle different\u201d than during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, Pew said.\n\nAs for the implication that half of American support the president\u2019s position on NATO, survey results are mixed.\n\nIn a Pew Research Center survey conducted in March 2019, 77 percent of the respondents -- \u201cincluding large majorities in both parties\u201d -- said being a NATO member was good for the United States. Those numbers were \u201cessentially unchanged from April 2016,\u201d the agency reported.\n\nEarlier, in November 2018, a CBS News poll found that 56 percent said they disapproved of the way Donald Trump was handling relations with U.S. allies in Europe, while 36 percent approved.\n\nIn July 2018, a Quinnipiac University poll found that 78 percent of Americans agreed that, \u201cDonald Trump should defend all of America\u2019s NATO allies, if necessary,\u201d while 16% said he should not.\n\nOn the other hand, a YouGov survey released in April 2019 to commemorate the 70th anniversary of NATO found that only 44 percent support U.S. membership in alliance down 3 percentage points from 2017. Ten percent opposed NATO membership and 29 percent were undecided.\n\nIn an October 2017 Pew Research Center survey of Americans, 48 percent of the respondents said NATO was not doing enough to help solve world problems.\n\nIn addition, polls have shown a change in partisan attitudes toward Russia in the United States \u2013 a significant factor, given that NATO was created to defend Europe against the Soviet Union.\n\nIn the July 2019 Pew poll cited above, 65 percent of Democrats said Russia\u2019s power and influence were major threats to U.S. well-being, while only 35 percent of Republicans said the same thing.", "lang": "en"}
