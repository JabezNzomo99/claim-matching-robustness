An article published by The Times of India on August 20, 2018, stated, \u201cA young boy, who claimed to be from minority community, is seen tearing a paper tricolor in the video. Police traced the boy and another teenager from Amroli and called them to police station along with their family members.\u201d\n\nIn a statement given to Alt News, G.A. Patel, Police Inspector, Amroli police station(Surat) clarified, \u201cBoth the teenagers are friends and belong to the Hindu community. The boys have also apologised for acting childishly.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs it turns out, two boys from the Hindu community, as part of a prank, made a video of themselves tearing the Indian flag and proclaimed that they are from the Muslim community. The video has been widely shared, which is not surprising considering the provocative nature of the content. Teenagers indulging in such divisive pranks is a reflection of the religious polarisation in the Indian society.", "lang": "en"}
