Col. Tim Garland described the scene on the ground during the nearly three-hour assault. According to the AFP story, \u201cTwo soldiers who had been in guard towers were blown out of their positions but only suffered concussion, the commander said.\u201d\n\nThe full extent of the injuries suffered that night was first reported by Defense One on Jan. 16, including details that the injuries were severe enough that 11 service members were medically evacuated to U.S. military hospitals in Kuwait and Germany. According to the Post, \u201cAt least two dozen soldiers were treated for concussions at the base, a U.S. official said.\u201d\n\nThe injuries were confirmed in a statement from Central Command on Jan. 17.\n\n\u201cWhile no U.S. service members were killed in the Jan. 8 Iranian attack on Al Asad Air base, several were treated for concussion symptoms from the blast and are still being assessed,\u201d according to the statement from Capt. Bill Urban, spokesman for U.S. Central Command. \u201cAs a standard procedure, all personnel in the vicinity of a blast are screened for traumatic brain injury, and if deemed appropriate are transported to a higher level of care. In the days following the attack, out of an abundance of caution, some service members were transported from Al Asad Air Base, Iraq to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, others were sent to Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, for follow-on screening. When deemed fit for duty, the service members are expected to return to Iraq following screening. \u2026 At this time, eight individuals have been transported to Landstuhl, and three have been transported to Camp Arifjan.\u201d\n\nThat announcement differs from earlier Defense Department reports and repeated statements from the president that the missile attack, launched by Iran in retaliation for the U.S. killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, resulted in no injuries to U.S. or coalition forces housed at the Iraqi bases.\n\nIn his first official statement a day after the attack, Trump said on Jan. 8, \u201cI\u2019m pleased to inform you: The American people should be extremely grateful and happy no Americans were harmed in last night\u2019s attack by the Iranian regime. We suffered no casualties, all of our soldiers are safe, and only minimal damage was sustained at our military bases.\u201d\n\nThe following day, on Jan. 9, Trump repeated that message two more times.\n\nIn remarks to the press, Trump said, \u201cIran went in, and they hit us with missiles. Shouldn\u2019t have done that, but they hit us. Fortunately for them, nobody was hurt, nobody was killed. Nothing happened. They landed \u2014 and very little damage even, to the base.\u201d And in an interview with WTVG 13abc News, Trump said, \u201cWe were very happy when we learned, not only weren\u2019t any \u2014 nobody was killed, but nobody was even hurt, and they landed in areas that were very good, as far as I was concerned. So you had 16 [missiles], I think four of them didn\u2019t reach the location and the other \u2014 the other 12 were \u2014 they didn\u2019t hit, perhaps they didn\u2019t want to hit, or something happened, but there was nobody hurt, nobody injured, and I think I was very happily surprised.\u201d\n\nDuring a rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Jan. 14, Trump said he was told no one was hurt or killed.\n\n\u201cAnd we saw those missiles launch and they were big and they were fast and they were accurate,\u201d Trump said. \u201cFour of them went bad, they fell way short, but 12 of them hit, and I said, \u2018Man they are quick.\u2019 They knew immediately what they were and they saw those missiles hit. I said \u2018How bad is it?\u2019 It hit a base and an hour later or so, we get a callback. I said, \u2018How many killed?\u2019 \u2018Nobody, sir.\u2019 I said, \u2018How many hurt?\u2019 They said, \u2018Nobody, sir.'\u201d\n\nThose comments echo ones coming from the Defense Department.\n\nIn a press briefing on Jan. 8, the day after the attack, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said, \u201cThe current BDA [Battle Damage Assessment] is, if you will, again, we can get you details, things like tentage, taxiways, the parking lot, a damaged helicopter, things like that; nothing that I would describe as major, at least as I note at this point in time. So that\u2019s the state of \u2014 of the attack at this point as we know it. Most importantly, no casualties, no friendly causalities, whether they are U.S., coalition, contractor, et cetera.\u201d\n\nCasualties include those who are killed or injured.\n\nBut Trump and Esper made those statements before they knew about the injuries, the Pentagon now says.\n\nPentagon press secretary Alyssa Farah told reporters on Jan. 17 that some of the service members did not report symptoms until several days after the attack, ABC News reported.\n\n\u201cThe symptoms of suspected TBI [traumatic brain injury] often do not fully materialize themselves until days after an injury and thus often require continued monitoring and follow on care,\u201d Farah said.\n\nPentagon officials on Jan. 17 said Esper was only notified on Jan. 16 that some service members suffered traumatic brain injuries. According to Pentagon officials, Esper then directed the department to inform White House staff about the evacuations and to release the information publicly.\n\nAccording to ABC News, \u201c[O]fficials said the president was likely not aware of the service members with TBI symptoms. Injuries reported up the chain of command are those deemed life-threatening or if an individual loses a limb or eyesight. Given those reporting requirements, TBI would not meet the threshold for the Pentagon to be notified of the injuries, and that\u2019s why the department was only told on Thursday, officials said.\u201d\n\nRegardless of what the president knew and when, we can say that the initial assessment that there were no injuries now appears to have been inaccurate.\n\nUpdate, Jan. 24: Asked about the discrepancy between his comments that there were no injuries in the attack and Pentagon reports that 11 U.S. service members were airlifted due to concussion symptoms, Trump told reporters on Jan. 22, \u201cNo, I heard that they had headaches, and a couple of other things. But I would say, and I can report it is not very serious. Not very serious.\u201d Trump said he was told about the injuries \u201cnumerous days\u201d after the bombing and added that he did not \u201cconsider them very serious injuries, relative to other injuries that I\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 24, Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman told reporters that 34 U.S. service members were diagnosed with \u201cconcussions and TBI [traumatic brain injury]\u201d after Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack in Iraq, the Washington Post reported. According to Hoffman, eight service members who were airlifted to medical facilities in Germany have since returned to the United States for further medical treatment, and nine others remain in Germany. The other 17 were diagnosed with concussions and have returned to duty, he said.", "lang": "en"}
