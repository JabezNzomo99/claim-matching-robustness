This claim is false.\n\nExamples of such posts can be found here , here and here .\n\nThe late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges involving dozens of underage girls at his mansions in New York City and Palm Beach, Florida, following his arrest on July 6, 2019. He had escaped federal prosecution by pleading guilty in 2008 to Florida state prostitution charges, an agreement now widely considered too lenient. Epstein was found dead in his cell at the Manhattan Detention Complex on August 10, 2019.\n\nThe financier once counted President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, Duke of York, as friends. None of them have been charged with criminal wrongdoing ( here ). The private planes used by Epstein to travel to his Caribbean island, Little Saint James in the U.S. Virgin Islands, has been referred to in the media as the \u201cLolita Express\u201d ( here ).\n\nIn July 2019, the New York Times reported that the pilots who flew Epstein\u2019s jets, including flights to his island in the Caribbean, had released records of flight logs from 1995 to 2013 including names of those who had traveled on the planes ( here ).\n\nCopies of these flight logs can be seen online, uploaded by Gawker.com here and by Factcheck.org here . Business Insider has also provided a searchable database of every known flight made by Jeffrey Epstein's private planes, available here for subscribers.\n\nReuters could not find Hanks\u2019 name or initials in the flight log documents.\n\nThe Reuters Fact Check team previously debunked a claim circulating on social media that Bill Gates had also traveled to Epstein\u2019s island multiple times ( here ).\n\nFalse. Tom Hanks\u2019s name does not appear in Epstein\u2019s flight logs.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
