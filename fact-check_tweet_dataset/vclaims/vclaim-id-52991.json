This patent is not owned by Bill Gates nor by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, but by the Pirbright Institute in the UK, which aimed to develop a vaccine against IBV.\n\nThis misinformation seems to have spread as the foundation has funded some of the Pirbright Institute\u2019s work, although not for this patented work.\n\nThere is not yet an effective Covid-19 vaccine, although trials of potential vaccines are ongoing. So neither Bill Gates nor the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation own the patent for a Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nThe foundation has funded a number of organisations in their work on creating a Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nWhat about the Wuhan lab?\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what exactly the post means when it claims Bill Gates is \u201ca partner\u201d in \u201cthe Lab in Wuhan China\u201d.\n\nIt could refer to the fact that there have been claims that the new coronavirus may have originated in bats kept in a Chinese government laboratory in Wuhan, the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. But the scientists who claimed this did so in a paper that had not been peer reviewed. They proposed it as a possibility, but did not provide any evidence that this was the case.\n\nAs we have discussed before, there\u2019s no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 originated in a lab in Wuhan, the city in China where the new disease was first detected.\n\nThe Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention is part of China\u2019s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, which has received funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, but Bill Gates can hardly be called a \u201cpartner\u201d in the laboratory.\n\nAlso the vast majority of scientists agree that the virus was not man-made.", "lang": "en"}
