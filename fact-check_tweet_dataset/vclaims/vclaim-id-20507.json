Military experts expressed doubt about the Russian defense ministry\u2019s satellite photos, saying the precision type of strikes shown in the them are not characteristic of strikes conducted by Russian aviation.\n\nNobody from IS has responded yet to the Russian claims either confirming or denying al-Baghdadi\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t al-Baghdadi released an audio message to refute the rumors of his death? It could be as simple as keeping his enemy guessing while he stays in hiding elsewhere,\u201d Martin Reardon, a senior vice president with The Soufan Group, a strategic security and intelligence consultancy, told Polygraph.info via email from Doha, Qatar.\n\n\u201cKeep in mind that after his reported death as the result of a U.S. airstrike a year ago, al-Baghdadi waited several months before sending out an audio message confirming he was still alive last November,\u201d Reardon said. \u201cIncidentally, that\u2019s the last time we\u2019ve heard from him. Al-Baghdadi, and the senior ISIS leaders, know they are targets, so for survivability purposes, are seen or heard from only when absolutely necessary.\u201d\n\nMultiple Iranian news agencies, however, distributed photos allegedly showing \u201cthe corpse of al-Baghdadi\u201d after he was killed in a Russian airstrike this past May. Besides state TV, the conservative Iranian news agency Shafaqna posted such photos.\n\nThese Iranian photo reports have been picked up and distributed widely by Russian media.\n\nHowever, there is one big problem when it comes to the accuracy of these reports: the same photos have been circulating around the Internet since 2014.\n\nThe Iranian news aggregator Namnak posted these very same pictures on June 25, 2016. It claimed the photos were of the corpse of al-Baghdadi, but that he had been killed in a \u201cWestern coalition airstrike.\u201d\n\nEven earlier, in November 2014, the India News television channel broadcast the same photos, saying they showed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi not dead, but \u201cinjured.\u201d\n\nPolygraph.info was able to track down the origins of these photographs to the Islamic State Twitter account Al-I\u2019tisaam, which has been inactive since at least 2014.\n\n\u201cRecent reporting that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed during a late May 2017 Russian airstrike in Raqqa \u2013 along with over 300 other \u2018terrorists\u2019 \u2013 have still not been verified with any credible intelligence from either Russia, Iran, the U.S. or other intelligence services,\u201d Reardon said. \u201cInternet photos of what are claimed to be al-Baghdadi\u2019s body are also suspect at this point, as they can be easily doctored.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
