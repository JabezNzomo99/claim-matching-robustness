In the European Union, naled is not authorized for use as a pesticide; it carries warning labels indicating that it is a toxin and an irritant, though these effects occur at higher concentrations than would be expected from mosquito spraying.\n\nOn 13 September 2017, the Harris County Department of Public Health announced that a program of aerial spraying would begin the following day in order to counteract the risk posed by mosquitoes, which had been present in unusually large numbers in the surface water left behind by Hurricane Harvey:\n\nA spokesperson for the Harris County Department of Public Health told us that the spraying was officially scheduled to continue through 20 September 2017. The announcement continues:\n\nDibrom is a brand name for naled, the chemical highlighted in the Stranger Than Fiction Facebook video. The federal Environment Protection Agency (EPA) says of naled:\n\nWhen applied according to label instructions, EPA does not expect the use of naled for public health mosquito control to raise a human health concern. People are unlikely to breathe in amounts large enough or touch anything with enough insecticide on it to harm them. However, anyone who is concerned because of an existing health problem should talk to their doctor. Also, people who tend to be sensitive to chemicals in general, including household chemicals, could experience short-term effects, such as skin, eye, and nose irritation.\n\nNaled\u2019s classification as a neurotoxin stems from its ability to cause cholinesterase depression, a harmful lowering of the levels of cholinesterase, an enzyme important to the functioning of nervous system. (In fact, that\u2019s how naled works: it lowers cholinesterase in insects to a level that proves fatal to them.) Again, these effects \u2014 which have primarily been investigated using animal studies \u2014 are not relevant to the concentrations found during mosquito spraying.\n\nThe primary research on pesticides and cholinesterase depression in humans revolves around farmworkers or other groups who are exposed to pesticides on a daily basis, and at much higher concentrations than the \u201cultra low-volume\u201d mist involved in aerial mosquito spraying, especially by the time that spray reaches the ground. An Environmental Protection Agency spokesperson told us that they have taken the risks into consideration:\n\nEPA has estimated the exposure and risk to both adults and children posed by ultra-low volume aerial and ground application of naled. Because of the very small amount of active ingredient released per acre of ground, exposures were below an amount that might pose a health concern. These estimates assumed several spraying events over a period of weeks, and also assumed that a toddler would consume some soil and grass in addition to skin and inhalation exposure. Because naled is applied at ultra-low volumes, low rates and does not persist in the environment, when applied according to label instructions, EPA does not expect the use of naled for public health mosquito control to raise a human health concern. People are unlikely to breathe in amounts large enough or touch anything with enough insecticide on it to harm them.\n\nDr Jeffrey G. Scott, a professor of entomology at Cornell University, told us:\n\nOn the whole, the claims made in the \u201cStranger Than Fiction\u201d video (seeking as it does to warn viewers that authorities in Houston, Texas are spraying a \u201cdeadly\u201d neurotoxin that \u201ccauses brain damage\u201d) are mostly false. It\u2019s true that the Harris County Department of Public Health, in collaboration with the United States Air Force, did spray naled over the county in September 2017, and naled is an organophosphate pesticide which kills insects by lethally suppressing their nervous system (i.e. is a neurotoxin).\n\nHowever, authorities in Harris County did not warn residents to wear gas masks during spraying, and the risk of neurotoxic damage to humans is largely limited to close exposure to naled in high concentrations \u2014 not the type of exposure expected in aerial spraying, which uses naled at an \u201cultra-low volume\u201d and involves significant dissipation of the chemical by the time it reaches the ground.", "lang": "en"}
