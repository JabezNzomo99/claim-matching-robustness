To combat this problem Congress approved a program and NASA scientists spent a decade and over $165 million developing a pen that writes in zero gravity, upside down, on almost any surface and at temperatures ranging from below freezing to over 300 Celsius. The Russians used a pencil...Your taxes are due again in April.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWhile the claim makes for a good story, it has been debunked several times over.\n\nAccording to NASA, both U.S. astronauts and Soviet Union cosmonauts used pencils on their first space missions.\n\nIn fact, NASA ordered 34 mechanical pencils from Houston\u2019s Tycam Engineering Manufacturing, Inc., for Project Gemini, the agency\u2019s second human spaceflight program, which flew in 1965 and 1966. The total cost, however, came to $4,382.50 \u2014 or $128.89 a pencil.\n\nPublic outcry followed, and NASA began searching for a cheaper option for future flights. (NASA also became especially cautious about allowing onboard flammable objects such as pencils after a fire broke out in 1967 on the Apollo 1 test mission, killing three astronauts.)\n\nIt was around the same time that Paul C. Fisher and his company, the Fisher Pen Co., designed a ballpoint pen that would operate better in space.\n\nThe company reportedly invested about $1 million in the effort. But none of those funds came from NASA or Congress, according to multiple sources, including NASA and a spokesperson for Fisher\u2019s company, now called Fisher Space Pen. In 1965, Fisher patented the Space Pen, which used a pressurized ink cartridge and could write upside down, underwater, in other liquids and in extreme temperatures ranging from minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nBecause of the earlier controversy, though, NASA reports in its own account that it was \"hesitant in its approach.\"\n\nAfter a series of tests, NASA managers agreed to equip astronauts with Fisher\u2019s anti-gravity ballpoint pen and, in 1967, the space agency purchased approximately 400 pens at $6 per unit.\n\nIn 1969, the Soviet Union also purchased 100 of Fisher\u2019s pens, and 1,000 ink cartridges, for use in its Soyuz space flights. According to Scientific American, eventually NASA and the Soviet space agency both bought the pens at $2.39 per pen, receiving the same discount for buying in bulk.\n\nIn the 50 years since, both American astronauts and Soviet/Russian cosmonauts have continued to use Fisher\u2019s pens.\n\nAn old myth that NASA and Congress spent over \"$165 million\" to develop the space pen while the Russians simply used pencils has recently resurfaced on the internet.\n\nInitially, both space programs used pencils. Both eventually started to use Fisher\u2019s Space Pen, which was developed and funded with private money, not government money.", "lang": "en"}
