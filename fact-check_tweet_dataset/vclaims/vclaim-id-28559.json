Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Video shows protest against CAA and NRC in Gulbarga. Fact: The same video with entirely different audio can be found to be in circulation since 2016. The video is related to Samastha\u2019s 90th Anniversary Conference. The event in the video happened in Kerala. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Yandex Reverse Image Search, many similar YouTube videos can be found in the search results. One of them had the title as \u2018Mailadiyal Samastha 90th at Alleppey conference\u2019. Also, on the posted video, the logo of \u2018SKICR TV\u2019 can be seen.\n\nSo, when searched with the keywords on the YouTube channel of \u2018SKICR TV\u2019, the video of the event streamed live on 14t February 2016 was found. Similar visuals as seen in the posted video can also be seen in the \u2018SKICR TV\u2019 video.\n\nOn the posted video, a Tik Tok username \u2013 @zakariya_abdulla can be seen. When searched on Tik Tok, it can be found that the user has posted the video, without the \u2018Dakia News\u2019 logo, on his account. A Facebook user with the same name \u2018Zakariya Bin Abdulla\u2019 has also posted the same video on his account on 15th December 2019. But the same user has also posted the same video with entirely different audio on 16th February 2016 with the title \u2013 \u2018Samastha sammelanam.! Speech Panakkad haidarali thangal\u2026\u2019. So, an old video is being shared again with different audio.\n\nThe photos related to the 2016 event can be seen here. In an article published by \u2018The Hindu\u2019 in December-2015, it can be read that \u2018the valedictory of the Samastha\u2019s 90th-anniversary celebrations would be held at Alappuzha in Kerala from February 11 to February 14\u2019. While it is true that there were some protests in Gulbarga, the video posted is an old video from Kerala.\n\nTo sum it up, an old video is being falsely shared as \u2018protest against CAA and NRC in Gulbarga\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
