But legislation shows that Democrats support border security measures, though not the border wall he wants to build.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats want open borders. They want anybody they wanted, including MS-13, pouring into the country.\u201d \u2014 President Trump, speaking on Monday at a campaign rally in South Carolina Democrats have argued that building a wall on the southwestern border is ineffective and a waste of resources, and rejected hard-line proposals to limit legal immigration. But Mr. Trump is grossly exaggerating Democrats\u2019 positions when he conflates their opposition to his signature campaign promise and immigration priorities as \u201copen borders.\u201d And there is no evidence that they \u201cwant anybody,\u201d including MS-13, to enter the United States freely. While criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies, the Democratic National Committee has committed to improving border security. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leaders, have rebutted the president\u2019s charges. Additionally, their aides cited several examples of legislation that are supported by Democrats and would have provided border security funding.\n\n\u201cWe care about protecting our country, but we don\u2019t think we need to protect the border by putting children in cages,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. \u201cWe want to be smart and strong \u2014 not reckless, rash and ruthless in this case.\u201d Thirty Democrats in the House have sponsored a bipartisan immigration bill this year that gives the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers a pathway to citizenship. It also enhances technology used to monitor the border, and provides $110 million in grants annually for collaboration between local law enforcement and Border Patrol agents. All 193 Democrats in the House and 23 moderate Republicans have signed a \u201cdischarge\u201d petition to force a vote on that bill and other immigration proposals. In the Senate, all but one Democrat voted for similar immigration legislation sponsored by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware.\n\nAnd all but three Democrats voted for yet another bipartisan proposal to provide a pathway to citizenship to Dreamers, authorize $25 billion to build barriers and hire personnel at the border over the next decade. It would also prohibit green-card holders from sponsoring adult children. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary, repeated the assertion on Monday and argued that Democrats have \u201cmade it very clear that they don\u2019t want to work with the president, that they don\u2019t want to fix our immigration system\u201d \u2014 referring to the political impasse over immigration reform. The vast majority of Senate Democrats, and 14 Republicans, voted down a White House-backed Senate proposal that would enable the Department of Homeland Security to make more arrests and deportations, limit family-based immigration, and eliminate the diversity visa lottery. House Democrats have also suggested opposition to a new measure that will also limit legal immigration. But rejecting these proposals does not amount to opposing any enforcement of immigration laws or allowing anyone, including criminals and gang members, to enter the country without restrictions. Democrats also consistently supported border security measures before Mr. Trump took office. In 2013, every single Democrat in the Senate voted for the so-called Gang of Eight immigration overhaul bill that would have provided about $40 billion for border enforcement, including deploying thousands more agents and building 700 miles of fencing. (The House never voted on the bill.) And in 2006, 26 Senate Democrats voted to build 700 miles of walls and fences on the southwestern border. Mr. Schumer was among the Democrats who supported that proposal \u2014 a fact that even Mr. Trump has repeatedly acknowledged, as recently as last week.
