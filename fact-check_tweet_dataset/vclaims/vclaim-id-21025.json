Lamar Smith said that, after national security agencies, \u201cNASA received the most favorable budget request from the Trump administration.\u201d True, but President Donald Trump\u2019s 2018 proposal would still cut NASA\u2019s budget by about 3 percent compared with the agency\u2019s enacted budget for 2017.\n\nSmith, the chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space & Technology, made his claim during a hearing on planetary missions. He said the president\u2019s proposed budget would allow NASA to undertake \u201ca bold and ambitious agenda.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s budget is a proposal that Congress will consider in passing its own funding appropriations bills.\n\nWe reached out to Smith\u2019s office for clarification on what the chairman meant by \u201cmost favorable.\u201d The House science committee\u2019s press secretary, Thea McDonald, pointed us to a May 23 Washington Post article.\n\nAccording to the newspaper, Trump\u2019s 2018 budget proposal would cut NASA\u2019s budget by roughly 1 percent \u2014 from about $19.2 billion to about $19.1 billion \u2014 the smallest reduction among the agencies that would receive cuts. Trump proposed increasing funding only for the Departments of Veteran Affairs, Homeland Security and Defense, the Post reported.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s proposed fiscal 2018 budget, which was released May 23, was prepared before Congress enacted a final budget for fiscal 2017. Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017 earlier in May that set NASA\u2019s budget at $19.7 billion for fiscal year 2017.\n\nComparing the enacted 2017 budget and Trump\u2019s 2018 proposal, NASA\u2019s funding would see roughly a 3 percent decrease.\n\nAccording to the president\u2019s budget blueprint released in March, the $19.1 billion would cancel the Asteroid Redirect Mission, which NASA says aims to develop the \u201cfirst-ever robotic mission to visit a large near-Earth asteroid, collect a multi-ton boulder from its surface, and redirect it into a stable orbit around the moon.\u201d The ultimate goal is to advance \u201cnew technologies and spaceflight experience needed for a human mission to the Martian system in the 2030s,\u201d according to NASA.\n\nTrump\u2019s proposal also would eliminate four of NASA\u2019s Earth science missions \u2014 PACE, OCO-3, DSCOVR and CLARREO \u2014 which, among other things, further scientists\u2019 understanding of climate change.\n\u2022 PACE aims to study \u201cinteractions between the ocean and atmosphere, including how they exchange carbon dioxide and how atmospheric aerosols might fuel phytoplankton growth in the surface ocean,\u201d says NASA.\n\u2022 OCO-3 is a \u201cfuture space instrument designed to investigate important questions about the distribution of carbon dioxide on Earth as it relates to growing urban populations and changing patterns of fossil fuel combustion,\u201d explains the agency.\n\u2022 DSCOVR, a collaboration with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Air Force, helps provide accurate space weather forecasts by observing changes in solar wind. Solar wind consists of particles that flow from the sun and contain its magnetic field. According to NOAA, \u201cspace weather has demonstrated the potential to disrupt virtually every major public infrastructure system, including transportation systems, power grids, telecommunications and GPS.\u201d\n\u2022 CLARREO aims to \u201cproduce highly accurate climate records to test climate projections in order to improve models and enable sound policy decisions,\u201d says NASA.\n\nTrump\u2019s 2018 budget proposal also decreases funding for Earth science research grants and eliminates NASA\u2019s Office of Education, and instead focuses on education efforts in other parts of the agency.\n\nThe president\u2019s budget plan does say it would create \u201cnew opportunities for collaboration with industry\u201d and would continue to provide funding for the development of NASA\u2019s Space Launch System, which is a \u201cvehicle for a new era of exploration beyond Earth\u2019s orbit into deep space.\u201d\n\nSmith is entitled to his opinion that Trump\u2019s proposed budget will allow NASA to undertake a \u201cbold and ambitious agenda.\u201d But he spins the facts in saying that, other than national security agencies, \u201cNASA received the most favorable budget request from the Trump administration,\u201d when Trump\u2019s proposal calls for cutting NASA\u2019s spending and eliminating programs.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting, as the House science committee press secretary pointed out to us, that the House appropriations committee has proposed $19.9 billion in funding for NASA, which is about $200 million more than NASA\u2019s enacted budget for 2017 and $700 million more than requested by Trump.", "lang": "en"}
