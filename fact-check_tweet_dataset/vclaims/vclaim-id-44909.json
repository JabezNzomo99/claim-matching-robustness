Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is fake.\n\nA video going viral on social media shows a man claiming that coronavirus can be cured by consuming pigeon membrane slurry. The man claims: \u201cI have perfect cure for coronavirus. These pigeons you find everywhere. Take the pota (undigested food from the inside of the intestinal(?) sack of the pigeons) and then take the fluids from stomach membranes of three pigeons and cook both and drink that water. You will never get coronavirus.\u201d The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nWe read the comments of the post and many users have commented that the post is fake.\n\nOn the myth-buster page of World Health Organization (WHO) it has been mentioned that while several drug trials are ongoing, there is currently no proof any drug can cure or prevent COVID-19. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop and evaluate medicines to treat COVID-19.\n\nAs per WHO, there is no currently available vaccine for COVID-19. However, many of the symptoms can be treated and getting early care from a healthcare provider can make the disease less dangerous. There are several clinical trials that are being conducted to evaluate potential therapeutics for COVID-19.\n\nWe investigated further and tried finding out scientific studies based on the purported pigeon remedy and coronavirus. There is no scientific basis for this treatment.\n\nWe earlier fact-checked a similar post claiming that pigeons can cure hepatitis and cancer. The fact check can be read here.\n\nWe spoke to Dr. Madhusudan Aggarwal, a General Practioner in New Delhi. He said: The viral post is fake. There is no evidence that pigeon membrane can cure coronavirus.\n\nDr Nikhil Modi, Pulmonologist at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, New Delhi also denied the claim calling it fake.\n\nThe post is shared on Twitter by a user named Azam Jamil. We scanned the profile of the user and found that he has 41.6K followers.\n\nDisclaimer: The #CoronavirusFacts database records fact-checks published since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak.
