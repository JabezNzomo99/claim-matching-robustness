With most industries shut due to the lockdown, migrants have demanded that they be sent back home in the absence of work, food and money.\n\nAmid this, a video of a group of people damaging buildings and vehicles is going viral on social media with the claim that the incident took place in Surat, Gujarat, where people are demanding that they be either provided ration or be shot dead.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim along with the viral video is false. The incident is from Kathua in Jammu and Kashmir where workers of a textile mill company took to the streets demanding full wages and arrangements for them to return home.\n\nRight at the beginning of the video, we could figure out \u201cChenab Textile\u201d written on a board on the right-hand corner. We searched the Internet using keywords \u201cChenab Textile protests\u201d and came across this incident.\n\nThe incident is from Kathua in Jammu and Kashmir where protests by workers of Chenab Textile Mills on May 8 turned violent. The protesters, mostly migrants, were demanding full wages and return tickets home.\n\nThe central and state governments have arranged for migrants to return to their states in buses and \u2018Shramik Special\u2019 trains. The protesting workers in Kathua were demanding the same arrangements for them.\n\nWe also came across media reports of the protest where one can see images of the \u201cChenab Textile Mills\u201d board and a broken police vehicle as visible in the viral video.\n\nNews agency \u201cANI\u201d also tweeted photos of the protest.\n\nSurat and Ahmedabad in Gujarat have recently witnessed protests by migrant workers employed in various industries in these districts. Migrants say with factories shut, they have run out of money and food, and hence, arrangements should be made so that they can return home.\n\nMigrants complain that even in these circumstances, their land owners are demanding rents from them. In some cases, the protests have turned violent, forcing police to lathicharge the mob and detain some.\n\nBut it is clear that the viral video is not from Surat where people are demanding that they be either provided rations or shot dead. The video is from Kathua in J&K where migrant workers are demanding full wages and arrangements to return home.", "lang": "en"}
