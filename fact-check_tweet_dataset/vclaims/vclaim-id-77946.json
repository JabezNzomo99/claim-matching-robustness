Both graphics said Aquino incurred way more debt than Duterte, even though the latter has the Build, Build, Build program, and is running the government amid a pandemic.\n\nFour readers emailed the claim to Rappler for fact checking. As of writing, Facebook\u2019s monitoring tool Claim Check also flagged at least 115 posts made by different pages and users for verification. Claim Check data showed the graphic was posted on Facebook as early as Friday, July 31.\n\nData from the Bureau of the Treasury show that the national government\u2019s total debt amounted to P5.9 trillion by the end of the Aquino administration in June 2016, but not all of this was incurred during his 6-year term. The net addition to the country\u2019s debt under the Duterte administration so far is also higher than Aquino\u2019s 6-year term.\n\nEconomist and Rappler columnist JC Punongbayan explained in a previous fact check article that the government\u2019s outstanding debt is a \u201crunning total\u201d of how much a country still owes \u2013 minus regular debt payments. As such, Punongbayan said that comparisons between presidents should show the net addition to debt for certain periods.

As such, the net addition to the country's debt under Aquino from July 2010 to June 2016 amounted to P1.4 trillion.

FDC said Aquino\u2019s successor would inherit about P6.4 trillion in outstanding debt \u2013 of which P4.2 trillion was borrowed by Aquino. FDC called Aquino then the \u201cbiggest loan addict\u201d among presidents since 1986.\n\nIn contrast, the net addition to outstanding debt in Duterte\u2019s first 4 years in office amounted to P3.1 trillion. The country\u2019s outstanding debt when he came into office in June 2016 was at P5.9 trillion, and it ballooned to over P9 trillion in June 2020.
