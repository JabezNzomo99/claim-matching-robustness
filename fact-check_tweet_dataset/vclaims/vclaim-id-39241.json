OPEC removed its own limit, triggering a nearly 25 percent drop in crude oil prices on a single day \u2013 Monday, March 9 -- and a panic on global stock markets.\n\nThe previous day, March 8, the Russian ruble fell by more than 9 percent, settling at 74.8 per U.S. dollar on March 9.\n\nDespite those reactions, Dmitry Kiselyov, CEO of the state-owned media conglomerate Rossiya Segodnya, which includes Sputnik and RIA Novosti among others, and known as the Kremlin\u2019s propaganda mastermind, joined a chorus of Russian officials making optimistic claims.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t panic,\u201d he wrote on Telegram that day. \u201cOil is falling but Russia remains in the black, not allowing its opportunities in the global oil market to be curtailed. Strategically, the decision is the right one. Had we agreed to a bad deal with OPEC (read - with the Saudis) - we would have been thrown overboard and deprived of new income. Now we have a chance not only to extract and sell as much as we need to extract and sell, but also to send American LNG overboard.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the immediate hit to the ruble, experts say the move will add to Russia\u2019s chronic economic woes and hit ordinary citizens in the pocketbook.\n\nAtlantic Council senior fellow Anders Aslund told Polygraph.info: \u201cThe lower oil price will inevitably reduce Russia\u2019s GDP (gross domestic product) , investments and standard of living, because the country will receive less imports from abroad for its exports of oil and gas, which have accounted for two-thirds of Russia\u2019s exports when the prices have been high.\n\n\u201cWhat matters to the Russian people is economic growth and their standard of living,\u201d Aslund said.\n\nLeonid Fedun, the CEO of privately owned Lukoil, Russia\u2019s second-largest oil company, called Russia\u2019s exit from the pact with OPEC \u201cirrational.\u201d With oil prices falling to around $40 per barrel and Russia exporting about 5 million barrels a day, \u201cRussia will be losing $100 to $150 million daily,\u201d Fedun said.\n\nOn average, Russia has been producing about 11.5 million barrels of oil a day. The independent Russian business newspaper Vedomosti, citing Energy Minister Andrey Novak, reported that the country\u2019s oil production could increase by 500,000 barrels per day in 2020.\n\nProduction increases by Saudi Arabia and Russia could lead to \u201creal price wars\u201d beginning in April, with prices falling below $30 a barrel, analysts told Vedomosti. In such a scenario, the Russian oil industry could only survive with substantial financial infusions from the federal budget and a significant devaluation of the ruble.\n\nThe price for Brent crude oil, an industry standard, stood at more than $50 a barrel on Friday, March 6, before the OPEC talks broke down. As of midday on Wednesday, March 11, the price for Brent crude oil was $36 a barrel.\n\nRussian economists predicted falling oil prices could ignite inflation that will affect domestic prices from food to clothes and cars.\n\nExperts said the U.S. oil industry can be the biggest casualty of the Russian-Saudi standoff. Half of the U.S. shale oil producers could go bankrupt because they \u201chave little ability to withstand lower prices,\u201d The Wall Street Journal quoted analysts as saying.\n\nThe U.S. responded to the crisis on Tuesday by suspending sales from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).\n\nAnalysts at the Atlantic Council agreed in part with Kiselyov\u2019s assertion that U.S. oil and gas industries could also suffer, but not as much as Russia\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThe dislocations from this price war will be severe, but once again Saudi Arabia and Russia may be miscalculating if they think the pain will be worse for us than them,\u201d said David Goldwyn, chairman of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Energy Advisory Group.\n\n\u201cThe impact on the Russian economy is likely to be serious and lasting,\u201d said the council\u2019s Aslund. He compared the situation to 2008, when the price of oil fell to $32 per barrel, Russia\u2019s stock market fell by 80 percent in dollar terms over a half a year, and the country\u2019s GDP slumped by 8 percent.\n\n\u201cThe Russian stock market never recovered from that blow,\u201d Aslund said. \u201cThe question remains how much suffering Russia\u2019s poor people are prepared to take.\u201d\n\nAccording to Russia\u2019s natural resources and environment ministry, oil and gas production accounted for 60 percent of Russia\u2019s GDP in 2019.\n\nRussian officials sought to shift blame on Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s second-biggest oil producer after the United States.\n\nMikhail Leontiev, press secretary of Rosneft, Russia\u2019s state-owned oil and gas giant, said the decision to boost oil production freed Russia from damaging limitations. Continuing to adhere to the pact with OPEC was \u201cmasochistic\u201d for Russia since it was designed to clear cheap Russian oil from the market so that U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) could take its place and become a global monopoly, Leontiev said.", "lang": "en"}
