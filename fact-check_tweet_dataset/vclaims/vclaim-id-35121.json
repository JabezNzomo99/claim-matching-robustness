The claim is misleading; freely using a phone while driving is illegal nationwide in Australia, but the punishment is a fine.\n\nThe Facebook post, published here on November 19, has been shared over 2,200 times and claims that the new legislation was passed in Parliament.\n\nThe text-only post reads in part: \u201cAny driver of the vehicle who touches the phone while driving or while the engine is running will be directly revoked for three months. The police will not tolerate or accept any excuses.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the full post:\n\nPosts with a similar claim were shared on Facebook here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here and here.\n\nThe claim is misleading; touching a phone while driving is illegal in Australia nationwide, but the punishment is a fine -- not the revocation of one\u2019s license.\n\nAustralia\u2019s state and territory governments are responsible for making road laws, not the federal government, as per the country\u2019s Constitution.\n\nWhile every state and territory in Australia has the authority to govern its own roads, it is illegal nationwide for drivers to freely use mobile phones while their car is moving or in a stationary position, such as waiting in a queue or at a traffic light.\n\nIn most states and territories, drivers are only allowed to use their phones freely when the car is parked, regardless of whether the engine is running or not.\n\nIt's the exception in the Australian Capital Territory, where an Australian Federal Police spokesperson advised in an email on December 5 that \"a vehicle\u2019s engine needs to be off before a driver handles a mobile device, even one in a hands free cradle etc.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Western Australian Road Safety Commission added in a clarification email to AFP on December 3 that \u201cwhether a vehicle is \u2018stationary but not parked\u2019 may be a matter of the police officer\u2019s discretion.\u201d\n\nPhones, however, can be used if they are securely mounted to the vehicle or operated by voice commands.\n\nYet learner and provisional licensed drivers are prohibited from using phones at all, even hands free, in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Northern Territory, Tasmania, and the Australian Capital Territory. In Western Australia, learner and provisional drivers follow the same rules as fully licensed motorists.\n\nBut across all Australian states and territories, there is no law mandating that a license be revoked as punishment for a driver caught touching their phone illegally.\n\nThe actual monetary penalties for drivers caught illicitly using their phones are as follows:\n\u2022 New South Wales: AUD $344 [USD $235] fine, or AUD $457 if detected in a school zone, plus five demerit points.", "lang": "en"}
