Our readers have asked us to look into this.\n\nMr Starmer was head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) when the decision not to prosecute Savile was made on the grounds of \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d. The allegations against Savile were dealt with by local police and a reviewing lawyer for the CPS.\n\nA later investigation criticised the actions of both the CPS and the police in their handling of the situation. It did not suggest that Mr Starmer was personally involved in the decisions made. The Labour party told us it could not comment on individual cases and the CPS said that records relating to the decision not to charge Savile were not kept, which the service said is in line with its data retention policy.\n\nMr Starmer was made Director of Public Prosecutions, head of the CPS, in 2008.\n\nThe CPS is responsible for prosecuting crimes in England and Wales. As part of this it decides which cases should be prosecuted and what defendants should be charged with. It is independent of the police and government.\n\nIn 2007 and 2008, Surrey Police investigated three complaints that Savile had \u201cengaged in sexual behaviour with young girls\u201d. During the same period, Sussex Police investigated a similar complaint involving a young woman.\n\nSavile was interviewed under caution by police in October 2009 and denied wrongdoing. He was not arrested. No prosecution was brought in relation to any of the four complaints, on the grounds that none of the victims were \u201cprepared to support any police action\u201d, for example testifying in court.\n\nSavile died in October 2011. Since his death, it has emerged that he sexually abused hundreds of children and women at locations including hospitals, schools and the BBC.\n\nThe review of the police investigation and CPS decision\n\nIn January 2013, after Savile\u2019s death and when his abuse had been revealed, an investigation into whether the CPS had been right not to charge Savile in 2009 was published by Alison Levitt QC. She was asked to investigate this by Mr Starmer.\n\nMs Levitt said she had \u201creservations\u201d about the prosecutor\u2019s decision not to press charges.\n\nShe said: \u201cOn the face of it, the allegations made were both serious and credible; the prosecutor should have recognised this and sought to \u201cbuild\u201d a prosecution.\u201d\n\nShe said the police treated the victims and the accounts they gave \u201cwith a degree of caution which was neither justified nor required\u201d.\n\nThree of the victims told her that if they had received more information from the police at the time of the investigation\u2014and particularly if each had been told she was not the only woman who had complained\u2014they would \u201cprobably have been prepared to give evidence.\u201d Ms Levitt said that, in the case of two of the allegations, there would have been a \u201crealistic prospect of conviction\u201d if the women had given evidence.\n\n\u201cHaving spoken to the victims I have been driven to conclude that had the police and prosecutors taken a different approach a prosecution might have been possible,\u201d she wrote.\n\nMs Levitt is critical of the approach taken by both the CPS\u2019 reviewing lawyer and the police in failing to build a prosecution against Savile in 2009, but said there was no evidence of any \u201cimproper motive on the part of either police or prosecutors\u201d.\n\nWhen the investigation report was published in January 2013, Mr Starmer said in a statement that he accepted the conclusions and hoped it would be a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for the CPS.\n\nHe said: \u201cI would like to take the opportunity to apologise for the shortcomings in the part played by the CPS in these cases.\n\n\u201cThese were errors of judgement by experienced and committed police officers and a prosecuting lawyer acting in good faith and attempting to apply the correct principles. That makes the findings of Ms Levitt\u2019s report more profound and calls for a more robust response.\u201d\n\nLater in 2013, the CPS updated its guidance on prosecuting child sexual abuse in England and Wales.\n\nWhat Labour and the CPS said\n\nFull Fact reached out to Labour and the CPS to see if they could give any further information about the case and if Mr Starmer had any involvement beyond his role as head of the CPS.\n\nA spokesperson for the CPS said that, \u201cin line with the established data retention policy\u201d, none of the records for the decision not to charge Savile in 2009 were kept.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere is no reference within the [investigation] report to any involvement from the DPP in the decision-making in the case. The reviewing lawyer at the time set out their own reasons for the decisions they took, which are reproduced in the report.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Labour party said they could not comment on individual cases, but insisted Mr Starmer \u201cput victims at the heart of the judicial system\u201d during his time as DPP, including improving support for victims of sexual and domestic violence and introducing a right for victims to challenge CPS decisions.", "lang": "en"}
