That was when then-Gov. Kitzhaber was nearing the end of a second term marked by steep job losses and bitter fights with Republicans over state budget cuts.\n\n \n\n \"Under Gov. Kitzhaber,\" Dudley said in a recent speech in Albany, \"unemployment rose 65 percent, state spending went up 57 percent and personal incomes declined compared to the rest of the country.\"\n\n \n\n We wondered about two things: Was it really that bad? And how much can you blame Kitzhaber for what happened?\n\n \n\n So let\u2019s take a look, first at the unemployment number.\n\n \n\n In 1995, when Kitzhaber took office, Oregon\u2019s economy was streaking at a record pace and unemployment was as low as it had ever been, 4.7 percent. The rate hovered around 5 percent for most of his career as governor because the economy remained healthy. But joblessness began to spike upward in his final two years as the national and state economies went into a deep recession. National unemployment figures followed a similar trend, although remained about a percentage point below Oregon\u2019s. When Kitzhaber left office, Oregon\u2019s unemployment rate stood at 7.8 percent.\n\n \n\n So Dudley\u2019s correct: at the end of Kitzhaber\u2019s tenure, the unemployment rate was up 65 percent.\n\n \n\n What about that state spending figure? That\u2019s a little trickier.\n\n \n\n The hot economy in the 1990s produced record-setting tax revenues for the state. Total state spending, which includes federal pass-through money, such as Medicaid and food stamp payments, indeed increased by 56 percent over Kitzhaber\u2019s eight years, rising from $22.6 billion to $35.3 billion. General fund spending, however, rose by a more staid 26 percent -- from $8.2 billion to $10.3 billion -- and that\u2019s widely considered the more accurate measure of state spending fluctuations. (Oregon's population grew 11 percent between 1995 and 2003. Inflation between those two years was 28 percent.)\n\n \n\n Worth noting: Republicans controlled the Legislature throughout Kitzhaber\u2019s tenure, and approved all general fund spending increases.\n\n \n\n Last, we checked on personal income.\n\n \n\n The dot-com boom benefited not just Oregon but the rest of the nation, too. Even though Oregonians were making more money, they weren\u2019t keeping up, and per-capita income rates fell slightly in relation to other states. In 1995, Oregon\u2019s per capita income stood at 97 percent of the nation\u2019s, when Kitzhaber left office it had dropped to 95 percent.\n\n \n\n So Dudley\u2019s math mostly holds up. But is it accurate to attribute those numbers to Kitzhaber\u2019s leadership?\n\n \n\n We checked with state economist Tom Potiowsky, who monitors the ups and downs of Oregon\u2019s financial health.\n\n \n\n He said Oregon\u2019s economy, which is based heavily in manufacturing, is at the mercy of national and global economic factors. When home building goes down, Oregon\u2019s lumber products aren\u2019t needed. When computer sales are down, Oregon\u2019s chips go unsold, he said.\n\n \n\n \"Those were very much national economic factors, really pushing us around,\" during Kitzhaber\u2019s final years, Potiowsky said.\n\n \n\n University of Oregon economist Tim Duy had a similar take. What happened at the end of Kitzhaber\u2019s administration was caused by the national business cycle and was largely out of his control.\n\n \n\n Yet Oregon didn\u2019t help itself much, notes Duy and John Tapogna, president of ECONorthwest, a Portland economic consulting firm. When high-tech firms were expanding, the state -- and Kitzhaber\u2019s office -- wasn\u2019t exactly helping them navigate the state\u2019s strict land use rules.\n\n \n\n So is Dudley right to hang Oregon\u2019s economic decline around Kitzhaber\u2019s neck?\n\n \n\n -- His statement is factually accurate on unemployment, spending growth and the decline in per capita income relative to the rest of the nation during Kitzhaber\u2019s term.\n\n \n\n -- Oregon, however, was knocked for a loop by the same dot-com bust that sent the nation\u2019s economy into a tailspin. Realistically, there\u2019s not much a governor can do about those kind of macroeconomic factors.\n\n \n\n -- Oregon enjoyed a robust economy for six of the eight years Kitzhaber was governor. But when things started to go south, Kitzhaber was at the helm.\n\n \n\n We find the claim to be Half True.", "lang": "en"}
