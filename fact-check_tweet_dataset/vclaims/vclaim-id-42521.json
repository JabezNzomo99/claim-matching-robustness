Passengers can be seen pulling his beard and pushing him, as he resists the attack. The former can be heard abusing the sadhu in Tamil. BOOM reached out to the Southern Railway Public Relations Officer, B Guganesan, who confirmed that the incident happened on board the Nagercoil - Coimbatore passenger train earlier this week.\n\nThe video, viewed more than 1.7 lakh times at the time of writing this article, has been captioned as, \"This is Horrible! On this train an old Hindu Saint is being beaten by Christians because he got into a compartment which was predominantly Christians & they did not want this Hindu man to sit with them. If I was on that train I swear I would have went berserk on those Christians!\"\n\nWarning: Disturbing content. Click here to view the archive of the tweet.\n\nThe same video was tweeted with a similar narrative in Tamil by another user.\n\nBOOM was able to ascertain that the video is from Tamil Nadu, as passengers can be heard speaking and reprimanding in Tamil.\n\nMultiple replies suggested that the incident was an alleged case of molestation.\n\nWe reached out to B Guganesan, the Chief PRO of Southern Railway, who confirmed that the incident happened on board the Nagercoil-Coimbatore passenger train earlier this week. According to Guganesan, the co-passengers beat up a septuagenarian sadhu when he was caught molesting an eleven-year old in the compartment. \n\n\n\nHe however added that the miscreant was not identified as no complaint was lodged about the incident with the Railway Police Force (RPF). The same was corroborated by a senior official from the RPF of the Trivandrum section.\n\nWe also found the same video which was uploaded to Facebook by one Shekinah Santhosh who stated that the incident happened in the Nagercoil-Coimbatore Passenger train where co-passengers thrashed the sadhu for misbehaving with a girl. According to the post, the sadhu was alighted at the Dindigul station.\n\nBOOM could not independently verify if the passengers travelling were predominantly Christians.", "lang": "en"}
