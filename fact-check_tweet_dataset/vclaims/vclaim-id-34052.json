Its European Space Agency probe, Huygens, landed on the surface of Saturn\u2019s moon Titan in 2005 and began transmitting scientific data back to Earth. The Cassini spacecraft itself took more than 453,000 images of Saturn and other celestial bodies during its roughly 20-year mission.\n\nThe Facebook post falsely alleges that an image appearing to show Saturn and its rings was taken by the Cassini spacecraft, with the caption saying, \u201cNASA\u2019s Cassini probe was a nuclear-powered spacecraft that orbited Saturn for 13 years. It sent back hundreds of thousands of images. This is just one of them.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Cassini spacecraft did not produce the image in the Facebook post. The picture, found through a reverse image search, is actually an artist\u2019s depiction of Cassini making one of its last orbital trips. NASA published the illustration in April 2017, several months before the Cassini burned up in Saturn\u2019s atmosphere.\n\n\u201cThis artist\u2019s concept shows an over-the-shoulder view of Cassini making one of its Grand Finale dives over Saturn,\u201d reads NASA\u2019s caption for the image.

It flew by the ringed planet in 1979 and is on a trajectory that will take it outside the solar system, according to NASA.", "lang": "en"}
