A policeman is also seen in the video, but he does not interfere.\n\nVerified Twitter user \u201cAli Keskin\u201d posted the 75-second video with the caption, \u201cMuslims are oppressed in India and will continue to be oppressed if we do not protect them. It's time to be unity. The Indian government will account! #ModiResignation\u201d.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be false. It was a family dispute in Balrampur, Uttar Pradesh, and there is no communal angle to the incident. Police have confirmed that the accused and victim are both Hindus and from the same family.\n\nAli Keskin\u2019s tweet was liked by more than 4,300 users and retweeted over 2,300 times till the filing of this story. The archived version can be seen here. The misleading post is also viral on Facebook.\n\nUsing related keywords, we found that many social media users have posted the video with the claim that the incident is from Rehra Bazar area in Balrampur, UP.\n\nWe also found some news reports regarding the video. As per \u201cAmar Ujala\u201d, the woman named Susheela was thrashed by her husband Ashok over a dispute related to selling their house.\n\nSoon, two brothers and three nephews of Ashok also joined him and started beating Susheela. The whole incident occurred in the presence of cops. Four accused, including the woman\u2019s husband, were arrested.\n\nBalrampur Superintendent of Police Dev Ranjan Verma also took cognisance of the matter and suspended two policemen who were present on the spot but didn\u2019t intervene. His press conference can be seen below.\n\nBalrampur police also confirmed to us that the viral claim is false. \u201cThe victim and the accused are Hindus and from the same family, so there\u2019s no communal angle in the matter,\u201d SHO Vinod Agnihotri said.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the claim along with the video is communally motivated as the woman was beaten up due to a family dispute.", "lang": "en"}
