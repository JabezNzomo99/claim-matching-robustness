Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Japan does not give citizenship to Muslims. Fact: There is nothing mentioned about religion in Japan\u2019s National Law and the Immigration Policy document. Also, Article 20 of Japan\u2019s constitution reads: \u2018Freedom of religion is guaranteed to all\u2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for more information on Japan\u2019s citizenship criteria on Google, it was found that the religion of a person was not mentioned in the eligibility requirements for obtaining Japanese citizenship. Both the Immigration Attorney website and Japan\u2019s Nationality Law do not mention religion as an eligibility condition.\n\nThe claim that the Muslims are not given houses on rent in Japan is also false as Article 14 of Japan\u2019s Constitution reads: \u2018All of the people are equal under the law and there shall be no discrimination in political, economic or social relations because of race, creed, sex, social status or family origin\u2019 and Article 20 provides religious freedom to all and refrains the State from involving in \u2018religious education or any other religious activity\u2019.\n\nOther fact checking organisations like Snopes, Huffing Post and Politifact have already debunked similar claims which went viral five years back. To sum it up, Japan does not provide/deny \u2018citizenship\u2019 based on religion.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
