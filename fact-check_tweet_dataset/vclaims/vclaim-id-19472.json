It is noteworthy that the government on August 5 deemed Article 370 of the Constitution, which grants special status to Jammu and Kashmir, ineffective.\n\nThe video has been widely floated using a Malayalam caption \u2013 \u201c\u0d15\u0d36\u0d4d\u0d2e\u0d40\u0d30\u0d3f\u0d32\u0d46 \u0d2e\u0d41\u0d38\u0d4d\u0d32\u0d40\u0d02 \u0d1c\u0d28\u0d24 \u0d2a\u0d3e\u0d15\u0d3f\u0d38\u0d4d\u0d25\u0d3e\u0d7b \u0d24\u0d40\u0d35\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d35\u0d3e\u0d26\u0d3f\u0d15\u0d33\u0d41\u0d1f\u0d46 \u0d05\u0d1f\u0d3f\u0d2e\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d3f\u0d7d \u0d28\u0d3f\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d28\u0d41\u0d02 \u0d2e\u0d4b\u0d1a\u0d3f\u0d24\u0d30\u0d3e\u0d15\u0d41\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d28 \u0d28\u0d2f\u0d28\u0d3e\u0d28\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d26\u0d15\u0d30\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d2f \u0d15\u0d3e\u0d34\u0d4d\u0d1a (Freedom from the captivity of Pakistani militants in Kashmir.)\u201d\n\nAn identical English caption has also been used to circulate the clip. Another English caption shared with the video says, \u201cJammu and Kashmir State : A beautiful scene. Bharath Mata ki Jai.\u201d\n\nA twitter user, Hemir Desai, who is followed by railway minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s office, also shared the video claiming that the procession is the effect of \u201cabolishment of Article 370.\u201d\n\nAlt News broke the video into multiple frames and reserve-searched one of the images on Google which led us to a Twitter handle that had shared the same video earlier in February this year. He claimed that this procession was taken out by Bohra Muslims in Bangalore in the memory of martyred CRPF jawans.\n\nUpon searching for the video with specific keywords, we also found the same clip on YouTube uploaded as a procession taken out by Bohra Muslims in Bannerghatta, Bangalore. Apart from pro-India slogans, people can also be heard chanting \u2013 \u201cShaheed Jawan Amar Rahe\u201d \u2013 which hints that the rally was indeed taken in support of martyred soldiers.\n\nFurthermore, at about 15 seconds into the video, the name of the complex behind the procession is visible. It says \u2013 \u2018Burhani Flora\u2019.\n\nBurhani Flora is an apartment complex located in Bangalore\u2019s Bohra Layout, Gottigere.\n\nIt is thus established that video was not shot in Kashmir but Bangalore. It is unrelated to the recent unrest in J&K owing to the government\u2019s decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir of statehood and special status under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution.", "lang": "en"}
