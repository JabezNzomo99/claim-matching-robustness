At least 135 people were killed and as many as 4,000 injured, with an estimated 300,000 left homeless because the blast destroyed their apartments or rendered them uninhabitable.\n\nThe explosion, reportedly set off by a nearby blaze at the port, was caught on camera by multiple individuals from different distances and angles. The blast was immediately followed by wild speculation on social media as to its origins.\n\nArguably the most bizarre take came from Veterans Today, an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory site with ties to Russian and Iranian state media.\n\nShortly after the blast was reported, Veterans Today tweeted:\n\n\u201cBreaking: Israel Nukes Beirut - Two explosions in Beirut, one a conventional guided bomb followed by a small nuclear weapon. The target seems to be an Iranian/Hezbollah missile storage facility. Our evaluation is guesswork and we are waiting for word from our nuclear exper...\u201d\n\nWithin hours of the incident, evidence mounted for another explanation. The explosion occurred after a fire had broken out nearby and firefighters were already at the scene. Al Jazeera reported that Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab cited ammonium nitrate stored at the site as the likely cause of the explosion.\n\nThe explosion itself displayed none of the tell-tale signs of nuclear detonation, one of the most important being a blinding flash. Furthermore, videos of the blast were posted online by people who would have been obliterated along with their media devices had there been a nuclear explosion.\n\nSo what caused the explosion?\n\nIt apparently began with a fire at the port facility and spread to 2,750 metric tons of highly-flammable ammonium nitrate fertilizer stored in a warehouse. Ammonium nitrate has been used as an improvised explosive, one of the most infamous cases being the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995.\n\nAccidental detonations in plants and storage facilities have occurred throughout the chemical fertilizer\u2019s history, such as the explosion at the BASF plant in Oppau, Germany in 1921, or more recently, a 2013 explosion at a fertilizer plant in West, Texas.\n\nThe Beirut fertilizer was seized from a ship in 2013 and had been left neglected in a warehouse since then.\n\nIn September 2013, the Moldovan-flagged ship Rhosus, owned by a Russian citizen living in Cyprus, was en route from the Georgian port of Batumi on the Black Sea to Mozambique. Citing technical problems, the Rhosus stopped in Beirut, where it was inspected by local authorities and deemed to be unworthy to sail.\n\nThe ship and its cargo were \u201cabandoned\u201d by the owner and the charterers, and after a legal battle the ship\u2019s cargo was moved to a nearby warehouse, where it was to be stored prior to being auctioned or subject to \u201cproper disposal.\u201d Neither took place.\n\nWorse still, information came to light on Aug. 5 that Lebanese government ministers knew that the hazardous cargo had been sitting in the warehouse for years, raising further doubts about governance in the country, which recently has been rocked by continuous protests against government corruption.\n\nAl Jazeera reported that several port officials have been placed under house arrest pending an investigation into responsibility for the blast.\n\nDespite the emerging counternarrative, Veterans Today doubled and tripled down on claims that Israel had used a nuclear weapon on Lebanon. Another tweet on Aug. 4 stated:\n\n\u201cBreaking: Israel Nukes Beirut, Russian Embassy Hit, Evidence In (updating) - A general in the Lebanese Army reports that Israel dropped a tactical nuclear weapon on the port of Beirut today. He reports that this was done to collapse the current political regime there and revo...\u201d\n\nThe tweet did not provide a link to back up its claim. As for the Russian embassy in Beirut being \u201chit,\u201d the embassy only reported that one worker suffered minor injuries when the building\u2019s windows were shattered.\n\nOn Aug. 5, Veterans Today tweeted out a condemnation of fact checkers contradicting its unsubstantiated claims:\n\n\u201c'Fact Checking' The Nuke That Hit Beirut - Within hours of VT breaking the news that Israel had nuked Beirut, the 'fact checkers' were out in force trying to contradict us, but the best they could do was a pretty pathetic effort comprised of nothing of substance, just regurgit...\u201d\n\nThat tweet is also false:VT: did not \u201cbreak\u201d the news of Israel \u201cnuking\u201d Beirut because that did not happen. Veterans Today not only failed to present any evidence for its claim that the blast was a nuclear weapon, but there is plenty of visual evidence that the blast was non-nuclear.\n\nWith the Lebanese officials saying the explosion was caused by the stored ammonium nitrate, Veterans Today\u2019s claims about \u201cbreaking the news\u201d are even more discredited.\n\nIn a 2017 Politico article on Russian disinformation targeting U.S. military veterans, author Ben Schreckinger noted comments by the chairman of Veterans Today in a 2012 interview:\n\n\u201cAbout 30% of what\u2019s written on Veterans Today, is patently false. About 40% of what I write, is at least purposely, partially false, because if I didn\u2019t write false information I wouldn\u2019t be alive.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
