Every time the world gets an upgrade on its electromagnetic field it messes people breathing up clearly\u201d.\n\nThe April 5 Facebook post has been viewed 31,000 times, shared over 200 times and attracted over 80 comments.\n\nThe April 5 Facebook post seeks to correlate various disease outbreaks with the rollout of new telecommunications technologies, starting with: \u201c5G launched, COVID-19 2019\u201d.\n\nAccording to American telecommunications and technology company QualComm, 5G is currently commercially available in only 33 countries around the world including Australia. COVID-19 infections, however, have been recorded in 184 countries and regions, including two cruise ships, as of April 9, 2020, according to the Johns Hopkins University of Medicine COVID-19 Map.\n\nThe Facebook post then goes on to state: \u201c4G launched, H1N1 2009\u201d.\n\nAustralia recorded 37,357 confirmed cases of the H1N1, also known as Swine Flu, and reported 191 deaths as a result of the virus in 2009, according to the federal Department of Health. However, the country\u2019s first commercial rollout of 4G technology didn\u2019t occur until two years later in 2011.\n\nThe post then claims both 3G and 1G occurred at the same time as influenza outbreaks in 1998 and 1979 respectively.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, there are four types of seasonal influenza viruses, A, B, C and D. Influenza A and B circulate yearly, with annual epidemics estimated to result in between three and five million cases of severe illness and 290,000 to 650,000 deaths per year. The 3G network was switched on in Australia in 2003 not 1998 and the 1G network was rolled out in 1987 not 1979, as claimed by the April 5 Facebook post.\n\nThe post also says: \u201c2G Launched, Cholera 1991\u201d.\n\nAccording to the Victorian Department of Health, Australia records between two and six cases of Cholera each year. People are typically infected in places where the disease is endemic like parts of Africa, South East Asia and South America. The 2G network was rolled out in Australia on April 27, 1993 \u2014 not 1991.\n\nAlso note that, while the post claims changes in technology \u201cmesses people up breathing clearly\u201d, Cholera is a bacterial infection, spread by contaminated water or food, that causes severe diarrhoea and dehydration.\n\nThe post then says: \u201cThe introduction of radio waves caused the Spanish flu of 1918\u201d.\n\nThe Spanish Flu hit Australia\u2019s shores in early January 1919, infected about 40 per cent of the population and killed 15,000 people by the time it had dissipated at the end of 1919. Australia\u2019s inaugural commercial radio broadcast occurred in 1923, when audiences across Sydney tuned in to hear the St Andrew Choir perform \u2018The Swan\u2019 by Saint Saens, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nThe post finally claims: \u201cEvery time the world gets an upgrade on its electromagnetic field it messes people breathing up clearly\u201d.\n\nExperts from around the world have come out to debunk the theory, including Australia\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, Brendan Murphy. \u201cThere is no evidence telecommunication technologies, such as 5G, cause adverse health impacts,\u201d he said in a January 24 statement.\n\nThe body responsible for protecting Australians from radiation exposure, The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA), said in a March 20, 2019 statement the radiation emitted by 5G technology is well below levels that could harm humans.\n\n\u201cIt is the assessment of ARPANSA and international organisations such as the (WHO) and the that there is no established scientific evidence to support any adverse health effects from very low RF EME exposures to populations or individuals,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nAn April 2020 statement from ARPANSA says that studies of the effects of low-level radio wave exposure, such as from 5G telecommunications \u201chave not provided evidence of changes in immune function\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is no established evidence that low level radio wave exposure from 5G and other wireless telecommunications can affect the immune system or cause any other long term or short term health effects,\u201d the statement says.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the post to be false. There is no pattern linking outbreaks of disease with cellular telecommunications or radio technologies. Experts have also highlighted the lack of evidence to suggest cellular technology causes adverse health impacts. False \u2013 The primary claims of the content are factually inaccurate. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://factcheck.aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
