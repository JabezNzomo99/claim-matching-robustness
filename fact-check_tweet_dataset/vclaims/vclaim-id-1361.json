At first, many thought it was a Pacific Sleeper Shark. The issue with that theory is the Pacific Sleeper Shark grow only to 20 feet, the shark featured is 50+ feet long. That measurement is estimated using the length of the cage, which is 10 feet across. Could this be the last remaining Megalodon? Watch and share!\n\nBuzz Channel\u2019s post was rife with misinformation. This video wasn\u2019t \u201cbreaking,\u201d it didn\u2019t show a 50-foot shark, it wasn\u2019t filmed in the Mariana Trench, and it absolutely didn\u2019t capture an extinct megalodon.\n\nThe earliest version of this video we could uncover was posted to YouTube in 2008:\n\nThat version of the video stated that the footage captured a 7-meter (22-foot) Pacific sleeper shark off the coast of Japan in the Suruga Bay. While certain details of the video are still unclear (such as the date it was made), the clip\u2019s description matches that of a shark filmed off the coast of Japan in 1989:\n\nHere\u2019s a comparison of the shark in the video and another sleeper shark:\n\nWhile the shark in the video is indeed large, it would be considered rather small if it were actually a megalodon. Fossil records of that extinct shark species suggest that it reached a size of nearly 60 feet in length.", "lang": "en"}
