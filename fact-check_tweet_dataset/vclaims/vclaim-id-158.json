Examples \u2013 including some referring to the recovery of an elderly lady in China, and others promoting fruits such as oranges that are high in Vitamin C - can be seen here , here , here , and here .\n\nVitamin C, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) \u201cplays an important role in immune function\u201d (here).\n\nHowever, it is false to suggest that Vitamin C is a widely approved treatment or cure for COVID-19. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \u201cNo specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) approved\u201d ( here ).\n\nA World Health Organization (WHO) document prescribes several methods for trained healthcare professionals to use in managing severe cases of COVID-19 ( bit.ly/2VxMu9B ). These include oxygen therapy and monitoring, the treatment of co-infections with empiric antimicrobials, endotracheal intubation in cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and resuscitation from septic shock using crystalloid fluid. As of mid-April, the guide does not mention use of Vitamin C.\n\nGuidelines on inpatient management from the Infectious Diseases Society of America can be found here . These also do not mention treatment with vitamins.\n\nAs reported by Newsweek, \u201cpatients testing positive with COVID-19 were in some cases being treated with large doses of vitamin C\u201d in the intensive care units of certain New York hospitals ( here ). However, the article said, \u201cthe effectiveness of intravenous vitamin C as a treatment for\u2014or buffer against\u2014COVID-19 is not established with solid clinical evidence.\u201d\n\nHealthline reports, \u201cNo supplement will cure or prevent disease [\u2026] it\u2019s especially important to understand that no supplement, diet, or other lifestyle modification other than physical distancing, also known as social distancing, and proper hygiene practices can protect you from COVID-19.\u201d ( here )\n\nThere is currently a clinical trial ( here ) under way in Wuhan, China to determine the potential benefit of Vitamin C on patients with COVID-19, but results have not yet been published.\n\nOn March 28, The South China Morning Post reported a Wuhan doctor saying: \u201cWe still don\u2019t know whether this helps [their] recovery \u2013 this needs a lot of research\u201d when asked about efforts to treat severely ill patients with intravenous Vitamin C, along with other medicines ( here ).\n\nWhile the immune-boosting properties of Vitamin C might help people\u2019s bodies respond to infections and illness, to claim Vitamin C alone can cure or treat COVID-19 is medically unfounded. Studies on its effect on respiratory infections similar to COVID-19 are still under way.\n\nFalse: Although some COVID-19 patients are reported to have been given large doses of Vitamin C, it is not a proven treatment or cure for the disease\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
