(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe post is wrong: On March 25, the Senate voted unanimously in favor of the stimulus package. The measure then passed the House on a voice vote, and President Donald Trump signed the bill into law on March 27.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say there wasn\u2019t drama along the way. Policy disagreements led 47 senators to block the bill from moving forward in a procedural vote on March 22. The next day, the same procedural vote failed 49-46 (Republicans needed 60 votes to move the bill forward and several Republican senators were in self-quarantine after Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., announced he tested positive for COVID-19). All 45 of the Senate\u2019s Democrats were united in their opposition. The \"main hang-up on the bill,\" Vox reported, was that Democrats objected to $500 billion earmarked for big companies and industries affected by the coronavirus.\n\nAs the bill was then written, the money \"would be under the discretion of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and Democrats want rules and regulations around the funds to direct them to the workers \u2014 not CEOS,\" according to Vox.\n\nUnder the bipartisan bill that ultimately became law, Americans earning up ro $75,000 will receive payments of $1,200. Those making up to $99,000 will get smaller payments, and families are also set to receive an additional $500 per child.", "lang": "en"}
