The text in the images seems to equate these with the socialism or communism seen in the Soviet Union under Vladimir Lenin and Josef Stalin ( here , here ). The claims attributing these rules to Alinsky are false.\n\nThe text in the image was allegedly written in 2015 during Barack Obama\u2019s second presidential term. The images imply that liberal politicians like Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reserved praise for Alinsky, noting that his writings influenced \u201cthose in political control of our nation today\u201d.\n\nThe quotes attributed to Alinsky are not found in his writings. In Rules for Radicals, Alinsky lays out a list of \u201cpower tactics\u201d for a \u201cmass-based people\u2019s organization\u201d ( here ), but these are not the same as the ones attributed to him on social media.\n\nAlinsky was an American community organizer and a self-professed rebel ( here ) but he reserved skepticism for the means and ends of communism, making the claim about his alleged formulations on the creation of a \u201csocial state\u201d as a pathway to socialism or communism, uncharacteristic.\n\nAlinsky himself said: \u201cSo as far as the Communists went, there were several special things that kept me out. Partly it was philosophic\u2026I hate dogma. People who believed they owned the truth have been responsible for the most terrible things that have happened in our world, whether they were Communist purges or the Spanish Inquisition or the Salem witch hunts.\u201d ( here )\n\nThe thought that Alinsky would recommend increasing \u201cthe poverty level as high as possible\u201d to facilitate their control is also unlikely, given that it would counter the political message that he advanced for decades of giving \u201cthe poor a future and power to control the future\u201d ( here ).\n\nReuters was unable to find any list in Alinsky\u2019s works on how to create a \u201csocial state\u201d.\n\nIt is perhaps true that Alinsky influenced Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, a connection that has provided fodder for right-wing political speculation and conspiracy, including the spread of the same image by a Trump senior campaign advisor in 2017 ( here ).\n\nIt is well documented that while studying at Wellesley College, Hillary Clinton wrote her senior thesis on the ideas of Alinsky and interviewed him ( here ). Clinton\u2019s thesis advisor Alan Schechter, however, claims that she \u201capproached it pragmatically and not from a pro-Alinsky perspective,\u201d the Washington Post reported.\n\nIn the 1980s, Barack Obama was a community organizer in Chicago where he received training from the Industrial Areas Foundation, an organization founded by Alinsky in the 1940s ( here ; bit.ly/2VumcpS ). In 1990, an essay by Obama on community organizing was compiled into a collection called \u201cAfter Alinsky: Community Organizing in Illinois\u201d. ( here ).\n\nAlex Cohen, Alinsky\u2019s biographer, has argued that Obama\u2019s grass-roots campaign strategy during the 2008 presidential election drew greatly from Alinsky\u2019s teachings ( here ).\n\nIt is improbable that Obama and Alinsky ever met. Alinsky died on June 12, 1972, when Obama was 10 years old and living in Hawaii with his grandparents ( here ).\n\nSaul Alinsky was an American activist known for his role in the foundation of numerous citizen groups and community organizations. In his book, Rules for Radicals, Alinsky proposed a list of \u201cpower tactics\u201d for creating effective mass movements. Quotes regarding the creation of a \u201csocial state\u201d attributed to him on social media, however, are not of his authorship.\n\nFalse: Saul Alinsky did not draft an eight-step plan for world conquest, or the creation of a \u201csocial state\u201d. These quotes attributed to him on social media are false.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our fact checking work here .", "lang": "en"}
