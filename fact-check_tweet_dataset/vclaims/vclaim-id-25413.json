Once he is done with the exercise he walks to the machine, collects a ticket and walks off.\n\nThe video appears to have resurfaced earlier in July with several netizens appealing to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to introduce similar ticket machines that accept exercise as payment, on the Delhi Metro.\n\nBOOM looked for the video on YouTube and found several links from 2013 sharing longer versions of the same video.\n\nThe ticket machine with special squat sensor installed at Vystavochnaya station would dispense free tickets if a passenger could perform 30 squats within two minutes in front of it.\n\nYou can watch the video below.\n\nThe promotional campaign was well received by locals who were gearing up for the winter Olympics that was held in February 2014. Read more about the free-ticket machine here.\n\nWhile the video and the text accompanying it is not fake, the news is from 2013 and the machine, installed at only Vystavochnaya station, remained operational only till December 2013.
