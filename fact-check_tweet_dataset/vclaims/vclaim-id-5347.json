No, that's not true: the story was made up by a Canadian website that makes up entertaining stories about weird crimes, bizarre sex acts and other crazy news, but none of it is real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on July 20, 2018 titled \"Reality show contestants rescued after 5 years on a deserted island\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nSeven participants of a Philippino reality TV show were miraculously rescued by coastguards after being stranded a total of 64 months on a deserted island. The three men and four women are all that remain of the 16 original contenders on the TV show Survivor: Castaway, which was meant to go on air in 2013. 8 men and 8 women from all over the Philippines were transported to the isolated and deserted Marooning Island for the shooting and were meant to remain there for a maximum of two months.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so some of them might have actually believed it:\n\nThe image illustrating the story is actually from a 2015 ferry disaster in the Philippines that killed 36 people:\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories. The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Teen On 'Female Viagra' Did NOT Crash Into Building While Masturbating To Gear Shift\n\u2022 Fake News: Florida Babysitter Did NOT Tie Crying One-month-old Baby To Ceiling Fan For 26 Hours\n\u2022 Fake News: Colorado Man Did NOT Claim He Was Held 2 Weeks As A Sex Slave By A Grizzly Bear\n\u2022 Fake News: Allergic Man NOT Rushed To Hospital; Girlfriend Did NOT Spread Peanut Butter On Vagina\n\u2022 Fake News: MH370 Pilot Did NOT Mysteriously Resurface Almost 2 Years After His Flight Vanished Over China Sea", "lang": "en"}
