On September 10, the Trump administration denounced the reports as \u201cinaccurate\u201d and \u201cdangerous.\u201d\n\nSmolenkov served as an adviser to Yuri Ushakov, a former Deputy Chief of the Government Staff of the Russian Federation, who, since 2012, has served as the Russian president\u2019s foreign policy aide.\n\nSmolenkov also served under Ushakov during the latter\u2019s nearly decade-long tenure as Russia\u2019s Ambassador to the United States. There has been media speculation that the alleged CIA asset in Russia had been providing information to the U.S. for decades.\n\nNew York Times journalist Ivan Nechepurenko wrote on Twitter that being the chief adviser to Putin\u2019s top foreign policy aide makes Smolenkov \u201csound more important than some Kremlin-friendly papers are trying to portray.\u201d\n\nUshakov declined to comment when asked if he knew who Smolenkov was.\n\nIlya Shumanov, deputy director of Transparency International, wrote on the Telegram messaging service that Smolenkov was not merely \u201csome government clerk who managed the President\u2019s affairs,\u201d but had \u201cbeen in Ushakov\u2019s inner circle for at least fifteen years.\u201d\n\nThe Russian business daily Vedomosti quoted an unnamed source as saying that Smolenkov, while serving under Ushakov, did not have access to information on Russia\u2019s election interference operation against the U.S., but did have access to \u201csensitive information,\u201d including intelligence information.\n\nThe source added that even without direct access to secret data, Smolenkov could have received it through conversations with colleagues.\n\nCNN sources also claimed Smolenkov had access to Putin and had been able to provide images of documents on Putin\u2019s desk.\n\nHowever, writing for Bloomberg, Russian journalist Leonid Bershidsky speculated that plans for any intelligence operation to disrupt the U.S. 2016 election would not have gone through Ushakov, and that he would not have been privy to them\n\n\u201cIn 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller produced a surprisingly detailed indictment of specific Russian military intelligence officers who allegedly hacked U.S. Democrats\u2019 computer networks and disseminated the stolen material. Data on the names, ranks and specific activities of the Russian officers wouldn\u2019t have landed anywhere near Ushakov\u2019s desk, and there would be no obvious way for an Ushakov aide like Smolenkov to obtain it in the line of his normal work,\u201d Bershidsky wrote.\n\nKommersant quoted another source as saying that Smolenkov was engaged in technical work like procurement and travel arrangements.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he could have told the Americans anything but rumors,\u201d the source told the Russian business daily.\n\nThe Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted another source who claimed to have worked with Smolenkov at the Russian Embassy in Washington as also downplaying his role as simply a technical one, adding that the alleged CIA asset was a frequent drinker.\n\nSmolenkov has also been accused of abandoning his ailing mother.\n\nThe New York Times, citing current and former officials, said the bulk of Russian state media reports amounted to government-directed disinformation, adding information about Smolenkov \u201ccould not be trusted.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper noted that playing down Smolenkov\u2019s importance was just as much a part of spycraft as exaggerating the importance of Russia\u2019s own recruits.\n\nKommersant quoted a government official as saying Smolenkov had continued to work with Ushakov after the latter\u2019s return to Moscow from the U.S., enjoying the trust of a senior official \u201cwith direct access to Putin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is serious,\u201d the official said.\n\nMeanwhile, Peskov\u2019s claim that Smolenkov was fired several years ago might be based on a technicality. As reported by the Russian-language news outlet Daily Storm, when Smolenkov, his wife (also a civil servant) and three children went to Montenegro on vacation in June 2017 and never returned, a murder investigation was opened several months later at the behest of Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee (a body analogous to the U.S. F.B.I.).\n\nSmolenkov was still identified as an employee of the Russian presidential administration at the time of his disappearance, which corresponds with the period that the CIA allegedly \u201cexfiltrated\u201d Smolenkov and his family.\n\nKommersant reported that the investigation was stopped and resumed several times. However, according to Kommersant, the Investigative Committee, in conjunction with Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service, ultimately determined that the alleged victims were alive and residing abroad.\n\nSmolenkov and his family are now believed to be living in Stafford, Virginia, some 40 miles south of Washington, DC. However, reports that Smolenkov has been living openly in the United States in a luxury house purchased under his own name have raised questions about why U.S. authorities did not take greater steps to protect the identity and ensure the security of a putative high-level CIA asset.\n\nAn NBC News reporter visited the Stafford home said to belong to Oleg Smolenkov, and the American news outlet published a story on September 9 about a \u201cformer senior Russian official\u201d who it said was living near Washington \u201cliving openly under his true name,\u201d but \u201cunder U.S. government protection.\u201d NBC News did not name him.\n\nThe Washington Post also sent reporters to the Stafford home, and on September 10, it published a story stating that a \u201cformer Russian government official thought to have spied for the United States was hiding in plain sight, living in a suburban neighborhood an hour outside of Washington.\u201d The newspaper reported that Oleg Smolenkov was listed in public records as owning a home in Stafford.\n\n\u201cIt is not clear that Smolenkov is the source who provided the United States with details on Russia\u2019s election interference,\u201d the newspaper reported. \u201cBut he was almost certainly a valuable CIA asset, according to current and former officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.\u201d\n\nFor its part, the Associated Press noted in a piece concerning press coverage of the spy story that both the Washington Post and NBC News were unable to \u201cconfirm that the person whose home they visited was the spy who gave the CIA information about election interference.\u201d\n\nAP also noted that other news organizations, including AP itself and National Public Radio (NPR), \u201ccited the inability to definitively tie the spy to the CIA\u2019s extraction mission as the reason why they have not used the person\u2019s name. NPR said the name was mistakenly used once in a report filed from Moscow, but wasn\u2019t repeated.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone has left the impression that this is the guy,\u201d Tom Bettag, former producer of ABC\u2019s \u201cNightline\u201d program and now a journalism professor at the University of Maryland, told AP. \u201cIt would be a terrible thing if it turns out that he\u2019s not. I think you have to be super-careful.\u201d\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Russian social media users have speculated that Smolenkov was nothing more than a \u201ccourier\u201d for information provided to the CIA, while a more highly placed agent obtaining that information \u201chas yet to be exposed.\u201d\n\nThe only certainty in the ongoing Smolenkov spying saga, the New York Times concluded, is that \u201che and his family has disappeared.\u201d\n\nAmid contradictory media reports, much remains unknown about Smolenkov\u2019s alleged role as a U.S. spy. Polygraph.info, however, finds Russian government efforts to downplay his potential importance to be misleading.", "lang": "en"}
