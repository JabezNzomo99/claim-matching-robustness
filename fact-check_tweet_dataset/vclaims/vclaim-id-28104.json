It\u2019s raining secularism in Maharashtra as soon as oath was taken. Policemen calling people and distributing tasbih after Jummah in Mumbra\u2019s Kausa Masjid. Jai Maharashtra.\u201d\n\nIT cell head of Pradhan Mantri Jankalyankari Yojana (PMJKY) Maharashtra Ruchika Gupta made the same claim, \u201cMumbai police distribute Tazbee at Kausa Masjid on the First Jummah after #UddhavThackeray Oath.\u201c\n\nThe claim has also been widely circulated on Facebook.\n\nAlt News contacted Mumbra police and was informed by inspector G. M. Mujawar that the claim propagated with the video is not true. \u201cThis was part of a community program and is unrelated to any new government,\u201d he said. The police distributed the tasbih during the National Integration Week (Qaumi Ekta Week) held after the Friday prayers on November 29.\n\nThis is an initiative of the ministry of home affairs and is celebrated across the country every year. The tweet below talks about Qaumi Ekta Week held in 2018.\n\nImages of the event held in past years have also been shared by the MHA.\n\nA press release on the event published last year by the MHA states, \u201cWith a view to foster and reinforce the spirit of Communal Harmony, National Integration and pride in vibrant, composite culture and nationhood, the \u201cQaumi Ekta Week\u201d (National Integration Week) will be observed all over the country, from tomorrow to 25th November, 2018.\u201d\n\nTherefore, a video of Mumbai police distributing tasbih (prayer beads used by Muslims) during National Integration Week held in the last week of November this year was shared on social media with a false narrative. This was not as a result of Uddhav Thackeray swearing-in as the CM of Maharashtra.", "lang": "en"}
