Another 11% were unsure.\u201d\n\nBeing uninterested or uncertain does not necessarily indicate resistance. The survey showed majority support for a coronavirus vaccine and strong support for vaccinations that have worked against other diseases.\n\nNot quite two-thirds of the respondents in the Reuters poll said they were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d interested in a coronavirus vaccine, while 84% said they believe in the safety of vaccines for diseases like the measles, both for adults and children.\n\nFurthermore, 29% of those who indicated they were \u201cnot very\u201d interested in taking a coronavirus vaccine said that would change if the vaccine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nOne expert told Reuters the number of respondents who said they were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d interested in a coronavirus vaccine was lower than he expected.\n\n\u201cI would have expected somewhere around 75 percent,\u201d William Schaffner, an infectious disease and vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, told the news agency.\n\nHowever, Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told Reuters that a combination of widespread disinformation about vaccines and mixed signals from authorities were the reason for the lower-than-expected interest in a coronavirus vaccine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising a significant percentage of Americans are not going to take the vaccine because of the terrible messaging we\u2019ve had, the absence of a communication plan around the vaccine and this very aggressive anti-vaccine movement,\u201d said Hotez, who is working on a vaccine.\n\nThe News Front article also mistakenly reported that at least 70% of Americans would need to be vaccinated to resist the virus and prevent its spread.\n\nIn fact, according to Reuters, experts estimate that 70% of Americans \u201cwould need to be immune through a vaccine or prior infection\u201d to achieve what is known as \u201cherd immunity,\u201d where a population is resistant to the virus.\n\nNews Front is a pro-Kremlin outlet with a record of publishing conspiratorial stories, including other fake news about the coronavirus. The EU-funded fact-checking site EUvsDisInfo has debunked stories by NewsFront claiming traditional medicine can cure COVID-19 and that the coronavirus vaccine is aimed at controlling world population.", "lang": "en"}
