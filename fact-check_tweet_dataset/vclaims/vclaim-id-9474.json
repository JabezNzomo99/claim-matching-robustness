On the other side of the debate, members of Congress are calling for policies that they argue could prevent mass shootings and keep guns out the wrong hands.\n\nThis is part one of two columns digging into the dueling claims on gun-control policy. On the surface, this seems like a simple case of cutting through the rhetoric to figure out what the facts tell us about gun control. But the fact of the matter is the evidence on both sides of the debate is murky. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nScalise also made the claim that strict gun-control laws have little effect, holding up Chicago, a city with some of the toughest gun laws in the country, according to Scalise, but still plagued by gun violence. This is not a novel argument from the gun-rights side of the debate. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also singled out Chicago in a news conference on Oct. 2, following the Vegas shooting, and President Trump made a similar claim during a presidential debate in 2016.\n\nThe city got its reputation for having the toughest laws in the country because of two laws that are no longer on the books. The city used to have a gun registry, but that ended in 2013 when the city council voted to adopt the state\u2019s concealed-carry laws. And in 2010, a federal appeals court struck down Chicago\u2019s decades-old handgun ban. The decision followed a 2008 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller that asserted the District of Columbia\u2019s ban on handguns violated the Second Amendment, setting a legal precedent for the country.\n\nWhen the numbers are analyzed on a per-capita basis, Chicago does not top the list. In 2016, St. Louis had the highest rate of non-fatal shootings with 660 per 100,000 people. Chicago, in contrast, had just 89 per 100,000 people. New Orleans had the highest rate of homicides in 2016, with 47 per 100,000 people. Chicago, in contrast had 16 per 100,000.\n\nScalise\u2019s misrepresentation of the data isn\u2019t the most controversial aspect of the statement. He\u2019s trying to make the case the tough gun laws don\u2019t work. He may have a point \u2014 The Fact Checker once documented how proposed gun laws would not have prevented any mass shootings that took place between 2012 and 2015 \u2014 but he cannot speak with such certainty.\n\nEven if Chicago or Illinois had the toughest gun laws in the country, it borders two states, Wisconsin and Indiana, that have lax gun laws. A 2015 study from the University of Chicago demonstrated how permeable borders contribute to gun violence in Chicago. Researchers traced all new guns recovered from crimes between 2009 and 2013, and they found that 60 percent of the new guns used in gang-related crimes in the city, and nearly 32 percent of the new guns used in non-gang-related crimes, were purchased in other states.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got 50 states, and each of them make dozens of changes to their gun laws each year,\u201d he said. \u201cAll you have to do is be selective: Find some state that happened to have an increase in its violence rates, and point to a change in the law.\u201d\n\nThis method can be used to make the opposite case that states with lax gun laws have more gun violence. For example, Alaska ranks 44th for its lenient gun-control policies, according to the Law Center. The state has the highest rate of gun deaths. Louisiana ranks 43rd for its lax policies, and it has the second-highest rate of gun deaths.\n\n\u201cThe Whip was perfectly clear in pointing out that while Chicago has some of the strictest gun control laws in the country, those policies have not produced a low level of gun violence,\u201d said Scalise spokesman Chris Bond. \u201cIn fact, the opposite is true, and the people of Chicago suffered more murders than any other American city last year. The point is, restricting the rights of law abiding citizens does not stop violent criminals who break the law to get guns in the first place. The victims of these criminals don\u2019t need a debate about semantics to tell them their city has one of the most serious gun violence problems in this country.\u201d\n\nThe claim about the impact of Chicago\u2019s gun laws on gun violence relies on outdated gun laws and shoddy data. The state of Illinois has tough gun laws, but several of the most restrictive laws, such as a ban on handguns and a gun registry, are no longer in use. And while the city may have high instances of gun violence \u2013 it does not have the highest rate of gun violence.\n\nEven if Scalise\u2019s data points were correct, to hold out one city as evidence the laws don\u2019t work is misleading. There are many factors that contribute to high instances of gun violence. And tough laws don\u2019t keep guns from being purchased in other states. Scalise is cherry-picking the data points to cast doubt on gun laws after a national tragedy. We\u2019ve wavering between Three and Four Pinocchios, but focusing on a single city tipped us to Four.
