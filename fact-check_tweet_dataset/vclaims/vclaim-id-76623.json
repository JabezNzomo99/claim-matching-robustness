Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, saw an opening for the Sunshine state.\n\n\"Hey @Uber, unlike California we in Florida welcome driverless cars - no permit required. #OpenForBusiness #FlaPol,\" Brandes tweeted Dec. 22.\n\nBrandes, who has been advocating for laws to allow driverless cars, is correct that Florida does not require a permit to operate or test a driverless car. But that doesn\u2019t mean people should expect to hitch an automated ride any time soon.\n\nSeveral car companies are developing fully autonomous or self-driving cars operated by computers and testing them in some states. But it could be several years before they are broadly publicly available due to the cost, questions about liability and the technology and as state government officials grapple with oversight.\n\nIn September 2016, federal transportation officials issued loose guidelines for driverless cars which gave companies the green light to push ahead. The rules included safety standards and called for states to come up with uniform policies.\n\nSome states have already done so. Since 2011, eight states -- Nevada, California, Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, North Dakota, Tennessee and Utah -- and the District of Columbia have passed legislation related to autonomous vehicles, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Governors in Arizona and Massachusetts issued executive orders related to autonomous vehicles. Legislation has failed or is pending in several other states.\n\nThe law is more strict in California than Florida.\n\nCalifornia passed a law in 2012 that allowed the testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads. Companies must apply for state permits and put up a $5 million bond. About 20 companies, including Tesla, Google and Mercedes-Benz, have been granted such permits.\n\nCalifornia revoked the registration of 16 Uber cars in December 2016 because the state said Uber lacked required permits. Uber complied but argued it didn\u2019t need the permits because the vehicles required monitoring by a person in the car.\n\nWhile California\u2019s law requires a permit, that\u2019s not the case in Florida.\n\n\"Florida has the least restrictive active state laws for the operation of autonomous vehicles,\" said John Terwilleger, an attorney at Gunster, Yoakley & Stewart in West Palm Beach. Terwilleger represents a company that is involved in developing and using autonomous vehicles in Florida.\n\nIn 2012, the Florida Legislature passed a law co-sponsored by Brandes that allowed a person with a valid driver\u2019s license to operate an autonomous vehicle. Before companies could test autonomous cars, they had to submit proof that they had $5 million in insurance.\n\nBut in 2016, the Florida Legislature passed new rules that eliminated some of the previous requirements, including the $5 million in insurance. The new law also got rid of the requirement that a human operator be present in the vehicle, as long as an operator can be alerted in case of technology failure and stop the vehicle.\n\nSince there is no permit for autonomous vehicles, the state has no information regarding how many Floridians own one, said Beth Frady, spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.\n\nFlorida law treats an autonomous vehicle in the same manner as any other motor vehicle operating on our roads, said Chris Spencer, a spokesman for Brandes.\n\n\"There are no requirements for additional permitting, licensing, or approval from any state or local government body to operate an autonomous vehicle on our roads,\" he said.\n\nThat\u2019s still the case, even though Florida was the location of the first fatality involving a self-driving car. In May, Joshua Brown, was killed when his Tesla while on autopilot crashed into a tractor-trailer in Williston.\n\nWhile Brandes is correct that there is no special permit requirement, don\u2019t expect driverless cars to flood Florida roads anytime soon.\n\nWhen Florida required testers to provide proof of insurance until that provision was dropped earlier this year, only one did.\n\nBrandes\u2019 tweet was a shout-out to Uber, so we checked on Uber\u2019s autonomous car plans.\n\nCurrently, Uber only operates self-driving cars in Pittsburgh, but they still have a human in the driver's seat, said Javi Correoso, an Uber spokesman for Florida. Uber moved its San Francisco cars to Arizona but hasn\u2019t started operating them yet.\n\nAnother hurdle to Uber\u2019s autonomous cars in Florida is that Uber\u2019s human-driven cars aren\u2019t everywhere in Florida. Only a handful of jurisdictions specifically allow Uber: Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Hillsborough counties, as well as the cities of Gainesville and Tallahassee.\n\nCorreoso said that Uber wants a statewide law to allow for Uber before it would move ahead with driverless cars in Florida.\n\n\"Until Florida passes statewide regulations, we haven\u2019t even started the process of bringing this technology to Florida,\" he said.\n\nBrandes tweeted, \"Unlike California, we in Florida welcome driverless cars - no permit required.\"\n\nFlorida does not require a permit to operate driverless cars. California requires companies that are testing such cars to get a permit. Although Florida law welcomes driverless cars, we found no evidence that they are commonly used in Florida.\n\nBrandes\u2019 comment is accurate, and we rate it True.", "lang": "en"}
