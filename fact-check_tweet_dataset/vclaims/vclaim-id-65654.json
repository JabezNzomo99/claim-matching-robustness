Other health officials have also continued to urge, and at times mandate, citizens to wear them amid some states experiencing a resurgence in COVID-19 cases and deaths.\n\nA viral post, which includes a diagram of a lung with inflamed tissue, claims wearing a face mask for \u201c8 hours a day\u201d causes pleurisy, a condition in which the tissue layers lining the lungs become inflamed. Over 4,300 Facebook users have shared the post as of press time.\n\nHowever, medical experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation that face masks don\u2019t pose such a risk.

The Pulmonary Associates of Mobile website actually recommends wearing a face mask to help prevent pleurisy caused by harmful or irritating particles in certain work environments.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Facebook users have shared misinformation related to the safety of face masks. Fact-checkers have previously debunked claims about face masks causing fungal pneumonia and low blood oxygen levels.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
