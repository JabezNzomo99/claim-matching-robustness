It appears to have come from a hospital in Ecuador.\n\nAs the new coronavirus continues to spread globally, the number of people killed by COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, has also increased. So far, more than 171,800 people have died worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.\n\nA viral video claims to capture the grim reality inside hospitals overwhelmed by coronavirus cases, allegedly showing the hallways of an unnamed New York City hospital filled with body bags of patients who have died from COVID-19. In recent weeks, people have widely shared the video on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.\n\n\u201cSituation in New York hospital, No place to store the dead bodies \u2026 mortuary is full,\u201d reads the caption of one such post. \u201cFor those who don\u2019t understand the importance of lock down.\u201d\n\nNew York has become the epicenter of the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, with more than 251,000 confirmed cases and 14,800 deaths at press time, according to the New York State Department of Health.

No news outlets picked up the footage, and social media users offer conflicting claims about where it was taken, including Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan and BronxCare Health System in the Bronx.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation confirmed with Erol Schneer, a spokesman for BronxCare Health System, that the video was not taken at the hospital. A representative for Lenox Hill Hospital also denied in a Twitter direct message to the DCNF that it was their hospital in the video.\n\n\u201cThe portion of the video filming the morgue space is absolutely NOT taken inside our morgue, or in the trailer outside of our hospital \u2014 which have been provided to all NYC hospitals,\u201d reads the Twitter direct message. \u201cOur morgue is locked and guarded by security at all times.\u201d\n\nAFP Fact Check traced a name visible on one of the body bags in another version of the footage and established that the man died in Ecuador. The man\u2019s obituary appeared in late March on a Facebook page for realtors in the Guayas province but has since been removed, according to AFP Fact Check.\n\nThe Los Ceibos Hospital in Guayas\u2019 capital city of Guayaquil released a statement on April 3 addressing a video circulating on social media that seems to match that of the Facebook post. A rough translation of the statement in part reads, \u201cThe corpses of COVID-19 patients remain in the hospital morgue, for at least 24 hours, before being transferred to refrigerated containers in the Parque de La Paz cemetery and others for their respective burials.\u201d\n\nThe health care system in Guayaquil has been overwhelmed by a surge in coronavirus-related deaths, according to The New York Times.
