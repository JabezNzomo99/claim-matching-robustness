His publicist has confirmed the attribution is false.\n\nThe lengthy post claims that Gibson, an actor known for his roles in films such as \u201cBraveheart\u201d and \u201cSigns,\u201d made a number of comments exposing the supposed \u201cepidemic of \u2018parasites\u2019 who \u2018control Hollywood\u2019 that are involved in child sacrifice and pedophilia\u201d after a 2017 appearance on \u201cThe Graham Norton Show.\u201d He made the comments in a green room backstage, the post alleges.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to comprehend, I know, and I\u2019m sorry that I am the one to break this to you, but Hollywood is an institutionalized pedophile ring,\u201d he supposedly said. \u201cThey use and abuse kids for their own sick \u2018spiritual beliefs,\u2019 if you can even call them that. I don\u2019t fully understand it myself, but they harvest these kids for their energy and feast on their blood.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no evidence to support that Gibson said the comments. While Gibson did appear on \u201cThe Graham Norton Show\u201d in 2017 to promote the movie \u201cDaddy\u2019s Home 2,\u201d he did not mention anything to that effect during it. The Daily Caller News Foundation found no news reporting about Gibson making the comments in the green room afterward or anywhere else.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that he never said such a thing,\u201d Alan Nierob, Gibson\u2019s publicist, told the fact-checking website Lead Stories. \u201cIn fact I, as well as representatives from Paramount studios, were with Mr. Gibson at that taping as well as with him for his entire promo tour, and he never stated that nor anything close to resembling those comments, period.\u201d\n\nThe text being shared appears to originate from a now-deleted 2017 article published by YourNewsWire, a website known for sharing misinformation. It does not provide sourcing for its claims. YourNewsWire now goes by NewsPunch, and the article is not available on NewsPunch\u2019s new website.
