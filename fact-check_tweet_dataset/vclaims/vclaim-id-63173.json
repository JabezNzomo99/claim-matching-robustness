It turns out that supplies that arrived on April 1 were purchased by the U.S. and a Russian investment fund.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "April 02, 2020", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-63173", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russian-covid-aid-usa/30526063.html", "vclaim": "Speaking at the White House COVID-19 press briefing on Monday, March 30, U.S. President Donald Trump said many foreign countries were sending help for the coronavirus pandemic. He specifically mentioned China and Russia, without specifying whether assistance was purchased or a form of humanitarian aid.\n\n\u201cRussia sent us a very, very large planeload of things, medical equipment, which was very nice.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement created a confusion, first because Russia had yet to send the plane when the U.S. president said it already had arrived. Secondly, Trump\u2019s critics assumed the aid was a gift, providing President Vladimir Putin a propaganda victory.\n\nRussian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov was the source of the misleading claim that the Russian supplies were of a \u201chumanitarian nature.\u201d\n\nPeskov said Putin offered to send humanitarian aid to the U.S. during a phone call with Trump on March 30, and that Trump \u201caccepted the offer with gratitude.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201csome on the American side\u201d did not support rapid implementation of the presidents\u2019 agreement, the Kremlin expects the spirit of cooperation to be mutual, Peskov added.\n\nOn Wednesday, April 1, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Twitter that Russia\u2019s \u201clargest cargo aircraft\u201d was en route to the U.S. to \u201chelp save lives of American citizens.\u201d The tweet used hashtag \u201cRussiaHelps,\u201d further suggesting a humanitarian gesture.\n\nThe Russian diaspora in the U.S. believed the supplies were a gift. The Russian Community Council in the U.S.A. sent a letter of gratitude to the Russian Foreign Ministry, saying: \u201cNumerous representatives of the Russian diaspora living in various parts of the United States are grateful to the residents of Russia and the Russian authorities for sending humanitarian aid, 120 tons of medicines, to the United States.\u201d\n\nA Russian Air Force An-124 \u201cRuslan\u201d took off from the Chkalovsk military airbase near Moscow on Wednesday, April 1, at around 4 p.m., Moscow time, and landed at New York\u2019s JFK International Airport at 4 p.m., Eastern Time, that same day.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said the plane was carrying surgical masks and equipment.\n\nBut in a move that unsettled the narrative, the U.S. State Department issued a statement that the U.S. actually bought the supplies from Russia.\n\n\u201cAs a follow-up to the March 30 phone call between President Trump and President Putin, the United States has agreed to purchase needed medical supplies, including ventilators and personal protection equipment, from Russia, which were handed over to FEMA on April 1 in New York City,\u201d the State Department said.\n\nThe U.S. did not provide the details of the purchase, including the price and the content of supplies. (FEMA stands for the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency, which responds to disasters like the pandemic.)\n\nOn April 2, the Russian Foreign Ministry confirmed that the cargo was indeed not entirely humanitarian \u2013 and added a new wrinkle.\n\nMoscow said the Americans paid for some of the supplies, while part of the cost was covered by the Kremlin\u2019s Direct Investment Fund, controlled by Putin.\n\nCritics have accused the Russians of trying to engineer a propaganda windfall by sending coronavirus supplies to places like the U.S., Italy and China while Russia\u2019s own COVID-19 response is wanting.\n\nIn Russia, the Doctor\u2019s Union accused authorities of covering up a coronavirus disaster. As in the U.S., hospitals across the country are reportedly in dire need of protective gear, masks and ventilators, the head of the union said in a video address.\n\nThe Russian authorities have been \u201cwaging a crusade\u201d to hide the true COVID-19 predicament under guise of fake news, the Associated Press reported.\n\nIn an op-ed for the Washington Post, Garry Kasparov, the exiled Russian world chess champion and Putin critic, compared the Kremlin\u2019s COVID-19 disinformation efforts to the Soviet regime\u2019s cover-up of the Chernobyl disaster.\n\n\u201cPutin\u2019s coronavirus malpractice isn\u2019t just the latest misery visited upon the Russian people; he also endangers the rest of the world. Remember the lessons of Chernobyl,\u201d Kasparov wrote.\n\nRussia\u2019s coronavirus aid to hard-hit Italy, dubbed \u201cFrom Russia with Love,\u201d came under criticism, after the Moscow Times and La Stampa newspapers reported that 80 percent of the supplies were \u201ctotally useless.\u201d\n\nPhotos and videos shared on social media showed Russian military convoys riding through Italian towns. Putin\u2019s \u201cpublicity coup\u201d left European Union exposed, Reuters reported, noting that it was not just the Russians seeking advantage.\n\nReuters reported: \u201cAlexander Baunov, a senior fellow at the Moscow Carnegie Center, noted China and Cuba were also sending medical aid to Italy. \u2018For countries that would like to see the existing world order revised in their favor, the pandemic is an opportunity,\u2019 he said.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
