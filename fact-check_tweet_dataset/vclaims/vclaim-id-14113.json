The world will have a generation of idiots.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller found no evidence of Einstein ever saying or writing this.\n\nEinstein is highly quotable, with an entire book devoted to quips and musings from the man who developed the theory of relativity and won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1921.\n\nHowever, this quote does not appear in \u201cThe Ultimate Quotable Einstein,\u201d a preeminent text on sayings from Einstein. Other attributions of this quote to Einstein do not provide a source or even the year in which he supposedly made the remark. It is often used to condemn increased reliance on technology, including smart phones and social media.\n\nThe Caller could not find any such statement in the archives of Einstein\u2019s writings online.\n\nThe quote may be a rewording of an expression incorrectly attributed to Einstein in the 1995 movie \u201cPowder\u201d in which one character said, \u201cIt\u2019s become appallingly clear that our technology has surpassed our humanity.\u201d Another character responded, \u201cAlbert Einstein,\u201d implying the musing originated with the physicist.\n\nThis second quote cannot be traced back to Einstein either, though it is possible that instances of misattribution since 1995 could be due to the film.\n\nIn one 1946 letter, Einstein did write, \u201cI believe that the abominable deterioration of ethical standards stems primarily from the mechanization and depersonalization of our lives \u2013 a disastrous byproduct of science and technology.\u201d\n\nBiographer Walter Isaacson says that Einstein\u2019s work has had a meaningful impact on many of the technologies available today. \u201cHis fingerprints are all over today\u2019s technologies,\u201d Isaacson has written. \u201cPhotoelectric cells and lasers, nuclear power and fibre optics, space travel, and even semiconductors all trace back to his theories.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
