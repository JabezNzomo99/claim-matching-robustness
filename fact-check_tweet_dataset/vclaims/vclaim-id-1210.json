This claim is untrue.\n\nAn example can be seen here and here .\n\nSome of the posts falsely claim a link to sex trafficking. One post reads: \u201cSo the person who created and runs victoria secret (sic) buys people\u2019s souls and he has something to do with the sex trafficking going on. did you know that if you cut your tag in half, there is a chip/tracker on the inside. if you don\u2019t want to cut your tag to see, just put it up to the light. shocked (also tell me why the trackers are ONLY in bras and lingerie?? not shirts, sweatpants, ONLY lingerie)\u201d ( here )\n\nImpinj, an RFID company, reported in November 2019 that clothing retailers, including Inditex, Nike, Levi\u2019s, Macy\u2019s, lululemon, UNIQLO and L Brands, use RFID technology to keep track of inventories ( here ). Regarding L Brands, which owns Victoria\u2019s Secret, Impinj said: \u201cAbout 1,100 of the company\u2019s stores are slated to begin using RAIN RFID by summer 2020, with almost 350 receiving these capabilities by the end of this year. Victoria\u2019s Secret is one of retail\u2019s largest specialty apparel brands and is planning to launch RFID to provide real-time inventory tracking across the chain.\u201d\n\nIn a 2019 investor update meeting document, L Brands discussed the use of digital data science and technology, including RFID ( here ). A spokesperson for Victoria\u2019s Secret told Reuters via email: \u201cLike many other retailers, this technology helps us deliver a great store experience by ensuring we have the right products available for our customers. We only use this technology in our back room and sales floors to help us manage inventory so that our associates can efficiently support our customers\u2019 needs.\u201d\n\nFalse. Victoria\u2019s Secret uses RFID tags on items for inventory purposes.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our fact-checking work here .", "lang": "en"}
