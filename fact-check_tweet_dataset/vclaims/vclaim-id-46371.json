The Met Police said on Saturday evening that there were no reported stabbings at that day\u2019s protests. It confirmed to Full Fact on Monday 15 June that this was still the case.\n\nThere were at least two stabbings reported in London from Friday to Sunday, but they do not appear to have been related to, or in the vicinity of, the protests. \n\n\n\n113 people were arrested at the demonstration for a range of offences.\n\nThis article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook.
