No, that's not true: the story was made up by a liberal satire website that also invented the whole Ted Nugent concert in an earlier article it published. None of it is real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by America's Last Line of Defense on January 7, 2019 titled \"BREAKING: Jerry Jones Gives Ted Nugent a Night at Texas Stadium and $3 Million For Wall Benefit Concert\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nTexas Stadium is about to be the home of the biggest benefit show on Earth. Jerry Jones, the sole owner of the complex, has given Ted Nugent permission to put on his \"Build the Wall Benefit Concert\" as early as January 30th. Jones has thrown in the cost of the lights and a million dollars in money to help pay the crew and set up concession stand fundraisers. Nugent, a longtime conservative and a Trump supporter, is well-known in the world of Rock and Roll for not getting into the Hall of Fame, and to veterans as a draft-dodger. Those days, however, are behind him. According to the Nuge: \"I know I had a rough go in my earlier years and I regret crapping myself to avoid Nam, but damn...it was Vietnam. Nobody wanted to go there. The fact that I betrayed my country is null and void when you consider that I'm gonna raise a couple billion for our security. Then they'll appreciate ol' Uncle Ted.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so it would not have been clear to the people liking and sharing it that it was all just satire:\n\nBut the story itself was posted under the category \"Satire Isn't Always funny\" and the header of the site has a caption that reads \"Information you probably shouldn't trust\". That was certainly the case with this article.\n\nAnd the supposed Ted Nugent concert to raise money for a border wall? Made up by the same site:\n\nThe site comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes wearethellod.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
