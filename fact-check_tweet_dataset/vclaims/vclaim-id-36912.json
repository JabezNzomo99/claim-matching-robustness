BOOM found the video is from November 27, 2018, a day before MP started aseembly polls and not from the general elections.\n\nThe 48-second video shows EVMs kept in a hotel room with four men present in the room. A group of people can be heard questioning the four men present who identify themselves as polling officers on election duty and when asked about the EVMs, explain that they were not for use but were from the reserve poll.\n\nThe video is being shared on Facebook with the claim that an EVM was recovered from a hotel recently.\n\nIt is being shared with a caption, 'Ye EVM hotel main kya kar Rahi hai' which translates to, 'What is this EVM doing in a hotel?'.\n\nClick here to view the post, and here for an archive. BOOM also found other posts with a similar caption.\n\nThe video is also being shared on Twitter with a caption in Tamil.\n\nBOOM received this video on its WhatsApp helpline number (7700906111) enquiring if the incident was recent.\n\nBOOM found that the same video was viral on WhatsApp and Facebook since November 28 2018, the day of the Madhya Pradesh assembly elections.\n\nIn the video, one of the people recording it asks the men present in the room to identify themselves and where they are from, one of them responds with \"Shajapur\" which is a district in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nBOOM ran a Google search with the key words 'Madhya Pradesh', 'EVM' 'Hotel' and found various news articles from local media and regional news outlets with most of them published on November 28, 2018.
