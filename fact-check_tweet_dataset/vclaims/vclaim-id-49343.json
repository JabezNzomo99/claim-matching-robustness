It could also deal a blow to the U.S. economy, said MSNBC host Chris Hayes, who argued on his primetime TV show that the policy has \"no upside.\"\n\n\"Higher education is one of America's strongest export sectors,\" Hayes said, while displaying a chart on U.S. education exports. \"Over 1 million international students studied at American universities, (in the) 2018-19 school year. They contributed over $40 billion to the economy.\"\n\nHayes\u2019 statistics are accurate. In 2019, U.S. service exports from education totaled roughly $44 billion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That made education the sixth largest service export for the year, behind services such as personal travel and professional and management consulting, a spokesperson for the International Trade Administration said.\n\nAcademic experts and representatives from nonprofits focused on international education also backed Hayes\u2019 claims. An ICE spokesperson said Hayes\u2019 statement was accurate but declined to comment further due to pending litigation.\n\n\"Higher education is one of the few areas in which we have a big surplus of exports over imports,\" said Dick Startz, professor of economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who wrote about the economics of education in a 2017 article for the Brookings Institution.\n\nAll three of the statistics Hayes cited are correct.\n\nMore than 1 million international students studied at U.S. institutions during the 2018-19 academic year, according to the Institute of International Education and NAFSA: Association of International Educators, two nonprofits dedicated to international education.\n\nThe two organizations reported that those international students contributed more than $40 billion to the U.S. economy during the year. Experts said higher education can be considered an export because international students pay their tuition and living expenses to colleges and universities using money from abroad.\n\n\"International students are buying an American education,\" Startz said. \"Hence it\u2019s an export.\"\n\nExports from education amounted to roughly $44 billion in 2019, up from about $42.6 billion in 2018, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That\u2019s more than the U.S. made from exporting many other goods and services in the same timeframe.\n\nEducation ranked sixth among service exports in 2019, the International Trade Administration spokesperson told us. It was fifth in 2018.\n\nThose numbers make sense when you factor in the cost of college, said Judith Scott-Clayton, professor of economics and education at Columbia University\u2019s Teachers College.\n\n\"If there are 1.1 million international students in the country, and each of them spends about $40,000 on U.S. tuition and living expenses, that gets you to $44 billion,\" she said.\n\nIn an email to PolitiFact, Hayes also cited the International Trade Administration and an article in the New York Times Magazine in which an Institute of International Education adviser was quoted saying \"higher education is one of America\u2019s biggest exports.\"\n\nBut the article said U.S. schools were losing their international appeal for a number of reasons, including rising tuition costs and various policies enacted under President Donald Trump.\n\nRachel Banks, NAFSA\u2019s senior director for public policy and legislative strategy, said in a statement that new international student enrollment is down over 10% since the fall of 2016, a trend NAFSA estimates has cost the U.S. economy $11.8 billion.\n\n\"That\u2019s before the impacts of a global pandemic and related travel restrictions, several presidential proclamations targeting immigrants and nonimmigrants, and this guidance,\" Banks said. \"Therefore, we don\u2019t anticipate this downward trajectory to reverse itself anytime soon.\"\n\nHayes said, \"Higher education is one of America's strongest export sectors. Over 1 million international students studied at American universities, 2018-19 school year. They contributed over $40 billion to the economy.\"\n\nGovernment agencies, academic experts and nonprofit organizations said Hayes\u2019 statistics are correct. The money the U.S. gets from foreign students studying at its colleges and universities makes education one of the country\u2019s top service exports.", "lang": "en"}
