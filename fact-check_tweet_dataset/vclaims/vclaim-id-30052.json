As a result, he added, \u201cTeesside men have the same life expectancy of those in Ethiopia\u201d.\n\nAlex Cunningham\u2019s office told us that this figure came from a BBC report about the large life expectancy gap within Stockton-on-Tees. This mentions Stockton Town Centre, a ward in Mr Cunningham\u2019s constituency where male life expectancy is 64. The BBC article is correct, although the figure has since risen to 65.\n\nThis is about the same figure that the World Bank recorded for men in Ethiopia in 2017. UK life expectancy figures are not published by constituency, but men in the London borough of Hillingdon, which contains the prime minister\u2019s constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, have a life expectancy of 80.4. That\u2019s about 15 or 16 years higher than the ward in Stockton. Mr Cunningham\u2019s office said they chose 14 as a conservative estimate because the BBC article was slightly dated.\n\nIt\u2019s worth bearing in mind that these figures don\u2019t mean that men are predicted to live as long as 64 or 80.4 years in these areas, because health and mortality rates are usually expected to improve by the time men born today reach these ages.\n\nHow low is a life expectancy of 64?\n\nA life expectancy of 64 is extremely low for the UK, where the latest average for men is 79.3, so it is understandable that Mr Cunningham and the BBC would want to bring Stockton Town Centre to public attention.\n\nHowever, the adult population there makes up less than a tenth of registered voters in Stockton North, so Mr Cunningham is wrong to suggest that their story represents his constituency in general, let alone Teesside as a whole. In fact, men in the borough of Stockton-on-Tees have an average life expectancy of 78.1, just two years less than in Hillingdon and 14 more than in Ethiopia.\n\nIn his reply, Boris Johnson called the discrepancy in life expectancy in the UK \u201ca disgrace\u201d. \u201cBut it is coming down and it will come down,\u201d he added.\n\nIt is not clear whether the Prime Minister had in mind the discrepancy in life expectancy between rich and poor, or between the North East and London, but he is wrong in either case. Life expectancy in the North East continues to rise more slowly than it does in London, widening the gap between them all the time.\n\nMeasuring the life expectancy gap by income is more complicated, but analysis by scientists on the Longevity Science Panel shows that it was widening, at least until 2015, which is the most recent data in the analysis.\n\nIt is true that UK life expectancy is at an all-time high, but it is now rising much more slowly than it has in the past, and at different rates for different people. We\u2019ve looked at these figures in more detail before.", "lang": "en"}
