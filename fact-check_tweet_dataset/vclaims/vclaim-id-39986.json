When prorogation happens, it typically lasts less than a week. \n\n\n\nMr Major was accused by political opponents and the media at the time of doing this to prevent the \u201ccash-for-questions\u201d report being published before the upcoming general election. Whether or not that was his reason for proroguing parliament, it had that effect\u2014the report was eventually published in July 1997.\n\nThe post also claims correctly that John Major joined a court case to stop the current prorogation of parliament.\n\nYou can read more about proroguing parliament here.", "lang": "en"}
