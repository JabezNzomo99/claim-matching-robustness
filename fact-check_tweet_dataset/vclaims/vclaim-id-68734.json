At least 12 of the Las Vegas shooter\u2019s guns were outfitted with them.\n\nBut did Obama approve their legality? Sort of, but approved is probably the wrong word.\n\nNRA spokeswoman Amy Hunter pointed us to a June 2010 approval letter from ATF, an agency under executive purview, sent to Slide Fire, a bump stock manufacturer. Spelling out the legal definition of a firearm, ATF\u2019s technology chief John Spencer determined it was not regulated by law.\n\n\"The stock has no automatically functioning mechanical parts or springs and performs no automatic mechanical function when installed,\" Spencer wrote. \"Accordingly, we find that the \u2018bump-stock\u2019 is a firearm part and is not regulated as a firearm under Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act.\"\n\nBump stocks harness a weapon\u2019s recoil to cause the user\u2019s finger to squeeze the trigger repeatedly, but because they don\u2019t alter the gun\u2019s internal mechanisms, they were considered lawful.\n\nBut just as these bump stocks didn\u2019t qualify for regulation, two similar devices did.\n\nThe difference? The Akins Accelerator and the Autoglove were determined in 2007 and 2017, respectively, to have mechanical parts that enhanced the trigger mechanism, making them by definition machineguns.\n\n\"Electrically-driven trigger devices are considered \u2018machineguns\u2019 because they are a \u2018combination of parts designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun,\u2019 \" ATF\u2019s letter to AutoGlove read.\n\nAutomatic weapons sales have been restricted since the 1934 National Firearms Act, and 1986 regulations made it much harder for civilians to get an automatic weapon like a machine gun.\n\nExperts in firearm policy were divided when we asked about the fairness of the NRA\u2019s characterization.\n\nAdam Winkler, a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles, who specializes in guns, said it was appropriate to characterize the move as an approval of its sale under the Obama administration.\n\n\"Not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it,\" Winkler said.\n\nOther legal experts stressed that it wasn\u2019t an approval, but rather a determination that current law didn\u2019t allow for its regulation.\n\n\"The statement implies Obama or (U.S. Attorney General Eric) Holder was somehow involved, and that it was an issue that wouldn\u2019t have been approved in any other administration, and that\u2019s technically incorrect,\" said Rick Vasquez, a former Firearms Technology Branch official who first signed off on the recommendation the ATF could not regulate the Slide Fire.\n\n\"We never had any political people come down to our office saying we must or must not approve (the Slide Fire),\" Vasquez said.\n\nObama issued a slew of executive orders promoting stricter gun control, which the Trump administration has been rolling back, including a measure that previously prevented people with mental illness from buying guns.\n\n\"I believe (the NRA) were stating that just to point out that this wasn\u2019t some rogue decision made during a Republican administration, which would be more friendly to gun owners, and therefore that when they re-evaluate it, they\u2019re going to have to take a really close look at the law,\" said John Pierce, a lawyer and advocate for gun rights.\n\nIn order to re-evaluate the bump stock, Vasquez said the ATF would have to change the way it interpreted the National Firearms Act or issue new legislation that would allow the device to be regulated.\n\nThe NRA said, \"The Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions.\"\n\nWe indeed found two occasions in which ATF, a bureau within the executive branch, decided it could not regulate bump stocks during the Obama administration.\n\nThese decisions allowed two companies to sell bump stocks. It\u2019s important to note this was not a statement of Obama\u2019s preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns, but was what the agency determined it had to do under the language of current law.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
