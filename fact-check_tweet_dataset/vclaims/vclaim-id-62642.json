The bottom of the image includes a quote, allegedly from Trump, that says, \u201cI knew Osama Bin Laden. People loved him. He was a great man that died for a worthy cause.\u201d (RELATED: Did Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama And Condoleezza Rice Pose For Photos With Osama bin Laden?)\n\nThrough a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that the image has been digitally manipulated. The original photo, taken in December 1987, actually shows Trump greeting Newhouse at a party in Trump Tower, according to the Getty Images caption. In the manipulated image, Trump\u2019s head has been superimposed onto Newhouse\u2019s, and bin Laden\u2019s has been superimposed onto Trump\u2019s.\n\nThe comment attributed to Trump doesn\u2019t hold up either. An internet search by the Caller didn\u2019t yield any media outlets attributing it to him, only other fact-checkers debunking it. Nor has Trump ever tweeted it from his verified Twitter accounts.\n\nCheck Your Fact has previously debunked images claiming to show politicians such as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice posing with bin Laden.", "lang": "en"}
