The claim is false; Sri Lankan authorities said the coronavirus has not been discovered in poultry; the photos were taken from various unrelated reports online and show chickens sickened with other diseases.\n\nThe images were published on Facebook here on March 3, 2020. The post has been shared more than 2,500 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Sinhala-language caption translates to English as: \u201cEXCLUSIVE Chicken also infected with coronavirus. We can no longer eat chicken?\u201d\n\nThe novel coronavirus, COVID-19, was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late December 2019. The virus has killed more than 6,000 people and infected 163,930 worldwide, including sports stars, celebrities and world leaders, AFP reported here on March 16, 2020.\n\nThe photos were also shared with a similar claim on Facebook here and here.\n\n\u201cSo far there is no evidence to claim that chicken is infected with the novel coronavirus and that it's unsafe to consume chicken,\u201d Dr. R. Hettiarachchi, the acting director general of Sri Lanka\u2019s Animal Production and Health Department, told AFP by phone on March 11, 2020.\n\nHettiarachchi said there was no need to \u201cconcern oneself over eating chicken\u201d and warned that such \u201cbaseless claims can really damage the poultry industry.\u201d\n\nDr. Ashan Pathirana, the registrar of Sri Lanka\u2019s Health Promotion Bureau, also said chicken remains safe to consume and cautioned the public against \u201cunnecessary panic\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile it is important to practise general good food safety measures such as avoiding contamination of uncooked proteins and avoiding raw or uncooked meats, there is no need to create an unnecessary panic over baseless claims,\u201d Pathirana told AFP on March 5, 2020.\n\nDr. Pathirana urged the public to only trust verified government sources when sharing information about the coronavirus.\n\nThe images used in the misleading posts were also being shared out of context. They werre taken from various unrelated reports online and show chickens sickened with other diseases. They were debunked here and here by AFP after circulating in similar posts in India and Pakistan.", "lang": "en"}
