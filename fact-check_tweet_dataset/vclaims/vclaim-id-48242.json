I have not participated in any such webinar. I am afraid in this age of fake news it is hard to respond to every such occurrence. I can only say that I post all my relevant public statements on this site only,\u201d Rajan wrote.\n\nMoreover, we did not find any mention of such a webinar on the website of the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThis clarifies beyond doubt that this post is fake.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
