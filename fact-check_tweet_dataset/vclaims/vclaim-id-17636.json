No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to educate gullible Trump supporters and Republicans about the need to actually click and read links before sharing or liking them in order to avoid being embarrassed by fans of the site later. All the events described in the article are not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Daily World Update on April 25, 2019 titled \"Robert DeNiro Loses $40 Million Reunion Contract - Blames Trump\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nRobert DeNiro isn't much to look at in person. At 5-foot-2 and just over 140 pudgy pounds, he wears platform shoes and a mean look on his face to feel tough. We've all seen those videos where he does the whole \"Trump is a punk\" thing. It's ridiculous. He's like an overgrown toddler with an Oscar or two. His outbursts will now cost him. According to our insider at Universal MGM, DeNiro's negative image among older Americans lost him the $40 million role of a lifetime: \"Bob was on his way to his biggest payday ever when the studio called. It was Art Tubolls himself. He told Bobby that they were passing on him for the Goodfellas sequel. They're gonna kill him off instead. Him and Liota were supposed to split $40 million up front with another $40 million guaranteed for the backend. Now they're bringing Pesci back to life instead.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThere even is a satire warning in the thumbnail image visible on social media when the story is shared there. On the page itself there are at least three more and several hints the story is false. For example the words \"our insider\" link to a Google translation of the phrase \"A person who does not exist but in fiction.\" and the name \"Art Tubolls\" is an anagram for \"Busta Troll\", the nickname of the man running the site.\n\nOh, and contrary to what the article implies, Joe Pesci is not dead yet. In fact he is working with DeNiro and several other Goodfellas cast members on a new gangster movie directed by Martin Scorsese that should come out this fall:\n\nThe site posting the hoax is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run byself-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine and his partner in crime John Prager along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry extremely visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nWe wrote about dailyworldupdate.us before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar DID NOT Praise the Destruction of Notre Dame\n\u2022 Fake News: Nancy Pelosi Did NOT Have 150-Year-Old Sign Removed From House Chamber Entrance\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Body In Ohio River Confirmed As Major Clinton Aide\n\u2022 Fake News: Whoopi Goldberg NOT Fired From 'The View' After 'Whiteface' Controversy\n\u2022 Fake News: Liberal Vandals Did NOT Spray Joshua Trump's House With Racist Graffiti", "lang": "en"}
