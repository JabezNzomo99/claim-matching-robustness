The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that \u201cTo date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus\u201d.\n\nThe U.S. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) has warned that:\n\n\u201cThe media has reported that some people are seeking \u201calternative\u201d remedies to prevent infection with COVID-19 or to treat the virus. Some of these purported remedies include herbal therapies and teas. There is no scientific evidence that any of these alternative remedies can prevent or cure the illness caused by COVID-19.# In fact, some of them may not be safe to consume.\u201d\n\nBoth PolitiFact and Reuters evaluated the claim that marijuana can cure or treat COVID-19; PolitiFact rated it \u201cPants on Fire\u201d, while Reuters labeled the claim \u201cfalse\u201d. AFP also fact-checked a claim that drinking boiled ginger water cures COVID-19; experts interviewed by AFP labeled this claim as false.\n\nClinical trials are underway to find an effective treatment for patients with COVID-19. In order to do this both safely and quickly, health authorities have taken the approach of investigating existing and approved drugs. An example is the WHO\u2019s Solidarity clinical trial, which aims to recruit several thousand patients globally to test four different treatments: remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir with interferon-beta, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. This trial will be complemented by a European clinical trial called Discovery that will test the same treatments with the exception of chloroquine.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised individuals showing mild symptoms of COVID-19 to stay at home to avoid infecting others, and to call their doctor for medical advice before they visit a clinic or hospital in person. Some advice that people can follow in order to care for themselves at home are listed here. Individuals should seek medical attention immediately if they show signs including, but not limited to, breathing difficulties, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, and bluish lips or face.\n\nFact-checkers have debunked a multitude of claims about \u201calternative\u201d cures for COVID-19. See a list of all coronavirus-related reviews by Health Feedback, including these about gargling with salt water or vinegar and using vitamin C supplementation to prevent or cure COVID-19.\n\nPolitiFact also compiled a list of myths on COVID-19 treatment.", "lang": "en"}
