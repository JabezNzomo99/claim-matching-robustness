I am not a fan of Jaffa Cakes\u2014let it be known that if I am offered a Jaffa Cake, I will refuse. I do not consider them to be essential to my life; I can give or take them. I recognise that razors are zero-rated, and judging by many Conservative Members the opportunity to shave every day is a human right. They are cleanly shaven, and I am sure they would be concerned to be charged a higher rate of VAT. Pitta bread is zero-rated\u2014we can probably all agree that that is a necessity. What is the kebab without a good pitta bread around it? It is a necessity.\"\n\nA number of MPs have called for an end to the \"tampon tax\", arguing that tampons and other sanitary products are essential items and so VAT shouldn't have to be paid on them.\n\nCurrently they're subject to a VAT rate of 5%, reduced from the standard rate of 20%.\n\n\n\nNo VAT is paid on cakes, on the other hand. After no small amount of controversy it's been determined that Jaffa Cakes count as cakes, despite having \"characteristics of both cakes and biscuits\", and so we don't need to pay VAT on them.\n\nRazor blades, on the other hand, are taxed at the standard 20% rate. We've also asked HM Revenue & Customs, who confirmed that. We've asked Ms Creasy's office to comment.\n\nAnd in the case of pitta bread, it's complicated. If you buy it at the supermarket you pay no VAT, as with other bread. But if it's part of a hot take-away meal (wrapped around a kebab for instance) it'll be taxed at 20%.\n\nEU rules mean that VAT rates can't be lowered below 5%. Categories of products that were already taxed below this rate prior to 1991\u2014like cakes and bread\u2014can continue to be taxed at that lower rate (0%, in practice).\n\nThe government says that all 28 EU countries would have to agree to any changes to the rules. The authorisation for the EU to make rules on this at all comes from an article of the EU treaties that requires them to be passed \"unanimously\".", "lang": "en"}
