Her last name is not visible.\n\n\u201cI will not shop at Costco until you remove your mandatory mask rule!\u201d the user purportedly wrote. Her comment seems to reference the wholesale retailer\u2019s requirement that customers wear face coverings while in Costco stores to help curb the spread of coronavirus.\n\nCostco allegedly replied, \u201cThank you for taking such a brave stand, Sharon. We look forward to the documentary they will make about you some day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, not a very professional response Costco!\u201d reads a supposed response from another Facebook user named Jack. \u201cLooks like I will be getting a membership refund myself! IT SHOULD BE A CHOICE!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve chosen not to refund you,\u201d Costco purportedly said in response.

Palmer, a comedian who parodies customer service responses, actually created the exchange, he confirmed in a Facebook direct message to the Daily Caller. He posted the fake exchange to his satirical Facebook page Hope This Helps on May 6.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time one of Palmer\u2019s creations has gone viral. In 2018, he created a fake Facebook page for the City of Atlanta that got shut down after he announced that the city was going to destroy Stone Mountain, according to BuzzFeed News.\n\nOther examples of Palmer impersonating organizations such as the City of Los Angeles and Home Depot can be found on his website.", "lang": "en"}
