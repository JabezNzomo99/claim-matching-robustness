The hoax has circulated in other countries.\n\nThe image, posted March 23, shows an alert message from the Neighbors app warning users about the U.S. military\u2019s supposed effort to limit the spread of the new coronavirus with pesticides. A map visible in the image suggests that users in San Diego received the alert.\n\n\u201cSo you must stay indoors after twelve o\u2019clock at night and remove all clothes which are outside,\u201d instructs the alert. \u201cWhen you hear the sounds of airplanes at night, it is for you to know that it is related to this matter (COVID-19).\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump outlined on March 22 the federal government\u2019s plan to fund the National Guard\u2019s efforts to combat the new virus in New York, California and Washington, three of the states hit hardest by the new coronavirus.\n\nThere is no evidence that the U.S. military is spraying coronavirus-killing pesticides from helicopters, however. The Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any credible reports of an operation like this taking place on March 23 or any other date.\n\nA spokesman for the Pentagon confirmed that the military has no such plans. Similar messages have been debunked by fact-checkers in India and Pakistan, among other countries.
