(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe first quote about being the \"president's nightmare\" is real. There\u2019s no evidence for the explosive second part about white men in chains.\n\nOmar appeared on the The Daily Show with Trevor Noah in July 2017, then as a Minnesota state House representative. Omar filed to run for the U.S. Congress in June 2018 after Democratic U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison decided to run for the state\u2019s attorney general office instead of seeking re-election. On Nov. 6, Omar was elected to Congress.\n\nIn her Daily Show appearance, Noah told Omar she had a unique story, coming to the United States a refugee, being a Muslim, and a woman. \"You are everything that President Trump seems to be against. And you are in government. What\u2019s the plan?\" Noah asked Omar.\n\n\"I am America\u2019s hope and the president\u2019s nightmare,\" Omar responded.\n\nAt no point in that interview did Omar say anything about white men in chains as slaves for not submitting to Islam.\n\nOmar also did not say in the Time magazine interview, even though the meme uses the photo from that interview. We found no evidence that Omar made those comments.\n\nWithout credible evidence for the assertion, we rate the statement Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
