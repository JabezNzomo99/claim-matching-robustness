Obamacare, would reduce the number of hours worked by the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time workers by 2025. As we have explained before, that means that workers will decide to reduce their hours, not that employers are reducing the number of jobs.\n\nMoreover, the CBO estimate was a mix of full-time and part-time workers, which result in the hours worked equal to that many full-time workers. But some workers might reduce their weekly hours by only an hour or two, so the impact on overall jobs would be muted.\n\nThe reason that we don\u2019t use the term \u201clost jobs\u201d is there\u2019s a critical difference between people who like to work and can\u2019t find a job or have a job that was lost for reasons beyond their control and people who choose not to work. If somebody comes up to you and says, \u201cWell, the boss said I\u2019m being laid off because we don\u2019t have enough business to pay me,\u201d that person feels bad about that and we sympathize with them having lost their job. If somebody comes to you and says, \u201cI\u2019ve decided to retire\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ve decided to stay home and spend more time with my family\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve decided to spend more time doing my hobby,\u201d they don\u2019t feel bad about it, they feel good about it, and we don\u2019t sympathize. We say congratulations. And we don\u2019t say they\u2019ve lost their job because they have chosen to leave that job.\n\nNow look back at what the ad says. Jacobs, when he is speaking, frames it correctly by talking about workers: \u201cThe Congressional Budget Office concluded that because of Obamacare, we are going to have 2\u00bd million less people working.\u201d\n\nJacobs further says that although Obama tries to spin the CBO finding \u201cas a good thing, I think that is a bunch of malarkey.\u201d That\u2019s in the realm of personal opinion, beyond the scope of The Fact Checker, but Jacobs is echoing a mainstream conservative critique of the law. There is little dispute that a reduction in the size of the labor force will yield a slightly smaller economy. The question is whether introducing near-universal health care is worth that trade-off, and Democrats do argue that it is a good thing.\n\nThe ad headline also cites a state loss figure of 27,000, which stems from an analysis by the Americans for Tax Reform, which is titled \u201cHow many Jobs Might Obamacare Cost Your State?\u201d The anti-tax group did a simple calculation, based on how many jobs each state currently has.\n\nBut we have previously found fault with the group\u2019s methodology, saying it was inherently misleading. Not every state expanded Medicaid, so the effects are different. (Iowa eventually accepted a modified version of Medicaid expansion.) Every state also has a different distribution of income, so there can be vast differences in the percentage of people who will be affected by the subsidies for low-income workers and the law\u2019s taxes on the wealthy. That could also significantly change the result, state by state.\n\nMoreover, because the estimate of hours is a mix of full-time and part-time work, there is no one-to-one relationship between the reduction in full-time equivalent workers and the fewer jobs that will exist in the economy. In other words, GOP candidates should not be using the ATR study in their campaign ads.\n\nThis ad poses a bit of a conundrum. We had previously said that \u201ccost jobs\u201d ads will earn Three Pinocchios. For non-economists, the use of the phrase \u201cjobs\u201d is especially confusing because it sounds like the decision made by employers, rather than workers.\n\nGiven that so many Americans mute their TV during campaign ads, we have the sneaky suspicion that the campaign decided a misleading \u201cjobs lost\u201d phrasing would have more impact, no matter how careful the candidate tried to be. So this still qualifies as a Two Pinocchio ad.", "lang": "en"}
