Muslims are saying that they have understood the abominable and hateful face of Islam.)\u201d \u2013 reads the message.\n\nThe claim has been propagated with the help of two photographs showing people wearing skull caps demolishing a structure.\n\nIt has also been circulated by a few Twitter users.\n\nWhy was the mosque demolished?\n\nReverse-searching the images led us to a May 29, 2019 article in Sri Lankan news website Daily Mirror.\n\n\u201cA mosque used by the National Thawheed Jama\u2019at (NTJ) at Madatugama in Kekirawa was yesterday demolished by the area Muslims and devotees of the main mosque,\u201d per the report. \u201cTrustee of the main mosque M H M Akbar Khan said the mosque used by the NTJ was built with the funds of an organization based in a foreign country,\u201d it continued.\n\nNTJ is the Sri Lankan Islamist extremist group which was implicated in the 2019 Easter Bombings where over 250 people were killed in coordinated attacks.\n\nDaily Mirror also uploaded a video of the incident.\n\nApart from the mosque, residents also destroyed a plaque with Arabic inscriptions, per a report by local media outlet Hiru News.\n\nA video of the demolition uploaded by Sri Lankan news channel Ada Derana shows people demolishing a blue coloured structure with sledgehammers.\n\nAlt News contacted a Sinhalese translator who said that the people in the video claim that the mosque was constructed using funds from Arab countries. \u201cEven the words on the board [plaque] are Arabic,\u201d said one of the residents. Speaking to Ada Derana, the demolishers added that they have their own traditional place of worship [main mosque] and disapproved of \u201cunnecessary Arab influence\u201d on mosques.\n\nAFP had earlier fact-checked the video when it was viral weeks after April\u2019s easter bombings. The news organisation spoke to Kekirawa Police officer-in-charge Thilak Bandara Ganegoda regarding viral claims suggesting Muslims converted to Hinduism. The officer informed, \u201cNo religious conversions took place. The land was previously allocated to construct a children\u2019s library and was handed over to its rightful owner.\u201d\n\nAkbar Khan had led the movement to tear down the building, according to AFP. \u201cIt was not demolished because of any link between that building and the NTJ or because any religious conversion took place,\u201d he said. Khan echoed the statements of residents earlier mentioned in this report. He told Hiru Newsthat the mosque was taken down because it was built using foreign funds. This was also tweeted by the deputy editor of Daily Mirror.\n\nThe incident was also reported by other Sri Lankan media outlets. None of the articles mentions \u201creligious conversion\u201d. Social media claims, therefore, stand false.", "lang": "en"}
