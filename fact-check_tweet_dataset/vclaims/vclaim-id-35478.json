Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: RTC bus driven by a temporary driver collided a vehicle in Medak district killing six people.

Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for this news in Medak district edition of various newspapers, an article related to the accident was found in Telugu newspaper, \u2018Eenadu\u2019. According to the article, the photo in the post is related to the accident that happened on September 28, 2019 near Pedda Shankarampet mandal in Medak district.\n\n\n\nTSRTC employees began their strike on October 5th, so the accident had happened before TSRTC employees went on strike. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, the accident that happened before TSRTC employees went on strike is shared as that caused by the appointment of temporary drivers.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
