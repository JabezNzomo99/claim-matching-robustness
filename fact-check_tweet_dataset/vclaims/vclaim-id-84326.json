The meme is misleading. One of the photos is doctored; the original shows real health workers who wore t-shirts featuring pro-vaccine slogans. There is no evidence of a Registered Nurse named Gayle Gregg in Canada or the United States and at least two of the women in the second photo work in fields unrelated to the public health system.\n\nA Facebook post featuring two photos of two different groups of women wearing t-shirts bearing anti-vaccine slogans such as \u201cvaccines cause infertility,\u201d \u201cvaccines cause death,\u201d or \u201cvaccines cause seizures,\u201d was shared hundreds of times in July 2019. \u201cNurses keeping it real,\u201d one Facebook user wrote, suggesting that the women in both photos work in the health sector.\n\nThe photos are captioned with a statement signed \u201cGayle Gregg, RN\u201d (for Registered Nurse), a self-proclaimed hospital nurse with 25 years of experience. According to the quote, \u201cBrilliant nurses in the profession for 20+ years are changing their views on vaccines.\u201d\n\nHowever, the meme misleads in several ways.\n\nSome of the women on the top right photo are indeed nurses, but a reverse image search quickly reveals that in the original photo, the women are wearing t-shirts with the slogan, \u201cVaccines cause adults.\u201d\n\nThe photo was posted on February 13, 2019, on the Facebook page of Legacy Pediatrics, a clinic in Rochester, in New York state.\n\n\u201cI saw a meme online that had the statement \u2018Vaccine cause adults\u2019 and I loved it,\u201d Kate Shand, pictured on the bottom right of the photo, told AFP about why she organized the photo. The post gathered a lot of attention, including from the media, and from anti-vaccine Facebook users. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also posed with the same t-shirt a few months later.\n\n\u201cWe were a little bit afraid at first because of all the awful things posted on our page and then we realized that this is not real life, we knew that they would burn themselves out on our (Facebook) page and we chose to just let it ride,\u201d Shand added.\n\nAccording to Shand, almost all the women in the photo are nurses, but not all. The profession of the subjects, from left to right, top to bottom, is: nurse, nurse, nurse, doctor, physician assistant, nurse, doctor.\n\nThe top left photo in the meme does not appear to be doctored. The oldest publication date AFP identified with it is a reddit thread from June 2018 mocking the women in the photo. Several Twitter accounts that regularly post content critical of vaccines currently use the photo as a header image. Rita Palmer, a New York State activist fighting the repeal of religious exemption for vaccination of children in the state of New York, is one of them.\n\nShe told AFP Fact Check that although she does not know who the women in the photo are, she believes that the context of the photo was a reaction to the \u201cVaccines cause adults\u201d t-shirts. \u201cI just thought it was so clever, and such a good answer back,\u201d she said.\n\nAFP Fact Check was able to identify two of the women in the photo, both from the Saint Petersburg area in Florida. According to their profiles on the professional networking social media site LinkedIn, they do not work as nurses but as an accountant and a senior partner at an alternative health company. AFP Fact Check reached out to both for comment but received no answer by the time of publication.\n\nThe quote beneath the photos is likely false as there is no evidence that a nurse named Gayle Gregg exists. Nursys, a database that lists 4.8 million nurses in the United States, shows no result for a Registered Nurse named Gayle Gregg in any US state.\n\nDawn Kappel, director of communications for the National Council of State Boards of Nursing, a nonprofit organization that runs Nursys using continuously updated data from each state board of nursing, told AFP, \u201cIf you can\u2019t find it in the database, they\u2019re probably not a licensed nurse in the United States.\u201d\n\nA search in the nurse registries for each of Canada\u2019s 13 provinces and territories for a Registered Nurse named Gayle Gregg also came up empty, from Ontario\u2019s College of Nurses to the Northwest Territories and Nunavut\u2019s Registered Nurses Association.\n\nPeople with questions on vaccine safety in Canada can consult this Health Canada website.
