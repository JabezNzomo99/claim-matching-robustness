The claim is false; a photo of the same man has previously circulated in reports about the funeral of a man from Trinidad and Tobago; AFP found no record for a man named in the misleading posts as the richest man in Kuwait; a Forbes list of the richest people in the world in 2019 included the name of a different Kuwaiti businessman.\n\nThe photo was published here on Facebook on October 18, 2019, where it has been shared more than 28,000 times.\n\nThe post shows a photo of a man adorned with golden jewellery lying in the casket alongside photos of US dollar banknotes; an aircraft; a yacht and a car.\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Thai language caption translates to English as: \u201cThe richest man in Kuwait NASI AL KHARKI is dead, look at the assets that he is not able to bring after his death.\u201d\n\nThe photos have been shared tens of thousands of times here, here, here, here, and here on Facebook with a similar claim.\n\nMany of the posts, for example this one, link the photos to a key Buddhist teaching -- available here in Thai on a Buddhist online forum -- which encourages you to live a humble life because you cannot retain money and wealth after your death.\n\nThe caption says: \"The richest man in Kuwait, Nasi Al Kharki is dead, look at those assets he is not able to bring with him after death. You were born without anything and you will leave this world without anything. When you have money, you should spend it for the good of your parents, and for the better good of the society.. this is the example of a perfect life that you can help other human beings both in this life and the next life.\"\n\nBut the claim is false; a reverse image search on Google found photos of the same man have previously circulated in media reports about the funeral of a man from Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nUK based newspaper The Metro published this report on April 4, 2018 about a man\u2019s funeral in Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the article:\n\nThe report states in part: \u201cA multi-millionaire real estate mogul was laid to rest in a gold casket, wearing $100,000 worth of jewellery and doused in Moet champagne.\n\n\n\n\u201cSheron Sukhedo, 33, was killed in a drive-by shooting outside his wife\u2019s parents\u2019 home in Trinidad and Tobago last week.\u201d\n\nThe same image was published here by British newspaper website Mail Online on April 4, 2018.\n\nThe article\u2019s headline states: \u201cBling funeral: Millionaire real estate mogul, 33 wears $100,000 of jewellery as he lies in a gold casket after being gunned down in Trinidad.\u201d\n\nThis video report about Sheron Sukhedo\u2019s death was published on the YouTube channel for Trinidad and Tobago based television channel C TV on March 27, 2018.\n\nThe video\u2019s caption states in part: \u201cPolice are still searching for the killers of murdered used car dealer, Sheron Sukhdeo. He was shot multiple times at around 9pm on Monday while at the home of relatives at Caroni Savannah Road, Charlieville. The 30 year old father of two was rushed to the Chaguanas Medical Facility where he died while being treated.\u201d\n\nThis report was published by Trinidad and Tobago based newspaper Trinidad Express on March 27, 2019, one year after Sukhdeo\u2019s death. It stated a special investigations unit had been assigned to find his killers.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report:\n\nAFP found no record for \u201cNASI AL KHARKI\u201d, cited in the misleading posts as Kuwait\u2019s richest man on current or past Forbes lists.\n\n\n\nThe closest name to the one cited in the misleading posts was Nasser Al-Kharafi, a Kuwaiti businessman who died in April 2011 with a net worth of US $10.4 billion, Forbes reported here. \n\n\n\nBelow is a screenshot of Al-Kharafi\u2019s profile on Forbes:\n\nAs of 2019, the richest person in Kuwait was Kutayba Alghanim, the chairman of Alghanim Industries, according to this article published on March 5, 2019, Forbes magazine.\n\nForbes estimated his net worth was US$1.4 Billion. The magazine listed him as the 1605th richest person in the world.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of Alghanim\u2019s profile on the Forbes website:\n\nReverse image searches for the other photos of cars, planes, boats and money in the misleading posts found they were stock photos widely used online.\n\nThe image of the gold bars was previously published here on an Indian news site; the image of the yacht was published here on a luxury boat website; the image of the black Bugatti car was published here on a stock image site; the image of the gold car was published here on an Australian news site.\n\nThe image of the US dollar banknotes corresponds with an image published here on travel website TripAdvisor, which states that it shows cash on display in Chicago\u2019s Money Museum.", "lang": "en"}
