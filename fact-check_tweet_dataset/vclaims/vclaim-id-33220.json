It has already been shared over 10,000 times on Facebook.\n\nCloser inspection of the image also reveals inconsistencies in the image colour and quality, where parts on the side are pixelated, while the poster is much clearer, an indication of image doctoring.\n\nThe picture is a doctored image of two men holding a poster showing solidarity with the victim of the horrific 2012 gang rape in New Delhi.\n\nThe image was shot on September 13, 2013 in New Delhi on the day a special fast track court handed out death sentences to four men convicted of raping a 23-year-old student on a moving bus the previous year.

The image has been edited to add text in Hindi that translates as 'the nation's watchman is a thief.'\n\nClick here to view the original photo on Getty Images' website.\n\nThe profile photo of the page itself is a manipulated image of Indian cricketer Virat Kohli holding up an anti-BJP poster.\n\nThe original photo is from Kohli\u2019s social media, where he is seen posing with an award given by the social media company Instagram in March 2018.", "lang": "en"}
