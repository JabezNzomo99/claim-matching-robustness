According to the WHO website, the World Health Organization is governed by two decision-making bodies: the World Health Assembly and the Executive Board.\n\nIt said: The Executive Board is composed of 34 technically qualified members elected for three-year terms. The annual Board meeting is held in January when the members agree upon the agenda for the World Health Assembly and the resolutions to be considered by the Health Assembly.\n\nWe also found that Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Minister of Health and Family Welfare, India, was appointed as the Chairman of the Executive Board in the 147th session of the Board, held on May 22, 2020.\n\n\u201cDr. Harsh Vardhan, who took over from Dr. Hiroki Nakatani of Japan, would chair the 148th session of the Executive Board in January 2021. At the Executive Board meeting in May 2021, he will hand over to the next chair from another WHO Region. However, he will continue to be a member of the Executive Board till 2023, \u201d the WHO statement read.\n\nFrom the above information, we gather the following:\n\u2022 India would chair the 148th session of the Executive Board in January 2021.\n\u2022 However, that DOES NOT mean that PM Modi has been appointed as the chairman.\n\u2022 In reality, Dr. Harsh Vardhan will be the chairman of the Executive Board for this session.\n\nHence, the viral claim in FAKE.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
