Their silence is violence. #BlackLivesMatter #Antifa #BLMScotland #AvengeSlavery.\"\n\nThe post says: \"This is what is being handed out at Black life Matters, and Antifa rally's???? How much longer are we gonna take this?????\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe hashtags and logos suggest the message on the flyer is associated with certain groups or movements, but we found no evidence of that, or that the groups are handing out such flyers.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement formed after a Florida jury in 2013 acquitted George Zimmerman of murder in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African American teen. The organization that grew out of the movement has been prominent in national protests over the Minneapolis death of George Floyd in police custody on May 25.\n\nAntifa is an umbrella term for a movement of far-left anti-fascists, and is not a unified organization.\n\nEdinburghLive.com reported that the flyers were found in Baxter Park in Dundee, Scotland. The website said that Black Lives Matter leaders in Scotland denied the flyers were produced by the group and denied that the group is affiliated with Antifa.\n\nThe Scottish Sun reported that local Black Lives Matter and Antifa leaders denied they produced the flyers that were found in the park.\n\nThere have also been claims about the flyers being in the United States.\n\nA June 22 Facebook post with the same image claimed the flyers were \"placed on cars at the Asheville (North Carolina) Mall yesterday.\" A June 24 Facebook post includes what appears to be a screenshot of a portion of another Facebook post that claims the flyers were found in Medford and Ashland, referring presumably to two cities in Oregon.\n\nAsheville Police Chief David Zack told PolitiFact: \"There was a local report; however, no flyer was discovered.\"\n\nThe Ashland Police Department said: \"The claim was unfounded. But we are monitoring.\"\n\nWe didn\u2019t get replies from the mall or the Medford Police Department.\n\nA statement attributed to Kailee Scales, managing director of Black Lives Matter Global Network, said it \"did not release any flyer with the \u2018kill a white on sight, their silence is violence,\u2019 nor was it posted or shared on any of our social accounts.\"\n\nWithout evidence that the flyers were produced by Black Lives Matter or Antifa, we rate the statement False.", "lang": "en"}
