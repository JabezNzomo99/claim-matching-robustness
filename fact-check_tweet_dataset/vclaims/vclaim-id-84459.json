Indian Express reports that the procedure for a such a perfect child according to the Garbh Sanskar program is three months of \u201cshuddhikaran (purification)\u201d for parents, intercourse at a time decided by planetary configurations, complete abstinence after the baby is conceived, and procedural and dietary regulations. According to Indian Express, Dr Hitesh Jani, national convener, Arogya Bharati, claimed that this program could produce tall and fair babies.\n\nThe parents may have lower IQ, with a poor educational background, but their baby can be extremely bright. If the proper procedure is followed, babies of dark-skinned parents with lesser height can have fair complexion and grow taller.\n\nDr Hitesh Jani also spoke to NDTV and stated that \u201cgarbh sanskar can produce genius babies\u201d. While speaking to NDTV, he also claimed that garbh sanskar enabled \u201cgenetic engineering in vivo or inside the womb\u201d, while modern day genetic engineering was done \u201cin vitro\u201d or in a petri dish. This issue was also reported by TheWire. Expectedly, there was a lot of outrage because of such ludicrous claims of producing super babies. In the meantime, OpIndia.com which is a right-wing website that works at exposing the bias in media against BJP, RSS and right-wing in general has come up with an article claiming that all the above articles about \u201cRSS-linked org promising fair babies\u201d were fake and invented by the media.\n\nThe author of the article Rohit Agarwal defends RSS by stating that based on his online research, he couldn\u2019t find any link between RSS and Arogya Bharati. He also spoke to Dr. Ramesh Gautam, National General Secretary of the Arogya Bharti, who reportedly stated that his ideology might match that of RSS but Arogya Bharti as such is an autonomous organisation. While speaking to OpIndia, he also stated that there was absolutely no attempt to get \u2018taller and fairer\u2019 babies as part of the Garbh Sanskar program. It is further stated in the OpIndia article that \u201cthe \u2018RSS-link\u2019 was entirely fabricated for sure\u201c.\n\nDr Ramesh Gautam, whom OpIndia spoke to, has shared this article on his Facebook timeline and can be accessed here =>https://www.facebook.com/ramesh.gautam.50/posts/1378544215538523.\n\nWhile Dr Ramesh Gautam currently claims that the program had nothing to do with RSS, on April 18th, he himself shared the Hindu article which starts with the sentence, \u201cArogya Bharati, the health and family welfare wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in the city will host a workshop on how to have a good child.\u201d That Hindu article drew a clear link between RSS and Arogya Bharati, yet, Dr Ramesh Gautam did not seem to have an issue. The Hindu article goes on to quote the Secretary of the Kolkata chapter of Arogya Bharati, Joyshree Rakshit, who said that the initiative was aimed at \u201craising awareness in Bengal about the traditional wisdom of ancient Hindu sages on the ways of bearing an ideal and good child.\u201d\n\nNow, lets give Dr Ramesh Gautam the benefit of doubt. He may have shared the article as a piece of news and probably doesn\u2019t endorse every word that is written in the Hindu article. However, Dr Ramesh Gautam\u2019s own Facebook timeline is proof enough to show how Arogya Bharati is not only \u2018inspired\u2019 by RSS, but that the two organisations work very closely.\n\nDr Ramesh Gautam has taken part in and addressed several \u201cGarbh Sanskar\u201d seminars as part of Ayogya Bharati, all of which he\u2019s written about on his Facebook timeline. He\u2019s also written about techniques to have \u201cgenius children\u201d leading to a \u201cbright future generation of Bharat.\u201d\n\nHere are more instances in which Ramesh Gautam attended \u201cGarbh Sanskar\u201d programs.\n\nHowever, if Arogya Bharati has no operational connections with RSS, then why was Arogya Bharti\u2019s Garbh Sanskar program in Jan 2015 done under the chairmanship of Rajesh Loya who is RSS\u2019s Sanghchalak of Nagpur Mahanagar? The pamphlet that was distributed by Ramesh Gautam clearly states that this particular Arogya Bharati program was conducted under the leadership of Rajesh Loya.\n\nRajesh Loya (circled below) is as RSS as it gets. In fact, according to Manashakti.org who covered this Garbh Sanskar event of Arogya Bharati, Mr Rajesh Loya even spoke about Garbh Sanskar and how all couples should follow it in his speech.\n\nIf Arogya Bharati is independent of RSS, then why are Arogya Bharati programs conducted at Hedgewar Smriti Bhawan, Reshmibaug, in Nagpur which is one of the main centres of RSS in Nagpur?\n\nIf Arogya Bharat is independent of RSS, why is that National President of Arogya Bharati, Ramesh Gautam, attends the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha (ABPS) meetings every year, ABPS being the RSS annual meeting of its highest decision-making body. If Arogya Bharati and RSS and truly independent, why is that Arogya Bharat workshop always follows the ABPS meetings if there is no case of co-ordination?\n\nWhile senior Arogya Bharati leaders attend RSS annual events, seniors RSS leaders also attend Arogya Bharati annual events as documented on Arogya Bharati website.\n\nEven RSS\u2019s weekly newspaper Organiser cover\u2019s Arogya Bharati\u2019s activities. In fact, there\u2019s a section called \u201cSangh Samarchar\u201d which is supposed to be news about the Sangh and Arogya Bharati has been covered in that section in 2005 and 2009.\n\nIn fact, the founder member of Arogya Bharati was a RSS Pracharak Dr Upendra Shenoy.\n\nThe facts presented in this post show that Arogya Bharati has many institutional connections with RSS contrary to what OpIndia.com claims. The fact that the National President of Arogya Bharati attends each and every Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha, the fact that seniors RSS leaders attend Arogya Bharti National Executive meetings, the fact that Arogya Bharti events have been conducted under the leadership of senior RSS leaders, the fact that Arogya Bharati events have been conducted in Hedgewar Bhawan which is one of the centers of RSS in Nagpur, all this point to the fact that the two organisations infact work very closely.", "lang": "en"}
