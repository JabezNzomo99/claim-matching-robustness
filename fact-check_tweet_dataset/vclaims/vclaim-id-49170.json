Scott Fitzgerald during the Spanish flu epidemic is making the rounds on social media, blogs, chats and media websites.\n\nThe letter describes life under quarantine during the Spanish flu pandemic in the early 20th century. A portion that is being shared most enthusiastically and has made it into various memes:\n\n\u201cThe officials have alerted us to ensure we have a month\u2019s worth of necessities. Zelda and I have stocked up on red wine, whiskey, rum, vermouth, absinthe, white wine, sherry, gin, and lord, if we need it, brandy. Please pray for us.\u201d\n\nFitzgerald, of course, is the author of \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d published in 1925 during the height of the U.S. prohibition era (1920-33).

Fitzgerald struggled with alcoholism throughout his adult life.\n\nThe original version was written by the American Nick Fariella for the humor website McSweeneys.com and published on March 13.

Hundreds replied with images of their own impressive stockpiles of alcohol.\n\nReuters\u2019 fact-checker found the fake letter just as popular in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe text has been shared at least 2,800 times on Facebook and at least 1,355 times on Twitter as of March 19, 2020,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\nThe Spanish flu of 1918-19 was the most severe pandemic in recent history, according to the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC).
