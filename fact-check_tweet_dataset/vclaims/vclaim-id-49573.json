A few hours after the news broke, another team of CRPF jawans sat huddled together in an office in Delhi, poring over the many photos flooding their computer screens and phones.\n\n\u201cThere was a flood of posts and photos and videos. Some outright gory and others filled with communal hatred. It was disturbing,\u201d says M Dinakaran, DIG and Chief Spokesperson, CRPF. \u201cSome of the posts were almost an insult to our jawans. They did not lay down their lives so that their death could become the cause for communal hatred. We knew we had to do something,\u201d he says.\n\nThis thought is what gave birth to the fact-checking team formed by the CRPF. Sitting in Delhi and a few other regional offices, a team of 12 to 15 people has since 14 February, debunked at least five posts a day.", "lang": "en"}
