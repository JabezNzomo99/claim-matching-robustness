In the video, the Sani Abacha Stadium isolation center in the state of Kano is shown to be apparently abandoned, while the author of the video can be heard muttering, \u201cThey said we have over 600 people here\u201d. The claim made in the video, however, is misleading.\n\nExamples of the claim can be seen here , here . The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to curb misinformation related to the new coronavirus.\n\nOn May 26, the Kano State Ministry of Health issued a statement on Twitter shedding light on the current COVID-19 situation as well as clarifying the government\u2019s response to the pandemic ( here ). The statement called the allegations in the video on social media \u201cmischievous\u201d, \u201cunfounded\u201d and \u201chandiwork of some disgruntled and unpatriotic elements\u201d aimed at discrediting the state governor\u2019s efforts around containing the spread of COVID-19.\n\nIt also informed the public that four isolation centers are fully functional while three more are nearing completion ( here ).\n\nZouera Youssoufou, Chief Executive Officer of the Aliko Dangote Foundation, and a member of the private sector led Coalition Against COVID (CACOVID, an acronym visibly stamped on a hospital bed in the video on social media), explained that the isolation center was temporarily vacant because it needed to undergo remodeling, according to the Daily Trust: \u201cBased on the advice that more centres should be set up using some of the 500 beds initially procured for the Kofar Mata centre, the centre was redesigned to occupy 213 beds and the rest of the beds were distributed to other three newly established centres within the state.\u201d ( here )\n\nThe Guardian Nigeria has also debunked this claim on social media ( here ). Mohammad Garba, Commissioner for Information, told The Guardian that the center was \u201credesigned based on recommendation and standards set by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 (PTF) and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC)\u201d and that 218 out of the 500 beds planned for the Sani Abacha center had been deployed to other new centers.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Nigeria imposed a \u201cprecision lockdown\u201d that extended to the northern economic hub of Kano state. As of May 14, Kano had the second highest number of confirmed cases in the country after Lagos ( here ).\n\nGlobally, COVID-19 cases have surpassed the 5 million mark ( here ). As of May 27, Nigeria had over 8,000 confirmed cases and a total of 249 deaths ( covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/ ).\n\nMisleading. The COVID-19 isolation center in this video was temporarily empty due to a redistribution of supplies. The outbreak is not a \u201cscam\u201d in Nigeria; the country has reported more than 8,000 cases of the disease.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
