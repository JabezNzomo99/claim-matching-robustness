No, that's not true, an old hoax went viral again which was originally created by a Canadian website that makes up tales about bizarre crimes and weird sex acts for entertainment purposes. It is not real, it did not happen.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on October 11, 2017 titled \"Obese couple makes three-story fall after floor collapses during sex\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA 640-lbs man and his 450-lbs wife had a rather unusual accident last night as the floor of their apartment collapsed during a particularly intense sexual intercourse, causing the couple to fall three stories lower. Michael Davis and Theresa Walker from Liverpool were having sex in their bedroom on the third floor of an apartment building when the structure collapsed. The couple and their bed fell through three floors before bursting through a wall and ending up in a laundry room in the basement of the building. Emergency services were rapidly called on the site and they were able to extract the unlucky lovers from their uncomfortable position.\n\nUsers on social media only would have seen this title, description and thumbnail, making it look like a real news story:\n\nThe story was copied by Citizens Daily Updates in 2018:\n\nIt was made popular again by a Facebook page pretending to be the Kenya branch of CNN:\n\nThe couple in the picture is not even from Liverpool, it was stolen from an American news story about an obese couple:\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories. The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Australian Police Officer NOT Beaten And Sexually Assaulted By Kangaroo\n\u2022 Fake News: Drunk Driver NOT Accused of Swallowing Breathalyzer To Avoid Arrest\n\u2022 Fake News: Sperm Bank Janitor NOT Suspected of Fathering 20,000 Children Over 20 Year Period\n\u2022 Fake News: Mother NOT Arrested, Did NOT Leave Children In Car For 9 Hours While At All-You-Can-Eat Buffet\n\u2022 Fake News: Priest Did NOT Suck Venom Out of Genitals, Choir Boy Did NOT Get Snake Bite", "lang": "en"}
