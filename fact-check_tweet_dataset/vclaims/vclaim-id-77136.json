The story is fake.\n\nThe story says two \"private intelligence agencies\" have determined that several news leaks that have been damaging to the Trump administration \u2014 from plans for executive orders to internal fights with staff \u2014 likely came from the president\u2019s own phone.\n\nBut TheSeattleTribune.com is a website that makes up their stories, and is associated with another faux news site called AssociatedMediaCoverage.com. Their disclaimer says the website \"is a news and entertainment satire web publication\" and that all articles \"are fictional and presumably satirical news.\"\n\nIf the counter on the story is to be believed, this one has been viewed more than 171,000 times in less than a week. It\u2019s been used in online forums and also is popular on Facebook. It\u2019s even appropriated a Twitter hashtag.\n\nThe article claims #DitchTheDevice is an online effort by social media users to get Trump to quit using the phone. But really, that hashtag was formerly used to try to get people to stop staring at their phones all day long and enjoy life a little bit more.\n\nIn any event, that\u2019s what the hashtag means now, as thousands of people have used it while tweeting out TheSeattleTribune.com link.\n\nThe story keys off a maelstrom of news about leaks from the White House, combined with Trump\u2019s penchant for tweeting and his reported actual use of an unsecured Android phone.\n\nWe rate it Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
