Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar has made vulgar remarks to warn village heads against the violation of lockdown rules in the villages. Fact: The newspaper clip in the post is an edited one. The title of the article has been edited to insert vulgar language. While it is true that the government has made the village heads answerable for lockdown violations in the village, the derogatory words in the article\u2019s title were not made by Bihar CM Nitish Kumar. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched with the keywords, a similar image (archived) was found to be uploaded on Facebook by a page with the name \u2013 \u2018Begusarai Live\u2019 on 11 April 2020. But, in that image, it can be seen that the title is not the same. It is written \u2013 \u2018\u0917\u093e\u0902\u0935 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0932\u0949\u0915\u0921\u093e\u0909\u0928 \u0915\u093e \u0909\u0932\u094d\u200d\u0932\u0902\u0918\u0928 \u0939\u0941\u0906 \u0924\u094b \u092e\u0941\u0916\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0939\u094b\u0902\u0917\u0947 \u091c\u0935\u093e\u092c\u0926\u0947\u0939\u2019 (English translation by Google \u2013 \u2018If the lockdown is violated in the village, the chief will be accountable\u2019)\n\nWhile the title is different in both the photos, the body of the article is the same. A clearer picture of the posted image can be found here (archived). So, when searched with the sentences from the body of the article, the same article was found on the website of \u2018Dainik Jagran\u2019. It can be seen that the whole body of the article is the same (a shorter version on the website). The title and the body of the article on the website do not have any such derogatory words.\n\nWhile FACTLY could not find the exact e-paper article, on looking at the article on the \u2018Dainik Jagran\u2019 website and the photo posted by \u2018Begusarai Live\u2019, it is clear that the article did not have any such derogatory words. The title has been edited to insert such words at the end in the posted image. Also, it can be seen that other news agencies have also published similar articles with the title \u2013 \u2018Lockdown \u0915\u093e \u0909\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0902\u0918\u0928 \u0939\u0941\u0906 \u0924\u094b \u092e\u0941\u0916\u093f\u092f\u093e-\u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0926 \u0939\u094b\u0902\u0917\u0947 \u091c\u0935\u093e\u092c\u0926\u0947\u0939\u2019.\n\nTo sum it up, the article title has been edited to show that Bihar CM Nitish Kumar has used derogatory words while referring to village heads.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
