But the fact is, (in) 2012, there were 12,197,000 arrests in the United States, OK? And there were 410 uses of deadly force. Now that is, I think, three-thousands of a percent. So, it\u2019s still an extraordinarily rare event.\"\n\nIn the comparison Flynn uses, there is one police killing in 0.00003 percent of all arrests -- an even tinier fraction than he suggested. But expressed another way, the 410 is an average of more than one police killing per day.\n\nSo, what about the two figures themselves: Are they accurate and do they account for all of the people who are killed by police?\n\nAround the country, attention to the use of deadly force by police was heightened after Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, was shot to death on Aug. 9, 2014, in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb.\n\nIn Milwaukee, to raise questions about the Brown case and about the April 2014 death of , a 31-year-old who was shot multiple times by a police officer during a struggle in Red Arrow Park in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nPolitiFact National a claim by conservative talk show host Michael Medved that \"more whites than blacks are victims of deadly police shootings.\" The claim ignored the fact that there are more than five times more whites than blacks in America.\n\nAnd our colleagues a statement that an unarmed black person is shot by a police officer every 28 hours. The report that had been cited by CNN pundit Marc Lamont Hill looked at all deaths, not just those of unarmed individuals. And it rolled in some deaths that did not involve police officers.\n\nFlynn, who headed the police departments in Arlington, Va., and Springfield, Mass., before becoming Milwaukee\u2019s chief in 2008, is known nationally for his use of data.\n\nWhen we asked for evidence for Flynn\u2019s claim, a Milwaukee police spokesman cited two FBI reports. Both are from 2012, the most recent full-year statistics available.\n\nThere were across the country in 2012, which means the figure Flynn used -- 12,197,000 -- was rounded up only slightly.\n\nThe highest numbers of those arrests were for drug abuse violations, driving under the influence and larceny-theft.\n\nThere were also in 2012, according to the FBI, which defines justifiable homicide as the killing of a felon by a law enforcement officer in the line of duty. : A police officer responding to a bank robbery alarm who shot a suspect after the suspect fired at the officer.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t taken into account all police killings of citizens.\n\nFiveThirtyEight.com, a news website devoted to data analysis, recently that the 410 is a minimum figure. The numbers are self-reported by local police agencies and not audited, not all police agencies report those figures to the FBI and the number doesn\u2019t include homicides that weren\u2019t ruled justifiable.\n\nThe FBI totals are likely an undercount for another reason, criminologists told us. Researchers who examine police killings of citizens within large metropolitan police departments often find that the number of such incidents recorded by the departments are higher than the number of justifiable homicides reported by the FBI.\n\nBut the criminologists also noted Flynn\u2019s comparison is one legitimate way to measure the frequency of police killings.\n\nFlynn said that in 2012, there were nearly 12.2 million arrests and \"410 uses of deadly force\" by police in the United States.\n\nThe Milwaukee police chief correctly quotes official FBI statistics on arrests and justifiable homicides by law enforcement officers, although it appears the 410 is an undercount of the number of people killed by police.\n\nWe rate his statement Mostly True.\n\nTo comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel website.", "lang": "en"}
