This is from a friend who just got coronavirus.\n\n\"If you believe this you will get the benefit. If you do not it won't harm me.\n\n\"This just happened two days ago. He was still sleeping when a cough woke him up. The cough had quite a lot of phlegm, and he felt his breathing was rather disturbed. There was no any sign that he would get a cough before.\n\n\"What did he do?\n\n\"1) Remove the phlegm.\n\n 2) Drink a lot of warm water /1 glass.\n\n 3) Take a little TABLE SALT to the tip of his tablespoon, put it into his mouth, let the salt dissolve in his mouth and swallow it little by little so the throat was filled with the salt taste.\"\n\nThe caption also says: \"That's my testimony. I hope WE CAN FIGHT THE CORONA Season WITH INEXPENSIVE SALT.\"\n\nThe same claim has been shared more than 7,000 times after it was published here, here, here and here on Facebook. It was also shared here on Twitter.\n\nA similar claim was also shared on YouTube here and here.\n\nThe claim is false; health experts have said there is no evidence that salt can treat the novel coronavirus disease.\n\n\"Until now there is no evidence that NaCl / table salt can kill the virus causing COVID-19. That information is a hoax,\" Dr Dirga Sakti Rambe, an internist and vaccinologist at Jakarta's OMNI Pulomas Hospital, told AFP via WhatsApp on May 27, 2020.\n\nIn response to a similar claim, Agit Sena Adisetiadi, Gadjah Mada University's internal medicine specialist, also said: \"Saltwater gargling cannot prevent Covid-19 infection.\"\n\n\"There is no medical evidence that explains that this can help prevent Covid-19,\" he said, as quoted in an article published in the university's website.\n\nJohn Hopkins University's School of Public Health debunked a similar claim about gargling with salt water, saying that \"it has no direct effect on the virus.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the John Hopkins' website:\n\nThe WHO also refuted another salt-related claim, that says regularly rinsing nose with saline helps prevent infection with the new coronavirus. \"There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus,\" it says.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the WHO's website:\n\nAs of May 29, 2020, the WHO has said here there is no remedy for COVID-19.\n\n\"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of mild COVID-19, there are no medicines that have been shown to prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19,\" it said.", "lang": "en"}
