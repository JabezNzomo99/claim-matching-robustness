With Putin\u2019s latest spin, a recap of some of that earlier coverage is in order.\n\nAs for the Wagner Group\u2019s legal status, its predecessor was a Hong Kong-registered company known as the Slavonic Corps, which had as its \u201cclient\u201d another offshore-registered company known as Moran Security Group. Although it is registered outside of Russia, the Moran Security Group advertises itself as a private security company specializing mainly in maritime security for cargo ships. This kind of activity is not considered \u201cmercenary activities\u201d under Russian criminal law, and private security firms are legal in Russia. This, incidentally, is what Putin was most likely referring to during his December 20 press conference, when he referred to the \u201clabor market\u201d for private security and the \u201calmost one million\u201d Russian citizens who work in it.\n\nThe Slavonic Corps, however, crossed the line when it began operating in Syria in 2013. One of the Corps members who participated in this mission was a former Russian Special Forces soldier named Dmitry Utkin, who would later acquire the alias \u201cWagner,\u201d supposedly for his keen interest in Third Reich military history and aesthetics. But when Utkin returned to Russia from Syria, he and two of the Slavonic Corps\u2019 executives were arrested by the FSB for violating Russian law on mercenary activities. Utkin, however, reappeared in 2014 in Ukraine, along with the so-called \u201cprivate military company\u201d Wagner Group. The term \u201cprivate military company\u201d is suspect in Wagner\u2019s case, given the evidence that it was actually set up by the Russian Defense Ministry and still coordinates closely with the Russian state.\n\nThe company was initially supplied with modern Russian military equipment, the New Yorker magazine wrote in February about reports that some Wagner personnel were transported to Syria on Russian military aircraft and evidence emerged that some of the mercenary soldiers received state medals.\n\nShortly after the Deir Ez-Zor incident, Russian lawmakers began talking about creating legislation to legalize private military companies in Russia. However, no such law was passed. In fact, the Russian state-owned media outlet Sputnik stated in an article on the subject: \u201cPrivate military companies are unathorized (sic) in Russia as there is no legislation regulating their activities. The issue, however, became urgent in recent months over rumors about alleged involvement of the so-called PMC Wagner in hostilities in Syria.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Wagner has never been \u201cwithin the law\u201d in Russia, as Putin speaks of it.\n\nPutin\u2019s suggestion that the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office should look into Wagner led to another interesting revelation. After Putin\u2019s statement, a representative from the Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s Office told Interfax that they had never received any request to look into the entity \u201cPMC Wagner.\u201d\n\nThe independent Russian news site Meduza quickly found evidence that this was untrue. According to journalist Ilya Rozhdestvensky, after he wrote about the company for the Russian news outlet RBC in 2016, someone asked the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office to investigate PMC Wagner for possibly violating the law against mercenary activity based on the material Rozhdestvensky gathered for his RBC article. Meduza confirmed that the request was received by the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office sometime during August-September 2016, before being passed on to the Moscow Prosecutor\u2019s office on October 12 that same year. In December 2016, Rozhdestvensky and all the other authors who worked on the RBC article were informed that the Russian Interior Ministry was investigating them for possible \u201cextremism\u201d and \u201cinciting hatred\u201d in connection with the article. One official asked him why they had written the article on Wagner, but the case subsequently went no further. According to Rozhdestvensky, the authorities said nothing about an investigation into PMC Wagner\u2019s activities, and he hasn\u2019t heard anything more from them since then.\n\nConsidering the evidence on Wagner's beginnings, on activities in Ukraine and, more recently in Syria, our judgment is that Putin's comment on the issue at his annual news conference was false.", "lang": "en"}
