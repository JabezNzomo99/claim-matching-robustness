The Russian president claimed to have discussed the topic of Ukraine and sanctions on Russia with Trump.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "August 21, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-7364", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-peskov-contradicts-putin/29445988.html", "vclaim": "On August 21,the Russian state-owned news agency TASS reported that Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov told journalists that \u201cgenerally speaking\u201d Presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump did not discuss the question of Ukraine and softening sanctions on Russia during their meeting in Helsinki in July. According to Peskov, the Kremlin is still awaiting \u201cconcrete offers on cooperation\u201d in resolving the situation in Ukraine.\n\nHowever, the day after the meeting between the two presidents in Helsinki, Putin himself told the Russian state-owned TV First Channel that the two had discussed the topics of Ukraine and sanctions.\n\nNewsweek magazine quoted the Russian president as saying about the meeting with Trump: \u201cWe talked about Ukraine. There are some new ideas on how to resolve the crisis in the southeast of the country. We agreed to work it out at the highest level. In my opinion, this is a positive element of the movement forward. Perhaps, although I say this tentatively.\u201d\n\nThe two statements \u2013 Putin\u2019s in July and Peskov\u2019s more recent one\u2013 contradict one another. It is impossible to determine which of the two is false and which is true, because the details of the discussion between Trump and Putin have never been released. Therefore, the Polygraph.info verdict is \"unclear.\"\n\nYet, Peskov\u2019s claim that Russia is still awaiting concrete proposals on what to do to soften U.S. sanctions is inaccurate, because the U.S. has made that position quite clear on a number of occasions, during both the Obama and Trump administrations.\n\nThe U.S. State Department has published a number of the executive orders on sanctions since 2014, when they were first imposed in response to Russia\u2019s annexation of the Crimean peninsula. Several of the executive orders themselves contain the words: \u201cBlocking property of certain persons contributing to the situation in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nIn March, the State Department said that sanctions on Russia would remain until the Crimean peninsula was returned to Ukraine. In July, the White House also repeated this condition and said that the U.S. would not recognize Russia\u2019s annexation of that territory.\n\nContext: Another Russian Claim, Ongoing and New Sanctions\n\nOn the same day that Peskov made his claims about the meeting between Putin and Trump, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also talked to TASS. During his interview Lavrov claimed that U.S. sanctions against Russia weren\u2019t really about Ukraine or Crimea but rather to \u201cdeter Moscow.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Lavrov is entitled to his opinion, on the same day in Washington, DC, a U.S. Treasury undersecretary repeated that U.S. sanctions \u201care guided by a clear understanding of the threat Russia poses\u201d to the U.S. and its allies. Sigal Mandelker, Treasury undersecretary listed the reasons for the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking: Russia\u2019s \u201coccupation of Crimea; \u201congoing aggression against Ukraine;\u201d enabling \u201cmassacres in Syria;\u201d use of \u201cchemical weapons to assassinate\u201d a former spy in Britain; \u201cmalicious cyber attacks;\u201d human rights violations at home and ties to \u201corganized crime groups.\u201d\n\nAlso on August 21, the U.S. Treasury slapped sanctions on two Russian shipping firms for ship-to-ship transfers of oil to North Korean vessels.The new sanctions against Primorye Maritome Logistics Co, Ltd and Gudzon Shipping Co. LLC involve six vessels.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. targets new \u201cRussian actors\u201d for attempting to circumvent earlier sanctions. Two companies, Vela Marine Ltd of St. Petersburg and Lacno S.R.O., based in Slovakia, face sanctions as do two Russian individuals: Marina Igorevna Tsareva and Anton Aleksandrovich Nagibin.\n\nThe companies and individuals are accused of helping another company, Divetechnoservices, in buying underwater equipment for Russia\u2019s FSB intelligence agency.", "lang": "en"}
