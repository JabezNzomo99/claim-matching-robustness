The video, which gained more than one million views in the less than three hours it was online, purported to show \u201cAntifa and professional anarchists \u2026 staging bricks\u201d for future nefarious use.\n\nThe video is a mash-up of 10 distinct social video clips. It begins with a social video of someone looking directly at the camera saying \u201cwe gotta do better\u201d and chants of \u201cwhere do the bricks go to\u201d in the background. At least four of the 10 clips are misleading, according to The Fact Checker\u2019s guide to manipulated video.\n\nThe first, which appears roughly 15 seconds into the video, shows a New York City police officer moving what appear to be four boxes for concrete bricks. The video originally appeared in this tweet suggesting the bricks were strategically placed \u201cin anticipation of protests,\u201d then asserting \u201cANTIFA is way more organized than politicians pretend.\u201d The author provided no evidence of either and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe video was picked up on New York Police Department Commissioner Dermot Shea\u2019s Twitter account and re-captioned, \u201cThis is what our cops are up against: Organized looters, strategically placing caches of bricks & rocks at locations throughout NYC.\u201d Yet geolocation shows this video was taken at West Third Street and Avenue X in Gravesend, Brooklyn \u2014 as the original tweet says \u2014 which is several miles south of where the main protests in Brooklyn took place. Moreover, nothing in the imagery makes it clear that the boxes of bricks were in any way connected to the protests.\n\nLess than 10 seconds later, a new narrator says, \u201cAin\u2019t no construction bro \u2014 just some random-ass bricks sitting here.\u201d Except there was construction that was in progress. A BBC report located the video to Fayetteville, N.C. It revealed not only that the bricks had been in that location well before the protests began (and presumably anyone would have \u201cstaged\u201d them), but confirmed that there had been construction in the area \u201csince at least January,\u201d according to residents.\n\nThe next clip in the montage shows protesters taking bricks from a large pile in New York. However, a longer version of the same video shows the bricks were behind a barrier before the protesters arrived. Additionally, there appears to be scaffolding in the background, indicating the bricks were there for construction and not, as the video implies, staged by protesters.\n\nThe next video shows encased stones of bricks on a sidewalk. You can hear the narrator say, \u201cI don\u2019t know man, that don\u2019t look right to me, that don\u2019t look right to me.\u201d BuzzFeed News found that these bricks were actually in front of the Chabad of Sherman Oaks, a Jewish community center in Los Angeles. The group posted a photo of the enclosures where the bricks used to be, saying the bricks were installed almost a year ago a security measure. They have recently removed the bricks as a temporary precaution, but a separate photo from November 2019 shows the barriers.\n\nIn any large group, there are always some bad actors. But the burden of proof is on the accuser, and the White House has provided none. Rather, this 58-second video employed out-of-context social clips to lob unproven accusations and create a misleading impression of what has happened during the Floyd protests. Nothing in the video proves who incited violence or that any of the bricks shown in this video \u201cwere staged\u201d to prepare for a street fight.\n\nIt is especially dismaying when the White House participates in a flood of misinformation on social media about the Floyd protests. White House officials should reveal clear, factual evidence before attempting to pin the cause of the ongoing protests on \u201cAntifa and other professional anarchists\u201d \u2014 or anyone else.", "lang": "en"}
