No, that's not true: clearer footage shows the man is just a fireman.\n\nThe video clip started circulating on social media during the fire on April 15, 2019 and it looks like it was filmed by someone pointing a cellphone at a television screen and zooming in:\n\nAn example of the video can be seen in this tweet published on April 16, 2019 (archived here) which read:\n\nThey found the same video in this tweet with over 200K views at the time (over 600K now):\n\nFrom looking at partial captions on the screen they were able to determine it was footage being broadcasted live by Spanish network RTVE.ES. The same live stream was also carried by CNBC and at 42:05 you can clearly see the man in question walk by:\n\nBecause this is a direct video feed and not a cellphone video of a television screen the colors and details are much clearer. The man is wearing a yellow high visibility vest and a shiny helmet, not a \"muslim garb\". At the start of the video the fire is already quite big and at the moment the man walks by one can also see jets of water being sprayed against the side of the tower by the fire brigade.\n\nThis would seem to indicate the fire brigade was on the scene already at the time the footage was shot. At the 30:30 mark in the video several other firemen can be seen standing in the same place:\n\nAnd at the 42:50 mark, barely 45 seconds after the \"mystery man\" walked by, more firemen can be seen coming out of the door he went into, seemingly inspecting or pulling a firehose or a cable:\n\nSo yeah, it was just a fireman.", "lang": "en"}
