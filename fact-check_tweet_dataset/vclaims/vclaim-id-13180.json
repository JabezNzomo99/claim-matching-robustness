As a share of merchandise imports, the average for fuel imports from 1971 to 2017 is even lower: 16.6 percent, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe former Senate president tossed the \u201c60 percent or more\u201d figure in the Feb. 4 interview Itanong Mo Kay Manong Johnny in Inquirer 990 Television, a video clip of which was uploaded to his official Youtube channel on March 7 (watch from 2:06 to 2:19).\n\nHe said reviving the mothballed Bataan Nuclear Power Plant would ease the foreign exchange requirement for fuel importation.\n\nConstruction of the plant began in 1976 and was completed in 1984 during the Marcos presidency. Corazon Aquino ordered it mothballed in 1986 amid safety concerns and allegations of funding irregularities.\n\nOf the country\u2019s net energy imports in 2017, oil and oil products made up 67 percent, coal 32.3 percent and biofuels 0.7 percent, the DOE said. Net imports accounted for 46.1 percent of the total energy supply in 2016, it said.\n\nWorld Bank data show net energy imports as a percent of energy use in the Philippines at 50.3 percent in 1972 when martial law was imposed; dropping to 35.9 percent in 1987, a year after the nuclear plant was mothballed; surging to 56 percent in 1997 during the Asian financial crisis, then declining to 45.7 percent in 2014.\n\nFuel imports as a share of merchandise imports, on the other hand, range from a low 7 percent in 1998 to a high 32.7 percent in 1982. It stood at 18.5 percent in 1987 and 11.2 percent in 2017.\n\nWorld Bank (2018). Energy imports, net (% of energy use) in the Philippines [Data file].
