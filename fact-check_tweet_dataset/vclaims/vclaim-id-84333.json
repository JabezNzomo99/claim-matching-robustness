According to the caption which accompanies it in the document handed to the UN, it shows guerillas from the ELN (National Liberation Army) engaged in \u201cindoctrination\u201d efforts at \u201crural schools in Tachira State\u201d, Venezuela, in April 2018.\n\nIn fact, the image was published back in June 2015 by the newspaper El Colombiano in a report about the guerillas\u2019 recruitment of children in Cauca, western Colombia -- some 1,200 kilometres from Tachira.\n\n\u201cThis image does not show ELN activities in Venezuela,\u201d the author of the article, El Colombiano\u2019s Peace and Human Rights Editor Javier Alexander Macias, told AFP. \u201cWe obtained it exclusively in 2015 in Cauca. It was passed to us by the intelligence service.\u201d\n\nEl Colombiano published three other photographs from the same scene on its website.\n\nWhile we have not been able to independently verify the location where the photograph was taken, the date given in the dossier Duque handed to the UN -- 2018 -- is certainly not accurate.\n\nThe second photo fact-checked by AFP shows a wooden hut, marked with ELN graffiti, in a forest. The caption refers to a \u201cmassacre\u201d committed in the Venezuelan state of Bolivar in October 2018 during clashes between ELN fighters and local gangs.\n\nIn fact, it was taken in the Colombian border region of Catatumbo by AFP photographer Luis Robayo in September 2018. You can find it here, on the AFP Forum website.\n\n\u201cI took this photo on September 20, 2018 during a reporting trip in the Catatumbo region,\u201d Robayo confirmed.\n\nA spokesperson for the Colombian defence ministry issued an apology to AFP on September 27, confirming that two other AFP photos -- similarly taken in Colombia and not Venezuela -- had been included in the file presented by the president to the UN, without proper attribution.\n\nThe ministry said on September 30 that General Oswaldo Pe\u00f1a, the Colombian military\u2019s intelligence director, had offered the president his resignation.\n\n\u201cI am aware of the need to answer for my actions and those of my staff,\u201d the statement quoted Pe\u00f1a as saying.\n\nThe revelations that the dossier contained errors prompted fierce criticism from the Colombian opposition as well as Venezuela\u2019s President Nicolas Maduro, who called Duque an \u201cimbecile\u201d for presenting the UN with false information.\n\nSince the early 2000s, Colombia has regularly accused Venezuela of providing refuge to Colombian fighters and drug-traffickers with the aim of destablising Bogota. Caracas similarly claims that Bogota backs armed groups on its territory.\n\nTensions have been rising between the neighbours in recent weeks, with Venezuela carrying out military manoeuvres and deploying missiles along the border.", "lang": "en"}
