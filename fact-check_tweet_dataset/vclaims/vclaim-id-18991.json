While he was relatively close to the Tory faction in parliament, this does not mean he was a Tory MP. The Tory faction slowly evolved into the modern Conservative party from the 1830s onwards.\n\nIn fact, party labels aren\u2019t that helpful to use here anyway. In the period when Wilberforce became an MP, party structures were less stable than they once were\u2014with earlier Parliaments being more clearly divided between \u2018Whig\u2019 and \u2018Tory\u2019 factions.\n\nAs Wilberforce\u2019s biographer and former Conservative leader William Hague wrote:\n\n\u201cWilberforce\u2019s own election was a good illustration of why many seats were not within the control of any one faction. The terms \u2018Whig\u2019 and \u2018Tory\u2019 had lost much of the meaning which, decades earlier, divisions over the Glorious Revolution and the Hanoverian succession had given them.\n\n\u201cThe whole notion of faction or \u2018party\u2019 was thought by many to be wrong and unpatriotic: for an independent MP to arrive at the House of Commons, speak up for his constituency, vary his vote and mix with all of the parties was therefore perfectly normal. Wilberforce set out on his Westminster career as just such an MP.\"\n\nWilberforce was more closely aligned with the Tory faction than the Whig faction, being good friends with and fairly loyal to the Tory Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger (though Pitt is said never to have described himself as a Tory).\n\nProfessor John Oldfield, director of the Wilberforce Institute for the study of Slavery and Emancipation at the University of Hull, told Channel 4 FactCheck in 2015:\n\n\u201cPitt, who was the nearest thing to a Conservative in this early period, had early supported abolition but refused or was unable to commit himself to the idea.\n\n\u201cBut Wilberforce wasn\u2019t a Conservative with a capital \u2018C\u2019, even if his politics were conservative with a small \u2018c\u2019. \u0130n fact, in party terms he remained an independent, even if he was loyal to Pitt.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
