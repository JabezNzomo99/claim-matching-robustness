The use of U.S. aid to pay for abortions overseas is prohibited, under several laws that were in place even before the Mexico City policy.\n\nYet those who oppose abortion rights often characterize this policy as a protection not only against taxpayer funds being used to both pay for abortion overseas, but also against actively promoting abortion overseas. That is why NARAL Pro-Choice America and other advocates of abortion rights call it a \u201cmyth\u201d that Trump\u2019s policy \u201cbans taxpayer $ for abortion overseas.\u201d\n\nSo, just what is going on? Per an October revision to USAID guidelines, the Trump administration\u2019s definitions for \u201cperforming abortion\u201d and \u201cactively promoting abortion\u201d mirror the Bush administration\u2019s, meaning an organization cannot \u201ccommit resources, financial or other, in a substantial or continuing effort to increase the availability or use of abortion as a method of family planning.\u201d\n\nIn the past, restrictions put in place by the Mexico City policy applied only to family-planning funds, or about $575 million. The new policy, called the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy (PLGHA), expands the breadth of the policy to any U.S. funding for global health including \u201cinternational health programs, such as those for HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, malaria, global health security, family planning and reproductive health.\u201d This means the policy would now be applied to about $8.8 billion in foreign aid across 64 countries, administered by different agencies. In other words, the new policy now covers roughly 15 times the amount of funding previously affected.\n\nThe State Department says the policy is not intended to \u201creduce the amount of global health assistance the U.S. Government makes available.\u201d To support its case, the administration and antiabortion advocates pointed to the fact that only four primary partners out of 733 that had funding reviews before Sept. 30 declined to sign the updated agreement.\n\nBut stated intention and practical application aren\u2019t always the same. As part of capacity-building efforts, many primary USAID partners work with small local organizations that now will have to comply with policy. Moreover, because of the global trend toward co-locating health services, NGOs that house a wide swath of services \u2014 including HIV prevention and treatment, immunizations, and safe abortion referrals in the same facility \u2014 risk losing U.S. funding for all of their programs.\n\nIn 2017, there were just under 27 million women using a contraceptive method provided by MSI. They estimate 2 million women would lose access to care as a result of the policy change. While this may sound like a small fraction, the organization noted this loss of services tended to be heavily concentrated. For example, in Madagascar, the United States funded a voucher program that delivered more than 170,000 free services to women and girls, which allowed them to receive contraceptive care at Marie Stopes clinics. Because of the funding gap, many of \u201cthe world\u2019s poorest women and girls will be denied the contraception they need to prevent an unintended pregnancy,\u201d said Marjorie Newman-Williams, president of MSI-US.\n\nReproductive rights groups also say large swaths of the new policy are vague, which has caused confusion among NGOs. They pointed out that USAID has a training program for affected grantees (in part because they have previously implemented an iteration of this policy) but that the Department of Defense, for example, doesn\u2019t have one. Plus, they said, there was little coordination between administering agencies and thus no way to know if the policy was being implemented the same way for every program. The State Department said affected agencies and departments would be developing additional training and compliance tools.\n\nPitfalls of the new policy have not been lost on the State Department \u2014 an Office of Management and Budget review of stakeholders published in February identified several challenges that have arisen. But none of the review\u2019s recommendations have been implemented. It did note the State Department would lead a review of policy implementation by December.\n\nDoes the updated policy restrict funding to any organization that \u201ceven *mentions* abortion?\u201d Not entirely, if one believes a reactive response still qualifies as a mention. Does it blanket more organizations than ever before with tightened rules on how grantees and sub-grantees can spend their funds (whether or not those funds are American in origin)? Absolutely.\n\nEvery reproductive rights organization, nongovernmental organization and the Department of State pointed out that this type of policy change takes time to play out, and this one has yet to be fully implemented. We still cannot make a definitive ruling on the policy\u2019s effect, so we will leave this unrated. What is clear, however, is that NARAL\u2019s tweet holds more water than we initially thought.", "lang": "en"}
