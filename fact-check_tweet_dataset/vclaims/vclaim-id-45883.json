COCO MARTIN GUSTO PAPALITAN LAHAT NG NASA GOBYERNO (Coco Martin wants everyone in government replaced),\u201d insinuating that the actor is referring to members of the Duterte administration. This is false.\n\nThe Ang Probinsyano actor made this comment nearly five years ago, when Rodrigo Duterte was still mayor of Davao City. He was elected president in May 2016.\n\nSpeaking in an August 2015 press conference for his TV action-drama, Martin was asked about his views on the upcoming May 2016 national elections. He said: \u201cGusto ko ng pagbabago. Kung maaari, gusto ko sana lahat bago kasi para magkaroon tayo ng bagong lipunan. Kung ilalagay rin natin yung mga taong yan sa posisyon na iyon, uulit lang nang uulit yan (I want change. If possible, I want all [elected politicians] to be new so we can have a new society. If we just put the same people in their positions, it will just be the same over and over again).\n\nThe June 3 story by website Raffy Tulfo (gmaentertainment.org) featured as its content a compilation of Martin's photos and those of Duterte with his Cabinet and a few legislators while a man's voice narrated the actor's stand on political issues. Its headline manipulated the context of his comments. The same content was uploaded on the same day by YouTube channel Showbiz Headliners.\n\nThe thumbnail of gmaentertainment.org\u2019s and Showbiz Headliners\u2019 posts further proved its duplicitous nature, splicing together a MYX photo of Martin and a September 2016 image of Duterte alongside his delegation and some overseas Filipinos in Vietnam.\n\nShowbiz Headliners\u2019 script was taken from a June 2 story by entertainment website Pep.ph titled, \u201cRemember when Coco Martin asked: \u2018Bakit kami natatakot sa gobyerno? (Why are we afraid of the government?)' \" and quoted some parts word for word while others were paraphrased.\n\nThe misleading post surfaced two days after Solicitor General Jose Calida responded to Martin\u2019s outburst about his hand in the shutting down of the actor\u2019s home network, ABS-CBN. Calida filed in February a quo warranto plea to revoke the legislative franchise of ABS-CBN before its May 4 expiration.\n\nThe misleading video on gmaentertainment.org, which uploaded its first story just last Feb. 29, could have reached over 36,000 netizens.\n\nThe top traffic generators to gmaentertainment.org\u2019s misleading post on Facebook are pages Pinoy Trending, Trending Viral PH, and Filipino Opini\u00f3n.\n\nShowbiz Headliners\u2019 video on YouTube has been viewed over 8,000 times and could have reached over 50,000 people on Facebook. The Youtube channel was created on Feb. 7, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
