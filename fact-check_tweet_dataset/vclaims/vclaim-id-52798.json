The Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any recent media reports about barbed wire being installed on the perimeter fence.\n\nProtests have occurred near the White House following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody on May 25. Temporary metal fencing was erected around the perimeter of the White House in early June as a security measure following such protests, CNN reported.\n\nThe image, posted on Facebook June 7, claims to show barbed wire arranged along the top of the fencing around the White House, with the caption saying, \u201cThere is now barbed wire on top of the White House barricade. Looking more like a concentration camp every day.\u201d\n\nHowever, a closer inspection of the image reveals that the barbed wire has been digitally drawn into the image. Nor did there appear to be barbed wire on the fence around the White House\u2019s perimeter around the date the image was posted. Photos from the area around the White House published by Reuters, The Associated Press and Getty Images between June 6 and June 8 show no barbed wire on the fences.\n\nAn internet search by the Daily Caller also found no recent media reports of barbed wire being installed there in recent weeks.
