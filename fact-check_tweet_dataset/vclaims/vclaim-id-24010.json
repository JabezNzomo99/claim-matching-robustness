Vishvas News investigated and found that the tablets are not for the consumption as a medicine but it is actually the tissue paper packed in the form of tablets. The viral claim is false.\n\nThe viral video on Facebook claims that the low-quality tablets are available in the market that opens up into a tissue paper. The man in the video states that medicine\u2019s composition is not written on the cover of the medicine. Neither there is manufacturing date of the medicine nor there is an expiry date. Only the name of the medicine, Zota is mentioned.\n\nWe found multiple videos circulating all across the internet with the same claim.\n\nUsing Invid, Vishvas News extracted the keyframes of the viral video. Using the magnifier tool we found the name Zota written on the cover of the tablet strip.\n\n\u201cIn the viral video, it is pure tissue paper. It is not medicine. We had procured that tablet tissue for gifting purpose to doctors. We had already mentioned the instruction on that pack but unfortunately, someone had misused & destroyed our image. These were compressed wipes and not tablets, and they had distributed these to doctors are part of a promotional plan.\n\nTissue tablets are actually quite popular and easy to buy online. These tissues are also given in several restaurants to customers. Simply pouring some water on them does the magic. The tablet unravels into a tissue.\u201c\n\nSearching the keywords \u201cZota Tissue Tablet\u201d on Google Search, we found a video. The video explained the details of the same tablet as shown in the viral video.\n\nIt is actually a tissue paper rolled in the form of a tablet. It is not a medicine for consumption.\n\nThe tissue tablets are not unheard of and are very easily available online.\n\nThe description of the tissue tablets in search result mentioned: Tissue tablet is a unique compressed paper napkin in the shape of a tablet which expands in a few seconds after adding water.\n\nVishvas News spoke to Dr. Sajeev Kumar, who is a General Physician. He stated: There is no such medicine that contains tissue paper. I have never come across any such medicine so far.\n\nPost claiming cheap and harmful tablets contain tissue paper is fake.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
