However, the image is a Press Trust of India photo, taken in 2012. It shows Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers damage a truck during the Bharat Bandh protests in Jamshedpur against rising petrol prices. The protests were against the Congress-led UPA government, at that time. BOOM had debunked the same image earlier in May 2019, when it went viral with a different claim during BJP-TMC clashes that took place in West Bengal.", "lang": "en"}
