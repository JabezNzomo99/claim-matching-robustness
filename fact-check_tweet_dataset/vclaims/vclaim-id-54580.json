Through this article lets fact-check the claim.\n\nClaim: An IAS officer sat down holding the stool for Uma Bharti, who studied only till 5th class Fact: Uma Bharti studied only till 5th class. However, the man who sat down holding the stool for Uma Bharti is not an IAS officer. A few news portals reported him as a security officer, whereas some reported him to be an unidentified party worker. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen we ran a reverse image search on google, we came across a few news articles in which the same image was published. According to those news articles, this image was clicked way back in December 2016 when Uma Bharti addressed a meeting in Jhansi, UP. Hence, we can conclude that the image is an old one.\n\nWhile few news portals addressed the person, who held the stool as a security officer, few other portals addressed him as an unidentified party worker. But we found no evidence to prove that the man is an IAS officer. The news articles which reported the incident can be read here and here.\n\nUma Bharti studied only till 5th class and information regarding her education can be found here. However, the man holding the stool is not an IAS officer. A video in which a Gujarati News channel debunked the same can be watched here.\n\nIn a nutshell, the man in the image who is seen holding the stool is not an IAS officer.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
