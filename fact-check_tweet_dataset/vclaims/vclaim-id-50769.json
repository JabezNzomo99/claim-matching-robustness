NFIU Is Not Probing Into The Affairs Of Lawan, Gbajabiamila, CJN Tanko & Others", "subtitle": "", "author": "dubawa.org", "date": "2019-09-17T12:03:35+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-50769", "url": "https://dubawa.org/false-nfiu-is-not-probing-into-the-affairs-of-lawan-gbajabiamila-cjn-tanko-others/", "vclaim": "CLAIM: Media reports say the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit is probing Lawan, Gbajabiamila, CJN Tanko Muh\u2019d and others.\n\nFASLE: Although the NFIU denied probing the banks, it did, however, corroborate the existence of the document in a statement- albeit leaked and unauthorised. Nonetheless, the document didn\u2019t mention anybody\u2019s name as alleged by the media reports making the claim false.\n\nFour days ago, Sept. 13, Vanguard, Nairaland, Daily Nigeria, Punch, Guardian and WhatsApp were flooded with reports about a letter. Said document was purported to have been written to banks by the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) requesting for the account details of some lawmakers and members of the Judiciary.\n\nAccording to the letter dated September 10 and signed by the Associate Director, Analysis and Compliance, Fehintola Salisu, the NFIU gave all the banks until September 13 to comply with the directive.\n\nThe letter was addressed to all Chief Compliance Officers of the banks.\n\nWho are the NFIU?\n\nThe Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) is a global financial unit that maintains autonomy whilst operating within the African Region. Their operations with respect to combating money laundering and financing terrorism seek to comply with international standards. The NFIU works within the Central Bank of Nigeria as the Nigerian arm of the global financial intelligence Units (FIUs).\n\nFrom our investigations, the NFIU has denied the story alleging it requested bank details of National Assembly (NASS) and Judiciary workers. This is reflected in this news report by Premium Times and the Sun. In the reports, it was revealed that it is well within the NFIU\u2019s jurisdiction to access bank account details for citizens, further adding that investigative and law enforcement agencies rely on them for such information. This same sentiment was expressed by others in some media circles like this one.\n\nInterestingly, in a statement yesterday by the agency, it was revealed that the document was leaked. Also, an internal investigation has been launched to identify and sanction the culprits in a bid to curb recurrence.\n\nNonetheless, what is clear is that contrary to allegations by media reports , no particular names were mentioned in this document. Hence, it calls to question publications that referenced Lawan, Gbajabiamila, etc. This was probably done consequent on these names belonging to one of the five categories for accounts requested.\n\nAlthough the NFIU denied probing the banks, it did, however, corroborate the existence of said document in a statement- albeit leaked and unauthorised. Nonetheless, the document didn\u2019t mention anybody\u2019s name as alleged by the media reports making the claim false.\n\nEbere Agozie is a Senior Correspondent with the News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) with a staff strength of about 880, Joined in 2014 as a correspondent.
