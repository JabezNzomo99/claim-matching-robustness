The claims about school closings and economic support are misleading; no province has officially closed schools through the end of the year, only individuals directly impacted by COVID-19 are eligible for financial aid, and mortgage relief is granted by banks on a case by case basis.\n\n\u201cAll schools in Canada are closed for the rest of the school year, each family will receive $950 every two weeks for the next 15 weeks, banks were notify to suspend mortgage payments for at least 6 months, and student loans deferred.\u201d\n\nIdentical versions of this announcement were shared on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter starting on March 18, 2020.\n\nHowever, the claims made in the post are misleading.\n\nPublic school is currently suspended across Canada, but the length of the school closures depends on each province and territory.\n\nIn the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland-Labrador, schools are closed indefinitely, spokespeople for each province\u2019s ministry of education told AFP.\n\nNew Brunswick schools are also closed indefinitely, according to a news release.\n\nIn the central province of Ontario, where classes were due to reopen on April 5 after a two week closure, the ministry of education is looking into the possibility of postponing the opening date, Ingrid Anderson, a spokeswoman for the provincial government, said by email.\n\nIn the eastern province of Quebec, schools and daycares are closed until May 1, Bryan St-Louis, a media officer for the education ministry, said by email.\n\nIn the Maritime province of Prince-Edward-Island, schools \u201care closed until April 6 but that could change,\u201d Jean Doherty, a spokesman for the provincial ministry of education told AFP.\n\nClasses in Manitoba and Nova Scotia, closed since March 23, are due to start again on April 10. The provinces did not send AFP updated guidance by the time of publication.\n\nThe claim that each family will receive $950 every two weeks \u201cis false,\u201d Anna Anderson, a spokeswoman for Canada\u2019s Minister of Finance, said by email.\n\nOn March 25, Canada\u2019s legislature adopted a Can$82 billion emergency package to assist individuals, families and companies throughout the novel coronavirus crisis.\n\nThe act introduces the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), which grants a Can$2,000 taxable monthly allowance \u201cfor up to four months for workers who lose their income as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe CERB does not cover \u201ceach family\u201d in the country, as posts claim, and those already receiving unemployment and sickness benefits are not covered.\n\nHowever, workers still employed but not receiving income may apply, as well as those who are sick, quarantined, or taking care of someone who is sick with COVID-19.\n\nOn March, 22, the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA), an organization representing Canadian banks, announced that the country\u2019s six largest banks would offer mortgage payment relief, \u201cby way of deferred mortgage payments.\u201d\n\nBanks including RBC, CIBC, TD, BMO, Scotiabank, and NBC announced that for individuals struggling financially due to COVID-19, deferrals on payments for up to six months would be available. However, details on who qualifies were not made public, and decisions are made on a case-by-case basis with clients.\n\nMathieu Labr\u00e8che, head of communications for the CBA, said in an email that the federal government asked those banks for relief for Canadians.\n\n\u201cThe current process includes answering a few questions so that we understand how their financial circumstances have been impacted by COVID-19,\u201d Ana Aujla, a spokeswoman for TD, said by email.\n\nAujla said her bank is \u201creceiving thousands of requests daily from across the country,\u201d for mortgage deferral, and that thousands have been processed already.\n\n\u201cThere are no income requirements and we review every application on a case by case basis,\u201d AJ Goodman, a spokesman for RBC, told AFP.\n\nAlthough payments will be deferred, interest on outstanding balances will continue to accrue.\n\nThe posts are correct in stating that student loans have been deferred. Part of the government\u2019s response to the pandemic is \u201csupport for students and recent graduates.\u201d\n\nStarting on March 30, all borrowers will benefit from a \u201csix-month interest-free moratorium on the repayment of Canada Student Loans.\u201d\n\nThe complete list of programs deployed under Canada\u2019s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan is available here. Beyond the measures mentioned above, they include wage subsidies for small businesses, credits for farmers, and a deferral on owed income tax.\n\nOn March 25, 2020, the US Senate approved a $2.2 trillion package to mitigate the novel coronavirus\u2019 impact on the economy. It will provide direct cash payments to American families, $500 billion in grants and loans for small businesses, and $50 billion for airlines.\n\nAFP Fact Check has investigated more than 180 false and misleading claims about the novel coronavirus.", "lang": "en"}
