The only reference to religion comes in the second paragraph, where Biden states, \u201cIn too many places LGBT community members face violence with impunity, mistreatment by police, the denial of healthcare, or religious condemnation and social isolation.\u201d\n\nThe DCNF also didn\u2019t find any instances of Biden suggesting such a thing in credible media reports or on his social media pages.

In 1996, he voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, a law that blocked federal recognition of same-sex marriage, though he has since become an outspoken proponent of LGBTQ rights. In 2012, he became the highest-ranking Democrat to initially endorse same-sex marriage, The New York Times reported.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
