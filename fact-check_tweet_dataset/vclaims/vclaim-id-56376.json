Sarah Elago who alleged she will \u201cruin the future\u201d of the kids.\n\nA cursory search showed no official records or reports from any legitimate source of Elago making such a pronouncement. It was not in any of her social media posts.\n\nPlaced beside a photo of the legislator from an August 2019 UNTV report, the fabricated statement read: \u201cAng inyong mga anak ay hindi ninyo mga anak. Dumaan lang sila sa inyo ngunit hindi niyo sila pag-aari. SISIRAIN KO ANG KANILANG KINABUKASAN (Your children are not your children. They only come through you but they do not belong to you. I WILL DESTROY THEIR FUTURE).\u201d Elago was described as an \u201cNPA recruiter.\u201d\n\nThe first two lines of the quote are a rephrased Filipino translation from the poem \u201cOn Children\u201d in the book \u201cThe Prophet\u201d by the renowned Lebanese-American writer Kahlil Gibran:\n\n\u201cYour children are not your children... They come through you but not from you, and though they are with you yet they belong not to you.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt was translated to Filipino in the 1983 novel Dekada \u201870 by Filipino writer Lualhati Bautista, a snippet of which could be seen in an FB promotion of the book to a musical adaptation.\n\nLast year, VERA Files Fact Check flagged and debunked a fake quote card of Elago carrying the same fabricated statement about children not being owned by their parents. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Sarah Elago DID NOT rebut parents of student activists with this quote)\n\nAn inspection of the profile of the netizen who published the spurious graphic showed that he misrepresented himself as a University of the Philippines (UP) student. Its display picture shows a man wearing a sablay, a symbolic cloth worn by UP graduates.\n\nA Google Reverse Image Search revealed that the netizen behind the account used a UP alumnus\u2019 photo. But upon closer look, a different man\u2019s face was noticeably edited onto it.\n\nRunning the edited photo through InVID, an image verification tool, showed an irregular noise pattern in the area of the man\u2019s face, characterized by a huge black space. An unedited photo would have shown white grains that outline the features in the man's face; the lack of grain or \"noise\" in that area suggests it was altered.\n\n\n\nThe misleading posts containing the fake Elago quote came as the country awaits President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s approval of the controversial Anti-Terrorism Bill. Elago was among those who voted against the piece of legislation in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe two FB posts have received a combined 180 shares and over 130 reactions. Its top traffic generators are public group AFP PNP RETIREES ASSOCIATION OF TAGUIG CITY-UPPER BICUTAN and page Real Talk , discussion that matters.", "lang": "en"}
