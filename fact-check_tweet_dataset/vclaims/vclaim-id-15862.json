A caption accompanying the video reads, \"What would you say about this unruly behavior of Congress MP Anil Upadhyay. Make this video so viral that entire India can watch it. @INCIndia rowdies, what will you do about this MP.\"\n\nThe 30-second-long video shows a man clad in a white shirt viciously attacking a police official even while a woman tries to stop him.\n\nThe video is being widely shared on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nYou can view the viral post here and access the archived version here and here.\n\nThis is not the first time this video has gone viral. Earlier too, in October 2018, the same video had gone viral with a different caption.\n\nBack then, the caption had claimed that the man shown attacking the cop in the video was a Bharatiya Janata Party councillor from Meerut, Manish Kumar.\n\nWhen BOOM searched the internet for reports on the incident, we found out that the man assaulting the cop in the video was indeed Manish Kumar, a BJP councillor from Meerut.\n\nNews reports said that the viral video was shot at a restaurant owned by the BJP councillor. According to reports, an argument between the cop and a hotel staff led to the brawl. The cop was accompanied by a woman lawyer. The reports further stated that the councillor was booked under Sections 395 and 354 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\n\nBOOM contacted the Meerut police for more information. The report will be updated once we get a reply.\n\n\n\nYou can read more about the incident here and here.", "lang": "en"}
