That will be through the Brexit dividend. The fact we are no longer sending vast amounts of money every year to the EU once we leave the EU. As a country we will be contributing a bit more.\u201d \u201cSome of the extra funding I'm promising today will come from using the money we will no longer spend on our annual membership subscription to the European Union after we have left.\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister has pledged an extra \u00a320 billion in funding for the NHS in England by 2023/24, saying this will in part be paid for by the \u2018Brexit dividend\u2019.\n\nThere is no guaranteed extra money\u2014or \u2018Brexit dividend\u2019\u2014as a result of the UK ceasing its contributions to the EU budget after leaving. Other costs associated with leaving are expected to more than offset that saving.\n\nThe government also won\u2019t know what the impact of Brexit will be on the public finances until it finalises a deal with the EU.\n\nAny extra funding given to the NHS or any other part of public spending would then need to come from increased taxes (as the Prime Minister also alludes to), increased borrowing, or reducing spending on something else. We\u2019ve looked at the NHS funding pledge in more detail here.\n\nThe Health Secretary has also said that if there was any Brexit dividend then any savings \u201cwon\u2019t be anything like enough\u201d to fund the NHS commitment.\n\nThe UK currently pays between \u00a313 and \u00a314 billion into the EU budget every year\u2014that\u2019s roughly \u00a3250 to \u00a3280 million a week. It also gets some of that back, mainly through payments to farmers and for poorer areas of the country such as Wales and Cornwall. Those are worth about \u00a34 billion a year or \u00a375 million a week.\n\nThe government has already indicated that, until at least 2022, it will continue to spend some money on the areas where the EU currently gives us funding. It may also wish to participate in EU agencies and programmes after Brexit, which could come at a price.\n\nThat could mean, when we stop paying to the EU budget in 2021, we\u2019d be likely to have at least \u00a39 to \u00a310 billion a year\u2014our \u2018net payment\u2019 to the EU budget\u2014which is worth \u00a3170 to \u00a3190 million a week. This is the dividend the Prime Minister is referring to.\n\nThat would be a saving in itself, but it\u2019s not extra money. \u201cThere isn't a Brexit dividend\u201d according to Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. That\u2019s because the short-term savings from ending payments to the EU budget are expected to be outweighed by the costs elsewhere.\n\nNot all of the costs are certain yet, so we don\u2019t know what the exact change to the public finances will be. Some though, such as the \u2018divorce bill\u2019, have already been agreed in principle.\n\nThe UK hasn\u2019t left the EU yet, so for now we\u2019re continuing to pay into the EU budget, and will do so until we leave fully, which is currently expected to by 2021. We\u2019re also likely to be paying a \u2018divorce bill\u2019 for leaving.\n\nThe \u2018divorce bill\u2019 is a sum agreed by the UK and EU which settles the UK\u2019s financial commitments or outstanding liabilities, like EU pensions.\n\nThe latest estimate for that figure is around \u00a337 billion in total, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. Between 2021 and 2028, about half of that\u2014\u00a318 billion\u2014is expected to be due.\n\nCosts from the economic effects of Brexit\n\nEventually those divorce bill payments will drop off, but there\u2019s still the question over the wider economic impact Brexit will have and how this affects the public finances.\n\nNo one knows exactly what the economic impact of Brexit will eventually amount to, but the government has already accepted, through the Office for Budget Responsibility, that the public finances have taken a hit.\n\nEstimates from 2016, just after the referendum, suggest the economic effects of Brexit \u201cweakened the public finance by \u00a315 billion per year by the early 2020s, more than outweighing the UK\u2019s \u00a38 billion net contribution\u201d, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\n\nAs the IFS also said in January, \u201cIn other words, so far the implication is that Brexit has reduced rather than increased the funds available for the NHS (and other public services), both in the short and long term\u2026\n\n\u201cAlthough subsequent growth after the OBR\u2019s forecast has been slightly stronger than expected, the medium-term outlook is now gloomier than in November 2016.\u201d\n\nIn other words, at the moment the cost of Brexit is expected to outweigh any \u2018dividend\u2019 the UK gets from ending payments to the EU budget.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what deal the UK will ultimately strike with the EU upon leaving, so the eventual impact on the public finances is still uncertain.", "lang": "en"}
