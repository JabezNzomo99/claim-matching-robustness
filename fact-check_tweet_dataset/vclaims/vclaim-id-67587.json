Republicans dominated, winning the governor\u2019s office, all other statewide executive offices and control of the House.\n\nWhat impact the Republican takeover of the House will have on the average Ohioan is unknown, but one thing seems clear: House members, coming off an election year with an extended summer break, will be called to work more often under the new leadership.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Bill Batchelder, who will take over as Ohio House speaker in January, was outspoken during the campaign about the House's productivity under Democratic leadership. He pointed to the high number of legislative sessions House Speaker Armond Budish canceled.\n\n\"We haven\u2019t had control of the House for the last two years and it\u2019s been malfunctioning,\" Batchelder, of Medina, told the Brunswick Sun News in mid-October. \"We had 109 sessions scheduled and held 49.\"\n\nGiven his critique of Budish, it will be worth checking how often Batchelder, once he becomes House speaker, cancels scheduled House sessions. But PolitiFact Ohio thought we first should make sure Batchelder\u2019s figures for the last two years are accurate.\n\nIf he is correct, the number of House sessions convened in 2009 and 2010 will be the lowest two-year total in recent years. The House had 78 sessions in 2005-06 and 71 sessions in 2007-08, according to the House clerk\u2019s office.\n\nThe House speaker publishes a schedule of planned sessions every six months. The speaker, under the rules of the House, also has the authority to cancel or add session dates as necessary.\n\nBudish, a Democrat from Beachwood, became House speaker at the beginning of 2009, after the Democrats took control of the Ohio House in the 2008 election.\n\nIn 2009, Budish scheduled 74 session days and cancelled 43 times, leaving 31 days the House actually held session, according to figures provided by Batchelder and confirmed by Budish\u2019s office.\n\nBatchelder and Budish also agree on figures for this year. Through Nov. 5, Budish had scheduled 35 session days and actually held session 17 times, according to their offices.\n\nThe sum of those figures aligns closely with Batchelder\u2019s statement to the newspaper. The number of scheduled session days is a match at 109. He is off by one on the number of actual sessions held. He said 49 but his office now agrees that 48 sessions were held in the last two years. Batchelder was counting a day the legislature met \u2013 but did not hold session \u2013 on the day of the governor\u2019s State of the State address.\n\nWhile Budish\u2019s office agrees with Batchelder\u2019s numbers, it has a different interpretation of their meaning.\n\nBudish spokesman Keary McCarthy said the number of canceled sessions is not an indication that the House has malfunctioned in the past two years. He mentioned passage of a two-year state budget and work on legislation to help create jobs.\n\nMcCarthy can disagree with Batchelder\u2019s attack on the House\u2019s productivity under Budish\u2019s leadership, but he can\u2019t really quibble with the number of canceled sessions Batchelder claimed. He was off by one in his total of actual sessions, but that miscalculation was insignificant.", "lang": "en"}
