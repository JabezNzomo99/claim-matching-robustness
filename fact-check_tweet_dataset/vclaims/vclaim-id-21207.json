Read more about our partnership with Facebook.\n\nIs it true? We looked at the polls cited in the story as well as additional polls to provide a more complete picture.\n\nWe found that The Gateway Pundit cited the early June polls that were the most favorable to Trump: a Fox News poll showed that 45 percent of respondents approved of Trump while Rasmussen Reports showed 47 percent approval for Trump.\n\nA compilation of polls by Real Clear Politics in early June showed that five other polls, including Gallup, all had slightly less favorable results for Trump.\n\nFor Obama, The Gateway Pundit cited a Rasmussen poll that showed Obama\u2019s approval was at 46 percent on June 9, 2010. Some experts have raised questions about Rasmussen\u2019s polls, because they are based on likely voters, which is a smaller sample than most other polls; historically, Rasmussen has tended to report more favorable results for Republicans generally and Trump in particular. So we looked at one other poll from the same time, Gallup, and also found Obama had the same approval rating.\n\nWe also found the comparison between Trump, Obama and Reagan in a story about a poll by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal. The story said that Trump\u2019s approval was 44 percent in early June, matching the results for Reagan (in June 1982) and Obama (in June 2010) \"before both presidents saw their parties lose a significant number of House seats in the midterms.\" Historically, the president\u2019s party usually gets shellacked during the midterms.\n\nThe Gateway Pundit did not cite this NBC/WSJ poll, which has some warning signs for Republicans in general, including that Democrats were far more enthusiastic than Republicans about the upcoming midterms. Also, 48 percent of voters indicate they\u2019re more likely to support a congressional candidate who promises to provide a check on President Trump, compared with 23 percent who say they\u2019re less likely to support such a candidate.\n\nKarlyn Bowman, a polling specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, cautioned against drawing conclusions about what the polls in early June mean for the midterm election in November.\n\n\"Although polls have more predictive value as we get closer to Election Day, we are still more than 100 days out,\" she said.\n\nSteven Smith, a Washington University political scientist, said that there is considerable variation in presidential job approval ratings across survey organizations. These differences are due to variation in sampling frames, question wordings, weighting, and other factors.\n\n\"Consequently, claims like the Gateway Pundit claim that depend on differences of a few percentage points using different survey organizations\u2019 findings are questionable. The comparisons simply are not reliable,\" he said.\n\nThe Gateway Pundit said, \"Trump approval rating better than Obama and Reagan at same point in their presidencies.\"\n\nThe story cited a Fox News poll in early June that found Trump\u2019s approval rating at 45 percent and a Rasmussen poll showing Obama was at 46 percent at the same point in his presidency.\n\nAn NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that Trump\u2019s approval was 44 percent in early June, matching the results for Reagan (in June 1982) and Obama (in June 2010).\n\nThese poll results show that Trump, Obama and Reagan had similar polling results for early June in the second year of their presidencies. These results are a snapshot in time, and other polling results show warning signs for Republicans headed into the midterms.\n\nThat said, the numbers cited are correct. We rate this claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
