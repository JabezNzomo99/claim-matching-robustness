Age UK looked at data from the Office for National Statistics\u2019 Crime Survey for England and Wales. The Crime Survey defines domestic abuse as abuse by a partner OR by a family member.\n\nThe Crime Survey estimates that in 2017/18 152,000 people aged 60 to 74 were victims of partner abuse and 66,000 were victims of family abuse.\n\nThe main body of the Daily Mail's article went on to report this correctly.\n\nIn all likelihood the number of people experiencing domestic abuse is higher than this, as the Crime Survey does not yet capture the offence of \u2018coercive and controlling behaviour.\u2019\n\nAs we\u2019ve said before, the scale of domestic abuse is hard to measure accurately. The statistics are compiled through individuals answering questions in a \u2018self-completion\u2019 survey. The figures don\u2019t tell us anything about how many individual cases of abuse were experienced by the people responding to the survey. We also don\u2019t how many people who have suffered domestic abuse are reluctant or unable to report it in such a survey.\n\nAge UK has called for the definition of domestic abuse to be expanded to include abuse by carers.", "lang": "en"}
