Kate Brown did issue an order requiring people wear masks in seven counties, including Lincoln County.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2020-06-25T21:11:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-53155", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/oregon-whites-only-masks/", "vclaim": "In a policy that established requirements for people to wear masks in most public settings during the COVID-19 pandemic, Oregon's Lincoln County said in June 2020 residents of color are exempt from the rule.\n\nIn light of recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for all Americans to wear facial coverings to curb the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, numerous U.S. states and cities passed laws to establish their own set of requirements on masks in public settings in mid-2020. In Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown required seven counties to create guidelines by June 24, 2020, as businesses reopened after a months-long shutdown to limit in-person gatherings and the state\u2019s total of COVID-19 cases increased.\n\nWhile authoring the directives, those Oregon counties \u2014 Multnomah, Washington, Clackamas, Hood River, Marion, Polk and, most notably, Lincoln \u2014 could decide if, or to what extent, they would enforce the requirements and to whom they would apply in their jurisdiction.\n\nThat said, Lincoln County\u2019s take on Brown\u2019s assignment sparked allegations of racial prejudice and created a platform for people nationwide who believed all government-issued requirements on masks were unnecessary. In the days after the Lincoln County policy\u2019s initial release on June 17, 2020, numerous people reached out to us to confirm whether the county had indeed written its rule on facial coverings so it would only apply to white residents.\n\nThe question was largely a response to stories in right-wing media outlets including Breitbart with headlines such as, \u201cOregon County issues mask order that exempts \u2018people of color\u2019\u201d or \u201cOregon County Issues Coronavirus Mask Mandate, But Only For White People,\u201d as well as articles in the New York Post and other tabloids. A post on a site called Pacific Pundit that says its dedicated to exposing media bias claimed:\n\nBefore we delve into the claim, some context. Since the CDC\u2019s advisory that everyone wear masks in public settings where they can\u2019t maintain a 6-foot distance from others, numerous Black men and academics have expressed concerns over the facial coverings putting Black Americans at risk of racial profiling, whether in areas where officials are monitoring for compliance with the mask requirements, or where people are simply prone to stereotyping. Kevin Gaines, the Julian Bond professor of civil rights and social justice at the University of Virginia, said in a New York Times story on April 14, 2020:\n\nOn April 17, 2020, a group of U.S. senators \u2014 Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, Richard Durbin, D-Illinois, Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts, and Benjamin Cardin, D-Maryland \u2014 wrote a letter to leaders of the FBI and Department of Justice outlining a series of incidents in which Black men wearing protective masks were judged based on their appearance, including a citation to a case in which a Florida doctor was handcuffed and detained by police officers near his home. The letter also stated that some Black men reported being harassed for not wearing facial coverings during the pandemic.\n\n\n\n To investigate the above-mentioned claim that Lincoln County \u2014 a rural, coastal county where almost 90 percent of its nearly 50,000 residents are white (per 2019 Census data) \u2014 had mandated that only white people wear masks, we referred to the county\u2019s Health and Human Service Department\u2019s website. On June 17, 2020, the department (with support from the county\u2019s three-person board of commissioners) issued a directive that said all residents must wear masks in indoor public settings and outdoor spaces where they can\u2019t maintain social distancing, unless they were part of the following groups:\n\u2022 Persons with health/medical conditions that preclude or are exacerbated by wearing a face covering.\n\u2022 Children under the age of 12. Children over the age of 2 but under the age of 12 are encouraged to wear face coverings but not required to do so.\n\u2022 Persons with disabilities that prevents them from using the face covering as described in this Directive. These persons must be reasonably accommodated to allow them access to goods and services.\n\u2022 People of color who have heightened concerns about racial profiling and harassment due to wearing face coverings in public.\n\nIn other words, it was accurate to claim Lincoln County officials had issued a policy requiring masks that only applied to white residents.\n\nWe should note here that the rule, as well as guidelines on facial coverings in Oregon\u2019s Clackamas and Multnomah counties, were not written with the intention of citing people who disobeyed but were more so about making sure employers and businesses made masks available to people, according to county leaders. The Lincoln County policy reads:\n\nNevertheless, the Lincoln County measure faced swift and fierce backlash from right-wing commentators who alleged the rule put unfair restrictions on white residents and others who were confused by, what was interpreted to be, the county\u2019s lack of concern for its non-white population\u2019s health. One Twitter user wrote: \u201cI thought the mask was to protect others so are they saying they don\u2019t care if people of color get the virus? Can\u2019t they give it to each other if they don\u2019t wear a mask if this is true?\u201d And a comment on Newsweek\u2019s story on the Lincoln County measure stated:\n\nOn June 24, 2020, county officials issued a statement in which they said they had received \u201chorrifically racist commentary\u201d and were the subject of unprecedented \u201cvitriol\u201d from people countrywide after their mask rule went public. To explain their rationale for why they allowed people of color to be exempt from the public health requirement, the statement read:\n\nDespite the measure\u2019s intent, the exemption \u201ccreated a ripple of fear throughout our communities of color\u201d and \u201cthe very policy meant to protect them, is now making them a target for future discrimination and harassment.\u201d\n\nFor those reasons \u2014 and after requests from non-white county residents to revise the requirements \u2014 Lincoln County officials said in the June 24, 2020, statement that they had rewritten the policy and removed the controversial exemption. It stated:\n\nIn sum, while it is accurate to say Lincoln County officials in June 2020 established a rule that required people to wear masks with an exemption for residents of color, authorities were not going to enforce the requirements, and the policy was later changed so that all residents \u2014 no matter their race \u2014 must wear the facial coverings to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We therefore rate this claim as \u201cOutdated.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
