So when the 86-year-old said in an interview that he quit smoking for health reasons, it prompted some very against-type anxiety among fans.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Nelson told San Antonio\u2019s KSAT-TV that he stopped smoking weed because he believes smoking has damaged his lungs over the years:\n\nNelson, 86, said \u201cI have abused my lungs quite a bit in the past, so breathing is a little more difficult these days and I have to be careful.\u201d \u201cI started smoking cedar bark, went from that to cigarettes to whatever,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that almost killed me.\u201d It didn\u2019t, so he made a decision. \u201cI don\u2019t smoke anymore \u2014 take better care of myself,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nThe news resulted in something of an internet panic. Celebrity news and gossip publication Page Six, for example, opened its report saying, \u201cIt\u2019s like Michael Jordan retiring from the NBA. It\u2019s like Donald Trump quitting Twitter. It\u2019s like Lindsay Lohan forsaking drama. Willie Nelson has quit weed.\u201d\n\nBut while Nelson did give up smoking to preserve his health, there are more ways to consume marijuana than puffing on a joint. Nelson\u2019s spokeswoman Elaine Schock clarified for the Associated Press that Nelson hasn\u2019t stopped using pot. She also hinted that his statement about no longer smoking wasn\u2019t exactly a hard-and-fast rule:\n\nHis spokeswoman, Elaine Schock, told The Associated Press in an email Wednesday that Nelson hasn\u2019t given up cannabis, and she points out there are different ways to consume it. \u201cThat said,\u201d she said \u201cWillie does what he wants, when he wants, when it comes to smoking.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
