Users who respond to those fake offers are required to share a website link or social media post in order to spread the scam more widely and lure in additional victims. Then those users are presented with a \u201csurvey\u201d that extracts personal information such as email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, and even sometimes credit card numbers. Finally, those who wish to claim their \u201cfree\u201d gift cards or coupons eventually learn they must first sign up to purchase a number of costly goods, services, or subscriptions (negating the \u201cfree\u201d aspect of the offer).\n\nKohl\u2019s current coupon promotions, which are linked from their official Facebook page, are promo codes good for 20% or $10 off purchases of $50 or more.\n\nThe Better Business Bureau offers three tips to identify similar gift card/coupon scams:\n\nDon\u2019t believe what you see. It\u2019s easy to steal the colors, logos and header of an established organization. Scammers can also make links look like they lead to legitimate websites and emails appear to come from a different sender. Legitimate businesses do not ask for credit card numbers or banking information on customer surveys. If they do ask for personal information, like an address or email, be sure there\u2019s a link to their privacy policy. Watch out for a reward that\u2019s too good to be true. If the survey is real, you may be entered in a drawing to win a gift card or receive a small discount off your next purchase. Few businesses can afford to give away $50 gift cards for completing a few questions.", "lang": "en"}
