This photograph actually shows a miniature figurine.\n\nAn image supposedly showing the world\u2019s smallest bird, a zunzuncito, was widely circulated on social media in 2019. A posting from the Facebook page Nature Gold, for instance, racked up more than 45,000 shares:\n\nThe zunzuncito (Mellisuga helenae), also known as the bee hummingbird or Helena hummingbird, is considered the world\u2019s smallest bird. However, the above-displayed photograph does not show this tiny bird. In fact, this photograph doesn\u2019t feature a real animal at all but a miniature figurine of a chickadee.\n\nThe figurine was created by a Bulgarian artist named Ina who runs the Facebook page Malinik Miniatures. This figurine was sold for $65 on eBay and was described as follows:\n\nOn the Malinik Miniatures Facebook page, Ina posted a photograph that showed the creation of this miniature chickadee:\n\nThough this viral photograph is not of a real bird, the zunzuncito is indeed real and considered to be the world\u2019s smallest bird.\n\nThe zunzuncito weighs less than a dime and only grows to about 2.25 inches. Here\u2019s how the National Audubon Society described this miniature hummingbird:\n\nThe Bee Hummingbird, which is found only in Cuba, is an absolute miniature, even among hummingbirds. It measures a mere two and a quarter inches long. Bee Hummingbirds are often mistaken for bees. They weigh less than two grams \u2014 less than a dime. That\u2019s half the weight of our backyard hummers, like the Ruby-throated or Rufous. The female builds a nest barely an inch across. Her eggs are about the size of a coffee bean. In flight, the Bee Hummingbird\u2019s tiny wings beat 80 times a second. And during a courtship flight, they beat up to 200 times per second! The male\u2019s entire head and throat shine in fiery pinkish-red, and blazing red feathers point like spikes down the sides of the breast.\n\nThis is hardly the first time an artistic creation has been mistaken for a real-life animal. We\u2019ve previously covered figurines that supposedly showed a baby platypus, baby owls, a Japanese Giant Emperor Moth, a \u201chaiku bird,\u201d and a rare \u201cmarbled fuark.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
