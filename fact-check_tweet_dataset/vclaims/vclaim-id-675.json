Yorktown in South Carolina. During that appearance, Trump invoked a vague approach to campaign issues as he proposed restricting access for some individuals to the internet:\n\nWe have to go see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what\u2019s happening. We have to talk to them about, maybe in certain areas, closing that Internet up in some way \u2026 Somebody will say, \u2018Oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech.\u2019 These are foolish people.\n\nPredictably, Trump\u2019s assertion prompted a range of reactions on social media and in the news. Technology blog Gizmodo blasted the ambiguity of the remarks in an article titled \u201cTrump\u2019s Plan to Fight ISIS Online Is So Fucking Vacant I Can Barely Blog About It\u201d (filed to the category \u201cireugjieogifdosjbnfdkslgjdslafjdsioalhfgdf\u2026\u201d) centering on the impossibility of such a plan:\n\nPumpkin-flavored arsenic marshmallow Donald Trump gave a speech at the Pearl Harbor Day Rally at the USS Yorktown in South Carolina tonight. After a day of rambling about banning Muslims, Trump offered some hazy suggestions for fighting ISIS\u2019s growing influence online. Trump then suggested \u201cclosing the internet in some way.\u201d He did not specify how.\n\nThe New York Times\u2018 \u201cBits\u201d blog addressed the comments in an 8 December 2015 post titled \u201cWhy Donald Trump\u2019s Call to \u2018Close Up\u2019 the Internet Is Science Fiction,\u201d characterizing his statement as nebulous and technologically impossible in every conceivable way:\n\nIt is not clear what Donald Trump actually meant on Monday when he conjured up the idea of getting Bill Gates to help \u201cclose up\u201d the Internet. Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t elaborated yet, and Mr. Gates, who stepped down as Microsoft\u2019s chairman last year, is spending most of his days at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. However, since he remains a technology adviser to the company\u2019s current chief executive, Satya Nadella, you could imagine Mr. Gates returning to Redmond, Wash., where Microsoft is based, and the two of them going down into the basement at Microsoft HQ and pulling the plug. The problem is that the Internet\u2019s backbone doesn\u2019t run through Redmond, and it never did.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments caused a degree of confusion sufficient enough to prompt readers to ask whether the candidate made them at all, or if the remarks were the work of a satire news site. While it\u2019s true that Trump made the comments attributed to him at a 7 December 2015 rally, the specifics of his proposed internet counterterrorism initiative remained so unclear that gleaning a specific policy course of action from them was, by all interpretations, completely impossible.\n\nThe clearest takeaway was that Trump referenced \u201cradicalized\u201d individuals in his remarks, and didn\u2019t suggest restricting the broader internet. The inherent implausibility of that plan (and its total lack of relevance to any \u201cfree speech\u201d issue) aside, Trump didn\u2019t appear to suggest a sweeping internet ban. Bill Gates has yet to comment on Trump\u2019s proposal.", "lang": "en"}
