(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThis is an old, fabricated tale that was created on a junk website in 2016 and has since been debunked numerous times.\n\nThe story goes that a 42-year-old man named Joel Miller was arrested for assault and attempted murder in Omaha. During questioning, the story says, Miller admitted that he had already killed 30 people (in the initial account, the victims were registered sex offenders).\n\nThe story first appeared in October 2016 on a website called Empire News, self-described as a site \"intended for entertainment purposes only.\"\n\n\"Our website and social media content uses only fictional names, except in cases of public figure and celebrity parody or satirization. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental,\" the website\u2019s disclaimer reads.\n\nBut the fictional story was re-published by other websites that have a history of publishing false content, such as YourNewsWire and NewsPunch, (most of the published stories have been deleted) and eventually made its way to social media, morphed into memes.\n\nThe fake article does not cite a single source, besides simply \"police say.\" And we searched the internet and news archives but didn\u2019t find any credible reports of a man in Nebraska admitting to killing 30 pedophiles or registered sex offenders.\n\nAs well, the picture of the man in the cruiser used to illustrate the story was actually taken years earlier and far away from Nebraska. The photo was uploaded by Chris Yarzab to Flickr in September 2008 with Glendale, California, as the tagged location.\n\nThis fake story is full-on Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
