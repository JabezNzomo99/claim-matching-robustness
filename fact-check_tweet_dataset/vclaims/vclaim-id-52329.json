His lawyer has also refuted the claim.\n\nGugino attended a June 4 protest against police brutality in Buffalo, New York, where he was shoved by two police officers, causing him to fall backward and hit his head on the ground, according to video of the incident.\n\nIn recent weeks, some social media users, including President Donald Trump, have made dubious claims about Gugino. This particular post alleges that he has been arrested 300 times, including 82 arrests for incitement. The image appears to show Gugino in handcuffs being escorted away by a police officer.\n\n\u201cThis is the \u2018kindly old man\u2019 who was \u2018pushed\u2019 in Buffalo,\u201d text above the image reads. \u201cMr. Gugino had been previously arrested 300 times. 82 times for incitement. Riots is what he does for a living.\u201d\n\nBut the Daily Caller News Foundation didn\u2019t find any evidence that Gugino had been arrested 300 times. His lawyer, Kelly V. Zarcone, refuted the claim in an email to the DCNF.\n\n\u201cIt is false,\u201d Zarcone said in an email. \u201cHe was arrested 4 times for peacefully protesting and never convicted of anything. In fact, 3 of the 4 arrests did not even result in any charges against him.\u201d\n\nGugino detailed the four times he said he\u2019s been arrested on his personal blog: in Orange County, California, in 2009, near the White House in 2012 and 2013 and near the Capitol in 2016. The DCNF confirmed each of those arrests occurred.\n\nThe first arrest appears to have involved an unnamed misdemeanor that occurred in Orange County, California in 2009, according to records obtained by the DCNF. PolitiFact reported Gugino was found not guilty of a misdemeanor charge for trespassing.\n\nNo public records could be obtained for the 2012 incident, but it appears to be the one photographed in the post. A reverse image search of the photo revealed it was taken by filmmaker Justin Norman in January, 2012, and can be found on Norman\u2019s Flickr page.\n\n\u201cMartin Gugino is arrested for peacefully protesting against the Guant\u00e1namo detention center in front of the White House,\u201d the caption said.

This time he was arrested for \u201cdemonstrating without a permit,\u201d according to an email from Sgt. Eduardo Delgado, a public information officer for the Park Police.\n\nThe fourth arrest Gugino mentions on his blog occurred in January 2016 when he was arrested with about 30 other people by Capitol Police for \u201cunlawful demonstration activities near the Rotunda steps of the U.S. Capitol Building,\u201d according to an emailed statement from the Capitol Police.\n\nThe DCNF also searched Google, LexisNexis and online databases but found no record of any other arrests. PACER, a database of case and docket information for federal courts, also had no results, according to PolitiFact.\n\nGugino suffered a fractured skull and is unable to walk, CNN reported on June 16.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
