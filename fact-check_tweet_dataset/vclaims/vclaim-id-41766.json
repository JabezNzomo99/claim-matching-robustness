Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: A Muslim woman and her daughter were deliberately hit by a car in UP due to Islamophobia. Fact: The victims of the car accident shown in the video are not Muslims. The victims were identified as Usha Devi and her daughter Pushpanjali. So, there is no communal angle to the incident. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image Search, a \u2018News 18 UP Uttarakhand\u2019 video regarding the incident was found in the search results. From the video, it is be found that the incident happened at Rasra in Ballia district of Uttar Pradesh. When searched with the keywords, news articles regarding the incident were found. On \u2018The Week\u2019 website, it can be read that \u2018the victims were identified as Usha Devi and her daughter Pushpanjali, 12.\u2019 Other news articles regarding the accident can be read here and here.\n\nAlso, in the FIR filed on the incident, the names of the victims were written as Usha Devi and Pushpanjali. So, the victims are not Muslims.\n\nA fewpeople were commenting on social media that the woman in the video is wearing a burqa. But, in the videos and photos posted by local news portals, it can be seen that the woman was not wearing a burqa\n\nTo sum it up, a video of an accident in Rasra (Ballia, UP) is being falsely shared with a communal narrative and the victims of the accident are not muslims.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
