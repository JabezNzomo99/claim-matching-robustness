Through this article lets fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Supreme court\u2019s motto is changed from \u2018Satyameva Jayate\u2019 to \u2018Yato Dharmastato Jayah\u2019. Fact: PIB through a tweet confirmed that the claim about Supreme court\u2019s changing its motto from \u2018Satyameva Jayate\u2019 to \u2018Yato Dharmastato Jayah\u2019 is false. Also, we looked through the archives of the supreme court website dating back to 2010 where we could see the moto \u2018Yato Dharmastato Jayah\u2019 on the website. Even the Supreme Court\u2019s logo in Judgments dating back to 2010 is \u2018Yato Dharmastato Jayah\u2019. With this, we can conclude that the Supreme court motto has not changed recently. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nGoogle search with the keywords \u2018Supreme court of India motto\u2019 led us to tweet by PIB clearing the air regarding this claim. According to their tweet, the claim that the Supreme courts motto inscription is changed from \u2018Satyameva Jayate\u2019 to \u2018Yato Dharmastato Jayah\u2019 is false.\n\nIn a document which is found in the history section of the Supreme Court website which describes the dharma chakra logo, we can see \u201cYatodharmastato jayah\u201d (Truth alone I uphold) inscribed below the logo.\n\nWhen we looked through the archives of the Supreme court website on the wayback machine, in the oldest archive which is dated 06 Febuary 2006 we can see the moto \u2018Yatodharmastato jayah\u2019 on the letterhead of the then Chief Justice of India VN Khare.\n\nIn another such archive dated 20 November 2010, we can find the moto \u2018Yatodharmastato jayah\u2019 on the website.\n\nIn yet another archive dated 24 October 2010, we can clearly see the moto \u2018Yatodharmastato jayah\u2019 on the website. So the claim that Supreme court changed its moto recently is not true.\n\nEven in the Supreme Court judgements dating back to 2009 & 2010, we can see the \u2018Yatodharmastato jayah\u2019 logo.\n\nTo sum it up, Supreme court did not change its moto recently.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
