The prescription was purportedly written and shared by an Ayurveda doctor in Sri Lanka. The claim is misleading; medical experts advise against using herbal remedies to treat the coronavirus, and urge those experiencing symptoms to seek professional medical assistance.\n\nThe photo was posted on Facebook here on March 13, 2020. The post has since been shared more than 45,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe writing on the purported prescription is Sinhala language. It translates to English as: \u201cAncient medicine recipe for coronavirus\u201d and lists 11 varieties of medicinal herbs, which it states should be boiled together and consumed daily.\n\nThe post\u2019s Sinhala caption reads, in part: \u201cDecided to issue an ancient medicine recipe for coronavirus. By drinking this ancient medicine recipe, this is a great medicine for all viral infections that can afflict the human body as well as coronavirus\u2026\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 epidemic that has killed more than 6,606 people and infected some 167,511 others, according to this latest WHO report published on March 16.\n\nThe photo of the prescription was also shared with a similar claim on Facebook here and here.\n\nHealth experts said the Ayurvedic herbal remedy is not effective for treating COVID-19.\n\n\u201cAyurveda began in 800-1000 BC and the coronavirus was not discovered at the time,\u201d Dr. L. P. A. Karunathilake, a senior lecturer at the Colombo University Institute of Indegenous Medicine, told AFP by phone on March 16, 2020. \u201cMoreover, the novel coronavirus was found in 2019, so it is impossible to treat COVID-19 using an ancient Ayurveda medicine recipe.\u201d\n\nKarunathilake also noted that while the 11 medicinal herbs mentioned in the prescription can be used to reduce fever symptoms, he cautioned against drinking the concoction as a coronavirus remedy.\n\nThe brew \u201cmay subside the fever but if the individual has contracted COVID-19, he/she could end up contaminating the environment around them and transmitting the disease to many others,\u201d he said.\n\nKarunathilake also warned that \u201cif one consumes the concoction without fever for a prolonged period, it can cause long term health complications, including kidney and liver issues.\u201d\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s Health Promotion Bureau (HPB) urged the public not to attempt to treat the coronavirus with home remedies.\n\n\u201cThese types of home remedies can create a false sense of security and distract the public from using basic preventive measures that can actually minimize COVID-19 transmission risk and defeat community infection control efforts,\u201d Dr. Ashan Pathirana, the HPB Registrar, told AFP by phone on March 15, 2020.\n\nHPB\u2019s official coronavirus guidelines can be viewed here.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) also maintains that there is currently no effective remedy for the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cWhile some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease,\u201d the agency states here. \u201cWHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
