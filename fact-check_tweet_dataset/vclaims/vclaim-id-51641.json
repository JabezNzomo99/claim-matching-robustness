However, Facebook told Full Fact that this was due to a hacking attempt, and the page and the Facebook event for the cup have both been restored. The restored Facebook page has also posted about this hacking attempt.\n\nFull Fact has also reached out to the Lee Rigby Foundation about the page.\n\nThis article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this\u2014and find out how to report Facebook content\u2014here. For the purposes of that scheme, we\u2019ve rated this claim as partly false because the page was removed by Facebook after a hacking attempt, and later reinstated, and not because of \u201cleft-wing pressure\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
