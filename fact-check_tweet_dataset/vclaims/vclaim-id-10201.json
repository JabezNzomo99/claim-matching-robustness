National statistics do not provide detail to show whether men who have died by suicide were fathers.\n\nTracey Bell-Henselin\u2019s statement that there has been \u201can increase in male suicide, with estimates as high as 21 suicides per week because of the family breakdown nationally\u201d is only partly supported by the facts.\n\nThere has been an overall increase in the number and rate of male deaths by suicide between 2007 and 2016. The rate of male deaths by suicide increased from 16.4 in 2007 to 17.9 in 2016.\n\nIn 2016, there were the equivalent of 41 male deaths by suicide per week in Australia.\n\nIf \u201cfamily breakdown\u201d is understood to mean the end of a romantic relationship, then this is a well-established risk factor for death by suicide among males.\n\nHowever, there aren\u2019t data to show exactly how many Australian male deaths by suicide may be associated with family breakdown, and we should avoid making claims about causation.\n\nAre \u2018up to 21 fathers\u2019 dying by suicide every week?\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics is the key source of national suicide data.\n\nWe can look at the number and rate of male death by suicide for all men.\n\nIn 2016 the total number of male deaths by suicide was 2,151. If we divide that number over the 52 weeks of a year, it works out to roughly 41 per week \u2013 almost double the number Dickson and Bell-Henselin cited.\n\nThat number is for all men, not only fathers. The national statistics can tell us how many people of a particular age and sex died by suicide, but don\u2019t provide detail about life circumstances. They don\u2019t tell us whether the person who died was a father, or had been in a family unit.\n\nHas there been an increase in male suicide?\n\nLooking at these data, we can see there has been an increase in the number of male deaths by suicide over the past decade, from 1,699 deaths in 2007 to 2,151 in 2016.\n\nThere has also been an increase in the rate of male deaths by suicide, or deaths per 100,000 people, which accounts for changes in population size. The rate of male deaths by suicide increased from 16.4 in 2007 to 17.9 in 2016.\n\nIf we look at the most recent years, both the number and rate of male deaths by suicide in 2016 were slightly lower than in 2015 and 2014.\n\nIt is important to point out that the numbers are likely to change once the Australian Bureau of Statistics performs its standard data revisions. Usually, the number of recorded deaths rises once the Australian Bureau of Statistics includes cases where coroner\u2019s proceedings had not been finalised at the time when those data were first collated.\n\nSo, at this stage, we\u2019re not able to say exactly what has happened with male deaths by suicide over the last couple of years.\n\nCan this be attributed to \u2018family breakdown\u2019?\n\nBell-Henselin said \u201cas many as 21\u201d male deaths by suicide were \u201cbecause of the family breakdown nationally\u201d.\n\nWe can\u2019t say with any certainty how many deaths were associated with \u201cfamily breakdown\u201d, or with any other events that may have preceded a death. Again, the national statistics do not provide this level of detail.\n\nThe term \u201cfamily breakdown\u201d will mean different things to different people. Bell-Henselin was speaking in the context of couples with children.\n\nThe term \u201cfamily breakdown\u201d could also be used to refer to circumstances like intimate relationship dissolution, and separation and divorce.\n\nIf we include all these definitions, then Australian and international evidence does show associations between these life events and suicide risk.\n\nA higher prevalence of suicide in separated and divorced individuals has long been noted. Separation and recent divorce appear to be important. These acute life stressors elevate the risk of suicide.\n\nRelative to females, males may be at a higher risk of suicide following relationship breakdown. And Australian research suggests that men\u2019s suicide risk is further elevated if separation is coupled with shame relating to the event, lower education levels, and stressful legal negotiations.\n\nSo, it is fair to say that there is a connection between family breakdown \u2013 meaning relationship dissolution, separation or divorce \u2013 and deaths by suicide among males.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer that suicide is caused by (or occurs \u201cbecause of\u201d) family breakdown. Suicide is a complex phenomenon, involving interactions between many different biological, psychological, and social factors. Therefore, we can\u2019t say how many male deaths by suicide are \u201cbecause of the family breakdown\u201d. \u2013 Samara McPhedran\n\nThis is a sound FactCheck. The figures cited for male deaths by suicide are correct and the information regarding the risk factors for suicide has been taken from reliable sources.\n\nSuicide is a complex phenomenon that has multiple causes and should never be attributed to one factor alone. \u2013 Jo Robinson\n\nUpdate, 12.36pm, November 15, 2017: Following publication of this FactCheck, a One Nation spokesperson provided The Conversation with additional comment from Steve Dickson.
