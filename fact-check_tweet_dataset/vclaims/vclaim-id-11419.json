No, that's not true: although there was some real violence and car burning after rumors of a \"Halloween Purge\" against police spread on social media the news about the huge death toll and the inflated number of cars burned all came from a Belgian satire website. That part is not true. The French headline even speaks of \"23 lightly dead\", a clear indication it was meant as a joke.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by NordPresse on October 31, 2018 titled \"Purge d'Halloween: 1600 voitures br\u00fbl\u00e9es, 320 bless\u00e9s, 23 morts l\u00e9gers\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nTraveling in the Val-d'Oise, the Minister of the Interior announced the reinforcement of 200 police in the department in the department after the publication of messages calling for the \"purge\" of police on social networks.\n\nAccording to the first results of the evening, the purge is a great success with more than 1600 cars burned, 320 wounded and 23 dead.\n\nChristophe Castaner also asked the prefects to reinforce the security forces throughout the territory. Martial law may be reinstated in case of further overflow due to the state of emergency.\n\nHowever the numbers are greatly exaggerated. French newspaper Le Parisien reports the real figures:\n\nIt mentions about a hundred arrests in connection with various riots in several places and dozens of small fires (including several cars) but no dead.\n\nLe Journal Du Nord (nordpresse.be) is a satirical website that was set up to mock the (real) sudpresse.be (since renamed sudinfo.be), a Belgian media group. They were involved in a lawsuit with each other in 2017 which was eventually won by NordPresse.\n\nThey have sort of a disclaimer in their header that reads:\n\nTranslated: \"all information verified by our monkey analysts\".\n\nWe wrote about nordpresse.be before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: NO 12 (Or 89 Or 123 Or 135) Dead, NO 870 Wounded, NO 13000 Cars Burned In French Riots Post World Cup Victory\n\u2022 Fake News: French Ex-President Sarkozy Did NOT Claim He Didn't Know Gaddafi Was A Dictator, Only Took 50 Million \"To Help\"\n\nThe second article in that list deserves some extra attention: this is not the first time the site is caught overinflating riot-related numbers:", "lang": "en"}
