As of March 24 the virus has spread to more than 150 countries with 372,757 cases globally and 16,231 deaths. In Italy, there have been 63,927 cases and 6077 deaths recorded.\n\nThe first cases in Italy were reported on January 31 in Rome. These were followed by outbreaks in the Lombardy region, where 16 million people were placed under quarantine in the first week of March. At that stage, the death toll in Italy was 230, with the mortality rate standing at 36 per day.\n\nThe post urges people to stay home, which is in line with official advice in Australia and New Zealand on minimising social interactions to limit the spread of the coronavirus. However the problem is the photograph of an aircraft hangar filled with coffins is unrelated to COVID-19. The picture by news agency AFP was first published on October 5, 2013, following the sinking two days earlier of a boat carrying hundreds of African asylum-seekers off the Italian island of Lampedusa. The boat had left Libya 13 days before, carrying up to 500 people, according to survivors.\n\nA UNHCR report on the tragedy says that when the boat\u2019s engine stopped off the Italian coast, asylum seekers set fire to clothing in their attempts to be seen, but \u201cfishing boats passed without helping\u201d. Only 155 people survived and 366 were killed. The AFP photo shows the coffins of some of the victims in a hangar of Lampedusa airport.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the post to be partly false. Italy continues to record one of the highest rates of new COVID-19 cases per day and many countries are in lockdown in an attempt to make people stay at home to stem infection rates. However, the photo is unrelated to COVID-19. It shows some of the coffins of migrants who died after a boat sank off the southern Italian island of Lampedusa in 2013.
