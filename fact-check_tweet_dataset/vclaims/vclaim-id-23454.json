The picture shown is a legitimate photograph taken in November 1987.\n\nFrom Reagan to the musician John Lennon, the internet would have you believe that decades ago, many prominent figures made striking predictions about an \u201coutsider\u201d and \u201cbusiness man\u201d who would one day become president. \u201cSomeone like Donald Trump as crazy as that sounds,\u201d Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain purportedly said in 1993.\n\nJust as there\u2019s no record of Lennon or Cobain actually making such predictions, the quote attributed to Reagan is spurious as well.\n\nThe picture shown in the meme is genuine and can be found on the Reagan Presidential Library and Museum website. \u201cPresident Reagan shaking hands with Donald Trump at a Reception for members of the \u2018Friends of Art and Preservation in Embassies\u2019 Foundation in the Blue room,\u201d the caption reads, dated November 1987.\n\nOn the same page of \u201cVIP\u201d photographs, Trump is pictured with Reagan and then-wife Ivana Trump at a state dinner for the king of Saudia Arabia in February 1985.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that Reagan made such a statement about Trump. The quote does not appear in the online archives of the presidential library, and The Daily Caller found no news outlets recording these words at the time of the photograph or in any year thereafter.\n\nCraig Shirley, a Reagan biographer and presidential historian, told the Caller in an email, \u201cI frankly doubt Reagan ever said this. There is no recorded history of this and I\u2019ve asked myself and many others who knew Reagan if this sounded like him,\u201d and they said no. \u201cI worked for him, heard him speak a thousand times, have read his speeches and radio commentaries and his press conferences and he never ever said something remotely similar.\u201d\n\nReagan\u2019s son, Michael, said in 2016 of his father: \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d be appreciative of the demeaning style of Donald Trump \u2013 the way he\u2019s treated the other candidates \u2013 because my father knew that at the end of the day he had to bring everyone together to win an election.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
