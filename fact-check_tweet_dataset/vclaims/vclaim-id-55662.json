The claim is false; the photo was first published online long before the pandemic and shows a waste management officer.\n\nThe purported image of the Nollywood actress appears in several posts shared in Nigeria and Ghana, including this one posted by popular Ghanaian radio station Peace FM. It has garnered more than 2,000 comments since it was published on April 9, 2020.\n\nThe post links to a publication on the radio station\u2019s website, headlined: \"Actress Funke Akindele Clears Rubbish On The Streets As She Commences Her 14 Days Community Service Sentence\". Many of the comments suggest viewers believed the claim to be true.\n\nAkindele was sentenced to 14 days' community service on April 6, 2020, for hosting her husband\u2019s birthday party at their Lagos residence, going against government rules on social distancing. The couple are the first to be tried under the new law to combat COVID-19, which has infected at least 158 people in Lagos, the epicentre of the pandemic in Nigeria.\n\nBoth Akindele and her husband Abdulrasheed Bello were fined 100,000 naira ($261) each and told to self-isolate for 14 days in addition to the community service, a Lagos court ruled.\n\nIn Nigeria, the claim that the photograph of a woman collecting waste showed Akindele was published on \u201cMy State News\u201d, a website that has previously been debunked by AFP here and here.\n\nPosts found here and here on Facebook, here and here on Twitter, and here and here on Instagram were all shared with a similar claim.\n\nHowever, the photo has been circulating on social media since at least January 2018, nearly two years before the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\nA Google reverse image search for the photo led AFP to several versions of the image, including this earliest version posted on Twitter on January 12, 2020 by Cleaner Lagos, an initiative of the Lagos state ministry of environment.\n\nThe picture features among four images as showing the first group of Community Sanitation Workers who commenced work in selected areas of Lagos state. \u201cUnder the Cleaner Lagos Initiative, 27,500 people will be employed as Community Sanitation Workers who will sweep the streets of Lagos,\u201d the tweet reads in part.\n\nThere are no reports from major Nigerian news outlets that the movie star has begun her community service.\n\nLagos and Nigeria\u2019s capital Abuja, as well as Ogun state, are on lockdown after Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on March 29, 2020, ordered the \u201ccessation of all movement\u201d to contain the coronavirus outbreak.", "lang": "en"}
