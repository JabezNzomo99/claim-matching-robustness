Likening the clashes to terrorism, former aviation minister and a prominent critic of the government Femi Fani-Kayode said terrorism deaths in Nigeria were higher than acknowledged.\n\n\"In the past year, Nigeria has experienced the greatest increase in deaths from terrorism, with 7,512 deaths reported - an increase of over 300%\",\n\nto his more than 650,000 followers at the beginning of January 2018.\n\n, Fani-Kayode, a lawyer, added: \u201cIt is far higher than 7,512 in the past year. It is at least 50,000.\u201d\n\nData quoted is three years old\n\nFani-Kayode is yet to respond to our query for the specific media report he cited or the source of his figure of 50,000 deaths. (\n\nWe traced his claim of 7,512 deaths to\n\nby The Independent in November 2015. Citing the 2015\n\n, the article said that the 7,512 deaths recorded in Nigeria in 2014 were an increase \u201cof\n\nover 300% \u2013 most of which have been claimed by Boko Haram\u201d.\n\nThe index said it had sourced its data from\n\nand that this was for the 2014 calendar year. It defined terrorism as \u201cthe threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non\u2010state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation\u201d.\n\n\n\n Calculating deaths from terrorism is difficult as there is no single globally accepted definition, analysts told Africa Check. This means some death tolls can be understated or inflated, depending on which definition is used. \n\n\n\n \u201cGranted there is no single, universally accepted definition of terrorism but of terrorism by the United States government suffices,\u201d Don Okereke, a Lagos-based \n\n This defines terrorism as \u201cthe unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives\u201d. \n\n\n\n \u201cIt is logical to conclude that deaths resulting from any or all of the aforesaid activities could be deemed terror-related,\u201d said Okereke. \n\n\n\n , agreed this was an acceptable definition within the Nigerian context. \u201cThe crucial thing to note when assessing the human cost of terrorism is to remember that for an act to be properly construed as a terrorist act, it\u2026 must have been committed with the aim of achieving a clear, stated political objective,\u201d Effiong said. \n\n\n\n Note: The Nigerian government\u2019s definition of terrorism can be\n\nThe most recent edition of the terrorism index was released in November 2017. Its data covers the 2016 calendar year because its compilation takes time. This Murray Ackman, a research fellow at the\n\nThe report showed that deaths from terrorism in Nigeria peaked at 7,538 in 2014, fell to 4,940 in 2015 and fell further to 1,832 in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the numbers for 2017 yet, but early indicators suggest that deaths from terrorism in Nigeria continued to fall in 2017,\u201d Ackman said.\n\n\u201cFor Nigeria to have experienced 50,000 deaths from terrorism in 2017 would mean it would need to have both the most deaths ever recorded from terrorism and the largest yearly increase ever recorded. [This] would be more than double the deaths from terrorism than the rest of the world combined.\u201d\n\nEven if a broader definition of \u201carmed conflict\u201d was used, the most recent data shows that in 2016 there 100,000 battle-related deaths from more than 100 armed conflicts globally, Ackman said.\n\n\u201cIt is not possible that terrorism in Nigeria has had the equivalent of half of all the death from armed conflict (which tends to be much deadlier than terrorism) in one year.\u201d\n\nAckman said the only scenario that Nigeria would record such a number of deaths were if they were counted as an indirect consequence of terrorism, for example from displacement and food shortages. But these are by their nature difficult to calculate and attribute, he noted.\n\nTwo databases which have complete data for 2017 documented far fewer than 50,000 deaths due to violence.\n\nof political violence, recorded 3,310 incidents in Nigeria in 2017, and\n\n. Project manager Olivia Russell told Africa Check that while they code the lower of the figures they come across, the figure of 50,000 sounded \u201cvery high and unlikely\u201d.\n\n, documented 3,564 deaths in 2017 from violence in the country. These were from a variety of causes, including economic and social ones and by state security agents. It however notes that its data is \u201cindicative rather than definitive as certain categories of violent or terror acts may overlap while some may have been left out\u201d.\n\nConclusion: Counting terrorism deaths difficult, but no data shows 'at least 50,000' in Nigeria in 2017\n\nFemi Fani-Kayode, a former Nigerian cabinet minister and prominent government critic, claimed that the real death toll from terrorism in Nigeria was \u201cat least 50,000\u201d in 2017.\n\nExperts told Africa Check that while defining terrorism was difficult, that figure was a gross overestimate - even according to the broadest definitions.\n\nFor Nigeria to have experienced 50,000 deaths in 2017 means it would have had the most deaths ever recorded from terrorism in a single year - a record of about 10,000 held by Iraq in 2014.\n\nWe therefore rate Fani-Kayode\u2019s claim as incorrect. While the challenges with internal security that Nigeria faces are well documented and rightly of national concern, the debate around it should be informed by accurate data.", "lang": "en"}
