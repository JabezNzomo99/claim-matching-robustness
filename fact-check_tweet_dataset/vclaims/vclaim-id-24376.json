According to the posts, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i made the order after claims that the apps lacked the proper licences to operate in Kenya. However, a ministry spokeswoman told AFP she was not aware of any such \u2018pronouncement or action\u2019 by Matiang\u2019i.\n\nAn article published on the website hivipunde.com, which we\u2019ve archived here, claimed Matiang\u2019i had asked Kenyans not to repay loans to five companies -- Branch, Tala, Opesa, Okash and Zenka -- \u201cas they operate illegally in the country\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are urging the public not to clear the existing loans until a case is determined on how the Mobile lending apps acquired licences to operate. We are doing everything humanly possible to ensure that all business operations in the country follow the law,\" the website quoted Matiang\u2019i as saying.\n\nAccording to social media analysis tool CrowdTangle, the article was shared more than 150 times. Other articles with similar claims were published here and here.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s a screenshot of the headline from that final article -- published on the website Butwaa.com -- that appears to be circulating most widely.\n\nIt was posted on numerous Facebook pages, including Group Kenya, a public Facebook group with more than two million members. The post was shared more than 90 times, accruing more than 2000 comments and reactions.\n\n\u201cKenyans,.......early xmas. Dr. Matiangi for president, \u201c the caption on the May 21, 2019 post reads.\n\nWe\u2019ve archived a few other Facebook posts that shared the screenshot of the article here, here and here.\n\nSome online users appeared pleased by the supposed order from Matiang\u2019i to halt their loan repayments, while others questioned whether the article was accurate.\n\nBut Wangui Muchiri, spokeswoman for Matiang\u2019i\u2019s ministry, said he had made no such order.\n\nShe told AFP via WhatsApp message that she was \u201cunaware of such pronouncement or action\u201d by the minister.\n\nThe central bank wants mobile lending apps to be regulated\n\nThe Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has been pushing for the regulation of mobile lending services, accusing them of charging Kenyans exorbitant interest rates. Tala, for instance, charges 15-percent interest on a 30-day loan, and 11 percent on 21-day loans.\n\nAs reported by local media last week, CBK governor Patrick Njoroge singled out three such apps -- Tala, Branch and Okash -- while giving evidence to a parliamentary committee, saying they could easily be used to launder illicit cash.\n\nIn July 2018, the CBK, the ministry of trade and four other institutions issued a statement warning Kenyans of the emergence of unlicensed and unregulated financial services and products available online.\n\nBut there has been no instruction from the government for Kenyans to stop paying off loans they have already taken out via mobile lending apps.", "lang": "en"}
