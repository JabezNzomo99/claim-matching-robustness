The claim is false, Marcos is not the author of the bill.\n\nMultiple Facebook posts, for example here and here, claim that Marcos was the original author of Senate Bill 1304 or the \u201cFree Higher Education Act for All\u201d.\n\nThe bill, which was signed into law in August 2017, aims to provide students from state colleges and universities with free education.\n\nHere is a screenshot of one of the misleading posts:\n\nThe status, when translated to English, says:\n\n\"Bam Aquino is not the author of the 'Free Higher Education For All Act'. The original author of the BILL is Bongbong Marcos. It's just that scrap food is really a credit grabber.\"\n\n\u201cBam Aquino\u201d refers to Sen. Paolo Benigno Aquino IV, nephew of the late senator Benigno \u201cNinoy\u201d Aquino Jr. and a member of Liberal party, the main opposition in the Philippines.\n\nHe is sometimes called 'scrap food' because he filed a bill mandating that food-related businesses must give their spare food to food banks.\n\nAccording to the copy of Senate Bill 1304 posted on the Senate\u2019s online legislative archives, Marcos is not one of the authors of the free education bill.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the bill\u2019s authors:\n\nThe authors listed when it was filed on January 23, 2017, were Senators Recto, Villanueva, Ejercito, Aquino IV, Gatchalian, Pangilinan, Angara and Legarda.\n\nThe timeline of the bill\u2019s passage into law posted on the official government website shows that other senators were made co-authors.\n\nAll in all, the bill had 12 authors: senators Ralph Recto, Joel Villanueva, Joseph Victor Ejercito, Paolo Benigno \u201cBam\u201d Aquino IV, Sherwin Gatchalian, Francis Pangilinan, Juan Edgardo \u201cSonny\u201d Angara, Loren Legarda, Leila de Lima, Cynthia Villar, Juan Miguel Zubiri and Richard Gordon.\n\nThe timeline also specified the separate bills which had been filed by each senator as part of the push for free education in state colleges and universities, none of which were authored by Marcos.\n\nThese are Senate bill no. 61, Senate bill no. 158, Senate bill no. 173, Senate bill no. 177, Senate bill no. 198, Senate bill 962 and Senate bill 1220.\n\nSenate bill 1304 was filed on January 23, 2017 and was signed into law on August 15, 2017.\n\nMarcos, the son and namesake of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, served as senator from July 2010 to June 2016. He then narrowly lost the 2016 vice-presidential election.\n\nMarcos\u2019s official website also has a list of the bills he authored and filed when he was still senator. None of the legislation pushed for free education in state colleges and universities.\n\nHere is a separate list of all the bills he filed or authored connected to the education sector. None of these bills called for free tuition for students in state colleges and universities.", "lang": "en"}
