Gretchen Whitmer has authorized police to use lethal force to enforce the state\u2019s stay-at-home order.\n\nThere is no evidence that Whitmer authorized lethal force to enforce the state\u2019s lockdown. Those in violation of the stay-at-home order may be subject to a misdemeanor charge in accordance with Michigan law.\n\nWhitmer sprung into the national spotlight after publicly criticizing the federal government\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a move that incurred some criticism from President Donald Trump. And Trump is not the only one upset with the governor: Thousands of Michigan residents have taken to the streets to protest Whitmer\u2019s executive order suspending non-essential activities.\n\nWhitmer extended the statewide stay-at-home order April 24, while relaxing restrictions so some businesses can reopen and residents can participate in more activities. The stay-at-home order had previously required residents to remain indoors except for necessary outings and closed non-essential businesses and schools, according to Fox News. Michigan has been hit hard by the new coronavirus, with more than 40,000 confirmed cases as of April 29, according to data from the state.\n\nOne Facebook post suggested Whitmer is prepared to use lethal force to enforce her stay-at-home order. It features two adjacent images: a screen grab of an article titled \u201cWhitmer authorizes lethal force to maintain state lockdown\u201d and an image of Whitmer with the caption \u201cI don\u2019t care if all the stats are fake I\u2019m prepared to shoot people in the face if that\u2019s what it takes to keep them safe.\u201d\n\nThere is no truth to the claim. The headline shown in the Facebook post originated on The People\u2019s Cube, a political satire website. The article lists the author as \u201cChedoh, Kommissar of Viral Infections, Hero of Change, Prophet of the Future Truth.\u201d However, the Facebook post makes no note of the story and headline\u2019s satirical nature, presenting it as genuine news.

The governor\u2019s main priority remains protecting public health and the people of Michigan.\u201d\n\nThe text of Whitmer\u2019s stay-at-home order stated that a \u201cwillful violation of this order is a misdemeanor,\u201d in accordance with MCL 10.33 and MCL 30.405(3).\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
