The caption, roughly translated from Indonesian, says, \u201cPraise be to Allah\u2026 Saudi Arabia has opened this lockdown meaning Saudi Arabia is safe from Covid (sic).\u201d\n\nThe Saudi government partially lifted its nationwide curfew from April 26 until May 13 between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., except for in Mecca and other areas with high numbers of COVID-19 infections, according to Newsweek. It has since announced it will re-imposed the countrywide 24-hour curfew, starting May 23 through May 27, Reuters reported.\n\nThe footage does not show people celebrating in Saudi Arabia. Through a reverse image search of key frames, the Daily Caller found the footage in a longer video posted on YouTube in late April. That video\u2019s title says, \u201cDubai celebrating zero corona cases,\u201d while its caption reads, \u201cCelebrating zero corona cases, after opening the Naif area in Dubai,\u201d according to a translation.\n\nSignage for Mega Star Nutrition and Tide Dry Cleaners and Laundry visible in the video matches that near the intersection of 27th Street and Al Maktoum Hospital Road in Naif neighborhood of Dubai on Google Maps.

They commended the UAE efforts to contain the pandemic and provide the highest levels of protection to all community members.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
