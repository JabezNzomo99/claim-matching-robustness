The controversy has spurred two separate Supreme Court decisions, as well as a more recent federal appellate court ruling, as the two previous administrations sought to resolve the matter through executive actions. Two Supreme Court decisions that came down during the George W. Bush administration, in 2001 and 2006, fostered uncertainty over exactly what falls under the federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. In the 2006 Rapanos v. United States decision, for example, the court\u2019s four most conservative justices at the time offered a very constrained view that only \u201cnavigable waters\u201d met this test. But Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who refused to join either the conservatives or the liberals, suggested in a concurring opinion that the government could intervene when there was a \u201csignificant nexus\u201d between large water bodies and smaller, as well as intermittent, ones.\u201d\n\nStakeholders published estimates of the potential economic impact of the rule long before it was issued. But since the rule didn\u2019t go into effect, it\u2019s unclear what Trump is referring to by saying that \u201cEPA\u2019s regulators were putting people out of jobs by the hundreds of thousands.\u201d And for that matter, it\u2019s unclear why Trump says the rule \u2013 which, again, has been halted \u2013 is \u201cprohibiting\u201d farmers, ranchers and other agricultural workers from \u201cbeing allowed to do what they\u2019re supposed to be doing.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Farm Bureau Foundation, two of the biggest critics of the rule, did not conduct a review of jobs lost since the court issued a stay. We checked with several other industry groups that had opposed the rule or asked the EPA to withdraw the rule, but received no estimate for jobs lost.\n\n\u201cThere is solid evidence that the federal permitting programs in question, over many years, have greatly increased costs and delays for major projects. That has negatively impacted the ability of companies, many of which are small businesses, to create jobs. The Obama WOTUS rule would have only worsened an already bad situation. This Administration is committed to improving it and making it work so we can create jobs and grow the economy, while also protecting the environment.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Trump also spoke about a Wyoming rancher who supposedly was affected by the rule: \u201cIf you want to build a new home, for example, you have to worry about getting hit with a huge fine if you fill in as much as a puddle, just a puddle on your lot. I\u2019ve seen it. In fact, when it was first shown to me, I said, you\u2019re kidding, aren\u2019t you? But they weren\u2019t kidding. In one case in Wyoming, a rancher was fined $37,000 a day by the EPA for digging a small watering hole for his cattle. His land.\u201d\n\nBut the case of the rancher, Andy Johnson, is more complex than Trump makes it seem. Our friends at FactCheck.org looked into the case in detail, and found that the Army Corps and the EPA found that the rancher actually constructed a dam on a waterway that was a tributary of the Green River, which is deemed by the EPA as a \u201cnavigable, interstate water of the United States.\u201d [Update: After our fact-check published, Johnson\u2019s attorney Jonathan Wood wrote a blog post saying Trump was \u201cexactly right\" on this point.]\n\n\u201cBuilding the dam constituted a \u201cdischarge of pollutants\u201d into \u201cwaters of the United States,\u201d according to the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers, and thus required a permit that Johnson did not have, or seek. . . . EPA officials say that Johnson received multiple warnings before any enforcement actions were taken. The EPA rules regarding discharging pollutants into waterways are based on a substantial body of evidence showing that water quality and flow in tributaries and wetlands can affect the water found downstream.\u201d\n\nTrump made several problematic statements in his remarks. He claimed that the Waters of the United States rule affected puddles and ditches; it affected some ditches, and technically has an exemption for puddles. But opponents of the rule say that since a \u201cpuddle\u201d is not defined in the rule, the EPA can still regulate what some people may consider puddles. Trump also exaggerated details of a case involving a Wyoming rancher.\n\nThe focus of our fact-check is whether the rule cost \u201chundreds of thousands of jobs,\u201d and there is no evidence to support that. After the rule was issued in 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit issued a nationwide stay blocking it from taking effect. We checked with key industry groups that opposed the rule, but did not find research into the impact of the rule on jobs after it was halted in 2015. The rule has been in limbo since, so it is not credible that any jobs have been lost.", "lang": "en"}
