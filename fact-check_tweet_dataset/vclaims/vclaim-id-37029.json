Dianne Feinstein has circulated online for years and is again being shared by thousands on Facebook.\n\nThousands of Facebook users have helped to once again disseminate a long-circulating comment about gun control falsely attributed to Sen. Dianne Feinstein.\n\n\u201cWhen the gunman realizes that nobody else is armed, he will lay down his weapons and turn himself in\u2026.that\u2019s just human nature,\u201d the quotation reads underneath a photo of the California Democrat. Text below that refers to her as \u201cstupid.\u201d\n\nThe falsehood has existed for years, despite repeated efforts by fellow fact-checking organizations to debunk it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been proven fake over and over,\u201d a Feinstein spokesman told us in an email.\n\nThe latest version to go viral was posted in March, by a Facebook group called \u201cLiberalism is a Mental Illness,\u201d and users breathed new life into it this week \u2014 bringing its total shares to more than 15,000.\n\nThe \u201cquotation\u201d was originally published by a now-defunct illegitimate news website, the Palookaville Post, in a February 2013 story headlined: \u201cFeinstein and Boxer Ask Californians to Lay Down Their Weapons During Statewide Manhunt.\u201d\n\nThe made-up story focuses on Feinstein and then-Sen. Barbara Boxer. It is premised on the actual news of a former Los Angeles police officer who shot and killed three people in 2013 and then fled, launching a manhunt. (The officer shot himself days later.)\n\nThe listed \u201creporter\u201d of the story \u2014 \u201cJimmy Olsentwins\u201d \u2014 makes clear the author\u2019s humorous intention. Jimmy Olsen is a fictional character who worked as photojournalist at the Daily Planet with Clark Kent, also known as Superman. And \u201cOlsentwins\u201d refers to actresses Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.\n\nThe piece did not attribute the remark about guns to Feinstein. Instead, it attributed the quotation to an \u201cintern.\u201d\n\n\u201cThroughout the day, Senators Feinstein and Boxer made desperate pleas for their California constituents to turn in their guns and not confront the crazed gunman because this would be a perfect test of their anti-gun proposals,\u201d the made-up story reads.\n\nIt then quotes a \u201cSenate communications intern\u201d as saying: \u201cThe Senators feel the best course of action is to remove all weapons from law enforcement and private citizens so no one else gets hurt. When the gunman realizes that nobody else is armed, he will lay down his weapons and turn himself in\u2026. that\u2019s just human nature.\u201d\n\nFeinstein has indeed advocated for gun control measures, including the Assault Weapons Ban of 2019. But the statement long attributed to her on social media is imagined.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
