Every April, Democrats hold events calling attention to a persistent wage gap between men and women, citing the latest number from the Census Bureau. (In 2012, 2013 and 2014, it was 77 cents; in 2015, it was 78 cents; and in 2016, it is now 79 cents.)\n\nAnnual wage figures do not take into account the fact that teachers \u2014 many of whom are women \u2014 have a primary job that fills nine months out of the year. The weekly wage is more of an apples-to-apples comparison, but it does not include as many income categories. (Still, we should note that the wage gap likely would increase if part-time workers were included in the statistics, as is done in Canada.)\n\nIn 2011, economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis surveyed economic literature and concluded that \u201cresearch suggests that the actual gender wage gap (when female workers are compared with male workers who have similar characteristics) is much lower than the raw wage gap.\u201d They noted that women may prefer to accept jobs with lower wages but greater benefits (more flexible parental leave) so excluding such fringe benefits from the calculations will exaggerate the wage disparity.\n\nFor instance, a 2013 article in the Daily Beast, citing a Georgetown University survey on the economic value of different college majors, showed that nine of the 10 most remunerative majors (such as petroleum and aerospace engineering) were dominated by men, while nine of the 10 least remunerative majors (such as social work and early childhood education) were dominated by women.\n\n\u201cWe conclude that many of the traditional explanations continue to have salience for understanding the gender wage gap and changes in the gap, although some factors have increased and others have decreased in importance,\u201d the authors said. One reason that gender wage gap has narrowed in recent years, they said, is because women now exceed men in educational attainment and have greatly reduced the experience gap. At the same time, some of the highest-paying white-collar jobs are less forgiving of workers who desire more flexible hours, such a women with family responsibilities.\n\nMoreover, there is certainly a case to be made that women should be encouraged to enter lucrative fields now dominated by men. That might help mitigating another aspect of a pay gap \u2014 the long-term impact of even slightly lower wages. A 2004 study for the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, by Stephen J. Rose and Heidi I. Hartmann, calculated that across 15 years, prime-age women earned just 38 percent of what prime-age men earned \u2013 an apparent wage gap of 62 percent.\n\nIndeed, in a town hall meeting in 2014, President Obama acknowledged some of this nuance: \u201cWhat folks will tell you sometimes is you can\u2019t really compare the situation, because a lot of women, by choice, end up working less when they have kids, decide to stay home, and so it\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d He went on to note that there are still examples of women getting paid less than men for \u201cdoing the exact same job.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
