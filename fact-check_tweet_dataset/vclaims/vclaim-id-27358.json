He donated $200,000, which was less than 10% of the total raised, according to press reports at the time.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump was a real estate developer in New York City in 1995, he donated money to an organization hosting a parade in the city on Veterans Day.\n\nThat fact has been exaggerated in a Facebook meme that claims: \u201c25 years ago, the City of New York refused to fund the Veterans Day Parade. Donald Trump financed it!\u201d\n\nTrump didn\u2019t pay for all of it, but he did make a contribution that organizers credited with jump-starting their fundraising.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump saved the parade,\u201d the parade director reportedly said at the time. News stories put Trump\u2019s donation at $200,000 and the total cost of the parade at more than $2 million. One story also said Trump, who was the grand marshal of the parade, was given the honor in exchange for his donation.\n\nTrump explained in his own words how he became the grand marshal during an appearance on \u201cThe Howard Stern Show\u201d two days before the parade.\n\nRobin Quivers, Nov. 9, 1995: How\u2019d you get to be the grand marshal? Trump: Well, it seems that they went to numerous corporate people in America and a lot of people didn\u2019t step up to the plate.\n\nThe organization that hosted the event, the United War Veterans Council, didn\u2019t return our calls and the nonprofit organization\u2019s tax forms from that year aren\u2019t available online. But press reports at the time estimated Trump\u2019s donation to be $200,000, and said that he helped raise more from other businesses.\n\nHis participation in the parade was a point of pride for Trump, who did not serve in the military himself. As a candidate for president in 2015, Trump was asked how he had \u201cbest demonstrated patriotism.\u201d He called his role in the parade \u201cone of my proudest accomplishments.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
