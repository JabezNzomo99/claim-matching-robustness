It is being claimed that the people thrashing him are Mamata Banerjee's supporters and are beating a BJP worker for speaking in favour of National Register of Citizens (NRC) in West Bengal's Basirhat.\n\nA Facebook page 'Modi Sarkar' has posted this 35-seconds video with a caption in Hindi that translates to \"Jihadis of Mamata brutally thrashed a BJP worker in Bengal's Bashirhat for speaking in favour of NRC. When will Jungle Raj end in Bengal?\"\n\nTill the time of filing of this story, the video has already been viewed by over 1.51 lakh times and shared more than 3,500 times. The archived version of the Facebook post can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The man being thrashed in the video has nothing to do with the NRC.\n\nIn fact, this was a result of fight between two rival groups of BJP's Barasat's unit. The person being thrashed was a former Mandal president of BJP and he was beaten by the rival faction of the party. Mandal President is an organizational post in BJP.\n\nTo verify the claim, we reverse-searched key frames from the video using InVID tool. It led us to a news report of Aaj Tak aired on December 5 this year. According to the report, two groups of the BJP workers had clashed during a meeting in North 24 Parganas of West Bengal.\n\nWe spoke to the Aaj Tak correspondent who had reported this news that that time. He confirmed that the person beaten up in the video is Rajkumar Pal, a former BJP Mandal President in Barasat.\n\nWe contacted Rajkumar Pal to know the reality of the viral video. Pal told us that there was dispute over election of a BJP Mandal President in Barasat. He too confirmed that the fight was regarding the the election of a party post and has nothing to do about NRC.\n\nRajkumar Pal also shared copy of the FIR he had lodged regarding this incident. The FIR also confirms that the incident was about fight over rivals groups of the party.\n\nBengali newspaper Sangbad Pratidin has also published a news on December 4 reporting this incident. This news reports also does not mention any NRC angle in it.\n\nIt was now evident that the fight in the viral video has nothing to do with the NRC issue.", "lang": "en"}
