SMC, whose supposed account number is 0011687925215, issued the supposed check through BDO's branch in Tandang Sora Avenue, Quezon City.\n\nThe facts: The claim is a rehash of a 2016 false claim initially circulated by pro-Duterte Facebook pages. Since then, BDO certified that the bank account number indicated in the check does not exist in their records and that San Miguel has no bank account in their Tandang Sora branch. Both SMC and Trillanes also denied the claim.\n\nReacting to the claim, San Miguel said in an April 2016 press release that they never issued such check to Senator Trillanes and that the claim is \"nothing more than a fabrication and a blatant disinformation.\" (READ: San Miguel Corp denies giving P500-M check to Trillanes)\n\nFor its part, BDO issued a certification dated April 28, 2016, saying that the account number 0011687925215, as indicated in the supposed check, does not exist. It also confirmed SMC's statement that the company has no bank account in the Tandang Sora branch.\n\nRappler reached out to the Facebook pages (President Rody Duterte News and ILoveDuterte) and a Facebook account to ask where they acquired the supposed P500-million check, but they have yet to respond as of this writing.\n\nThe claim initially circulated on Facebook ahead of the 2016 elections after Trillanes accused then- presidential candidate Duterte of not declaring a Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) bank account with a balance of around P211 million in his statement of assets, liabilities, and net worth (SALN).

Duterte eventually admitted that he has two BPI accounts but that they contain only P50,000 and P17,000 each.\n\nThe exchanges between Trillanes and Duterte on bank accounts has since continued. In September 2017, Duterte admitted to having invented the supposed bank account of Trillanes in the Development Bank of Singapore.
