The collection\u2019s caption claims that the photos in the gallery are examples of the devastation that the current Australia fires has had on the country\u2019s animals. We found that many of the 29 photos included in that post were incorrectly labeled.\n\nIn this case, the photo is real and was taken in Australia, but it is not from the current bushfires.\n\nThe photo was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe photo was taken in Australia \u2013\u2013 but in January 2013.\n\nThe image, which we found included in a Jan. 11, 2013, CNN article, shows a group of sheep lying in a New South Wales field after devastating bushfires swept through the area.\n\nThe caption below the image reads: \"Burned sheep lie in a paddock near Bookham in New South Wales on Wednesday. An estimated 10,000 sheep have died in the New South Wales bushfires.\"\n\nThe photo was not manipulated and does show animals killed from bushfires in Australia, but it was taken several years ago.
