Chick-fil-A is dedicated to providing the blacks with a safe space so that they can be properly honored.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThat\u2019s because both the image and Instagram post were taken from a story in the Babylon Bee, which describes itself as \"your trusted source for Christian news satire.\"\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time misinformation about Chick-fil-A\u2019s weekend hours has spread on social media. In 2015, Snopes debunked a claim that it was changing its decades-old policy and opening shop on Sundays.\n\nThe Instagram post does not make clear the photo and text are from a satirical website.
