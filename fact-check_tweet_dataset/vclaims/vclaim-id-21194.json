At the time of his detention, Grigoryan was immune from criminal prosecution as a member of Parliament.\n\nArmenian Prosecutor General Arthur Davtyan said Grigoryan was charged with illegal possession of firearms. He also requested an \u201cextraordinary meeting\u201d of the National Assembly asking the lawmakers to revoke Grigoryan\u2019s immunity and to approve his criminal prosecution.\n\nThe initial reaction of the general\u2019s political allies in the Armenian Republican Party to the detention of one of the country's leading figures was one of outrage and denial. The general has been decorated as a hero for his leading role in the creation of Armenian voluntary army, which fought against neighboring Azerbaijani forces for the disputed territory of Nagorno Karabach region.\n\nOne of the party\u2019s leaders, Eduard Sharmazanov, deputy chairman of the National Assembly and Republican Party press secretary spoke to Radio Free Europe after visiting Grigoryan in detention. He called the case against the general \u201cunacceptable, illegal, unconstitutional\u201d and \u201cfabricated.\u201d\n\nWe have settled on the verdict of \u201cmisleading,\u201d because of a later comment from Sharmazanov. As you will see, he has yet to revise his initial accusation that charges were \u201cfabricated.\u201d\n\nOn June 17, newly elected Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan went live on Facebook pointing to more accusations against Grigoryan.\n\n\u201cI would like to clearly state that the detention of Marvel Grigoryan is tied not only with the possession of the large amounts of illegal weapons and ammunition. It is also connected with suspicion that he was involved in appropriation and theft of the aid intended for the army,\u201d Pashinyan said.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s accusations were confirmed by the Armenian security service, which published a video of the search of a house owned by Grigoryan in the city of Echmiadzin.\n\nAlong with an arsenal of hundreds of firearms, rockets and thousands of packs of ammunition, the video showed stacks of paper boxes marked as \u201chumanitarian aid\u201d and packed with canned food, first aid supplies and clothes. Security service personnel showed handwritten letters to soldiers from children who had collected and donated the aid for the soldiers. The video also showed Grigoryan\u2019s collection of vintage cars and his private zoo, with exotic animals kept in small cages.\n\n\u201cHe was illegally appropriating the food the school students have been collecting for the soldiers and feeding it to his animals \u2013 the bears, the tigers and others,\u201d Prime Minister Pashinyan said.\n\nThe security service\u2019s video provoked a wave of public outrage in Armenia.\n\nOn the evening of June 17, the general\u2019s son, Karen Grigoryan, announced on Facebook his resignation as mayor of the city of Echmiadzin.\n\nRepublican Party members publicly condemned Grigoryan's actions, calling them \u201cunacceptable and disgusting.\u201d They also stated that they \u201crespect the presumption of innocence, but if the charges brought against him (are) proved according the law, he must be held accountable.\u201d\n\nOne indication of the strong feelings in Armenia: Somebody edited Grigoryan\u2019s Wikipedia page, adding the word \u201ctraitor\u201d to his career achievements, while \u201cHero of Corruption\u201d was added in next to the picture of the Armenian Order of Hero he had been awarded.\n\nOn June 19, Armenia\u2019s National Assembly revoked Manvel Grigoryan\u2019s parliamentary immunity and approved his criminal prosecution, with the approval of almost all the general\u2019s supporters in the Republican Party.\n\nSharmazanov has shifted his opinion, saying: \u201cIf all of this turns out to be true, I think this has no justification that is my opinion.\u201d Still, he has not publicly taken back his initial statement that the charges were \u201cfabricated,\u201d even as the general\u2019s defense rests on the notion.\n\nLater on June 19, Grigoryan\u2019s legal team said he rejects all accusations, including any knowledge of the goods and weapons stocked on the premises of the property he claims he barely visits twice a year.\n\nThe VOA Armenian Service contributed to this report.", "lang": "en"}
