At no point did he suggest a COVID-19 vaccine might kill nearly 1 million people.\n\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which, among other things, promotes access to vaccinations around the world, has committed $300 million to help fund the development of coronavirus detection, treatments and vaccines.\n\nSuch efforts appear to have made Gates a popular target for misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic, with this particular article claiming, \u201cWATCH: Bill Gates Admits His COVID-19 Vaccine Might KILL Nearly 1,000,000 People.\u201d\n\nThe article, which was filed under the \u201cconspiracy\u201d section of the Clover Chronicle website, links to an interview Gates did with CNBC in early April about the work he and his foundation are doing to fight the pandemic. During the interview, he discusses the difficulties of quickly developing a COVID-19 vaccine that will be effective for the elderly in the context of side effects.\n\n\u201cHere, we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they\u2019re most at risk of that. And doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people, and yet you don\u2019t have side effects,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIf we have one in 10,000 side effects, that\u2019s way more \u2014 700,000 people who will suffer from that.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cunderstanding the safety at gigantic scales across all age ranges \u2014 pregnant, male, female, undernourished, existing comorbidities \u2014 it\u2019s very, very hard,\u201d according to the CNBC video.
