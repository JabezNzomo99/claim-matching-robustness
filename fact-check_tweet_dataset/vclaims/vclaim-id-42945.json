For example, we know that men have a lower life expectancy than women, and that men are significantly more likely to play golf so the researchers tried to account for that.\n\nHowever there are two factors that weren\u2019t controlled for that could also make a big difference to these results, and that excluding them means these findings are limited.\n\nFirstly, the research does not control for economic status. Golf.com\u2019s 2016 survey of American golfers found that 70% had a household income of $100,000 or more. The median American household income in 2016 was $58,000 meaning golfers are much richer than Americans on average.\n\nThe World Health Organisation says: \u201cHigher income and social status are linked to better health.\u201d So by not controlling for income the research could simply be affirming something we already know\u2014that being rich is good if you want to live longer.\n\nSecondly, the research does not control for other exercise.\n\nIt could be the case that people who play golf monthly are also more likely to do some other form of exercise compared to people who don\u2019t play golf.\n\nAnd so without controlling for other forms of exercise, it\u2019s impossible to say whether golf is the reason for lower death rates.\n\nThe research press release published by the American Stroke Association (a division of the American Heart Association) did say \u201cwhile researchers were unable to determine if golfing had a direct impact on lowering the risk of heart attack or stroke, they are currently performing additional analyses to identify what other health conditions may benefit from regularly playing golf.\u201d\n\nHowever it is also misleading in saying that \u201cregularly golfing \u2013 at least once per month \u2013 was found to lower the risk of death among older adults\u201d when no causal link was examined or proven.\n\nWe asked the researchers why economic status and other exercise were not controlled for and will update this piece if they respond.", "lang": "en"}
