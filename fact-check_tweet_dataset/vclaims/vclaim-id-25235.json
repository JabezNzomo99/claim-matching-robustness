Rashida Tlaib has made headlines during her first week in office, from being the first Palestinian woman elected to the U.S. House to using profanity as part of a vow to impeach President Donald Trump.\n\nNow, an offensive tweet supposedly made by Tlaib is going around social media.\n\n\"Americans have spent decades raping and pillaging my people. What goes around comes around. #FridayFeeling\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe tweet, made shortly after 10 a.m. on Jan. 4, is not from Tlaib\u2019s account and no longer exists on Twitter.\n\nTlaib\u2019s real account is verified and has the blue checkmark badge by her name. The tweet referenced in the Facebook post came from an account that is not \u2013 and one that has since been deleted or removed from the social media platform.\n\nThe fake account also tried to make it appear as if Tlaib\u2019s name was spelled correctly, but it wasn\u2019t. It used an uppercase \"i\" in place of the lowercase \"L\" in her last name. When her name is spelled accurately on Twitter, the result is that the lowercase \"L\" reaches higher than the \"T\" in her last name. When misspelled with an uppercase \"i\", that faux-\"L\" only comes in at about the same height as the T.\n\nMoreover, Tlaib\u2019s Twitter following is around 277,000, a number more on par for a member of the U.S. House than the 30 followers the hoax account had amassed before it was removed.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
