This is false. The Canadian High Commission in Nigeria has dismissed the claim, though it said Nigerians are welcome to apply to immigrate to Canada through existing channels.\n\nThe article, published by a website named CBTV on April 14, claimed Trudeau had asked Buhari to send the Nigerians to Canada under \u201ca new Employment and Migration Programme designed for immigrants\u201d.\n\nThe post, which we've archived here, has been shared almost 2,500 times on Facebook, according to social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle. It was shared on multiple pages, including the Yellow Vests Canada group, which has more than 100,000 members.\n\nDele Momodu, a popular Nigerian journalist and former presidential candidate, posted the same link on Twitter and was retweeted more than 500 times.\n\nHowever, the Canadian High Commission in Nigeria has swiftly moved to debunk the story.\n\n\u201cThis particular story is FALSE,\u201d the High Commission tweeted. But it added that \u201cNigerians are welcome to apply to immigrate to Canada\u201d through the existing channels.\n\nThe \u201cone million\u201d figure appears to have been drawn from the announcement in January that Canada wanted to add one million new permanent residents over the next three years.\n\nThe Canadian Federal Skilled Worker programme, which allows people with sought-after skills or work experience to immigrate to Canada, is very popular in Nigeria, especially among the middle classes.\n\nIn Canada\u2019s 2016 census, 42,430 people identified themselves as Nigerian immigrants, of whom almost half (20,630) lived in Ontario.", "lang": "en"}
