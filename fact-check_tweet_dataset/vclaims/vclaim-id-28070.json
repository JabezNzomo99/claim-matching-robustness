His writings have influenced a number of leaders around the world, including the late Cuban dictator Fidel Castro and Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin.\n\nYet, while he authored many oft-quoted expressions, there is no evidence of Marx ever saying or writing the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. The saying does not appear anywhere in his written works.\n\n\u201cThe quote is not from Marx,\u201d Iowa State University philosophy professor Tony Smith told the Daily Caller in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s from a story told about Lenin, but who knows if he said it.\u201d (RELATED: Did Vladimir Lenin Say \u2018Socialized Medicine Is The Keystone To The Arch Of A Socialist State\u2019?)\n\nThe website Quote Investigator examined the origin of the expression and found multiple variations, none of which credibly belong to Marx.\n\nA writer named S. Dmitrijewski apparently wrote in a 1931 profile of Soviet diplomat Maxim Litvinov, \u201cThe necessary money being given by millionaires, who thereby helped weave the rope from which many of them should hang later on.\u201d\n\nAnother variation appeared in a 1955 edition of a California periodical called The Commonwealth, according to Quote Investigator. In that publication, Major George Racey Jordan was quoted as saying, \u201cLenin wrote, \u2018When it comes time to hang the capitalists, they will vie with each other for the rope contract.'\u201d\n\nIn 1975, Russian novelist and historian Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn delivered a speech that contained an anecdote of Lenin saying variation of the expression, though Solzhenitsyn didn\u2019t provide a credible source for it, according to Quote Investigator.\n\nThe saying, Quote Investigator noted, is frequently attributed to Lenin and former Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin, though there\u2019s \u201cno substantive evidence\u201d it originated with them either.", "lang": "en"}
