It also isn\u2019t \u201cworse\u201d than the novel coronavirus.\n\nRumors about people dying from the insect\u2019s sting spread after news of the hornet\u2019s discovery in parts of the United States and Canada in 2019 resurfaced in May. It was the first time the Asian giant hornet was seen in North America; this species is commonly found in South and East Asia.\n\nVERA Files Fact Check flagged at least three posts made from May 26 to 28 that contained a misleading mix of images \u2013 screenshots of a video on Asian giant hornets lumped with photos of punctured body parts. These were captioned with the false claim that the hornets have been killing people in different countries and misleadingly compared its effect to the almost 400,000 deaths globally due to COVID-19.\n\nContrary to the FB posts, news reports in May never mentioned any recent human deaths resulting from the Asian giant hornet\u2019s sting. The hornets are sometimes called \u201cmurder hornets\u201d because they can swiftly wipe out honeybee hives by decapitating bees.\n\nIn a May 14 article, National Geographic reported that a person \u201clikely would have to be stung by a couple hundred giant hornets\u201d for its venom to be fatal. It added that these insects wouldn\u2019t attack humans unless bothered: \"Most deaths from giant hornets\u2019 stings occur because people seriously disturb the insects' nests.\u201d\n\nSmithsonian Magazine, the publication of museums under the U.S. government, quoted the entomology collections manager at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History who said there is nothing to worry about:\n\n\u201cMore people die of honey bee stings in the U.S. than die annually, globally, from these hornets. About 60 to 80 people die from [allergic] reactions to honey bee stings [in the U.S.]; only about 40 people die per year, in Asia, mostly in Japan, from reactions to the [giant hornet] stings.\u201d\n\nThe photos used in the FB posts were from two different incidents\u2013 one in 2013 and the other, in 2020:\n\u2022 The punctured arm and head were photos from a 2013 wave of attacks by the Asian giant hornet in the province of Shaanxi in China. News reports say it resulted in at least 41 deaths and hundreds of injuries. The incidents could\u2019ve been brought about by \u201chotter weather in the area\u201d and workers \u201cmoving deeper into the isolated rural areas where the hornets typically live,\u201d said the reports.\n\u2022 The screenshot of the Asian giant hornet is from a video clip on U.S. media CBS Philadelphia\u2019s report on the insects in May.\n\nThe three FB posts have been shared over a thousand times.", "lang": "en"}
