The claim is false; the photos circulated online at least one month before the Philippine government imposed a lockdown on its main island due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe photos were published here on Facebook on April 7, 2020. It has been shared almost 200 times.\n\nThe post contains three photos of protesters carrying Tagalog-language placards calling for government accountability during the COVID-19 crisis. Two other images in the post show social media comments criticising the protesters.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe caption of the post, written in a mix of Tagalog, English and Visayan, translates to English as: \u201cLOOK: The cancer of Society and Corona Virus of the Nation staged a rally again. Instead of following the Enhance Community Quarantine. / Ctto: / shoot them dead..anti duterte\u2019s..the virus will spread further because of you\u201d.\n\nThe Philippine government placed its main island of Luzon on an \u201cenhanced community quarantine\u201d from midnight on March 17, 2020 in an effort to curb the growing COVID-19 numbers in the country. The presidential order announced \"mass gatherings shall be prohibited\" and \"a strict home quarantine shall be observed in all households\".\n\nThe photos were also shared here, here and here on Facebook, alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false. A keyword search found the original photos published here on the Facebook account for Anakbayan, which describes itself as a \u201cnational democratic mass organization of the Filipino youth\u201d. The photos were published on February 4, 2020 -- weeks before the Philippine government imposed a lockdown.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Anakbayan\u2019s Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Tagalog-language caption translates to English as: \u201cSeveral groups are currently staging a protest in front of the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) to condemn the lack of clear plan to protect the people and the government's lax efforts to curb the spread of the Novel Coronavirus (nCov).\u201d\n\nThe Philippine General Hospital is a public hospital in the Philippine capital of Manila.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photos in the misleading post (L) and the photos in Anakbayan\u2019s Facebook post (R):\n\nThe protest was also reported on by the Philippine news publication Abante Tonite, which shared similar photos here, here and here on its Facebook page on February 4, 2020.\n\nThe misleading claim was also debunked by Philippine news outlet Rappler here.", "lang": "en"}
