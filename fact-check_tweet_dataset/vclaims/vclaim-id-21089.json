And even the president of Mexico called me -- they said their southern border, very few people are coming because they know they're not going to get through our border, which is the ultimate compliment.\"\n\nBut Pe\u00f1a Nieto denies that ever happened.\n\nA statement released by the Mexican Foreign Ministry said Pe\u00f1a Nieto \"has not recently spoken to President Donald Trump over the telephone.\"\n\nThe statement went on to reference the only other time the two met and conversed on the sidelines of the G-20 Summit.\n\n\"During the meeting the two heads of State held last July 7th in Hamburg, Germany, the topic of migration was a topic of conversation approached by both. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto shared that repatriations of Mexican nationals from the United States had fallen 31 percent between January and June 2017 in comparison to the same timeframe in 2016,\" the statement read.\n\nAs has been the case on several occasions over the past few months, the Mexican Foreign Ministry, provided more detailed information to the U.S. press than the White House.", "lang": "en"}
