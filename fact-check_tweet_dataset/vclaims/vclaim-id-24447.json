Bombardier cited the lack of public contracts as the reason for a railcar factory layoffs in Ontario, while the California site will host operations that previously took place in New York State.\n\n\u201cBombardier to lay off 550 workers at Canadian rail car assembly plant due to Trudeau\u2019s Carbon Tax. Bombardier to open rail car assembly plant in the USA due to Trump\u2019s reduced corporate tax rate,\u201d states a meme shared more than 4,000 times in a week.\n\nThe post presents true facts about where Bombardier plans to reduce and add rail car assembly jobs, but there is no evidence that the US corporate tax rate or Canada\u2019s carbon tax are the reasons for the moves.\n\nCiting this article from Canadian media Global News, the first half of the meme correctly asserts that 550 workers at Bombardier\u2019s Thunder Bay, Ontario rail car assembly plant will be laid off.\n\nOn July 10, Bombardier confirmed what Global News published the day before, explaining that half the workers in the Ontario plant would lose their jobs.\n\nThe meme claims Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government\u2019s carbon tax are the cause of the layoffs. The carbon tax is a federal levy of $20 per tonne of CO2 emitted, imposed on four provinces that had not already implemented any scheme to tax pollution in April 2019 as this AFP article from the time explains. The central province of Ontario, where Thunder Bay is located, was one of the four.\n\nHowever, the Global News article cited by the meme makes no mention of the carbon tax. Neither does the company\u2019s press release. Instead, the press release says the \u201cdecision is due to the cyclical nature of our business and the ramp down of our two high cadence programs,\u201d citing Metrolinx BiLevel and TTC LRV, two large contracts with Toronto area governments about to end with no orders to follow.\n\nEric Prudhomme, head of public relations for Bombardier in the Americas, added in an email to AFP that Bombardier\u2019s problems are compounded by the Buy American Act, the US government purchase policy, which currently requires 65 percent of the costs of components and subcomponents for rolling stock, which includes rail cars, to be produced in the United States. This figure will increase to 70 percent in the fiscal year 2020.\n\nAccording to the second half of the meme, Bombardier will open a rail car assembly plant in California, because of favorable corporate tax rates implemented by the Trump administration. The post cites this article from Railway Technology, an industry media. However, the article makes no mention of corporate tax rates.\n\nAs the company announcement states, Bombardier Transportation will be \u201copening a rail car assembly site in Pittsburg, California,\u201d in order to provide rail equipment for the \u201cFleet of the Future,\u201d a 775-car contract with the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART).\n\nHowever, the press release specifies that operations for the BART contract are already taking place in the United States, at the company\u2019s plant in upstate New York and that they already had 500 employees in the Golden State. Moving a plant from one state to another within the United States will not change Bombardier\u2019s federal income tax.\n\nThe company said the move from New York to California \u201cwill serve several purposes, including retaining and creating local jobs in Pittsburg and freeing up space at the New York site for new and upcoming East Coast orders.\u201d\n\nBombardier benefitted from a California Competes Tax Credit, \u201can income tax credit available to businesses that want to come to California,\u201d but this is a state tax policy, not a federal one.\n\nMaryanne Roberts, public relations officer for Bombardier in the US, provided no comments on the Facebook publication and instead referred AFP Fact Check to the press release for the reasons for the move.", "lang": "en"}
