Chris Murphy urged politicians to stand up to the National Rifle Association because while \u201c[t]he gun lobby is certainly politically powerful \u2026 it loses as many races as it wins.\u201d But the NRA has won the vast majority of recent congressional races in which it heavily invested.\n\nIn the wake of the mass shooting in Las Vegas, Murphy \u2014 a Democrat who represented Newtown, Connecticut, as a congressman at the time of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school \u2014 implored Congress \u201cto get off its ass and do something\u201d about gun control.\n\nIn an op-ed for the Washington Post, Murphy advocated for \u201cuniversal background checks, permit requirements for gun ownership and bans on the most dangerous kinds of weapons and ammunition,\u201d all things that he says a majority of Americans support. Those kinds of changes haven\u2019t come, he said, because \u201cthe gun lobby has rigged the official and unofficial rules of the game to prevent common-sense change.\u201d\n\nMurphy, Oct. 2: In the coming days, Republicans who call for sensible changes in our laws will be told that their position is politically unsustainable \u2014 the gun lobby will defeat them if they advocate for gun-safety laws. But even this is a fiction: In 2016, four states had gun-law referendums on their ballot, three passed. The winners of three top U.S. Senate races \u2014 New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Nevada \u2014 all won with the support of advocates in the anti-gun-violence movement. (Two Democrats and one Republican, by the way). The gun lobby is certainly politically powerful, but it loses as many races as it wins.\n\nBut election records show the NRA won far more often than it lost when it heavily invested in federal campaigns.\n\nMurphy mentioned three Senate races in 2016, but the NRA only invested substantially in one of them. The NRA spent $106,000 advocating for Republican Joe Heck, and $2.4 million opposing Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto in the Nevada Senate race. And Masto won. But the NRA simply stayed out of the Pennsylvania Senate race and spent relatively little in New Hampshire.\n\nAccording to data from OpenSecrets.org, the NRA invested nearly $22 million in independent expenditures (not directly to the campaigns) in Senate races in 2016. More than 96 percent of it was spent on seven races. The candidate backed by the NRA won six out of those seven races (the lone exception being Nevada).\n\u2022 The NRA\u2019s biggest Senate investment was in North Carolina. It spent $5.6 million opposing Democrat Deborah Ross, and $711,000 in favor of her opponent, Republican Sen. Richard Burr. Burr won.\n\u2022 The NRA spent $2.5 million in Missouri opposing the candidacy of Democrat Jason Kander, and $601,000 in favor of Republican Sen. Roy Blunt. Blunt won.\n\u2022 In Indiana, the NRA spent $2.4 million against Democrat Evan Bayh, and $441,000 in favor of Republican Todd Young. Young won.\n\u2022 In Florida, the NRA spent $2.3 million opposing Democrat Patrick Murphy, and $1 million in support of Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. Rubio won.\n\u2022 In Ohio, the NRA spent $1.6 million opposing Democrat Ted Strickland, and $731,000 in favor of Republican Sen. Rob Portman. Portman won.\n\u2022 In Wisconsin, the NRA spent $255,000 opposing Democrat Russ Feingold, and $396,000 in support of Republican Sen. Ron Johnson. Johnson won.\n\nThe NRA spent no money in indirect expenditures in the Pennsylvania Senate race won by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. Toomey drew the ire of the NRA after Sandy Hook when he co-sponsored, along with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, an amendment that would have expanded background checks to private sales by unlicensed individuals at gun shows and over the internet. Toomey\u2019s grade from the NRA dropped from an \u201cA\u201d to a \u201cC,\u201d and the NRA stayed out of the race altogether. (Toomey\u2019s opponent, Katie McGinty, got an \u201cF\u201d grade from the NRA.)\n\nIt\u2019s true, as Murphy noted, that Toomey got the endorsement of a gun-control group, Everytown for Gun Safety, which ran ads supporting Toomey. But with the NRA not spending any money in the race, it\u2019s a stretch to call that race a loss for the NRA (especially given McGinty\u2019s \u201cF\u201d rating).\n\nAs for New Hampshire, the NRA spent relatively little, backing Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte with $91,00, and spending $48,000 opposing her Democratic challenger, Maggie Hassan, who won. The $139,000 spent by the NRA in the New Hampshire Senate race was a fraction of the more than $88 million in outside spending on that race.\n\nAn analysis of the NRA\u2019s success in 2016 was documented by Mike Spies, for The Trace, and Ashley Balcerzak, of OpenSecrets.org, under the headline: \u201cThe NRA Placed Big Bets on the 2016 Election, and Won Almost All of Them.\u201d\n\nIn addition to its Senate successes, the NRA also spent $31.2 million \u2014 more than any other outside group \u2014 on the presidential race on behalf of Donald Trump.\n\nThe NRA spent much less lavishly on House races, spreading nearly $1.3 million among 48 races.", "lang": "en"}
