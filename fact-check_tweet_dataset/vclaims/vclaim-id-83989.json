According to Yeddyurappa, the information regarding the alleged pay-off by Siddaramaiah is available in a diary recovered during the raid on the house of Member of Legislative Council (MLC) K. Govindraju many months ago.\n\nHowever, a leaked video conversation between BS Yeddyurappa and Union Minister Ananth Kumar from the BJP Executive Meet in Bengaluru on February 12 has instead embarrassed the two senior leaders of Karnataka BJP. In this leaked video released by local media channels, in the context of BSY\u2019s allegations regarding Siddaramaiah having given Rs 1000 crores to Congress \u2018High Command\u2019, Ananth Kumar is heard telling BSY, \u201cYou have also paid money when in power, I have also paid money when I was in power (to High Command)\u201d. They further go on to state, \u201cWe will accuse him, he will have to clarify. People might not believe he got kickbacks of Rs 1000 Crore but we will accuse him. Till elections they will have to keep clarifying\u201d. For viewer convenience, we are putting here a shorter version of the video with English speech bubbles as well as the longer version of the video.\n\nThis is a double whammy for BJP with Ananth Kumar and BS Yeddyurappa admitting to having paid the BJP High Command when they were in power, an allegation that they were using against Siddaramaiah and it also exposes their election strategy. Not surprisingly, when Yeddyurappa was questioned regarding the same by journalists today, he refused to respond. In the following video, one can see how Yeddyurappa is avoiding the journalist.", "lang": "en"}
