The claim is false; the photos do show Indonesian women but they were taken between 1900 and 1956; photography was not invented until the 19th century.\n\nThe images have been posted repeatedly on Facebook, for example here, and on Twitter here on July 7, 2019, where it was retweeted more than 3,000 times before it was removed.\n\nThe Indonesia-language tweet says: \u201cPhotos of Indonesian women wearing hijab, circa 1700, neatly stored at the Leiden Library, the Netherlands, taken long before Kartini was born.\u201d\n\n\u201cKartini\u201d is a reference to Indonesian national hero Raden Ajeng Kartini, born in 1879. Kartini, who did not wear a hijab, was an \u201cimportant symbol for the Indonesian independence movement and for Indonesian feminists\u201d, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading tweet:\n\nThe four images do show women in Indonesia -- but they were not taken \u201ccirca 1700\u201d.\n\nThe first photographic process \u2014 heliography \u2014 was invented around 1824 by Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce.\n\nManual and online searches of Dutch and Indonesian photographic archives established that the images in the misleading posts were taken between 1900 and 1956.\n\nThe first photo shows a wedding ceremony in the Indonesian region of Lampung, circa 1900. It is archived here by Leiden University in the Netherlands.\n\nThe Dutch-language title says: \u201cA wedding ceremony according to Lampung Pepadon custom in Lampong District\u201d.\n\nLampung Pepadon is a reference to a traditional community in Indonesia\u2019s Lampung province.\n\nTwo of the other images used in the misleading post are in the online archive of the Nationaal Museum van Wereldculturen, an ethnographic museum in the Netherlands.\n\nOne of the images, which shows a number of women posing for the camera, is titled: \u201cGroup portrait of standing and sitting Malay women from Payakumbuh\u201d. It was taken in 1900, according to this information on the museum website.\n\nThe third photo has a Dutch-language title, \u201cPortrait of Panglima Polem \u2019s wife and sister.\u201d\n\nIts caption says: \u201cIn May and June 1903, the Korps Marechaussee captured the mother of Aceh resistance leader Panglima Polim, as well as two of his wives, his sister and some other family members.\u201d\n\n\u201cKorps Marechaussee\u201d was a special force created by the Dutch in April 1890 to combat the Acehnese guerilla fighters. Panglima Polim, or Polem, was a noble title in the era of the Aceh Sultanate.\n\nThe last of the four photos used in the misleading post shows people in a market on Sumbawa Island in Indonesia in 1956.\n\nIt is stored here in the digital collection of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, in the United States.\u200b", "lang": "en"}
