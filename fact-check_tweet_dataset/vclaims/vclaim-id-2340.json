But the idea that the bad guys are just going to lay down their weapons has long been a powerful source of ridicule.\n\nIn a post dated May 24, 2017, but which seemed to gain steam on social media in early September, the website Babylon Bee said that the terrorist group variously known as ISIS or the Islamic State had given up its fight just because American singer Katy Perry had called for co-existence in an interview.\n\nIn an article headlined, \"ISIS Lays Down Arms After Katy Perry\u2019s Impassioned Plea To \u2018Like, Just Co-Exist,\u2019\" the website wrote, \"Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, released a statement Wednesday confirming that ISIS would be immediately surrendering its fight to establish a powerful caliphate after viewing an interview in which pop singer Katy Perry said, \u2018The greatest thing we can do is just unite and love on each other and like, no barriers, no borders, like, we all need to just co-exist.\u2019 \"\n\nThe article raised red flags at Facebook, and we\u2019re fact-checking it here as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to fight fake news.\n\nIt\u2019s not so obvious on the page showing the ISIS-Katy Perry article, but the Babylon Bee is a satire site. At the bottom of its home page, there\u2019s a line that reads: \"The Babylon Bee is Your Trusted Source For Christian News Satire.\"\n\nA glance through other headlines on the site does confirm that the site runs fairly obvious satirical articles that often have religious themes. For instance, the site ran one article about Texas-based megachurch pastor Joel Osteen headlined, \"Lakewood Church Issues Eclipse Glasses For Gazing At Joel Osteen\u2019s Teeth.\" Another article was headlined, \"Heaven Department Of Tourism Advises 2018 Round-Trip Tickets Selling Out Fast\"\n\nSo the Babylon Bee is more openly satirical than some other examples we\u2019ve been forwarded by Facebook, but we\u2019ll still confirm for the record that ISIS did not, after all, stop fighting for an Islamic caliphate just because Katy Perry suggested it.\n\nThe genesis of the joke, as Snopes.com has noted, comes from comments Perry made on the Elvis Duran Morning Show on May 23, 2017, one day after a suicide bombing inspired by ISIS killed 22 people at the Manchester Arena in England during a concert by pop star Ariana Grande.\n\nIn the interview, Perry said: \"I think the greatest thing that we can do now is just unite as people, as fan bases, all of it, you know? Whatever we say behind people\u2019s backs \u2013 because the Internet can be a little bit ruthless as far as fan bases go \u2013 but I think that the greatest thing we can do is just unite and love on each other. And no barriers, no borders \u2013 we all need to just co-exist.\"\n\nSome conservative commentators on social media mocked Perry\u2019s remarks as geopolitically naive, though they often did so without noting that Perry had been seeking to promote unity and respect between the fans of different singers, not trying to ideologically reconcile extreme Islamism with advanced democracy.\n\nFor instance, a Fox & Friends tweet touted commentator Michelle Malkin\u2019s remark that Perry's call for \"no barriers, no borders\" typifies the \"liberal mindset of celebs who don't operate in reality.\"\n\nPerry responded to Malkin through a pair of tweets. \"@michellemalkin The media has edited my words out of context, I was talking about online fan culture and how we must unite now. ... Maybe didn't say it perfectly but, I don't always get it right. Would love to speak with you in the future.\"\n\nEither way, the story in the Babylon Bee reflects pretty obvious satire, not reality. For anyone who failed to catch the snark the first time around or saw the headline out of context, we rate it Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
