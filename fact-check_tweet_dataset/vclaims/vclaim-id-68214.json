PolitiFact Ohio isn\u2019t either, because it sounded new to us.\n\n \n\n Has Ohio really has lost more of its population than 47 other states? Over what time period?\n\n \n\n So we decided to take a look.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau official state counts for the Census 2010, released on Dec. 21, only one state lost population from April 2000 to April 2010 and it wasn\u2019t Ohio \u2014 it was our neighbors to the north, Michigan.\n\nBut maybe Kasich flubbed his words and meant Ohio\u2019s population grew more slowly than every other state but two. That would be closer to the truth. Ohio\u2019s population grew 1.6 percent over the decade to just over 11.5 million people, according to the census figures.\n\nOnly Louisiana at 1.4 percent and Rhode Island at 0.4 percent grew at a more sluggish pace. Michigan\u2019s population dropped 0.6 percent. That would leave Ohio ranked 47th over the past decade in population growth.\n\n\n\n Or, maybe the governor-elect was talking about some previous census figures. The census bureau had routinely put out annual estimates and other projections prior to issuing its official data drop in mid-December.\n\nBut even by earlier estimates and projections, Ohio did not lose population but gained more people, albeit at a much slower pace than most of the rest of the country.\n\nKasich is correct to be concerned.\n\nWhile Ohio\u2019s overall population is still seventh-highest in the country, the state\u2019s slower pace of\n\n growth could also directly affect the pace at which Ohio\u2019s struggling economy recovers.\n\nAnother concern is that while Ohio hasn\u2019t lost population, other states are gaining new residents faster. The most immediate consequence of that for the state is a loss of clout in Washington, where Ohio will lose two of its 18 congressional seats and have fewer electoral college votes for presidential elections due to the population trends.\n\nWe offered the governor-elect the benefit the doubt, but from any angle you look at it, Ohio did not lose population from this year over last, or in 2009 from 2008, or this year compared to 2000.\n\nOn this one, Kasich doesn\u2019t need sensational talk to highlight a problematic issue.", "lang": "en"}
