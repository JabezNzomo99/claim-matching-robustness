We could also locate London's Trafalgar Square in the video.\n\nBOOM then did a search with relevant keywords, which led us to a Getty Image photo of an anti-Trump protest at Trafalgar Square that was staged during Trump's state visit to the UK on June 4, 2019.\n\nThe photograph, taken by Mike Kemp, has been described as, \"Donald Trump lookalike makes a mock grab with a bikini wearing protester who is holding a placard which reads 'Don't grab my pussy' in Trafalgar Square during protests against the state visit of US President Donald Trump on 4th June 2019 in London, United Kingdom. Organisers Together Against Trump which is a collaboration between the Stop Trump Coalition and Stand Up To Trump, have organised a carnival of resistance, a national demonstration to protest against President Trumps policies and politics during his official UK visit.\"\n\nBOOM found that the man in the video is Dennis Allan, who's a well-known Trump impersonator. Allan had earlier spoken to BBC describing his work as a Trump impersonator.\n\nThe anti-Trump protest seen in the viral video refers to a derogatory statement by Donald Trump, that was revealed through a leaked video, where he explains how he grabs women by their private parts.\n\nAllan, in the viral video stages a series of mock groping with another protester wearing a bikini.\n\nChinese News Agency Xinhua also posted a video from the event, showing Allan in the Trump avatar taking photos with people.", "lang": "en"}
