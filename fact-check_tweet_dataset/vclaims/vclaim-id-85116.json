Trillions of dollars in risky mortgages had become embedded throughout the financial system, as mortgage-related securities were packaged, repackaged, and sold to investors around the world. When the bubble burst, hundreds of billions of dollars in losses in mortgages and mortgage-related securities shook markets as well as financial institutions that had significant exposures to those mortgages and had borrowed heavily against them. This happened not just in the United States but around the world. The losses were magnified by derivatives such as synthetic securities.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton campaign offered two academic papers in support of Clinton\u2019s argument, but they were off point. One article claims increased inequality contributed to the slow recovery, but that\u2019s not the same as causing the crisis. The other article described a theoretical model of a closed economy in which increased income inequality would lead to a credit bubble. But that does not apply to the 2008 financial crisis, which was exacerbated by global capital flows.\n\n[Update: Angelides provided a statement saying the Commission\u2019s \u201cinvestigation was focused on matters related to financial markets and regulation, the collapse of major financial institutions, and potential violations of law related to the financial crisis. Accordingly, our findings were focused on those matters, not on matters of broad tax policy. \u2026I concur with Secretary Clinton that the Bush Administration policies of slashing tax cuts for the wealthy, failing to stabilize and strengthen the middle class, and turning a blind eye to recklessness on Wall Street severely weakened our economy, making it particularly vulnerable to financial shock and resulting in the deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression. I believe her statement was accurate and on point.\"]\n\nAlan B. Kreuger, a Princeton economist who called The Fact Checker on behalf of the Clinton campaign, acknowledged that \u201cmy ears perked up also\u201d when he heard the reference to the Bush tax cuts. But he said he interpreted her statement as a reference to how income inequality led to the stagnation of the middle class and spurred excess borrowing and leverage \u2014 key components of the crash along with lax regulation. The Bush tax cuts, he said, contributed to income inequality, although, he added: \u201cI don\u2019t want to say the Bush tax cuts were the only factor.\u201d\n\nSimon Johnson, a professor of global economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, also contacted The Fact Checker on behalf of the campaign. He said he read Clinton\u2019s comments to mean that the Bush tax cuts weakened the ability of the U.S. government to respond to the financial shocks. \u201cThe financial crisis led to a deeper recession because the federal government could not respond effectively/as much as was needed \u2013 there was less fiscal space because of the Bush tax cuts,\u201d he wrote in an email, because of higher deficits. \u201cThis meant a deeper recession, i.e., more loss of output and a slower recovery.\u201d\n\nNarrative 1: It was the fault of the government, which encouraged a massive housing bubble and mishandled the ensuing crisis. (Basically a conservative position.) Narrative 2: It was Wall Street\u2019s fault, stemming from greed, arrogance, stupidity, and misaligned incentives, especially in compensation structures. (Basically a liberal position.) Narrative 3: \u201cEveryone\u201d was at fault: Wall Street, the government, and our wider society. People in all types of institutions and as individuals became blas\u00e9 about risk\u2010taking and leverage, creating a bubble across a wide range of investments and countries. (The position taken by many former policymakers, including Hennessey.)\n\n\u201cTo my knowledge, this is the first time someone with her prominence has advanced the argument that fiscal policy caused the crisis. Think of it as a new narrative 4,\u201d Hennessey said. \u201cThat many of those who typically agree with narrative 2 might also oppose the Bush tax cuts does not mean that narrative 2 and narrative 4 are the same, or that narrative 4 has the intellectual heft of narrative 2. They are not, they are quite different arguments. And the support her people have given so far for this new argument is, in my view, incredible. The new intellectual ground she broke Monday night is intellectual quicksand.\u201d\n\nClinton is a disciplined debater, but it\u2019s pretty clear she flubbed this. No credible analyst would cite the Bush tax cuts as playing a key role in spurring the crash. If she had meant to pin the blame on rising income inequality, she should have said so clearly, without putting a political spin on the policies of a Republican president. (If, as Johnson said, she meant that the tax cuts made it more difficult to respond to the crisis, she certainly could have been clearer.)", "lang": "en"}
