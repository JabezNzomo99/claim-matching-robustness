The answer, unequivocally, is no. Asked of this assertion, Michael McConnell, director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School, told us by email \u201cno basis for it whatsoever\u201d exists.\n\nAs we discussed in an earlier explainer about the president\u2019s potential ability to self-pardon, very few limits exist on presidential pardon power. Based on social media comments, it appears that at least some of this misconception may stem from a misreading of the U.S. Constitution. Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution reads, in part, \u201cThe President [\u2026] shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment\u201d:\n\n\u201cExcept in cases of impeachment,\u201d is not, as some have taken it, a Constitutional requirement that no pardons be issued during a presidential impeachment. Instead, it is widely understood to prohibit pardons that \u201crestore the standing of a Federal officer who has been impeached and removed from his position.\u201d As such, the claim is \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
