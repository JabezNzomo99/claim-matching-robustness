The documents did not name the campaign officials, identifying them only as \u201cthe High-Ranking Campaign Official,\u201d \u201cthe Senior Policy Advisor,\u201d and \u201cthe Campaign Supervisor.\u201d\n\nHe also met with Trump at least once in a foreign policy meeting, as evidenced by a picture of Trump meeting with his \u201cnational security team\u201d on March 31, 2016, that was posted to Trump\u2019s own Instagram account. Papadopoulos is pictured (third from the left) sitting at the table for that meeting.\n\nWhen he met with the Washington Post editorial board on March 21, 2016, Trump named Papadopoulos as one of only a few members of the campaign\u2019s foreign policy team. \u201cGeorge Papadopoulos. He\u2019s an oil and energy consultant. Excellent guy,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Papadopoulos was a volunteer for the campaign. But that doesn\u2019t always indicate a diminished role. As CNN notes: \u201cAccording to previous reporting, [campaign manager Paul] Manafort, [deputy campaign manager Rick] Gates, Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and senior strategist Steve Bannon were all unpaid \u2018volunteers\u2019 while doing extensive, high-level work for the campaign.\u201d\n\nPapadopoulos wasn\u2019t that kind of volunteer, either. But he had contacts with Trump\u2019s senior campaign aides, court documents show.\n\nPapadopoulos and the 2016 Campaign\n\nHe started the 2016 campaign as a foreign policy adviser to Ben Carson, one of Trump\u2019s vanquished rivals for the Republican presidential nomination. The Carson campaign named Papadopoulos to its foreign policy team in December 2015, describing him as an energy consultant who had worked as an analyst and researcher at the conservative Hudson Institute in Washington, D.C.\n\nAccording to his LinkedIn page, Papadopoulos earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science and government from DePaul University in 2009, and a master\u2019s degree from University College London in 2010.\n\nShortly after Carson dropped out of the race in early March, Papadopoulos became a Trump campaign adviser. He first came into contact with a Russian intermediary on March 14, 2016, while traveling in Italy, according to the Justice Department. In a chance meeting, Papadopoulos met a professor who he \u201cunderstood to have substantial connections to Russian government officials,\u201d the department said.\n\nThe professor, whose name has been withheld by the Justice Department, took an interest in Papadopoulos because of his role in the Trump campaign. He would soon introduce Papadopoulos to two others: a \u201cFemale Russian National,\u201d who Papadopoulos believed had \u201cconnections to Russian government officials,\u201d and \u201can individual in Moscow \u2026 who told defendant Papadopoulos he had connections to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\u201d the Justice Department said.\n\nJoseph Mifsud, an academic at the University of Stirling in Scotland, has since confirmed to the Telegraph that he is the \u201cprofessor\u201d named in the court documents, though he contests Papadopoulos\u2019 account.\n\nWhat contacts did Papadopoulos have with Russians and the Trump campaign?\n\nIn announcing the guilty plea, the Department of Justice released a \u201cStatement of the Offense\u201d that lays out some \u2014 not all \u2014 of Papadopoulos\u2019 work on behalf of the campaign and the contacts he had with \u201cthe Russians\u201d and Trump campaign officials.\n\nThe statement does not \u201cconstitute all of the facts known to the parties concerning the charged offense,\u201d but rather provides \u201cselected events\u201d to demonstrate that \u201csufficient facts exist\u201d for the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, the Justice Department said. Both sides \u201cstipulate and agree\u201d that the facts contained in the statement \u201care true and accurate.\u201d\n\nIn the statement, Papadopoulos was identified as having contacts with senior members of the Trump campaign on at least a dozen occasions from March through August of 2016 \u2014 including the March 31, 2016, national security meeting. At that meeting, Papadopoulos \u201cintroduced himself to the group\u201d as someone who \u201chad connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President Putin,\u201d according to the Justice Department statement.\n\nSeven days earlier, Papadopoulos met with two Russian intermediaries in London and discussed the possibility of arranging a meeting between Trump and Putin. After his March 24, 2016, meeting in London, Papadopoulos sent an email to \u201cthe Campaign Supervisor and several members of Campaign\u2019s foreign policy team,\u201d explaining that his Russian contacts wanted \u201cto arrange a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to discuss U.S.-Russia ties under President Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Campaign Supervisor responded that he would \u2018work it through the campaign,\u2019 but that no commitments should be made at that point,\u201d the Justice Department statement says. \u201cThe Campaign Supervisor added: \u2018Great Work.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Department of Justice did not name any of the campaign aides referenced in its statement. However, the Washington Post has since reported that an attorney for Sam Clovis confirmed that \u201cthe Campaign Supervisor\u201d in court documents refers to Clovis, who served as Trump\u2019s national campaign co-chairman.\n\nHere are some of the other contacts that Papadopoulos had with senior campaign officials about Russia during this time, according to the Justice Department statement:\n\nApril 2016 \u2013\u2013 Papadopoulos \u201csent multiple emails to other members of the Campaign\u2019s foreign policy team regarding his contacts with \u2018the Russians\u2019 and his \u2018outreach to Russia.'\u201d\n\nApril 25, 2016 \u2014 Papadopoulos sent an email to \u201ca senior policy adviser for the Campaign\u201d that said: \u201cThe Russian government has an open invitation by Putin for Mr. Trump to meet him when he is ready.\u201d\n\nApril 26, 2016 \u2014 During a meeting in London, \u201cthe professor\u201d told Papadopoulos \u201cthat he had just returned from a trip to Moscow where he had met with high-level Russian government officials\u201d who told him that the Russian government had \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton \u201cin the form of \u2018thousands of emails,\u2019\u201d the Justice Department said. Following the meeting, Papadopoulos \u201ccontinued to correspond with Campaign officials\u201d and his Russian contacts \u201cin an effort to arrange a meeting between the Campaign and the Russian government.\u201d\n\nApril 27, 2016 \u2014 Papadopoulos emailed \u201ca high-ranking official of the campaign\u201d to discuss \u201cRussia\u2019s interest in hosting Mr. Trump \u2026 when the time is right.\u201d According to the Post, \u201cEmails previously described to The Post indicate that the \u2018high-ranking campaign official'\u201d described in court documents is Corey Lewandowski, who at the time was Trump\u2019s campaign manager.\n\nMay 4, 2016 \u2014 Papadopoulos received an email from his contact at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that said: \u201cI have just talked to my colleagues from the MFA. The[y] are open for cooperation.\u201d Papadopoulos forwarded that email to the \u201chigh-ranking campaign official\u201d who since has been identified by the Post as Lewandowski.\n\nMay 5, 2016 \u2014 Papadopoulos also forwarded that email to \u201cthe Campaign Supervisor,\u201d who we now know is Clovis, after the two had a phone conservation. The subject of the email read, \u201cRussia updates.\u201d\n\nMay 14, 2016 \u2014 Papadopoulos emailed the \u201chigh-ranking campaign official\u201d with a message that \u201cthe Russian government ha[s] also relayed to me that they are interested in hosting Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nMay 21, 2016 \u2014 Papadopoulos emailed \u201canother high-ranking Campaign official\u201d with the subject line, \u201cRequest from Russia to meet Mr. Trump.\u201d The Post has since identified Paul Manafort as \u201canother high-ranking campaign official.\u201d At the time, Manafort was Trump\u2019s campaign convention manager. The Post reported earlier this year that Manafort forwarded Papadopoulos\u2019 email to his deputy, Rick Gates, with a note saying: \u201cWe need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips.\u201d Gates said he would ask the campaign\u2019s correspondence coordinator \u2014 \u201cthe person responding to all mail of non-importance\u201d \u2014 to respond, rather than a senior campaign aide, the Post said.\n\nJune 1, 2016 \u2014 Papadopoulos emailed the \u201chigh-ranking campaign official\u201d about Russia, but he was told to contact \u201cthe Campaign Supervisor because \u2018[h]e is running point.\u201d Papadopoulos emailed \u201cthe Campaign Supervisor\u201d \u2014 Clovis \u2014 with the subject line, \u201cRe: Messages from Russia.\u201d Papadopoulos wanted to know if Trump was interested in visiting Russia.\n\nJune 19, 2016 \u2014 Papadopoulos emailed the \u201chigh-ranking campaign official\u201d with the subject line, \u201cNew Message from Russia.\u201d He offered to travel to Russia to meet with Russian government officials, if Trump was not interested or unable to visit Russia.\n\nAug. 15, 2016 \u2014 \u201cThe Campaign Supervisor\u201d told Papadopoulos \u201cthat \u2018I would encourage you\u2019 and another foreign policy advisor to the Campaign to \u2018make the trip, if it is feasible.'\u201d The Justice Department said the trip proposed by Papadopoulos did not take place.\n\nThe department\u2019s statement did not provide any specific information about Papadopoulos\u2019 campaign contacts beyond Aug. 15, 2016. But, as we mentioned, the Justice Department statement is a partial account of Papadopoulos\u2019 contacts with the Russians and the Trump campaign.\n\nWhat we do know is that during this time \u2014 from late March to mid-August \u2014 Papadopoulos was in regular contact with senior Trump campaign officials and attended a national security meeting with Trump. We will let readers decide if this constitutes a \u201clow-level volunteer.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
