This is why me and every Indian hates Salman.\u201d\n\nALSO READ: A Nepalese citizen was NOT assaulted in Varanasi; here\u2019s the truth\u2026\n\nNewsMobile fact checked the above post and found it to be misleading.\n\nWe cropped both the pictures and put them through Reverse Image Search separately. The results led us to several reports, suggesting that the man in the picture with Salman is NOT Dawood, but his brother Noora.\n\nOther reports can be seen here, here and here.\n\nWhen we looked for the second picture of Salman waving the Pakistani flag, we found the original picture on The Times of India, in which he was actually holding the Indian tricolour.\n\nIn the above FAKE vs REAL collage, it is clear that the Indian flag was replaced with the Pakistani flag using photo editing software to create a false narrative.\n\nHence, with the above discoveries, we can conclude that the post in question is FALSE.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
