It is a new virus and the hypothesis is that it came from animals and mainly bats. It was found in another wild animal but so far there is no reference to chicken. We don\u2019t have such information even from China or any other place,\u201d said Dr Michel Yao, Emergency Operations Programme Manager, WHO\u2019s Regional Office for Africa in an interview with GhanaFact.\n\nThis was in reaction to a claim that \u201cCarona virus has been found in broiler chicken\u201d which is being widely shared on Facebook, with screenshots popping up in WhatsApp groups in Ghana.\n\nFacebook user- Jits Scenic made the claim on February 5 and admonished people not to eat broiler chicken. The post has since been shared more than 1,000 times.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, China has reported an outbreak of the deadly H5N1 bird flu in Hunan province, which lies on the southern border of Hubei province, the epicentre of the rapidly spreading coronavirus.\n\n\u201cThe outbreak occurred in a farm in the Shuangqing district of Shaoyang City. The farm has 7,850 chickens, and 4,500 of the chickens have died from the contagion. Local authorities have culled 17,828 poultry after the outbreak,\u201d according to a February 1 statement by China\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.\n\n\u201cWe have many things going on on social media and people should be careful. It is a totally different virus.\u201d Dr Michel Yao dismissed any connection between the avian influenza virus [bird flu] and the coronavirus.\n\nNo case of coronavirus in Ghana\n\nAccording to the Ghana Health Service, forty-one(41) suspected cases of coronavirus in Ghana have all tested negative.\n\nThe Ghanaian government has committed \u00a22.5 million to support the activities of the National Coordinating Sectoral Committee leading the implementation of the prevention plan against coronavirus.\n\nHowever, the Ghana coalition of NGOs in Health says the amount committed to the fight against the deadly Coronavirus is not enough.\n\nThis comes after a report from the WHO shared similar concerns about inadequate funding and stated that even though the country has capacity in-country to test for COVID-19 disease (Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research and Kumasi Centre for Collaborative Research) its readiness status is largely moderate.", "lang": "en"}
