Vishvas News investigated and found that the image is edited and the claim is a rumor.\n\nA photo shared on Facebook by a user named Roger Taylor is accompanied by a caption that reads: \u201cDr\u2019s say those who find the camel are unlikely to get Alzheimer\u2019s\u201d. The text in the photo reads: \u201cThe test of the head is to find a camel, it\u2019s a test to see who can develop Alzheimer\u2019s. Doctors say those who find the camel will stay far from getting Alzheimer\u2019s\u201d.\n\nVishvas News started its investigation by performing Google reverse image search of the viral image and found that the image is doctored. The doctored image is circulating online since 2012.\n\nThe original image does not have camel in it. The picture of camel has been inserted on the original image and the original image has been edited.\n\nWe can see that camel is inserted in the doctored picture. Whereas there is no camel in the original picture.\n\nNo camel in present in the original image\n\nOn the official website of Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, we searched articles on determining risks of Alzheimer\u2019s by looking at an animal\u2019s image, but no such study was mentioned.\n\nVishvas News spoke to Dr. Gururaj Mallikarjun who is a neurologist. He said:\u201cthis message is a hoax. It is a rumour that is spread to induce fear in people. People should not believe in such fake messages.\u201d\n\nAccording to US Department of Health & Human Sciences, Alzheimer\u2019s disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks.\n\nAccording to Alzheimer\u2019s Association, The most common early symptom of Alzheimer\u2019s is difficulty remembering newly learned information because Alzheimer\u2019s changes typically begin in the part of the brain that affects learning. As Alzheimer\u2019s advances through the brain it leads to increasingly severe symptoms, including disorientation, mood and behavior changes; deepening confusion about events, time and place; unfounded suspicions about family, friends and professional caregivers; more serious memory loss and behavior changes; and difficulty speaking, swallowing and walking.\n\nNowhere has it been mentioned that spotting an animal in the image can help in diagnosing risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nThe post claiming that acamel in an image can help in diagnosing risk of Alzheimer\u2019s is fake.", "lang": "en"}
