According to this clipping, Gandhi had made this statement during campaigning ahead of the assembly election in Rajasthan in 2018.\n\nThe image has been shared mostly by individual users on Facebook along with a message which reads, \u201cLook my vaishya brothers, how Pappu (Rahul Gandhi) called all baniyas thieves by repeatedly calling Modi ji a chor. He himself has built a fortune through loot and thinks all people are thieves. Now see how the baniyas of the country show him his place\u201d (translated from Hindi).\n\nIt is also circulating on WhatsApp. Several Alt News followers sent us the image, asking whether it is true.\n\nThe purported newspaper clip carrying Rahul Gandhi\u2019s supposed statement on the baniya community is an outright fake. Had the Congress President indeed made such a statement, it would have been reported extensively by the media. Alt News searched the newspaper clip with different keywords, but found no result.\n\nShared earlier in the name of Amit Shah\n\nA version of the same clipping also went viral on social media ahead of the Rajasthan assembly elections in December 2018. Back then, it was BJP President Amit Shah who had supposedly abused the baniya community. Among those who had shared this fake clipping was former Union Minister and Congress leader Pawan Kumar Bansal.\n\nIdentical introduction except for few words\n\nAlt News found that apart from the identical headlines, the introductory paragraphs of the articles are almost identical except for the name of two different leaders and parties.\n\n\u201c\u0930\u093e\u091c\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093e\u0928 \u0935\u093f\u0927\u093e\u0928\u0938\u092d\u093e \u091a\u0941\u0928\u093e\u0935 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0947 \u0926\u094c\u0930\u093e\u0928 \u092d\u093e\u091c\u092a\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092f \u0905\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0937 \u0905\u092e\u093f\u0924 \u0936\u093e\u0939 \u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0926\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092a\u0926 \u092c\u092f\u093e\u0928 \u0926\u0947\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0941\u0935\u0947 \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u0947 \u092c\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0938\u092e\u093e\u091c \u0914\u0930 \u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092a\u093e\u0930\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0941\u0932\u0928\u093e \u091a\u094b\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u0938\u0947 \u0915\u0930 \u0921\u093e\u0932\u0940\u0964 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u092c\u0942\u0902\u0926\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0906\u092f\u094b\u091c\u093f\u0924 \u092d\u093e\u091c\u092a\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u091a\u0941\u0928\u093e\u0935\u0940 \u0930\u0948\u0932\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092d\u093e\u091c\u092a\u093e \u0905\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0937 \u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0939\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u091a\u094b\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u093e \u0924\u094b \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u0947 \u092c\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0914\u0930 \u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092a\u093e\u0930\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0940 \u0906\u0926\u0924 \u0939\u0948, \u091f\u0948\u0915\u094d\u0938 \u0924\u094b \u091a\u094b\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0940 \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0939\u0940 \u0915\u093f\u0938\u093e\u0928\u094b \u0915\u0940 \u092c\u0930\u094d\u092c\u093e\u0926\u0940 \u0915\u093e \u092d\u0940 \u092e\u0941\u0916\u094d\u092f \u0915\u093e\u0930\u0923 \u092f\u0947 \u092c\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0914\u0930 \u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092a\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0917 \u0939\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u091c\u094b \u0938\u093e\u0930\u093e \u092e\u0941\u0928\u093e\u092b\u093e \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0940 \u091c\u0947\u092c \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0921\u093e\u0932 \u091c\u093e\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902\u0964\u201d, reads the introduction in the earlier version of the fake newspaper clip whereas in the version now shared on social media, \u201cAmit Shah\u201d and \u201cBJP\u201d has been replaced with \u201cRahul Gandhi\u201d and \u201cCongress\u201d.\n\nIt may be reiterated that this newspaper clipping is fake.
