But if anything 100,000 looks likely to be too low.\n\nLast week Professor John Aston, the Home Office\u2019s Chief Scientific Advisor, provided evidence to MPs about his department\u2019s estimates, saying: \u201cThe numbers for April I can tell you are that up to the 26th April from aviation there were 95,000 arrivals, of which about 53,000 were UK citizens.\u201d The 95,000 figure was confirmed to us by the Home Office and suggests the total number of arrivals since mid- to late March would have been well in excess of 100,000.\n\nLast month the Health Secretary claimed there were 15,000 arrivals a day happening in mid-April, a claim we fact checked recently. The Home Office told us this figure was wrong, but didn\u2019t provide an alternative estimate at the time, so it\u2019s still not possible to determine if Mr Hancock\u2019s figure was correct.\n\nSince we wrote that piece, Heathrow Airport has released passenger figures for April, which show a 97% fall compared to the numbers from April 2019.\n\nHow many had Covid-19?\n\nWhen pressed by MPs as to how many passengers had Covid-19, Professor Aston said: \u201cWe believe that less than half a percent of those people arriving potentially had Covid-19\u201d. This line was picked up by a number of newspapers.\n\nHowever it appears that statement was incorrect; Professor Aston tried to clarify the 0.5% twice more to the committee:\n\n\u201csorry less than half a percent of those arriving are due to the total cases of Covid-19 in the UK.\u201d\n\n\u201c0.5% of total cases in the UK were estimated to be imported\u201d\n\nWhen we contacted the Home Office, it told us that Professor Aston had initially misspoken at the committee. It directed us to comments made by the Home Secretary at the start of April, by way of clarifying the department\u2019s figures:\n\n\u201cThe Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) advised on 23 March that the numbers of cases arriving from other countries are estimated to be insignificant compared with domestic cases, comprising approximately 0.5% of total cases at the time.\u201d\n\nThe Home Office said no newer estimates were publicly available.", "lang": "en"}
