Are you paying attention yet?\u201d the image was captioned.\n\nThere has never been a pro-ISIS rally in Dearborn, according to the city\u2019s public information office, and no news outlets have reported ISIS flags being flown. An anti-ISIS rally did occur around the same time the post first went viral.\n\nMichigan, home to one of two Muslim women currently serving in Congress, has been the target of multiple memes that suggest the state\u2019s population is becoming increasingly hostile to Americans.

However, there\u2019s no evidence that any of these flags, shown in the background of a grainy picture, bore an ISIS insignia.\n\n\u201cThere was NEVER a pro-Isis rally in Dearborn,\u201d Mary Loundrouche, the director of Dearborn\u2019s Department of Public Information, told The Daily Caller in an email.\n\nIn December 2015, around the same time the image first began appearing on social media, the Muslim community did participate in an anti-ISIS rally. That rally took place days after the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California.\n\nThe Caller found no local reporting about pro-ISIS protests in Dearborn. Rather, all relevant coverage has focused on fact-checking the image at the center of this claim.\n\nPictures and video from the 2015 rally do not show demonstrators waving ISIS flags. \u201cHundreds of people in Dearborn come together to take stand against ISIS & terrorism,\u201d WXYZ Detroit tweeted at the time.\n\nDuring another rally against ISIS days earlier, in November 2015, one participant told the crowd, \u201cIf you want to know about ISIS, they have no god, no faith, no morality \u2013 they are savages.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
