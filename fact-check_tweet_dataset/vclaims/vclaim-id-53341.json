It estimated that in the UK a million people a year suffer a foodborne illness. The population of the UK today is around 66 million, which the original claimant seems to have used to get one in 66.\n\nThe FSA told us that one million people a year was the latest figure it had published, and is based on data from 2008/09. Back then the UK population was around 62 million.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to estimate the number of people who get food poisoning a year. It\u2019s not always possible to prove someone got ill because of something they\u2019d eaten, and they may not always go to a doctor or seek medical advice. As a result the estimates are broad.\n\nThe figure of one in six for the US comes from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which estimates that \u201ceach year roughly 1 in 6 Americans (or 48 million people)\u201d get sick as a result of foodborne diseases. The CDC told us this came from a paper published in 2011, but that the estimates are a \u201cfairly accurate representation of the burden of [foodborne] diseases in the US.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve said, the data between the two countries isn\u2019t comparable and varies considerably in how and when it was collected, and there are differences in the methodology behind the estimates. Real world factors, like access to medical care which differs widely between the two countries, can also affect the comparison.\n\nThe FSA added that it was \u201ccurrently undertaking analysis to better understand how much of the differences quoted between countries are likely to be real differences.\u201d\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a list of maximum levels of defects in food, that it says \u201cpresent no health hazard\u201d.\n\nThese levels represent the point at which the FDA has to take enforcement action against manufacturers. That doesn\u2019t mean that the FDA \u201callows\u201d contaminants below these levels\u2014it can still choose to take enforcement action in these cases.\n\nWhen this piece was first published we referred to these levels as \u201cacceptable levels\u201d, which doesn\u2019t accurately convey their purpose. We have since written a more in-depth piece about US and UK food hygiene rules, which you can read here.\n\nUnder the entry for ground paprika, the enforcement level is above an \u201caverage of more than 11 rodent hairs per 25 grams\u201d. For whole ginger the level is 3mg or more of mammal excrement per pound of product. For peanut butter it\u2019s \u201c30 or more insect fragments per 100 grams\u201d and for citrus juices it\u2019s \u201c1 or more maggots per 250ml\u201d.\n\nIf these contaminants are found in these products at these levels, the FDA classifies the product as \u201cadulterated\u201d and it becomes illegal to distribute them. The FDA adds that these maximum levels \u201cdo not represent an average of the defects that occur in any of the products--the averages are actually much lower.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
