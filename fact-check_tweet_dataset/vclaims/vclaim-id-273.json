Another iteration of the claim alleges Thunberg made the same statement to the Japanese government. As of May 13, 2020 the claim has been shared over 8,700 times on Facebook.\n\nOne post reads: \u201cThis is too good to let pass by! Greta Tunberg called on the Chinese to stop using their traditional chopsticks and thus save hundreds of trees. The Chinese advised Greta Thunberg to return to school, where she will learn that the sticks are made of bamboo, and that bamboo is a plant, not a tree. And they called her to stop wiping her butt with toilet paper because it is actually made of wood!\u201d\n\nExamples of Facebook posts are visible here , here , here , here and here .\n\nThe claim has also been shared in Dutch ( here ) and Danish ( here ).\n\nReuters did not find any evidence from a credible source confirming Thunberg ever made similar statements. Thunberg\u2019s team confirmed to Reuters that she had never made such a statement.\n\nThe earliest iteration of this claim is a tweet from January 14, 2020 ( here ), from a user apparently located in the U.S. The tweet, which makes no mention of any specific country, includes the statement, \u201cGreta said don\u2019t use chopsticks.

According to the fact-checker, the article might have stemmed from an authentic declaration made by Thunberg earlier on January, about the possibility of visiting Asia ( here ).\n\nOn January 3, 2020, Thunberg told Japanese media outlet Kyodo News, she is willing to travel to Asian countries including China ( bit.ly/3dFTVTv ) and Japan ( bit.ly/3fOvMfp ). During the interview, Thunberg made no mention about chopsticks.\n\nFalse. There is no evidence teen climate activist Greta Thunberg made this statement about chopsticks.
