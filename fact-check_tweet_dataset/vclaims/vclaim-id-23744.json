The caption with the video, however, makes a false claim.\n\nIn the video, Anna can be heard saying, \"He was slapped? Only one slap?\"\n\nThe caption along with the viral video reads, \"Look at Anna's reaction after the Kejriwal-slapping incident.\"\n\nYou can view the viral post here and access its archived version here.\n\nThe video is viral on Facebook.\n\nTaking cue from the video which has a logo of India TV, BOOM searched the archives of the channel and found that the same video was uploaded to YouTube on November 24, 2011.\n\nHowever, the incident Anna is referring to in the video is not related with Arvind Kejriwal but Sharad Pawar.\n\nNationalist Congress Party's Sharad Pawar was slapped by a youth on November 24, 2011.\n\nThe youth had been identified as Harvinder Singh, a transporter from Delhi who was earlier involved in an assault on telecom minister Sukhram.\n\nIt was when the news channels sought Anna's reaction on the incident that he took a potshot at Pawar. However, later Hazare had condemned the incident.", "lang": "en"}
