But, FACTLY has found the video to be edited one. In the original video, it can be seen that PM Modi was watching and clapping during the live telecast of the launch of Chandrayaan-2 by ISRO. So, the visuals of the launch of Chandrayaan-2 telecasted on television have been edited to show the visuals of TV series \u2018Ramayana\u2019. Earlier, when the same video was shared as PM Modi clapping while watching Chidambaram getting arrested, FACTLY has written a fact-check article, which can be read here. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
