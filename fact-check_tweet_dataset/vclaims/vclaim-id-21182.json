Scripture commands Christians to help the poor, to recognize the importance of the family, and to criticize unjust laws.\n\nIn the Gospels, Jesus repeatedly teaches that Christians should love their neighbors. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus says: \u201c\u2018Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.\u2019 This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: \u2018Love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.\u201d\n\nLater in Matthew, Jesus explains what loving your neighbor involves: feeding the hungry, slaking the thirsty, inviting in the stranger, clothing the naked, and visiting the sick and imprisoned. \u201cWhatever you did not do for one of the least of these,\u201d Jesus says, \u201cyou did not do for me.\u201d\n\nAnd in the very passage that Sessions cites, Romans 13, the Apostle Paul mirrors Jesus\u2019 teaching. \u201cWhatever other command there may be,\u201d he writes, \u201c[they] are summed up in this one command: \"Love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d Love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.\u201c\n\nGiven the scriptural emphasis on acts of mercy and love of neighbor, Sessions\u2019 claim that Paul\u2019s command is clear is at best dubious. It is at worst indefensible.\n\nThe centrality of the family\n\nHow do mercy and neighborly love relate to the family? Beginning with Genesis, Scripture emphasizes the centrality and importance of the family for individual and social well-being. In Genesis, God creates Adam and Eve so that they may be companions to one another. God also commands them to be fruitful and multiply.\n\nIn addition to being placed by Jesus at the heart of the Kingdom of God, children are a gift from God. And parental love aims to mirror for children the love of God.\n\nThe import of these teachings is reflected in several contemporary documents, including Catholic social doctrine, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, all of which claim that civil society and the state should prioritize care for mothers and children.\n\nIn recent days, the media have reported the painful stories of the forced separation of hundreds of immigrant families at U.S. border detention centers.\n\nWhat\u2019s conspicuous and morally problematic about these stories, is the trauma that forced separation causes to families, and in particular to children.\n\nSessions\u2019s invocation of Romans 13 is only the most recent example of the use of this passage which has been used to justify all manner of immoral behavior: imperialism, slavery, Nazism and apartheid.\n\nWhat Sessions and others have missed is the moral of Romans 13. Care for the most vulnerable, falls to the family first and then to the state. Immigrant families fleeing from destitution are attempting to find the means to provide for their themselves. The state must honor this priority if people are to consider their laws just and worthy of the submission Paul enjoins on Christians.\n\nThe spirit of charity and hospitality, recognizing that we are all strangers and sojourners alike, demands caring for the most vulnerable members of the human family. The Trump administration\u2019s rhetoric and action flout these.", "lang": "en"}
