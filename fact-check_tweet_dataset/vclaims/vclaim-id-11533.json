No, that's not true: the claim was made by a recently renamed twitter account using old photographs of a protest as \"proof\". It is not true.\n\nThe story originated from a tweet published on November 6, 2018 by a Twitter user calling himself \"Col. Gary\" (archived here) which looked like this:\n\nHowever other Twitter users were quick to point out that the picture used to illustrate the tweet actually came from a 2014 protest:\n\nThe image used as the avatar of the Twitter account appears to be of someone named \"Rick Light\" from a Texas-based militia group:\n\nThe Twitter account @ItMeDoge that posted the tweet appears to have recently changed its name and bio. Right now it says \"Col. Gary\" and it has following bio:\n\nBut as recently as September 13, 2008 (archived link) the name listed on the profile was just \"Doge\u2122\" with a bio that read \"Never Tweet\".\n\nIt appears the whole thing is just a giant troll, as this tweet (archived version) seems to suggest:", "lang": "en"}
