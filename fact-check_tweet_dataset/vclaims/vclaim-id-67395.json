We had a big debate about this, President (Barack) Obama discussed this. President Obama is a constitutional law professor, he came into office very concerned about the terrible ...\"\n\nABC political analyst Matthew Dowd jumped in as Kristol spoke to say Obama\u2019s performance in this area is \"exceedingly disappointing.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m sorry, then he became president of the United States,\" Kristol replied. \"He got all the briefings, he saw seriously what was going on, and basically he decided, I think, correctly, that you know what, the balance is probably pretty appropriately struck. Now he\u2019s shifting ... entirely because of optics.\"\n\nPunditFact wanted to know if Kristol is correct about Obama\u2019s evolution on government spying programs.\n\nIn his early years in the Senate, Obama was a reliable critic of the post-Sept. 11 surveillance efforts launched by President George W. Bush.\n\nIn 2005, the exposed a Bush executive order allowing the National Security Agency to tap Americans\u2019 international phone calls and emails in effort to track terrorists without seeking search warrants from the courts. The Times reported the agency was still seeking warrants for monitoring domestic communications.\n\nAs the Senate voted to reauthorize the Patriot Act that same week, Obama decried the administration\u2019s \"fishing expedition\" of Americans\u2019 everyday electronic records in a : \"This is just plain wrong. ... Giving law enforcement the tools they need to investigate suspicious activity is one thing \u2013 and it\u2019s the right thing \u2013 but doing it without any real oversight seriously jeopardizes the rights of all Americans and the ideals America stands for.\"\n\nIn a 2006 speech explaining why he would vote against confirming Michael Hayden as the director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 2006, Obama said:\n\n\"We don\u2019t expect the president to give the American people every detail about a classified surveillance program. But we do expect him to place such a program within the rule of law, and to allow members of the other two co-equal branches of government \u2014 Congress and the Judiciary \u2014 to have the ability to monitor and oversee such a program.\"\n\nAnd: \"We need to find a way forward to make sure that we can stop terrorists while protecting the privacy, and liberty, of innocent Americans. As a nation we have to find the right balance between privacy and security, between executive authority to face threats and uncontrolled power. What protects us, and what distinguishes us, are the procedures we put in place to protect that balance, namely judicial warrants and congressional review. ... These are concrete safeguards to make sure surveillance hasn\u2019t gone too far.\"\n\nFast forward to 2007. Obama is running for president -- and still criticizing Bush for operating without enough oversight.\n\nHe said the Bush administration \"puts forward a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we provide.\"\n\nAccording to the Des Moines Register (via ), he said, \"When I am president, there will be no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens. No more national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime. No more tracking citizens who do nothing more than protest a misguided war.\"\n\nThe next year, however, he faced charges of on warrantless wiretapping by his Republican rival, Sen. John McCain.\n\nAt issue was legislation in 2008 that rewrote the rules of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the 1978 law that lays out rules for spying in the country and created a it. Congress amended the law amid backlash. One of the most controversial questions was whether to grant retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that had turned over network data to the government, as the companies were vulnerable to lawsuits following the Times expos\u00e9.\n\nObama\u2019s campaign said he would oppose a bill that provided retroactive immunity for the companies.\n\nBut he ended up joining 68 senators who voted for it, disappointing some on the left as well as advocates of civil liberties.\n\nThe changes to FISA in 2008 essentially legalized warrantless wiretapping that had been going on, Molly Bishop Shadel, an expert in foreign intelligence law at the University of Virginia School of Law, .\n\n\"Congress expanded the scope of FISA even though it knew or should have known that the NSA had done something questionable,\" she said.\n\nObama defended his vote to supporters by saying the new law includes checks and balances that weren\u2019t in place before.\n\n\"Senator Obama has said before that the compromise bill is not perfect,\" his campaign said in a statement at the time. \"Given the choice between voting for an improved yet imperfect bill, and losing important surveillance tools, Senator Obama chose to support the FISA compromise.\"\n\nObama explained the bill \"is far better than the Protect America Act that I voted against last year... (because it) makes it clear to any president or telecommunications company that no law supersedes the authority of the FISA court.\"\n\nStill, that Obama flip-flopped after promising to filibuster a bill that provided retroactive immunity to the telecommunications companies as True.\n\nNo substantial legislative oversight has been added to the Patriot Act since Obama took over the White House.\n\nObama signed a five-year extension of the FISA Amendments Act in December 2012. The Senate rejected amendments that would have required intelligence agencies to report more information about their work to Congress.\n\nFollowing Snowden\u2019s revelations, Obama defended two surveillance programs using some of the language Kristol mentioned.\n\n\"You can't have 100 percent security and also have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience. We're going to have to make some choices as a government,\"\n\n\"You can complain about Big Brother and how this is a potential program run amok, but when you actually look at the details, I think we've struck the right balance.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll close by looking at Obama\u2019s performance on campaign promises on this subject, including his to update the FISA law so there is greater congressional oversight and his to \"revisit the Patriot Act to ensure that there is real and robust oversight of tools like National Security letters, sneak-and-peek searches, and the use of the material witness provision.\"\n\nObama said he would restrict warrantless wiretapping by strengthening intelligence agencies\u2019 accountability to Congress, which is rated Obama signed a reauthorization of the Patriot Act in 2011 that did not include more oversight, though his Justice Department did voluntarily to add additional measures included in a bill that failed in the Senate.\n\nObama also promised to \"revisit the Patriot Act to ensure that there is real and robust oversight of tools like National Security Letters, sneak-and-peek searches, and the use of the material witness provision,\" which PolitiFact also rated as a\n\nKristol said Obama \"came into office very concerned about\" wiretappings but \"then he became president of the United States, he got all the briefings \u2026 (and) he decided \u2026 the balance is probably pretty appropriately struck.\"\n\nObama\u2019s concerns for Bush-era surveillance tactics have certainly dwindled since he took office -- and he has defended ongoing, recently exposed confidential surveillance programs.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s opinions shifted even before he moved into the White House. Most notably, he voted for a bill that essentially approved warrantless wiretapping in July 2008. The shift was so notable that his presidential rival at the time called him a flip-flopper.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
