Their only plan is to destroy us! Why are we so stupid to not understand that? Thank God for these brave men!\u201d\n\nBut other Facebook users and some of our readers were more skeptical and flagged the story as potentially false. It is.\n\nTim Wiley, spokesman for the FBI\u2019s Detroit field office, confirmed to FactCheck.org that there was no such raid and the only named person quoted in the story, \u201cAgent Nesmith Variacles,\u201d is not employed by the bureau.\n\nThe story also refers to \u201cThe Department of Refugee Affairs,\u201d but there is no such department.\n\nThe whole story is made-up \u2014 except the name of the city, Dearborn, which is a frequent target for false stories because it has a large Arab American population.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nSpagat, Elliot and Merchant, Nomaan. \u201cImmigration agents descend on 7-Eleven stores in 17 states.\u201d Associated Press. 10 Jan 2018.\n\nHoman, Thomas. \u201cStatement from ICE Deputy Director Thomas D.
