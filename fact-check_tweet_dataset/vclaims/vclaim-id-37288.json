Kavanaugh and what Kavanaugh\u2019s record shows on these issues.\n\nAdvocates for abortion rights are concerned that Judge Brett Kavanaugh could become the deciding vote in a future case to potentially overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that recognized a woman\u2019s right to an abortion.\n\n\n\nAfter all, Donald Trump, in a 2016 presidential debate against Hillary Clinton, said \u201cI am pro-life\u201d and \u201cthe justices that I\u2019m going to appoint will be pro-life.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump nominated Kavanaugh in July, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said that \u201cJudge Kavanaugh\u2019s comments make abundantly clear that he will expansively rule against women\u2019s reproductive rights and freedoms and move to destroy Roe v. Wade.\u201d\n\nTo support her claim, Pelosi referred to flattering comments Kavanaugh made about former Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who wrote a dissenting opinion in the landmark case. In addition, she mentioned a ruling Kavanaugh made last year in the case of an immigrant minor, who was in the country illegally, in federal custody, and who wanted to get an abortion.\n\nThose issues came up in Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings, in which he also faced questions about whether or not he truly believes Roe v. Wade is \u201csettled law.\u201d\n\nHere, we review the specific points raised by the Democrats and the facts in each case.\n\nWhat Democrats are saying: \u201cJust last year, Judge Kavanaugh praised the dissent in Roe v. Wade,\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris said on Sept. 4. The same day, Sen. Chris Coons said of Kavanaugh, \u201cyou\u2019ve recently praised Justice Rehnquist\u2019s dissent in Roe v. Wade.\u201d And back on July 12, Pelosi said that \u201che gave a speech, not probably well-known but praising Chief Justice Rehnquist for his dissent in Roe v. Wade.\u201d\n\nWhat Kavanaugh\u2019s record shows: Kavanaugh did call Rehnquist his \u201cfirst judicial hero\u201d in a September 2017 lecture at a Constitution Day event for the American Enterprise Institute. He said Rehnquist, who was one of only two justices who dissented in Roe v. Wade, \u201cbrought about a massive change in constitutional law and how we think about the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd as a law student, Kavanaugh said, he often found himself agreeing with Rehnquist\u2019s opinions, or at least recognizing when he made compelling arguments.\n\n\u201cIn class after class, I stood with Rehnquist. That often meant in the Yale Law School environment of the time that I stood alone,\u201d Kavanaugh said. Although, \u201cto be sure, I do not agree with all of his opinions,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAfter that, Kavanaugh went on to highlight five areas where he said Rehnquist \u201capplied his principles and where he had a massive and enduring impact on American law.\u201d\n\nOne of those topics was \u201cthe Court\u2019s power to recognize unenumerated rights,\u201d which Kavanaugh covered in five paragraphs:\n\nKavanaugh\u2019s Constitution Day lecture, Sept. 18, 2017: A few months after he joined the Court in 1972, Justice Rehnquist faced an oral argument about the constitutionality of a state law prohibiting abortion in the case of Roe v. Wade. Rehnquist, along with Justice Byron White, ultimately dissented from the Court\u2019s seven-two holding recognizing a constitutional right to abortion. Rehnquist\u2019s dissenting opinion did not suggest that the Constitution protected no rights other than those enumerated in the text of the Bill of Rights. But he stated that under the Court\u2019s precedents, any such unenumerated right had to be rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people. Given the prevalence of abortion regulations both historically and at the time, Rehnquist said he could not reach such a conclusion about abortion. He explained that a law prohibiting an abortion even where the mother\u2019s life was in jeopardy would violate the Constitution. But otherwise he stated the states had the power to legislate with regard to this matter. In later cases, Rehnquist reiterated his view that unenumerated rights could be recognized by the courts only if the asserted right was rooted in the nation\u2019s history and tradition. The 1997 case of Washington v. Glucksberg involved an asserted right to assisted suicide. For a five-to-four majority this time, Rehnquist wrote the opinion for the Court saying that the unenumerated rights and liberties protected by the due process clause are those rights that are deeply rooted in the nation\u2019s history and tradition. And he rejected the claim that assisted suicide qualified as such a fundamental right. Of course, even a first-year law student could tell you that the Glucksberg approach to unenumerated rights was not consistent with the approach of the abortion cases such as Roe v. Wade in 1973 \u2014 as well as the 1992 decision reaffirming Roe, known as Planned Parenthood v. Casey. What to make of that? In this context, it is fair to say that Justice Rehnquist was not successful in convincing a majority of the justices in the context of abortion either in Roe itself or in the later cases such as Casey, in the latter case perhaps because of stare decisis. But he was successful in stemming the general tide of freewheeling judicial creation of unenumerated rights that were not rooted in the nation\u2019s history and tradition. The Glucksberg case stands to this day as an important precedent, limiting the Court\u2019s role in the realm of social policy and helping to ensure that the Court operates more as a court of law and less as an institution of social policy.\n\nHowever complementary his remarks were, Kavanaugh never explicitly said he agreed with Rehnquist\u2019s dissent in Roe v. Wade. But it isn\u2019t clear that he disagreed with it, either\n\n\n\nWhat Democrats are saying: \u201cLast year, you drafted a dissent in Garza v. Hargan. And that\u2019s a case where a young woman in Texas, I believe, was seeking an abortion,\u201d Sen. Dianne Feinstein said on Sept. 4. \u201cIn that dissent, you argued that even though the young woman had complied with the Texas parental notification law and secured an approval from the judge, she should nevertheless \u2014 nonetheless be barred.\u201d\n\nWhat Kavanaugh\u2019s record shows: About a month after Kavanaugh\u2019s lecture on Rehnquist, he was part of a three-judge panel that ruled on a case involving a 17-year-old immigrant who illegally entered the U.S. without her parents, and after being told she was pregnant, sought to have an abortion.\n\nIn lieu of parental consent, she obtained permission from a local judge to have the abortion, as required in Texas, where she was being held in a federally funded immigration shelter.\n\nBut the Office of Refugee Resettlement of the Department of Health and Human Services, which assumes responsibility for unaccompanied minors who come to the U.S., would not permit her to leave the facility to undergo the procedure.\n\nWith the help of Rochelle Garza, a court-appointed guardian, \u201cJane Doe\u201d or \u201cJ.D.,\u201d as the minor was identified in court documents, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, where Judge Tanya Chutkan ordered federal officials to allow her to have the abortion, \u201cpromptly and without delay.\u201d\n\nThe government appealed the decision to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that it should not have to \u201cfacilitate\u201d the abortion, and that the girl should first be transferred from HHS custody to an adult sponsor before ending her pregnancy.\n\nIn a 2-1 ruling, the judges\u2019 panel, including Kavanaugh, sided with the government. (Judge Patricia Millett dissented.)\n\n\n\nThe decision, which was unsigned, said: \u201cThe Government argues that this process \u2014 by which a minor is released from HHS custody to a sponsor \u2014 does not unduly burden the minor\u2019s right under Supreme Court precedent to an abortion. We agree, so long as the process of securing a sponsor to whom the minor is released occurs expeditiously.\u201d\n\nHHS was given another 11 days to find a sponsor for the pregnant teen. If a sponsor could be found to take custody of the minor, she would be allowed to have the abortion. But if no sponsor could be found, the case would go back to the District Court.\n\nSo, the girl wasn\u2019t necessarily \u201cbarred\u201d from having an abortion, as Feinstein said. Instead, the panel ruled that she should be placed with a sponsor before having one.\n\nIn response, Jane Doe\u2019s lawyers (from the American Civil Liberties Union) asked that the case be considered by the full appeals court, which, by a vote of 6 to 3, overturned the panel\u2019s ruling and paved the way for her to get the abortion.\n\nIn his dissenting opinion, Kavanaugh said that the majority got it wrong.\n\n\n\nKavanaugh dissent, Garza v. Hargan, 2017: The en banc majority has badly erred in this case. The three-judge panel held that the U.S. Government, when holding a pregnant unlawful immigrant minor in custody, may seek to expeditiously transfer the minor to an immigration sponsor before the minor makes the decision to obtain an abortion. That ruling followed from the Supreme Court\u2019s many precedents holding that the Government has permissible interests in favoring fetal life, protecting the best interests of a minor, and refraining from facilitating abortion. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the Government may further those interests so long as it does not impose an undue burden on a woman seeking an abortion. Today\u2019s majority decision, by contrast, \u201csubstantially\u201d adopts the panel dissent and is ultimately based on a constitutional principle as novel as it is wrong: a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. Government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand, thereby barring any Government efforts to expeditiously transfer the minors to their immigration sponsors before they make that momentous life decision. The majority\u2019s decision represents a radical extension of the Supreme Court\u2019s abortion jurisprudence. It is in line with dissents over the years by Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun, not with the many majority opinions of the Supreme Court that have repeatedly upheld reasonable regulations that do not impose an undue burden on the abortion right recognized by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade.\n\nKavanaugh said the government was \u201cmerely seeking to place the minor in a better place when deciding whether to have an abortion.\u201d\n\nIt was even possible the minor \u2014 who would have been 16 or 17 weeks pregnant at the end of those 11 days \u2014 would have been allowed to have the abortion if a sponsor had not been found, he said. (Texas outlaws abortions after 20 weeks.)\n\nNotably, Kavanaugh didn\u2019t go as far as Judge Karen Henderson, who said unauthorized immigrant minors don\u2019t have the right to an elective abortion.\n\nBut at the start of the confirmation hearings, Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said she still was wary of Kavanaugh\u2019s argument.\n\n\u201cIf adopted, we believe [it] would require courts to determine whether a young woman had a sufficient support network when making her decision, even in cases where she has gone to court,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cThis reason we believe, I believe, demonstrates that you are willing to disregard precedent,\u201d she said of Kavanaugh, who, according to news reports, told Republican Sen. Susan Collins in August that Roe v. Wade was \u201csettled law.\u201d\n\nHe told Feinstein the same thing on Sept. 5.\n\n\u201cSenator, I said that it\u2019s settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court entitled the respect under principles stare decisis,\u201d Kavanaugh said, referring to the legal term for letting prior rulings stand. \u201cAnd one of the important things to keep in mind about Roe v. Wade is that it has been reaffirmed many times over the past 45 years, as you know, and most prominently, most importantly reaffirmed in Planned Parenthood versus Casey in 1992,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat Democrats are saying: \u201cJudge Kavanaugh has been pretending he would not overturn Roe v. Wade by hiding behind the idea that it\u2019s \u2018settled law\u2019 and \u2018precedent,'\u201d Sen. Patty Murray said on Sept. 6. \u201cThat\u2019s what he has been saying in his hearings, so far, and he\u2019s hoping that will fool women across the country into thinking their rights and freedoms are safe. We know that is not true. A ruling even as important as Roe is settled law and precedent only until someone like Judge Kavanaugh and four other ideological justices on the Supreme Court vote to overturn it. This new document confirms our worst fears.\u201d\n\nWhat Kavanaugh\u2019s record shows: One day after reaffirming that he thinks Roe v. Wade has been \u201csettled as a precedent,\u201d the New York Times reported that it had obtained an email from March 2003 in which Kavanaugh wrote, \u201cI am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so.\u201d That email is the document that Murray referred to in her remarks.\n\nAt the time the email was sent, Kavanaugh was working in the George W. Bush administration, and he was responding to an email that included a draft of an op-ed written to defend some of President Bush\u2019s judicial nominees. The original draft included the line, \u201cFirst of all, it is widely understood accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land.\u201d\n\nFeinstein asked Kavanaugh about the email on Sept. 6 \u2014 the same day the Senate Judiciary Committee released it to the public along with other documents.\n\n\u201cThis has been viewed as you saying that you don\u2019t think Roe is settled,\u201d Feinstein said, after reading part of the email aloud. \u201cSo please, once again, tell us why you believe Roe is settled law, and if you could, do you believe it is correctly settled?\u201d\n\nKavanaugh said he was only questioning the accuracy of the op-ed\u2019s language.\n\n\u201cThe broader point was simply that I think it was overstating something about legal scholars,\u201d he told Feinstein. \u201cAnd I\u2019m always concerned with accuracy and I thought that was not quite accurate description of legal \u2014 all legal scholars, because it referred to all.\u201d (The draft actually said \u201clegal scholars across the board,\u201d not \u201call legal scholars.\u201d)\n\nKavanaugh went on to again tell Feinstein that \u201cRoe v. Wade is an important precedent of the Supreme Court\u201d that has \u201cbeen reaffirmed many times.\u201d However, he avoided answering whether the case was correctly decided, as she had asked.", "lang": "en"}
