No, that's not true: it was a rumor that originated on a satire website.\n\nThe story originated on the Southend News Network on March 29, 2018 and was titled \"Government announces every UK home must have gender-neutral toilet by 2021\" (archived here) and opened:\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Agricture and Equalities has confirmed that every home in Britain will be required to have a designated gender-neutral toilet by the end of March 2021. Junior minister for the DAE Julian Fin De Cloche told a packed press conference that it was time for every home in Britain to provide an inclusive and non-discriminatory toilet environment.

They have a disclaimer on their about page that reads (in part):\n\nSouthend News Network was originally started in October 2015 with no real aims or objectives in mind other than to add a satirical/spoof-like touch to issues that people are passionate about in Southend On Sea. Above all else, SNN is all about having the occasional 'dig' at the powers that be, as well a slightly bigger and more frequent 'dig' at certain elements of local media!\n\nSeveral of their stories have been mistaken for real news in the past and the site was recognized by the local authorities as an \"official news outlet\".", "lang": "en"}
