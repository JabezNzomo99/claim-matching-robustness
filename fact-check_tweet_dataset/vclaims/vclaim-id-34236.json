Great job Steve!\"\n\nAccording to a Nov. 20 Facebook post making the rounds, Chris Wallace sent out a scathing Twitter response:\n\n\"@realDonaldTrump And you\u2019ll never be your father either, (Fred Trump), a self made Billionaire,\" the post appears to show Wallace tweeting at Trump. \"You\u2019re a fraud. A charlatan. A thug. A loser. A trust fund baby. A punk. A serial adulterer. A pussy grabber. My job is to be a journalist, not a flunky and a propaganda arm for your criminal behavior and corruption. If you want propaganda, go watch Hannity, Ingram, Pirro, and Tucker who do nothing but kiss your ass.\"\n\nThe quote is fabricated. Wallace never tweeted that \u2014 and he doesn\u2019t appear to have a public, verified Twitter account.\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThere are some clues, like how the supposed tweet in the Facebook post is center justified whereas Trump\u2019s real tweet is left justified. Or how the @FoxNewsSunday handle is made to look like it is Chris Wallace\u2019s personal Twitter account, when it\u2019s actually the official account for the Fox show he hosts.\n\nOn Nov. 17, Fox News Sunday only tweeted clips from the show \u2014 including the segment featuring House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., discussing the impeachment hearings. The account also retweeted country singer Toby Keith, who was promoting an upcoming appearance on the show. The account didn\u2019t reply to anyone that day, nor since. Additionally, we found no personal Twitter account for Wallace.\n\nA Fox News host aggressively attacking the president would have garnered the same kind of attention as Trump\u2019s salvo, but we could find none.\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
