Resemblance between the two logos appears to be coincidental.\n\nThe Facebook post uses the logos to suggest a connection between a real biological research company and Umbrella Corporation, the fictional lab responsible for a viral outbreak that plays a key role in the plot of the \u201cResident Evil\u201d video games.\n\n\u201cIn #ResidentEvil the Umbrella Corporation releases a virus that infects the people of Raccoon City,\u201d reads the post. \u201cA biological research lab with the exact same logo as the Umbrella Corporation can be found in the city where the #CoronaVirus outbreak originated. Corona is an anagram for Racoon (sic).\u201d\n\nThe viral image provides the location of the real biological research company by showing its name. Shanghai Ruilan Bao Hu San Biotech Limited is based in the Pujiang District of Shanghai, more than 500 miles away from the central city of Wuhan where the novel coronavirus is believed to have originated.\n\nShanghai Ruilan Bao Hu San Biotech Limited offers services such as \u201caccurate health testing consultation, health assessment services, disease prevention and consultation, and health conditioning,\u201d according to a translation of its website.
