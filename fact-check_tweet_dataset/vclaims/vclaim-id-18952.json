Zubairu Dada \u2013 Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development\n\u2022 Sa\u2019adiya Umar Farouk \u2013 Minister of State for Labour and Employment\n\u2022 Abubakar D Aliyu \u2013 Minister of State for Budget and National Planning\n\u2022 Emeka Nwajiuba \u2013 Minister of State for Industry, Trade and Investment\n\nThis claim coincides with similar news published on a Facebook page on the 4th of July 2019.\n\nHowever, our research shows that as at today, President Muhammadu Buhari was still expecting an official communication from the National Assembly to enable him inaugurate his ministers designate and assign ministries to them, according to his Special Assistant on National Assembly Matters (Senate), Ita Enang.\n\nEnang, who addressed journalists on the 1st of August said, \u201cthe President upon receipt of the communication from the National Assembly will, on a date he will fix, notify the screened and cleared nominees and inaugurate them as appropriate.\u201d\n\nHe said the President did not assign portfolios to the ministerial nominees because the constitution did not ask him to do so.\n\nAlso, in response for more information, Mr Femi Adesina, the Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to President Buhari called it: \u201cfakest of all news\u201c.\n\nBuhari\u2019s Personal Assistant on New media, Bashir Ahmad, on his Twitter page, urged Nigerians to disregard any list of ministers\u2019 portfolios making the rounds on social media. According to him, the list will be officially announced by President Buhari during inauguration.\n\nAhmad on his Twitter page wrote: \u201cSo someone makes a list of Ministers-designate and assigns portfolios to them. The assigned list is now trending on WhatsApp as usual\u201d.\n\nEbere Agozie is a Senior Correspondent with the News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) with a staff strength of about 880, Joined in 2014 as a correspondent.
