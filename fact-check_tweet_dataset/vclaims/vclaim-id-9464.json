We\u2019ve asked the Department of Health for more information.\n\nThe report assesses many aspects of the UK economy in order to give an overall picture. This means that quoting small parts of the report does not tell the whole story. For instance, whilst they recognise the UK\u2019s low unemployment rate, they also recognise that growth is slow in 2017.\n\nOverall, the OECD considers UK economic performance to be \u201csolid\u201d up to the end of 2016.\n\nThe OECD says that the UK\u2019s healthcare efficiency is weak. The OECD measure this by comparing how efficiently UK healthcare works compared to the best performing countries. We\u2019ve asked the Department of Health for more information.\n\nFiscal sustainability looks at whether government spending can be maintained in the long run and it can continue to pay its debts.\n\nThe OECD report says: \u201cFiscal sustainability has also improved, with the budget deficit falling towards 3.0% of GDP and public debt stabilising at below 90% of GDP in 2016.\u201d\n\nThe budget deficit (the difference between the government\u2019s income and spending) has been falling since 2010/11. Public debt has risen significantly since the recession, but has recently stabilised just below 90%.\n\nThe report says that \u201cImportant steps have been taken to improve the educational outcomes and basic skills of disadvantaged students.\u201d\n\nHowever, it has a number of criticisms including that \u201clow basic skills in the United Kingdom prevail across all education levels, and the percentage of young adults with low basic skills is higher than in the OECD\u201d and it says higher child poverty could \u201cincrease the number of children whose disadvantaged background affects their educational chances\u201d.\n\nThe OECD does also say that \u201cjobs and earnings are good\u201d.\n\nThey also say that \u201clow-skilled workers in the United Kingdom have comparatively lower earnings than low-skilled workers in other G7 countries, and the effect of higher skills proficiency on wages is particularly important in the United Kingdom.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
