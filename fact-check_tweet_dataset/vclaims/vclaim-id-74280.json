The video in which paratroopers are making a bad exit from the aircraft is superimposed with the Indian national flag, while the other video where paratroopers make stunning jumps is superimposed with the Pakistan national flag.\n\nThe caption along with one such 53-second video says, \u201cUnbeatable my pak army my Allah save Pakistan and pak army ameen..!!\u201d\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be false. While the video showing paratroopers making a remarkable exit is from India, the other video is reportedly from Africa.\n\nWe also found several Indian Twitter handles reacting to the videos from Pakistan by interchanging the superimposed flags of India and Pakistan, and claiming that the clipping of poor-performing paratroopers is from Pakistan.\n\nThe archived versions of some of the claims posted by social media users in Pakistan can be seen here, here and here.\n\nWith the help of InVID and reverse image search, we found that the clip purportedly showing the exemplary skills of Pakistan paratroopers is actually of a group of Indian paratroopers jumping off a C-130J Super Hercules over eastern Ladakh.\n\nMany media houses, including India Today, had reported about this thrilling video of the Indian Army\u2019s skydiving exercise on July 17. The demonstration was part of defence minister Rajnath Singh\u2019s visit to a forward outpost in eastern Ladakh amid tensions between India and China.\n\nA public relations officer of the defence ministry had also uploaded the same footage through his official Twitter handle.\n\nAs to the other video in the viral posts, purportedly showing incompetent Indian paratroopers, a reverse image search with video key frames helped us find similar clips uploaded on multiple websites.\n\nAccording to The Aviationist, the video is from Flintlock 2019, an African multinational training exercise in the Sahel region.\n\nWe also found the same video on YouTube with the title, \u201cAfrican Jump Errors Exercise Flintlock 19, 2019.\u201d\n\nHence, the video showing a group of paratroopers taking impressive back-to-back jumps from an aircraft is of Indian paratroopers demonstrating their skydiving skills in eastern Ladakh. The other video is from an African multinational training exercise.", "lang": "en"}
