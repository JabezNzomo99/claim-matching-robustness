Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is misleading.\n\nThe viral post shared on Facebook by a user named Cheryl Robinson reads: \u201cA friend of mine checked the back of her Clorox wipes and, what do you know, the human coronavirus is listed among the things that these wipes kill. I checked our wipes and, sure enough, it is listed. So my take is, as I suspected, this is no \u201cNEW VIRUS\u201d as the news media wants us to believe.\u201d The post is accompanied by a picture of Clorox with the mention that Clorox kills Human Coronavirus. The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nWith the increasing cases of novel coronavirus patients, misinformation related to the same is also increasing. A Facebook post highlights Human Coronavirus on the label of Clorox disinfecting wipes and says there is no NEW VIRUS as coronavirus is mentioned in the label of Clorox since beforehand.\n\nWhen Vishvas News investigated we found on the website of World Health Organization (WHO) that \u201cthe current outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first reported from Wuhan, China, on 31 December 2019.\u201d This NEW strain of coronavirus \u2018Novel Coronavirus\u2019 was reported on December 31, 2019 was not known earlier.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a NEW strain that has not been previously identified in humans.\n\nAs per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s. The seven coronaviruses that can infect people are:\n\nMERS-CoV (the beta coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS)\n\nSARS-CoV (the beta coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS)\n\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus is a NEW strain in the coronavirus family.\n\nDocuments submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency show that Clorox wipes are able to list \u201cHuman Coronavirus\u201d on their labels because those products were tested against human coronavirus 229E which is a common human coronavirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains.\n\nVishvas News Spoke to Ms. Patricia of Consumer Case Department, Clorox over mail. She said that some of the Clorox products are effective against similar strains of the virus. The NEW coronavirus was not identified beforehand.\n\nDisclaimer: The #CoronavirusFacts database records fact-checks published since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. The pandemic and its consequences are constantly evolving and data that was accurate weeks or even days ago might have changed. Remember to check the date when the fact-check you are reading was published before sharing it.\n\nConclusion: The post claiming that the new coronavirus was known beforehand as Clorox label shows that it kills human coronavirus\u2019 is misleading. The novel coronavirus was first reported in December 31, 2019. The novel coronavirus was not known beforehand.", "lang": "en"}
