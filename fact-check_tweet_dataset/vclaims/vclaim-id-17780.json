(READ: Ateneo Junior High School probes bullying caught on video)\n\nThe post, published on Friday, December 21, includes the bully\u2019s alleged address that has been making the rounds on social media. Sonza asks in his post, \u201cDito po ba nakatira si kid bonsai? (Is this where kid bonsai lives?)\u201d\n\nFacts: The address that has been circulating on social media as the bully\u2019s belongs to a school, chapel, and home of a senior pastor and his family. (READ: Ateneo bully's alleged address? It belongs to pastor's family)\n\nThe family has been receiving food deliveries in the bully\u2019s name and is being made to pay for them. As of December 21, fast-food deliveries worth P7,000 had been sent to them.\n\nPending orders from the online shopping site Lazada worth P37,000 and P17,000 were also sent to the family\u2019s address. According to Jewel Taculod, the daughter of the senior pastor, these orders were not approved for delivery since calls for confirmation went unanswered.\n\nTaculod added that more people have been passing by their home, prompting them to post a piece of paper outside, stating that it is not the address of the bully from Ateneo.\n\nTaculod is asking the public to stop sharing her and her family\u2019s address because they are not connected with the former Ateneo student and because they feel unsafe. \u2013 Vernise L.
