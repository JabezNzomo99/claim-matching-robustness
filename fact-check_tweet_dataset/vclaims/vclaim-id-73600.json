We don\u2019t have any specific date as to when schools will reopen,\u201d she said.\n\nA viral photo circulating Ghanaian Whatsapp and social media purporting to be a press release from GES on the reopening of SHS students on 6th September, 2020 is false.\n\nThe GES PRO, Cassandra Twum-Ampofo who is alleged to have signed the press release has sent Dubawa a photo of the press release showing it is fake.\n\nWhile the GES does not as yet, have a specific date for the reopening of schools, it is certain it is neither 6th September, 2020 nor 8th September, 2020 as is falsely making the rounds.", "lang": "en"}
