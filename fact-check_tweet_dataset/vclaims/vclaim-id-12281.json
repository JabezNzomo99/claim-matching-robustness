This was supposedly to warn parents to keep tight watch over their children.\n\nThe post included a thumbnail from a \"video report\" supposedly sourced from a major local news organization about the incident, showing the photo of the helpless children spread on the floor of the warehouse.\n\nThe post has turned viral, with around 4,000 reactions, 2,000 comments, and 73,000 shares as of this writing. People whose comments have garnered the most reactions recounted tales of children being kidnapped and their organs being sold.\n\nThe same children in the photo were also captured in a video by the Youtube channel erbeeni, which has been documenting the Syrian revolution. (Warning: The video in the link contains graphic content.)\n\nThe said chemical attack has been considered by international media as among the worst chemical attacks in the world, with some estimating that up to 1,000kg of the deadly nerve agent sarin had been dropped on Ghouta, a known suburb of rebels, leaving around 1,000 women and children dead.\n\nAn earlier version of this hoax appeared in 2016, using the same photo. In that earlier version, 100 Malaysian dead children without organs were said to be found in a van in Thailand.\n\nThe Facebook page Serpiente has around 50,000 likes and it posts on a variety of topics, most of them about children\u2019s death and kidnapping. \u2013 Addie Pobre/ Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
