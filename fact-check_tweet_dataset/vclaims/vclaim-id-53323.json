The same video has been shared by multiple Facebook and Twitter users with the claim Chavhanke made in his tweet.\n\nThe claim made by Chavhanke is false. The video is from an election rally in Aurangabad which was held on 17 October where Owaisi broke into a dance step while getting off the stage, after addressing a crowd.\n\nOwaisi\u2019s step looked like the act of flying a kite, apparently making a reference to his party\u2019s symbol. However, Owaisi later said that he wasn\u2019t really dancing and somebody used a music audio to make it seem like he was dancing. \u201cI stay away from music,\u201d Owaisi had said.\n\nClearly, an unrelated video has been used by the TV channel to push a certain agenda. Earlier too, Sudarshan News has been caught spreading fake news on multiple occasions. Earlier this year, the channel had shared a video with the false claim that a Muslim mob carried out a procession, raising slogans against RSS.", "lang": "en"}
