It can\u2019t be guaranteed it was representative of that group, and in no way reflected the view of all Labour activists.\n\nThe survey is of a small grassroots group\n\nIt\u2019s first worth clarifying that Labour activists are not exactly the same thing as Labour members. There are multiple campaigns within the Labour party focused on different issues. Additionally, there are campaign groups external to the party that are focused on affecting the policies of the Labour party, but where membership of the Labour party is not a prerequisite.\n\nNot all of the Labour Party\u2019s roughly 500,000 members would be considered activists, and there are large campaign groups external to the party. For example, Momentum (another grassroots campaign group focused on the Labour party) claims to have 40,000 supporters. These groups also hold varied policy positions: for example there is both a Labour Leave group and a Remain Labour group, which are on different sides of the Brexit debate.\n\nThe 97% finding comes from a survey by one of those campaign groups: Remain Labour, a small grassroots group with around 2,000 likes on Facebook. Its two aims are (1) for the Labour Party to adopt a policy of supporting the UK remaining in the EU, and (2) for that policy to be put to general public either as a manifesto commitment in a general election, or through a referendum on the terms of Brexit.\n\nRemain Labour\u2019s survey was answered by just over 1,000 of its supporters, of whom 600 said they were Labour party members. In total, 992 respondents (97%) were in favour of a remain alliance and 33 (3%) were against.\n\nIn order to accurately represent the views of Labour activists, you would have to survey a representative spread of Labour\u2019s campaign networks, accurately reflecting the balance of political views, as well as of things like age and gender.\n\nRemain Labour\u2019s survey results were not \u201cweighted\u201d to make them representative of its own supporters, and the survey wasn\u2019t designed to canvass Labour\u2019s whole activist base.\n\nIt\u2019s also extremely unlikely that Remain Labour supporters are representative of Labour activists as a whole. Given that Remain Labour\u2019s objectives are focused on the UK remaining in the EU it\u2019s perhaps not surprising that the majority of the group\u2019s supporters are in favour of a policy position that is designed to maximise the chances of the UK remaining in the EU.", "lang": "en"}
