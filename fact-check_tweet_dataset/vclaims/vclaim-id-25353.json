However, these plant diseases do not pose a threat to humans, so eating bananas with this discoloration has no serious health risk. It is correct that there has been a 2015 report of a child feeling ill and being sent to hospital after eating such a banana, however the report also pointed out that \u201cthe fungus cannot cause any substantial illness but it can cause ill-feeling, which may be psychosomatic.\u201d The child recovered and was discharged from the hospital.\n\nIt is erroneous to suggest that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be transmitted to unsuspecting people through this method. HIV does not survive long outside of the human body, and according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:\n\n\u201cThough it is very rare, HIV can be spread by eating food that has been pre-chewed by someone with HIV. The contamination occurs when infected blood from a caregiver\u2019s mouth mixes with food while chewing. The only known cases are among infants.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
