Boosie debunked the claim on his Instagram.\n\nThe story shared on Facebook stated that Boosie, a rapper formerly known as Lil Boosie, recognized Zimmerman outside of a Miami Walmart and called Zimmerman out for his role in Martin\u2019s death, leading to a physical altercation in which both sustained injuries.\n\n\u201cBoosie is currently in custody and will appear before a judge for assault charges next week,\u201d reads part of the post. (RELATED: \u2018Book Of Yeezus\u2019 \u2014 Did Kanye West Publish A Bible That Replaces \u2018God\u2019 With His Name?)\n\nInstagram user My Mix Tapez first shared the story, according to the New York Post and Heavy.com. The image shared on Facebook features a screen grab of that account\u2019s post.\n\nHowever, the story appears to have no merit. No media outlets reported on the alleged physical altercation. If Zimmerman had gotten into a scuffle with Boosie, it would have been picked up by the media, as both are public figures to varying extents.\n\nBoosie, whose real name is Torrence Hatch, later posted a video on his official Instagram account denying that the altercation ever took place.\n\n\u201cService announcement from Boosie. I never seen George in my life but on TV. This is a lie. Leave me alone,\u201d Boosie said. \u201cI never seen George Zimmerman in my life. George don\u2019t know me. Talking about I did something to him in Walmart, that is a lie.\u201d\n\nZimmerman has made headlines a number of times since his 2013 acquittal of killing Martin. He filed a $100 million lawsuit in December 2019 against Florida prosecutors, Martin\u2019s family and others, alleging that a key witness in the trial was \u201can imposter,\u201d according to ABC News.\n\nAn attorney for Zimmerman did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
