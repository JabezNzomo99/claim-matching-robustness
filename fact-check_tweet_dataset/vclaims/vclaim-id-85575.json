But passing bills is not the same as bills signed into law.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2017-09-12T07:00:23Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85575", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/09/12/the-house-republican-claim-they-have-passed-more-bills-than-recent-first-year-presidencies/", "vclaim": "After all, just days after President Trump took office, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) laid out an aggressive 200-day agenda that would have resulted in Obamacare repeal, a tax overhaul, a big infrastructure package and funding a border wall all signed by the president before the August recess. \u201cIt\u2019s the president and his administration working hand and glove with the speaker and the [Senate] majority leader,\u201d one lawmaker said at the time.\n\nAnna McEntee, spokeswoman for Foxx, said the numbers were calculated by Quorum Analytics and provided to all Republican House members by McCarthy\u2019s office. The counting starts from the beginning of the year \u2014 before the president took the oath of office. (About 22 bills were passed in the House in January before Trump became president.)\n\nBut Tauberer offers a caveat. Counting pages, the House in 2009 tops the House this year, with 9,199 pages compared with 7,243 pages so far this year. Counting pages is an imperfect way of judging the \u201csubstance\u201d of a bill, just as simply counting bills is. Obviously, not all bills are created equal. Few would argue that the Affordable Care Act is equal to a bill renaming a U.S. federal building.\n\nIn terms of actual bills signed into law, the 115th Congress finds itself in fourth place, with 56 bills, out of the first year of the last five presidents. By contrast, 94 bills were signed into law at this point under George H.W. Bush in 1989, 82 bills signed under Bill Clinton in 1993, and 62 bills signed in 2009 under Barack Obama.\n\nTo use a baseball analogy, bills passed in the House are like hits and bills signed into law are like runs. The House Republicans are counting hits, not the runs that win the games. Hits are an interesting statistic, but they do not matter as much as the final score.\n\nIn other words, this is a carefully selected statistic to put the performance of the Republican House in the best possible light. Indeed, the House Republican effort appears designed to deflect blame, to the Senate, for the mediocre legislative showing. As Ryan mentioned in the CNN town hall, the House Republican conference has set up a website, didyouknow.gop, designed to highlight all of the legislation that passed the House and awaits action in the Senate.\n\n\u201cIt is useful to understand how the House has worked in that time,\u201d McCarthy spokesman Matt Sparks said in an email. \u201cThis is the body that WE control. Do you suggest we should simply discount the work our committees and members have done?\u201d\n\nTo be fair to the House GOP, the health-care bill that ran aground in the Senate was actually designed to comply with some fairly obscure Senate rules. So from their perspective, House lawmakers believe they did what was necessary to help smooth the way for final passage.\n\n\u201cJust looking at this objectively, not subjectively, the statement is wholly backed up by the facts,\u201d said Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong. \u201cWe are judged here by what we do or don\u2019t do. Thus, saying as a matter of fact what we have done is not only factual, it\u2019s necessary.\u201d\n\nWe can understand why our reader was confused. Compared with other recent Congresses in a first-year presidency, the 115th Congress has passed relatively few bills into law \u2014 and what has passed has not been especially notable. House leaders have certainly fallen short of the ambitions they outlined at the start of the year.\n\nYet the House has passed a lot of bills. That means a lot of players are on base, even if they have not scored yet. Perhaps that is something to be proud of, but in the end it won\u2019t mean much for the history books.", "lang": "en"}
