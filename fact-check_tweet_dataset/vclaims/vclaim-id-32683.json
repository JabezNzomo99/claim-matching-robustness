The last quarter of the 2019/20 financial year only ends on 31 March 2020, almost two full months beyond when the claim was made, meaning that a credible comparison of year-on-year crime figures will only be possible at some point after 1 April 2020;\n\u2022 The police statement claims that 73 299 crimes were reported between 1 April 2019 and 31 December 2019. But a calculation of the quarterly figures presented for 2019/20 adds up to 72 969 reported crimes, which is a difference of 330;\n\u2022 While 2018/19 saw a marked spike in reported crime (to over 100 000, compared to just over 93 000 reported crimes for 2017/18), the five-year average for reported crime seems to be about 93 500 reported crimes per year, and 2019/20 appears to be on track to trend in line with the average of the previous five years (from 2014/15 to 2018/19);\n\u2022 Since Operation Kalahari Desert started on 1 April 2019, the number of reported crimes have actually shown a quarter-on-quarter increase \u2013 23 693 in Q1, 24 013 in Q2 and 25 263 in Q3 \u2013 and not a decrease. In short, reported crimes have actually increased on a quarterly basis while Operation Kalahari Desert was running.\n\nGiven these issues and the fact that full-year reported crime figures for 2019/20 will only be available after 1 April 2020, inspector-general Ndeitunga\u2019s claim of a reduction in reported crime is questionable and rated as unproven.\n\nNamibia Fact Check will endeavour to follow-up on this story once updated crime figures are available.", "lang": "en"}
