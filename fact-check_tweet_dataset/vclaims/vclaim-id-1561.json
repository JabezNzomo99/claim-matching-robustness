He said, and I quote again, \u2018Let it go.\u2019 \u201d Trump supported the auto bailout in 2008. The \u201clet it go\u201d quote is from 2015, and taken out of context.\n\nClinton previously has highlighted Trump\u2019s 2015 comments, which showed Trump backing away from his previous support of the government\u2019s auto rescue efforts. He said last year that \u201cyou could have let it go bankrupt\u201d but that the auto industry \u201cwould have ended up ultimately in the same place\u201d whether it had received government assistance or not.\n\nIn a Sept. 5 speech in Cleveland, Clinton correctly said Trump had made the \u201clet it go\u201d comment \u201clast year.\u201d As we\u2019ve written, she wrongly implied that same day in Illinois that Trump had said he \u201cdidn\u2019t care\u201d about the auto industry or its workers. But Clinton\u2019s latest comment in Detroit moves her talking point from a wrong implication to an outright falsehood.\n\nHere\u2019s Clinton\u2019s comment on Oct. 10 at a rally at Wayne State University in Detroit:\n\nAs a presidential candidate, Trump has been criticized for either flip-flopping on his position or being inconsistent, but \u201cback in the Great Recession,\u201d as Clinton says, at the time the auto bailout was being considered by the federal government, Trump made several comments in support of government intervention.\n\nOn Dec. 10, 2008, Trump told CNBC: \u201cIt would seem to be that they should Chapter it and the country should put up the financing.\u201d\n\nCNBC reported that Trump said, \u201cYou have to save the car industry in this country.\u201d\n\nThat day, the House passed a rescue plan to provide $14 billion in government loans to the auto industry, with the contingency that the companies agree to government oversight through a to-be-appointed \u201ccar czar.\u201d The following day, the Senate voted down the plan, which had been backed by both then-President George W. Bush and President-elect Barack Obama. Hillary Clinton, then a senator, voted for it.\n\nGeneral Motors and Chrysler were in a particularly shaky financial state in the midst of the 2007-2009 Great Recession. The New York Times reported in December 2008: \u201cG.M., Chrysler and industry experts have said that the two companies would likely not survive until the end of this month without government aid, and the companies had already agreed to carry out sweeping reorganization plans in exchange for the help.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2008, Trump again voiced support for government help for the automakers, telling Fox Business\u2019 Neil Cavuto: \u201cI think the government should stand behind [the Big Three automakers] 100 percent. You cannot lose the auto companies.\u201d\n\nCavuto pressed him on whether the auto bailout should happen. Trump said: \u201cThere are so many ways that it can be saved. \u2026 If they do a Chapter 11 \u2014 and over the years, I\u2019ve put companies into a Chapter 11. You negotiate from Chapter 11.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s that exchange with Cavuto, edited for length:\n\nCavuto, Dec. 17, 2008: But would you bail them out? Trump: There are so many ways that it can be saved. Trump: If they do a Chapter 11 \u2014 and over the years, I\u2019ve put companies into a Chapter 11. You negotiate from Chapter 11. Cavuto: The other guys say they would be different because bankruptcy for them is not an option, that it would be a scarlet letter and a stigma. Trump: Well, I absolutely don\u2019t, because I\u2019d rather buy a car than fly in an airline. When United Airline is bankrupt, when Delta Airlines goes bankrupt, and I\u2019m supposed to be flying, I\u2019d rather have a car than fly on an airline if that\u2019s the case. But they didn\u2019t lose any business. Now, as long as they know that the company\u2019s going to be around it\u2019s not going to hurt them one bit. In fact, people would like it. But you have to make a better deal with the unions, despite [United Automobile Workers President Ron] Gettelfinger\u2019s brilliant salesmanship \u2014 it\u2019s brilliant \u2014 despite that, you have to make a much better deal with the unions. And you have to make a better deal with everybody, I mean, everything. \u2026 Cavuto: Do you think that we can afford to do without one of the Big Three? Trump: No. I think you should have the Big Three. I think, frankly, they should do dip financing. I think the government should stand behind them 100 percent. You cannot lose the auto companies. They\u2019re great. They make wonderful products. Maybe they\u2019re making too much. Maybe they\u2019re not making too much. Trump: The government is going to give them 35 billion, give them 50 billion in good financing, get a good, strong czar. I think the idea of a czar is great. I think Jack Welch would be, by the way, a great czar. But you know, these are minor details. But there are\u2026 Cavuto: You wouldn\u2019t want to do it? Trump: No, I don\u2019t want to do it. But \u2014 but Jack Welch would be a great czar. He would really be a great czar. We need a tough, smart, very corporate kind of a guy, and man, would he be good. And there\u2019d be others. I could name others also.\n\nTwo days later, President Bush announced that he was authorizing the use of government funds to help the auto industry, despite Congress\u2019 inability to pass legislation. GM received $13.4 billion and Chrysler $4 billion that month from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as the Wall Street bailout program.\n\nUnder President Obama, GM and Chrysler did declare bankruptcy and restructured with billions more in government loans and backing. The total financing disbursed was nearly $80 billion, with all but $9.3 billion eventually being recovered by the government, according to the Treasury Department.\n\nTrump\u2019s position has varied over the years. In November 2012, Trump criticized Obama in a tweet for being a \u201cterrible negotiator\u201d on the bailout, falsely claiming that Chrysler was going to send all Jeep production to China.\n\nAnd his \u201clet it go\u201d comment came last year in a press conference in Michigan. Trump was asked whether he would have done what President Obama did in Detroit. Here\u2019s the response (see the 2:54 mark).\n\nThat comment shows Trump waffling on whether he would have supported the auto bailout or not. But at the time the deal was being debated in Congress, in late 2008, Trump said, \u201cI think the government should stand behind [the Big Three automakers] 100 percent.\u201d\n\nClinton is wrong to say he didn\u2019t support a government-backed rescue during the Great Recession.", "lang": "en"}
