It was incorporated as a 501(c)(6) organization in 1979, and in 2005, it formed the San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association Scholarship Fund for Latino students.\n\nThe group lists the following goals under its mission statement:\n\u2022 Increase the overall number of Latinos in the legal profession.\n\u2022 Encourage and support Latino and Latina judicial candidates to apply to the bench\n\u2022 Advocate for the promotion and retention of Latino and Latina attorneys and judicial officers.\n\u2022 Improve the professional skills of our members through our certified MCLE programs.\n\u2022 Provide for the professional and social interaction among our members and other organized bar associations.\n\u2022 Improve the delivery and access of legal services to the county\u2019s Spanish speaking community.\n\u2022 Provide role models and mentoring to Latino youth through direct interaction with students and school districts.\n\u2022 Strongly advocate positions on judicial, economic and social issues to political leaders and state and local bar associations that impact the Latino community.\n\nThe San Diego group is one of more than a dozen affiliates of the California La Raza Lawyers Association, and both are affiliated with the Hispanic National Bar Association.\n\nCuriel, on a 2011 judicial questionnaire to become a federal judge, listed the Hispanic National Bar Association and La Raza Lawyers of San Diego among the groups that he belongs to.\n\nBut some Trump supporters have confused the San Diego legal group with the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization that supports \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform,\u201d including a path to U.S. citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\n\nOsuna, the SDLRLA president, said the two groups are separate.\n\n\u201cThe only connection we have is that we provide services to the Latino community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not affiliated in any other way.\u201d\n\nThe lawyers association, on its website, does list the National Council of La Raza as a resource for the Latino community. However, Osuna said that organizations listed there simply provide services not available through the San Diego group.\n\nWhen Fox News\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly asked Trump if he regretted making an issue of Curiel\u2019s Mexican heritage, Trump said that he brought it up because he was asked.\n\nO\u2019Reilly, June 6: OK. So wouldn\u2019t it have been better then if you didn\u2019t bring up the Mexican thing at all and just said what you said here tonight because, look, you\u2019re being sued, I understand we did analysis of your lawsuit\u2019s history and you win most of your lawsuits. You are a big guy. Guys are going to come after you. You know that. So wouldn\u2019t it have been better if you just said, look, I don\u2019t think I have been treated fairly, here\u2019s what we have, and let the Mexican thing alone? Trump: Well, the question was asked to me, you know, I mean, all these times, every time I go. I want to talk about how lousy the economy is. I want to talk about how badly we are doing against ISIS. How badly we are doing on the border. But every time I go onto a show all they want to talk about is Trump University.\n\nBut Trump has been suggesting since at least February that Curiel\u2019s background might make him less than impartial. At a campaign rally in Arkansas, Trump said:\n\nThe next day, in an interview with \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d anchor Chris Wallace, Trump suggested that Curiel \u201chas been extremely hostile\u201d to him because of Trump\u2019s position on border security.\n\nTrump brought it up more recently in a campaign speech in San Diego on May 27. He called Curiel \u201ca hater of Donald Trump\u201d and said that he \u201chappens to be, we believe, Mexican, which is great.\u201d\n\nNow, Trump, says that his comments about Curiel were \u201cmisconstrued.\u201d In a written statement, Trump said:\n\nTrump is free to question whether he is receiving a fair trial. But he now says that he does not \u201cfeel that one\u2019s heritage makes them incapable of being impartial\u201d when the record shows otherwise.\n\nHe not only questioned Curiel\u2019s impartiality because of his \u201cMexican heritage,\u201d but he also told Dickerson on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that a Muslim judge may not be impartial, either, given Trump\u2019s call to ban Muslims from entering the U.S.\n\nTrump says in his statement that he will not comment any further on the Trump University lawsuit.", "lang": "en"}
