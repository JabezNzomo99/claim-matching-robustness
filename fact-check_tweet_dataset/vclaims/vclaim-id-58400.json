Included in the bill are \u201ceconomic impact payments\u201d that amount to $1,200 payments for single adults that have an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less and $2,400 payments for married couples that earn $150,000 or less, as well as $500 payments for qualifying dependents under the age of 17, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe video, which originated on TikTok but has also surfaced on Facebook and Instagram, claims recipients will have to pay the federal government back when they file their 2020 tax returns. \u201cSo that means next year, you\u2019re automatically going to owe $1,200 come tax season,\u201d the man in the video says. \u201cGuys, stay safe out there. Media and public is not telling you exactly what this bill is.\u201d\n\nThe payments are refundable advance tax credits but, according to the IRS and the Tax Foundation, that does not mean they must be paid back. It is similar to the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit in that it doesn\u2019t need to be repaid, per CNBC. (RELATED: No, Coronavirus Stimulus Payments Are Not Tied To The 2020 Census)\n\n\u201cThe Payment is not includible in your gross income,\u201d the IRS states on its website. \u201cTherefore, you will not include the Payment in your taxable income on your Federal income tax return or pay income tax on your Payment. It will not reduce your refund or increase the amount you owe when you file your 2020 Federal income tax return.\u201d\n\nNor will people who receive stimulus payments based on their 2018 or 2019 tax returns have to pay anything back if their earnings in 2020 exceed the threshold limits, according to the Tax Foundation.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing to understand is that the rebate is a bonus amount,\u201d Chye-Ching Huang, senior director of economic policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told Snopes. \u201cThe stimulus payment won\u2019t reduce tax refunds for 2020 (when people file in 2021) below what they would have been otherwise.\u201d\n\nAn IRS spokesperson confirmed to the Daily Caller that people who receive the stimulus payments do not have to pay them back.", "lang": "en"}
