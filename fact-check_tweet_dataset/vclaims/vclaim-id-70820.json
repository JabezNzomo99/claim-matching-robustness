Nathan Deal recently told one group.\n\nDeal said the changes in criminal sentencing adopted in 2012 have helped Georgia\u2019s bottom line by about $20 million. A PolitiFact Georgia reader saw an article that outlined the claim and asked us to check it out. We wanted to know whether the governor\u2019s numbers were on target. Or should he be sentenced for faulty math?\n\nThe governor made the comments at a reception of graduates of the University of Georgia School of Public Affairs in Atlanta. Deal told the group he was surprised by the speed and size of the savings, Morris News Service reported.\n\n\"I was amazed at the dollar figures ... and amazed at the time frame,\" said Deal, a Republican.\n\nDeal spokesman Brian Robinson said that in 2011 the state paid counties more than $23 million to house state inmates in county jails, some of which were overcrowded.\n\n\"In 2013, the payments were slightly under $3.2 million \u2014 approximately $20 million less!\" Robinson wrote in one email.\n\nIn 2012, Deal, a former prosecutor, said Georgia needed more cost-effective criminal justice approaches that didn't compromise public safety. State lawmakers crafted legislation to establish alternatives to incarceration for low-level, nonviolent drug and property offenders. At the time, 60 percent of Georgia\u2019s inmates were locked up for drug and property crimes, according to a state study.\n\nMany elected officials across the country have employed a similar approach to balance their budgets in the post-recession world. In Georgia, the changes included reduced sentences for relatively minor crimes such as writing bad checks and burglary, and the state is diverting addicts to community supervision and treatment through so-called accountability courts instead of sending them through the normal criminal system and on to prison.\n\nState officials projected the package would save taxpayers $264 million in prison spending over the next five years.\n\nThe big change has been the state is spending less money on housing inmates in county jails because of a lack of space in Georgia prisons. Those inmates assigned to the county lockups typically work on roadway or construction projects for that county.\n\nGeorgia spends $20-$22 per day for each inmate in a county jail, records show.\n\nDeal\u2019s proposed budget offers statistics that support his claim. In Fiscal Year 2012 -- which began July 1, 2011, and ended June 30, 2012 -- the state\u2019s subsidy to various counties to house its inmates was slightly more than $25 million. In Deal\u2019s proposed budget, Georgia\u2019s Department of Corrections projected it would pay about $4.6 million to counties. Deal recommended about $1.6 million.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s Department of Corrections sent us several spreadsheets that also backed up the governor\u2019s claim. In 2011, Deal\u2019s first year in office, Georgia spent about $26.5 million to house state inmates in county jails. In 2013, the state paid counties nearly $3.8 million. That\u2019s a $22.7 million difference.\n\nStatistics show there are fewer Georgia prisoners in state and county lockups.\n\nIn March 2011, the average daily population in county jails awaiting a trip to state prison was nearly 5,000, Corrections Department figures show. Last week, there were just 611 inmates waiting to be transferred, the Corrections Department spreadsheets show. The average number of inmates sitting in state prison decreased by about 1,000 a day between 2011 and 2013. Another state report showed the year-round number of inmates had declined in the past two years from 40,648 to 35,111.\n\nTo sum up, Deal said Georgia has saved $20 million through changes in sentencing. State data show there has been a $20 million decrease in the amount of money spent housing state inmates in county jails.", "lang": "en"}
