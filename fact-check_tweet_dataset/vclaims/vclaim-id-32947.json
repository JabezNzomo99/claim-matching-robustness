The claim the videos are being shared with are false; the Mumbai Police has not issued any alert regarding a terror attack. Insofar as the videos are concerned, they are from a routine mock drill which happens several times in a year. Inspector General of Police, Cyber, Brijesh Singh, took to Twitter to clarify that no such advisory has been issued by Mumbai Police. This tweet was issued in connection with another video which has gone viral with the same claim. 2015 Video From Patna Shared as Cops Beating Muslims in Kashmir\n\nUpon carefully looking at one of the videos, we saw a hoarding of \u2018Jagruti Nagar.\u2019 Consequently, we searched on YouTube using keywords \u2018Mumbai high alert Jagruti Nagar.\u2019 The hoarding of Jagruti Nagar is highlighted in red. The YouTube key word search led us to several videos which were same as the ones we had received but with a slightly different claim: \u2018Mumbai High Alert, NSG Commando Full Security in Metro Station at Asalfa, Sakinaka & Jagruti nagar.\u2019 YouTube users, on one such video, had posted comments that suggested that it was a drill. Users on one of the videos had commented that it was a drill Sources who were aware of the operation told The Quint on condition of anonymity that it was a \u201croutine mock drill\u201d and happens several times a year at various locations. They conducted this drill in collaboration with National Security Guard (NSG) and the Mumbai Police. When such drills are conducted, people of the area are kept in confidence, the source added. Akhilesh Held for Protest Over Article 370? No, It\u2019s an Old Video\n\nSAME CLAIM VIRAL WITH DIFFERENT VIDEO The Quint had earlier debunked the same claim but with a different video. In the video clip, the man can be heard saying, \u201cIntelligence agencies have hinted that after revoking 370 from Jammu and Kashmir Pakistan army, Pakistan intelligence agency ISI is planning to attack Indian cities.\u201d The Quint got in touch with Brigadier Hemant Mahajan, the man is in the video. He told us that the video is from a soundbite that he had given to a Marathi news channel. Mahajan is an ex-Army officer who has served in counter insurgency operations in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and Northeast.", "lang": "en"}
