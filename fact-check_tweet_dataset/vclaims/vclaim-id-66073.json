Sean Duffy (R-WI) blamed the U.S. Senate\u2019s filibuster rule for preventing Trump\u2019s agenda from being passed into law.\n\n\"Get rid of the filibuster rule\u2019\u2019 Duffy said July 17, 2017 on Fox News Channel\u2019s \"Fox & Friends\" show. \"(Then) you only need 51 votes.\"\n\nThen, the congressman went further:\n\n\"We\u2019ve won a thousand seats since Obamacare,\" he said. \"The American people want us to accomplish this agenda, and we\u2019re not getting it done because of stupid Senate rules.\"\n\nDuffy also made the 1,000-seat assertion during an appearance on \"Varney & Co.\" the same day on the Fox Business Network.\n\n\"We\u2019ve won a historical election,\" Duffy said. \"We have a thousand seats we\u2019ve won since Obamacare.\"\n\nHas the GOP really picked up 1,000 seats since the Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010?\n\nLet\u2019s start at the state level, where most of the positions in question lie.\n\nAccording to Ballotpedia: The Encyclopedia of American Politics, the Republican Party held more seats in 82 of 99 state legislative chambers (82.3 percent) in January 2017 than it did in January 2009.\n\n\"During President Barack Obama's two terms in office, Democrats experienced a net loss of 968 state legislative seats, the largest net loss of state legislative seats in this category since World War II. The second-largest loss occurred following Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s two terms in office, when Republicans were handed a net loss of 843 state legislative seats.\"\n\nAn accompanying chart lists the five largest losses in state legislative seats for Democrats during Obama\u2019s two terms: Arkansas state Senate (18 seats), West Virginia state Senate (16 seats lost), Arkansas House of Representatives (46 seats), West Virginia House of Representatives (43 seats) and Oklahoma state Senate (16 seats.)\n\nThere were other losses.\n\nAccording to an article on FoxNews.com, \"Democratic U.S. Senate seats fell from 55 to 46. Their share of the House plummeted from 256 seats to 194. \u2026 Democratic governerships also became a rarity during this eight-year period, slipping from 28 to 16.\"\n\nAfter the election of Obama, there was much talk of a new era -- that a coalition of young, minority and female voters would usher in gains for the Democrats for decades.\n\nThat did not happen.\n\n\"The defeats have all but wiped out a generation of young Democrats, leaving the party with limited power in statehouses and a thin bench to challenge an ascendant GOP majority eager to undo many of the president\u2019s policies,\" according to a Dec. 24, 2016 Associated Press article.\n\n\"After this year\u2019s elections, Democrats hold the governor\u2019s office and both legislative chambers in just five coastal states: Oregon, California, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware,\" the article said. \"Republicans have the trifecta in 25, giving them control of a broad swath of the middle of the country.\"\n\nDuffy\u2019s communications director, Mark Bednar, pointed us to an article in the January/February 2017 edition of Politico magazine titled \"Democrats in the Wilderness,\" which maintains Democrats are facing a crisis in coming years.\n\nThe article, written by Edward-Isaac Dovere, says the party\u2019s situation is \"the result of years of complacency, ignoring the withering of the grass roots and the state parties, sitting by as Republicans racked up local win after local win.\"\n\nMatt Bennett, a co-founder and vice president of public affairs of the Third Way, an organization that describes itself as \"a strategy center for progressives,\" confirmed the figure.\n\n\"Yes, it\u2019s true at the state legislative level,\" he said. \"Dems have lost about 1,000 seats.\"\n\nWhile Duffy did not directly blame Obamacare for the loss of every seat, he presented it as the primary reason for the Republican gains and Democrat declines. But every race is different, and many other factors come into play -- from newly drawn districts to the performance by individual candidates and a host of issues.\n\nSo, he oversteps a bit in framing it entirely around Obamacare.\n\nThere are many reasons for the decline of Democrats beyond dissatisfaction with Obamacare, including frustration over Washington gridlock, voters\u2019 fears over budget deficits, national security, immigration, tax reform, the global economy, wages and jobs. Therefore, Obamacare is not the sole reason for the GOP seat gains, but one of many. But the \"thousand seats\" figure Duffy cites is accurate.", "lang": "en"}
