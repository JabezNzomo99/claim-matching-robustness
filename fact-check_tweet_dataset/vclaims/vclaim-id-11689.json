While the pope was referring to drug traffickers in the statement he was quoted saying, Reyes was speaking about drug addicts.\n\nThe false story was published two days after the pope made the statement at the conference, which was called \"Drugs and Addictions: An obstacle to integral human development.\"\n\nUpdatedtayo.info's story could have reached over 1.5 million people, with social media traffic to the story largely coming from the pages Angat Pilipino, Filipino Vlog, and DUTERTE MARCOS SUPPORTERS.\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
