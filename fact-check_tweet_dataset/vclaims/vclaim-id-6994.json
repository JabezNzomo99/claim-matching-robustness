But there is no evidence of such collusion.\n\nThe headline, in all caps, promises a shocking tale: \u201cJEFF SESSIONS CAUGHT COLLUDING WITH OBAMA.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s also fictitious, as some suspected on Facebook, where users flagged the story as potentially false.\n\nThat persistent claim, published May 10 on conservativestories.com, was previously published on the same website in April and has been spread across social media since March, including through multiple YouTube videos.\n\nThe body of the story borrows largely from a March 2018 report on The Gateway Pundit website, which focused on Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 decision to recuse himself from the investigation into possible coordination between members of the Russian government and members of President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.\n\nThe Gateway Pundit accurately quoted Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett saying that Sessions opted to recuse himself after consulting with \u201choldovers\u201d from President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. (A holdover is a term used to describe an administration official who stays on staff even after a new president takes office.)\n\nAt a March 2, 2017, news conference announcing his recusal, Sessions said he \u201cmet with senior officials shortly after arriving\u201d at the Department of Justice about the matter.\n\n\u201cMy staff recommended recusal,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cThey said that since I had involvement with the campaign, I should not be involved in any campaign investigation.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI have studied the rules and considered their comments and evaluation. I believe those recommendations are right and just. Therefore I have recused myself in the matters that deal with the Trump campaign.\u201d\n\nA statement Sessions issued the same day also said he conferred with \u201crelevant senior career Department officials,\u201d but did not specify who they were. On Fox News, Jarrett did not name \u201cObama\u2019s holdovers.\u201d\n\nEven if those officials were Obama holdovers, there is no evidence that Sessions was \u201ccolluding\u201d with the former president \u2014 despite the conservativestories.com headline, which isn\u2019t supported by its own story.\n\nSessions was the first sitting U.S. senator to endorse Trump in 2016, and he served as a foreign policy adviser for the campaign. On the day he recused himself from the Russia probe, Sessions confirmed a Washington Post report that he met twice with the Russian ambassador to the United States during the campaign \u2014 meetings he did not disclose during his confirmation hearing.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cAttorney General Sessions Statement on Recusal.\u201d Press release.
