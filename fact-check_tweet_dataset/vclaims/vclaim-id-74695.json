It takes a bit of college-boy math.\n\nAbout three-quarters of the state\u2019s higher education budget comes from the general revenue fund. The rest of the money mostly comes from the 1 cent education sales tax and other state funds. (The federal government also chips in some money \u2014 this year it was a little under $3.7 million, or 0.2 percent, of the total higher education budget.)\n\nThe average annual inflation rate between 2001 and 2015, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, was 1.918 percent for Missouri and Illinois. Inflation rates vary across the country, and the Federal Reserve calculates the inflation rate by region rather than by state.\n\nIn fiscal year 2002, higher education was allotted $1,153,954,522. After adjusting for inflation \u2014 which compounds year over year \u2014 that\u2019s equivalent to $1,505,546,464 today.\n\nIn the most recent budget, for fiscal year 2016, is set for higher education in Missouri. That\u2019s a 15.9 percent decrease, short of what Koster said.\n\nIf you only look at dollars, though, you miss the effect of Missouri\u2019s surging college enrollment, Koster spokesman Andrew Whalen told PolitiFact Missouri.\n\nIn fall of 2001, Missouri\u2019s public colleges and universities enrolled . By 2014, enrollment had risen to 184,305 students.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say exactly how much money is spent on each student across the state because each school receives money directly from the General Assembly. That money is counted in the appropriations for the Department of Higher Education \u2014 but since the department doesn\u2019t dictate how that money is used, the department doesn\u2019t track how much of it each institution spends, spokeswoman Liz Coleman said.\n\nBut we can still get a rough per-student funding estimate by dividing the department\u2019s budget by the number of full-time-equivalent students. Here\u2019s the math:\n\nIn 2001, Missouri spent $10,480.21 per student, adjusting for inflation. Assuming this year\u2019s enrollment totals track near 2014\u2019s (and there\u2019s suggesting it\u2019s not too far off), that would mean the state now spends closer to $6,873 per student.\n\nThere are a few caveats here:\n\u2022 Students aren\u2019t directly impacted by every dollar spent by the Department of Higher Education. For instance, the department also operates the Missouri State Historical Society, and some money also goes towards operating expenses for the department itself.\n\u2022 The department funds scholarships, some of which go to students at private schools.\n\u2022 And schools also draw funding from outside the appropriations process, from sources such as tuition, donations and endowments.\n\nSo, the exact amount of money spent on each college student is a squishy number. But we can still confidently track how much the state contributes \u2014 which, in the context of raising the tobacco tax, is the essence of Koster\u2019s statement.\n\nKoster said that since 2001, higher education funding has been cut or eroded by 35 percent to 40 percent. The legislature hasn\u2019t technically cut higher education funding over this time; nominally, the state has actually spent $100 million more on it.\n\nBut that\u2019s not enough to keep pace with inflation. And when you factor in skyrocketing enrollment numbers, the amount of money the General Assembly has budgeted to spend on a per student basis has indeed \"eroded\" by about as much as Koster says it has.\n\nEven though Koster\u2019s statement is pretty close, it needs additional information and clarification.
