The claim is false and the image was altered.\n\nPosts such as this and this have shared a photo which claims to show Senator Franklin Drilon asleep at a key game between University of the Philippines (UP) and Ateneo de Manila University.\n\nThe games drew a lot of attention on social networks and in local media as it was the UP men\u2019s first time in the Philippine college basketball league finals in 32 years.\n\nHere is a screenshot of one of the misleading posts:\n\nThe caption, when translated to English, says: \u201cHow can UP Maroons not lose to ATENEO when this bringer of bad luck watched the game and slept through all the excitement bwahaha\u201d.\n\nThe UP team, which is known as the UP Maroons, lost to Ateneo.\n\nComments on the post indicated that some people believed the image of Drilon was genuine.\n\nOne comment, when translated to English, says: \u201cIs he standing or sleeping? He can sleep in whichever position? Appalling\u201d.\n\nAnother comment says in Tagalog: \u201cHe is really bullheaded. He doesn\u2019t care, anywhere is fair game for him when it comes to sleeping. He is a senator who has no manners!\u201d\n\nA reverse image search traced the photo of Drilon back to a tweet from local broadcaster ABS-CBN showing him at the game.\n\nHere is a screenshot of that image:\n\nABS-CBN tweeted the photo on December 1, the day of the first finals game between UP and Ateneo.\n\nThe altered version used in the Facebook posts appeared on December 7.\n\nThe images are identical, apart from Drilon\u2019s head. Key details like a man holding a mobile phone to the left of the senator and a laughing woman behind him are the same in both images.\n\nA reverse image search of Drilon sleeping traced the photograph back to a series of 2017 Twitter posts with the hashtag #FireDrilon.\n\nHere is a screengrab of one of the tweets:\n\nThe hashtag emerged after Drilon was caught sleeping during a Senate hearing on August 23, 2017.\n\nThis is a video of the hearing and Drilon can be seen asleep at 1:04:18 in the clip.\n\nDrilon is a member of the opposition Liberal Party and a critic of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nThe post has been shared hundreds of times by Facebook groups which support Duterte.", "lang": "en"}
