The claims are false; Omar has never tweeted any such statement; no such phrase was included in her 2017 interview with TIME magazine; the congresswoman has said the meme is false.\n\nThe meme features an image of Omar, which first appeared on the cover of TIME in 2017 and is published online here alongside the interview she gave at the time.\n\nThis July 16, 2019 Facebook post, shared hundreds of times, contains the meme which has text superimposed on the image saying:\n\n\u201cHer Own Twitter words. 'I am America\u2019s hope and the president\u2019s nightmare'. 'I think all white men should be put in chains as slaves because they will never submit to Islam': Ilhan Omar. Sen. Ilhan Omar Let that sink in\u2026.\u201d\n\nOmar was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives \u2013 also known as Congress \u2013 in 2018. She does not sit in the US Senate.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe meme has been shared elsewhere online, for example here on Twitter.\n\nThe claim is false; there is no record of Omar tweeting any such comment, and the phrase was not included in her 2017 interview with TIME magazine, a video of which can be seen here.\n\nThere is no record on Omar\u2019s Twitter account of her tweeting the phrase: \"I think all white men should be put in chains as slaves because they will never submit to Islam\".\n\nHere is a search result from her Twitter account using those keywords which returned no results. Below is a screenshot of the search:\n\nThe first section of the quote in the misleading posts has been taken from Omar\u2019s interview with Trevor Noah on The Daily Show in July 2017.\n\nThe episode was published on the Comedy Central website here on July 13, 2017.\n\nDuring the interview, at the 0:47 mark in the video, Noah says: \u201cYou are someone who is all too familiar with being a refugee, you're from Somalia, you're also a Muslim person, you're also a woman. You are everything that President Trump seems to be against, and you are in government. What's the plan?\"\n\nAt the 1:14 minute mark Omar replies: \u201cI am America\u2019s hope and the president\u2019s nightmare\u201d. The video is embedded below:\n\nWhile addressing supporters in Minnesota July 19, 2019, Omar clarified this comment, as seen in this video published to Facebook by US media organisation NowThis and viewed more than 250,000 times.\n\nAt the 0:28 mark in the video, Omar says: \"When I said I was the hope of the United States it\u2019s because I embody what that hope should look like. And when I said I was the president\u2019s nightmare\u2026 well, you\u2019re watching it now. Because his nightmare is seeing a Somali refugee rise to Congress.\"\n\nOmar posted these screenshots of misleading posts containing the meme on her verified Twitter account on 19 November, 2018, with the caption: \u201cWho said facts mattered?\u201d.\n\nThat tweet is embedded below:", "lang": "en"}
