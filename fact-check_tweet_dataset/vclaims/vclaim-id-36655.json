It has been retweeted more than 62,000 times.\n\nThe image, which has superimposed red arrows pointing to the white spots on the meat, was posted alongside the following claim: \u201cDear buyer of Meat / If you see these white bubbles, they are bags containing deadly and dangerous TB virus. Help on spreading the word.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe same photo was posted alongside a similar claim on Facebook here.\n\nHowever, the claim is misleading; experts say that proper preparation of meat eliminates the risk of TB infections and that the strain of bacteria that cause TB in animals is most commonly transmitted to people through the consumption of dairy products that have not been heat-treated.\n\n\u201cProperly cooked meat doesn\u2019t pose a risk for TB infection,\u201d Thomas Dale Hiatt, a technical officer for tuberculosis at the World Health Organization (WHO), told AFP in an email on January 7, 2020.\n\n\"That should be the approach people should take to keep them safe.\u201d\n\nTwo species of bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. bovis, cause TB in humans, according to this report by the WHO and several other international health groups.\n\n\u201cThe main route of transmission of M. bovis to people is indirect,\u201d the report notes. \u201cIt is most commonly transmitted through the consumption of contaminated milk and other dairy products that have not been heat-treated. Less commonly, it can be transmitted through the consumption of raw or improperly cooked contaminated meat.\u201d\n\nThe photo featured in the misleading posts has previously circulated online in a report about rotten meat, not TB. A reverse image search found a version of the photo posted without the red arrows here on the Arabic-language website El Balad News.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report:\n\nThe headline of the report reads: \u201cRotten meat photos scares women on Facebook\u201d.\n\nPart of the report, when translated to English, cites a veterinarian who said that the white spots seen on the meat are in fact \u201cPinworm (Enterobius vermicularis) egg bags.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
