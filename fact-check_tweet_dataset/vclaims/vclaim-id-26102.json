The contract was awarded in January 2014, and the coaches were delivered starting late 2015.\n\nThe trains have yet to be used to date. The Department of Transportation (DOTr) \u2013 the successor of DOTC \u2013 discovered in early 2017 that each train weighed 49.7 tons, raising issues of it being too heavy for the rails.\n\nIn early 2018, the DOTr tapped Germany-based consultancy firm TUV Rheinland to perform an audit on the 48 train coaches. In July, TUV Rheinland's audit indicated that the trains \"can be \u201cready for use\u201d with some repairs and technical adjustments.\n\nHowever, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade said the trains would not be deployed just yet despite the audit though he also said he is aiming for a \"win-win\" scenario.\n\nAs of August 9, MRT3 is running 15 trains with a passenger load of 600,000 every day, nearly twice the daily load limit of 350,000. The Dalian trains are part of the MRT3\u2019s expansion project.\n\nThe blog ddsfilesfiles.xyz is similar to the dubious blogs Rappler has checked.
