Employment in the auto industry declined during the Great Recession, but has been steadily increasing since mid-2009. Similarly, domestic auto production increased during the economic recovery before declining in mid-2016, while domestic new car sales grew for seven straight years until 2017. His examples of the auto companies \u201cpouring\u201d into Michigan and other Midwestern states were a $4.5 billion investment in Detroit by Fiat Chrysler, a $1 billion investment by Ford in Chicago, and a $300 million investment in Michigan by General Motors. Chrysler\u2019s plans would reopen a car plant, while Ford and G.M. are increasing production capacity at existing plants.\n\nIn contrast, G.M. said it would idle five car factories in Ohio, Michigan, Maryland and Canada while Chrysler is cutting jobs at an Illinois plant. According to the Reshoring Initiative, a group that encourages companies to move back to the United States, announcements to increase investment or move companies back to the United States peaked in 2016. \u201cThe special counsel completed its report and found no collusion and no obstruction. \u2026 Total exoneration, complete vindication.\u201d While the investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III did not conclude that Mr. Trump or his campaign coordinated with Russia, according to a summary of Mr. Mueller\u2019s report by Attorney General William P. Barr, the special counsel stopped short of absolving Mr. Trump on obstruction. Mr. Barr quoted the special counsel as stating that \u201cwhile this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,\u201d and wrote that Mr. Mueller did not draw conclusions about whether Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct amounted to obstruction of justice. \u201cI\u2019m going to get, in honor of my friends, full funding of $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which you have been trying to get for over 30 years.\u201d The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a program for restoring the ecosystem of the Great Lakes, was first implemented by the Obama administration in 2010. Federal funding ranged from nearly $300 million to $450 million every year under Mr. Obama. Mr. Trump requested no funding at all for the initiative in his 2018 budget request, effectively eliminating the program, though Congress ended up appropriating nearly $300 million. His latest budget proposes a 90 percent cut to the program, reducing funding to $30 million.", "lang": "en"}
