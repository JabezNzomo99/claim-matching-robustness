That Iran was unwilling to negotiate on terms that included suspension of enrichment is further evidence that there is no \u2018better deal\u2019 to be had.\u201d\n\nSo what was happening in 2008? The five permanent members of the Security Council (the United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia and China), working with Germany and the European Union, had pushed through three U.N. Security Council resolutions imposing sanctions on Iran, in an effort to prod it to the negotiating table. Those were the sticks. But the \u201ccarrots\u201d were the elements that might be on the table if Iran actually started negotiations.\n\nMany of the carrots had been on the table ever since the Europeans first started negotiating with Iran in 2003. When the United States formally joined the effort in 2006, some of the elements offered by the Europeans were withdrawn or watered down, notably discussions on regional security. (The Americans did not want to offend Persian Gulf allies.) The 2008 letter slightly sweetened the pot with its language on Iran playing a constructive role in the region.\n\nThe Iranians responded to the June letter with their own wish list of negotiating topics, including stating that they were willing to consider discussing having an enrichment fuel bank in \u201cdifferent parts of the world \u2014 including Iran.\u201d The Iranians ignored the demand to suspend enrichment \u2014 and instead focused on a quick suspension of sanctions. \u201cThe time for negotiating from the condescending position of inequality has come to an end,\u201d wrote then-Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki.\n\n\u201cIt has come to my attention that Secretary Kerry has referenced the June 2008 letter from the P5+1 to Iran in recent briefings to Congress. Allow me to recount what transpired in June 2008. The letter was a final attempt by the P5+1 to convince the Iranians to negotiate in good faith before seeking new sanctions. The idea was to show the Iranians what negotiations might look like if they met the essential condition of the verifiable suspension of all enrichment and reprocessing programs and activities. I want to emphasize that this had long been a precondition for the United States formally joining the talks and that it was a requirement that had the backing of all of our negotiating partners. It was enshrined in three U.N. Security Council Resolutions. The United States never negotiated the elements described in the letter with the Iranians. This was a listing of what might be possible. Indeed, several ideas were explored among the P5+1, including the provision of civil nuclear capability to Iran. That was to be done by providing fuel by outside parties (likely the P5 itself) through a fuel bank. The provision of a civil nuclear program without indigenous enrichment and reprocessing, we thought, could form the basis for other agreements and it was the core of a landmark one with the United Arab Emirates in 2009. The premise of our negotiations with the Iranians was to end their program and halt their enrichment and reprocessing activities. We had succeeded in imposing sanctions through the United Nations and had levied the first financial and banking sanctions through the Treasury Department. We believed that in time these sanctions would be powerful tools against the Iranian economy and would force them to negotiate. That was the joint position of the international community when we left office in 2009.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
