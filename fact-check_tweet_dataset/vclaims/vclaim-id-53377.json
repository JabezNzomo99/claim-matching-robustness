Boris Johnson said this was not the case. However, Mr Starmer was correct.\n\nGovernment guidance published on 25 February twice states that it is \u201cvery unlikely\u201d people receiving care in care homes or the community will be infected with the new coronavirus. This advice was withdrawn on 13 March, and replaced with new guidance about what to do in the event of an outbreak at a care home or other supported living.\n\nThe initial guidance, for social, community and residential care employers, stated: \u201cThis guidance is intended for the current position in the UK where there is currently no transmission of Covid-19 in the community.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore very unlikely that anyone receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected. This is the latest information and will be updated shortly.\u201d\n\nThe same document also said: \u201cFacemasks are only recommended to be worn by infected individuals when advised by a healthcare worker, to reduce the risk of transmitting the infection to other people. It remains very unlikely that people receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected.\u201d\n\nMr Starmer has written to Mr Johnson, asking him to correct the record in the House of Commons and repeating the section of the guidance that said: \u201c...it is therefore very unlikely that anyone receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson has replied to Mr Starmer, saying that he quoted the advice \u201cselectively and misleadingly\u201d by neglecting to \u201cprovide the critical context at the start of the guidance\u201d, and refers to the passage mentioned above which states the guidance was intended for the \u201ccurrent position in the UK where there is currently no transmission of Covid-19 in the community\u201d. The Prime Minister says he stands by his comments made during Prime Minister\u2019s Questions.", "lang": "en"}
