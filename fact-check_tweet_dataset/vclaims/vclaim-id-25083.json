This video is proof. Media will not show you such wonderful news- translated). A video of Congress leader and senior lawyer Kapil Sibal has been shared widely on Facebook and Twitter along with the message that he was slapped outside the court premises when he was speaking to media persons.\n\nThe video varies in length from 9 seconds to 17 seconds, and Sibal can be seen grimacing in pain with his hand on his face.\n\nThe above tweet, posted in the morning of January 5, has garnered over 800 retweets. Several pro-BJP social media users have gleefully shared the video.\n\nThe above post is by a Facebook page Shivraj Singh Chouhan Fans Clube. Here, it has been viewed over 14000 times so far and shared over 500 times. The video has also been shared by another Facebook page Mission Modi 2019. It has also been posted on the group We Support Narendra Modi.\n\nAlt News found that the first tweet with this claim was by a user Mamta Sharma. On Facebook, a user Manish Sharma was among the earliest to share it. The video has spread like wildfire on social media platforms with several pages, groups and individual users posting it.\n\nA close look at the video reveals that Sibal was not slapped by anyone. He was in fact hit by a microphone held by one of the media persons assembled at the spot. Posted below is a slow motion version of the video.\n\nIt can be seen clearly in the above video that Sibal is accidentally hit on his face with a microphone. The exact frame in which this incident occurs is posted below.\n\nA cursory glance is enough to suggest that there is no question of Sibal being slapped, but probably not so for those who have shared the video fervently.", "lang": "en"}
