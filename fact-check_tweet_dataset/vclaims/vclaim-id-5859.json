This is false.\n\nA post sharing the video can be viewed here (here).\n\nThe opening sequence shows billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, warning that \u201cwe will have to prepare\u201d for the next pandemic.\n\nThe narrator then uses points to argue that the pandemic was planned, and claims it is a hoax that is being used as an excuse to control the general public.\n\nCLAIM 1 - THE VIRUS THAT CAUSES COVID-19 HASN\u2019T BEEN IDENTIFIED OR ISOLATED\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve never isolated it or actually identified this virus as actually existing, so the whole thing is just a big scam\u201d, the narrator claims (here).\n\nThis is not true. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the name of the virus that causes the disease COVID-19 (here).\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was identified by Chinese authorities on January 7, 2020 (tinyurl.com/y5at3vke).\n\nCLAIM 2 - TEST FOR COVID-19 BROADLY TESTS FOR RNA VIRUSES AND GENETIC MATERIAL\n\n\u201cOf course, the more people they test, then the more people are going to test positive because they\u2019re just testing for RNA viruses and genetic material\u201d, the narrator alleges (here).\n\nIt is false that the COVID-19 test broadly detects all RNA viruses rather than SARS-CoV-2 specifically.\n\nAn RNA virus is a virus that has RNA as its genetic material (here). Human diseases caused by RNA viruses include COVID-19 (here), SARS, influenza and Ebola disease (here).\n\nThe Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test used to detect SARS-CoV-2 works by detecting the presence of its RNA in the swab sample (here).\n\nEach virus has its own pattern of RNA material, and the test for coronavirus tests for the RNA material of SARS-CoV-2 specifically.\n\nCLAIM 3 - ALL DEATHS ARE BEING LABELLED AS COVID-19\n\n\u201cAll deaths are basically being labelled as COVID deaths now whether they are or not. All you have to do is test positive for this genetic material in your body and it\u2019ll say COVID-19\u201d (here).\n\nIn the UK, data on COVID-19 deaths published by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) includes deaths \u201cinvolving COVID-19\u201d.\n\nThis includes deaths that have COVID-19 mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, whether it is an underlying cause or not (here).\n\nHowever, the ONS says that: \u201cIn the majority of cases (46,736 deaths, 92.8%) where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, it was found to be the underlying cause of death\u201d.\n\nIt is wrong to say that all deaths are being recorded as COVID deaths. One indication of how many deaths have been caused by the pandemic is the number of \u2018excess deaths\u2019 recorded, or additional deaths compared to the number usually expected during a given time period.\n\nAn ONS report shows that England and Wales saw spikes in the number of excess deaths that reflect the number of COVID-19 deaths that were reported at that time (see Figure 2) (here).\n\nIn June, the ONS reported that there were around 64,500 excess deaths across the UK for the time of year using a five-year average, though the figure is now likely to be higher (here).\n\nFalse. The coronavirus pandemic is not a hoax; it is a global outbreak caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
