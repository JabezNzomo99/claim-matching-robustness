No, this is not true. In fact, it is an old recycled hoax apparently inspired by a real decapitation murder in Mississippi in June 2017. The image used in the story was taken from a local TV station website's report on the discovery of the headless body of Jeremy Jerome Jackson on the doorstep of someone who is not a judge. There is no indication that Jackson was ever accused of being a pedophile.\n\nDespite being a recycled hoax, it is getting lots of sharing action on social platforms as measured by our Trendolizer tools. This newest version is a direct rip-off of an earlier hoax published by another well-known fake news publisher in September 2017.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on September 1, 2018 titled \"Pedophile's Decapitated Corpse Found On Judge's Doorstep After Bail Hearing - cvikasdrv.com\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe decapitated corpse that was found on a judge's doorstep in Dallas, Texas has been identified as belonging to a notorious pedophile who was recently allowed to walk free on bail by the judge, according to reports. William Smith, 28, from Dallas, Texas was discovered in the early hours of Tuesday morning, decapitated and slumped against the front door of the judge who had granted him bail in August. Smith was arrested last month following allegations by his then girlfriend that he had raped her 8-year-old daughter. After a police investigation in which Smith was found in possession of child pornography, he was arrested on two counts related to child pornography and one count of child molestation.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nWe wrote about cvikasdrv.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Woman Did NOT Set Pedophile Muslim Man on Fire After Catching Him Rape 7-Yr-Old Daughter", "lang": "en"}
