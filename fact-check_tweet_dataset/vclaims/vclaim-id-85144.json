And the basic facts of both cases right now just don\u2019t compare. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nLaw enforcement sources have told reporters that the emails were found on a computer that belonged to former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) and his estranged wife, Huma Abedin, who had been Clinton\u2019s deputy chief of staff at the State Department. The emails surfaced during an underage sexting investigation into Weiner.\n\nThere is not enough information right now to know whether the new emails will lead to any other developments. It does not appear as if the FBI has yet examined them in depth, and Comey had said in the letter that the FBI \u201ccannot yet assess whether the material may or may not be significant\u201d or whether the emails contained classified information.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if they were addressed to and from Clinton, or if they are emails that the FBI already had reviewed in the earlier investigation into her use of a private server.\n\nNo charges ever have been filed in the Clinton email case; Comey has said the FBI could not find evidence of \u201cclearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information.\u201d There is no way to know whether the new emails would change that. (For more, see all of our fact-checks on the Clinton email issue.)\n\nOn the other hand, we know a lot about the Watergate scandal from the 1970s, thanks to the dogged, Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting of The Washington Post\u2019s Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward. The scandal began with a burglary of the Democratic National Committee office at the Watergate complex and led to the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon, and the criminal convictions and guilty pleas of dozens of people involved in the massive campaign of sabotage and espionage on behalf of Nixon\u2019s reelection effort and the ensuing coverup.\n\nNick Akerman, one of the prosecutors in the Watergate case, rejected Trump\u2019s statement that the emails case is \u201cbigger than Watergate,\u201d according to mic.com political reporter Celeste Katz: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s statement that this is bigger than Watergate is totally absurd. There is no evidence of any violation of law. For Trump to reach that conclusion based on a total lack of evidence is reminiscent of the innuendo spread by Joseph McCarthy in the early 1950s.\u201d\n\n[Update: John Dean, former Nixon White House counsel implicated in the Watergate scandal, rejected Trump\u2019s description in an op-ed in the New York Times. \u201cWhatever mistakes Mrs. Clinton made, her actions bear no similarities whatsoever to Nixon\u2019s criminalization of his presidency, and his efforts to corrupt much of the executive branch,\" he wrote.]\n\nThe Trump campaign did not provide evidence of how the Clinton emails are \u201cbigger than Watergate,\u201d but issued this statement in response to our inquiry: \u201cHillary Clinton is one of the most corrupt candidates ever to run for president and she has enlisted the biased media to act as her campaign\u2019s propaganda arm. Americans know that Clinton\u2019s email scandal disqualifies her for the presidency and her candidacy will go down as one of the most unethical moments in political history.\u201d\n\nTrump says the Clinton email scandal is \u201cbigger than Watergate,\u201d given Comey\u2019s letter to Congress about new emails that might be relevant to the Clinton email scandal. But there is not enough information available right now to know whether these emails will make a difference in the case. Comey\u2019s letter said the FBI \u201ccannot yet assess whether the material may or may not be significant.\u201d\n\nSo far, there have been no criminal charges, and therefore no convictions or guilty pleas in the Clinton email scandal. That makes the Clinton emails fundamentally different from Watergate, where 48 people were found guilty. Trump earns Four more Pinocchios for this absurd comparison.", "lang": "en"}
