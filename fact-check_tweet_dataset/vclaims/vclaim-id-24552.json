In the post, it is claimed that Donald Trump was inspired by the books of Ambedkar and he expressed his wish to embrace Buddhism. Let\u2019s try to verify the claims made in the post.\n\nClaim: Trump was holding an official document that has an image of Ambedkar on the left and the text \u2018jai bhim\u2019 with his signature on the right. Fact: President Trump\u2019s executive order to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership is photoshopped with the image of Ambedkar on the left and text \u2018jai bhim\u2019 on the right. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the photo in the post is run through Google Reverse Image Search technique, it was found in an article of \u2018Forbes\u2019 published in January 2017. The photo in the article carried the following description- \u201cPresident Trump shows signed executive ordering withdrawing U.S. from Trans-Pacific Partnership WASHINGTON, DC\u201d.\n\nWhen searched if Trump has expressed anytime his wish to embrace Buddhism, no corroborating information was found.\n\nSo, the photo of Trump with a document carrying Ambedkar\u2019s photo and text \u2018jai bhim\u2019 is a photoshopped one and also, Donald Trump hasn\u2019t expressed any wish to embrace Buddhism anytime.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
