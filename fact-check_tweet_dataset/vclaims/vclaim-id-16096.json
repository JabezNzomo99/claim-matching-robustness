It\u2019s correct that it\u2019s significant, and it\u2019s correct that it doesn\u2019t directly stop us from leaving the European Union. Whether it might indirectly lead to Brexit happening differently or not at all is a separate question that depends on politics.\n\nThe case is clearly significant in terms of the legal issues at stake, with academics commentating on it even before it had finished. Often a single judge will hear a High Court case, but the Article 50 challenge was overseen by three of the most senior: the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, and a judge from the Court of Appeal. They described the case of one of \u201cgeneral constitutional importance\u201d.\n\nThe legal question for the court was whether the government can use its \u2018prerogative powers\u2019 to trigger Article 50 and start the process of leaving the EU.\n\nThe judges decided that UK constitutional law doesn\u2019t allow that.\n\nIt follows that Parliament must pass a law in order to enact Article 50 and leave the EU, although the court didn\u2019t spell this out.\n\nWhether that law is likely to be passed is a matter of political judgement.\n\nA draft law can be amended. That means MPs (and Lords) have the opportunity to give the government instructions. Parliament will now be much more involved in how Brexit plays out than it might have been, had the government been able to trigger Article 50 on its own.\n\nThe government has appealed the decision. Its appeal is likely to skip a step and go directly to the Supreme Court, where all 11 justices will hear it.", "lang": "en"}
