No, that't not true. A faked screenshot of a supposedly deleted tweet that's making the rounds claiming that has been created by fake satire (\"fauxtire\") site Huzlers, it s not real.\n\nThe fake tweet appeared in an article published on April 28, 2018 titled \"Kanye West Says He's Not Black In Recently Deleted Tweet (See Screenshot)\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nLOS ANGELES - In the midst of the controversy surrounding Kanye West for revealing he supports president Trump, Kanye tweeted a shocking tweet which he almost immediately deleted. However a screenshot of the tweet was able to be taken. See screenshot below: Kanye West is claiming to have not identified as a black man since 2006 and that he identifies as a \"dark skinned white man\" which absolutely makes no sense. Is something wrong with Kanye? We expect the screenshot to be be viral and therefore addressed by Kanye himself.\n\nThe full text of the faked tweet read:\n\nNo such tweet was sent out by West or it would have been massively screenshotted by many people all over the internet. The filename of the tweet image would also not read \"you_doodle_pro_2018-04-28t03_33_52z.jpg\", which indicates it was altered with a program named You Doodle.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail might have thought the news was real:\n\nBut Huzlers styles itself as a \"fauxtire\" website and carries a disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nThe faked tweet is a commentary on the recent string of mutually praising tweets between President Donald Trump and the iconic rapper which has taken many people by surprise:\n\nAccording to Splinter News the site is run by Pablo Reyes and David Martinez and according to Buzzfeed Reyes is involved with several other fake news websites. They tend to shy away from political stories, opting instead to write for a more \"urban\" audience, with stories about rappers, criminals and celebrities.\n\nWe wrote about huzlers.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: New Research Did NOT Show Cardi B Fans Have a 90% Higher Chance Of Acquiring An STD\n\u2022 Fake News: Cardi B Did NOT Say Bruno Mars Might Be The Baby Daddy\n\u2022 Fake News: Lil Tay NOT Rushed to Hospital, NOT Beat By Group of Children At Playground\n\u2022 Fake News: 28 Year-Old Man Did NOT Overdose From Marijuana\n\u2022 Fake News: Fortnite Creator Did NOT Admit Game's Purpose Is To Prepare Young Men For War", "lang": "en"}
