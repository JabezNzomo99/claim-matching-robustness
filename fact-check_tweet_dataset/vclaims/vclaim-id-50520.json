Alabama has not reported any confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus at press time.\n\nFeatured in the viral post is an alleged screen grab of a chyron from a television news broadcast, saying, \u201cCoronavirus found in crawfish in Mobile, AL.\u201d The post claims that 12 women who recently ate crawfish contracted COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.\n\nBut the Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any media reports about people in Mobile contracting COVID-19 from crawfish or any other food. In fact, there are no confirmed cases of respiratory virus in Alabama at press time, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health.\n\nThere is currently \u201cno evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food,\u201d according to the CDC website. People can get COVID-19 from touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes, but coronaviruses generally spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets.\n\nThe image appears to have been created a website that allows people to create their own news chyrons.
