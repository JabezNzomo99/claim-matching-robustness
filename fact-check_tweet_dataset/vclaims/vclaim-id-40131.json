The claims are false; none of the 13 bills covering sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGIE) currently pending at the Philippine Congress contain any such measures.\n\nThis post published on Facebook on August 30, 2019 contains an image with a list of eight things the SOGIE bills will purportedly do.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe post\u2019s lengthy Tagalog language caption translates to English as: \u201cWhat do you know!\n\n\u201cThe SOGIE Bill may sound simple but this is what it leads to.\n\n\u201cIf you ridicule the LGBT you will be charged and asked to pay a fine of 500,000 pesos + you will be imprisoned for 6 years and 6 months\n\n\u201cYou cannot specify gender on the birth certificate of a new-born child until he/she reach the age of 12\n\n\u201cWhoever objects to them getting married can be stripped of their rights as a Priest or Pastor!!\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is this bill was not yet passed at the senate but they're already going to each Mayor, Congressman, governor of each province\u2026and they were able to convince them to agree with this!!\n\n\u201care you amenable to having this bill passed in our country?!\n\n\u201clet us hopefully not just be silent and let public officials know our sentiments!!\u201d\n\nThe post has been shared more than 17,000 times.\n\nThe SOGIE bills are a number of proposed measures to end discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in the Philippines.\n\nAltogether, 13 bills penalising discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity have been submitted in the current session of the Philippine Congress. One of the Senate bills filed penalises discrimination based on \"ethnicity, race, religion or belief, sex or gender of sexual orientation,language disability and educational attainment\".\n\nNine bills have been filed in the House of Representatives: bill numbers 95, 134, 160, 258, 640, 1041, 1359, 2211 and 2870.\n\nFour have been submitted to the Senate: bill numbers 689, 159 , 412 and 315. Senate bill 315 prohibits discrimination based on SOGIE, ethnicity, race, language disability and educational attainment.\n\nAll nine House bills and Senate bill 412 have the same wording on anti-discrimination provisions. Two of the Senate bills have the same wording as each other, while another one, Senate Bill 315, also has its own wording.\n\nNone of the three versions of the bill make any reference to banning the listing of sex on birth certificates.\n\nNone of the bills mentions same-sex marriage.\n\nNone of the bills contain provisions that would allow members of the clergy to be stripped of their positions for opposing same-sex marriage.\n\nThere are also no explicit provisions in the bills about LGBT people showing their affection in public.\n\nBelow are the following acts of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity as defined in the bills:\n\nRegarding the post\u2019s claim that: \u201cIf you ridicule the LGBT you will be charged and asked to pay a fine of 500,000 pesos + you will be imprisoned for 6 years and 6 months\u201d\n\nAll House bills and Senate bill 412 impose the penalties for hate speech or harassment of LGBT people, with fines of up to 500,000 pesos and jail terms of up to six years.", "lang": "en"}
