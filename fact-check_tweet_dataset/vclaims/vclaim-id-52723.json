One of the men can be seen holding a sickle while another is seated on a mud ground and asks a horrified crowd watching the grotesque scene to buy the body parts.\n\nThe clip is being shared by several Pakistani Twitter handles with the caption, \"Are you watching human rights watch, Where are you? @UN @realDonaldTrump @ImranKhanPTI @BDUTT .Loudly crying face #IndiaOnBlacklist #RSS #RSSTerrorists #RSSTerrorism\"\n\nClick here to view, and here for an archive.\n\nClick here to view, and here for an archive.\n\nClick here to view, and here for an archive.\n\nAlso Read: Unrelated Images Shared As RSS Men Attacking Hindu Woman For Making Sehri\n\nBOOM had previously debunked the same viral clip in May 2018 when it was being falsely shared claiming that it shows Rohingya Muslims killing and eating Hindus and found that it was a staged video.\n\nWe were not able to ascertain where exactly the video was from or the context associated with it. However, the video has several clues that give it away as staged.\n\n\n\nThe men in the video can be heard speaking in Hindi, 'Aaiye aaiye meat lijiye; sasta ho gaya; hazaar rupaiye; lijiye sasta ho gaya'. (Come buy meat, thousand rupees, it has become cheap)\n\nThe word 'WhatsApp' can be heard multiple times in the video. A poster in which the Hindi word for head (mundi) and English word meat spelt in Devanagari script can also been seen.\n\nAdditionally, the paint used in the video is too bright and too thick to be real blood. The surrounding mud would have turned dark and wet if it was real blood. The second clue is that what appears to be a severed head bleeding from the neck onward is actually a man buried under mud. BOOM has traced a white outline around the man's body to show the same.\n\nAlso Read: Gory Staged Video Being Shared As Rohingya Slaughtering Hindus\n\nThe video is being shared by several Pakistani Twitter accounts in the backdrop of a United States government panel calling for India to be put on a religious freedom blacklist over a \"drastic\" downturn under Prime Minister Narendra Modi in its annual report.", "lang": "en"}
