There have been a number of demonstrations in Columbus, according to the Columbus Dispatch.\n\nThe image shows a screen grab of another Facebook post featuring two smoke-filled photos taken in Columbus. The caption, seemingly referencing OhioHealth Grant Medical Center and Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital, reads, \u201cIf you believe that the \u2018protests\u2019 are still ok, you\u2019re out of your mind!! Setting a Children\u2019s hospital and Grant on fire is beyond protesting.\u201d\n\nContrary to the post\u2019s claims, neither hospital has caught fire during recent protests in Columbus. Spokespeople for OhioHealth, the hospital system that manages Grant Medical Center, and Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital confirmed as much in emails to the Daily Caller.\n\n\u201cI verified with both our facilities and security teams,\u201d Katie Logan, an OhioHealth spokesperson, said in an email. \u201cWe have not had any fires at OhioHealth Grant Medical Center in the last 30 days.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fire was not on our property,\u201d Katelyn Hanzel, a senior media relations specialist at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital, confirmed.

The roof of the Christian Spiritualist Temple on nearby 6th Street can be seen in the photo. CBS affiliate WBNS-TV reported that witnesses told the fire investigation unit the fire \u201cwas set by rioters.\u201d\n\nIn the photo on the right, Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s Big Lots Behavioral Health Pavilion is visible, but the smoke that appears in the photo may actually have come from a May 31 fire that happened at an apartment building construction site, according to the Columbus Dispatch.\n\nOn May 30, Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther signed an executive order implementing a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew that will remain in effect until he rescinds it, according to a tweet from the city\u2019s government.", "lang": "en"}
