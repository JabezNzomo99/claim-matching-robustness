The pollster, however, said it had not conducted the survey and real polls have shown incumbent president Joko Widodo well ahead of Subianto ahead of April elections.\n\nAn image shared to Facebook on January 15 appears to show that 67.8 percent of the poll\u2019s respondents favoured Subianto and his running mate Sandiaga Uno after the ex-general delivered a speech.\n\nIn the image Widodo, pictured alongside his running mate Muslim cleric Ma\u2019ruf Amin, had 32.2 percent support. The logo of Saiful Mujani Research and Consulting (SMRC), a pollster, can be seen above the candidates\u2019 faces.\n\nThe post\u2019s translated caption reads: \u201cThese are the results of a survey conducted after Prabowo-Sandi\u2019s nationalistic speech last night.\u201d\n\nIt refers to Subianto\u2019s campaign speech on January 14.\n\nHere is a video of the speech uploaded to YouTube by his political party Gerindra. Here is a report by Indonesian newspaper The Jakarta Post about the event.\n\nThe pollster\u2019s executive director Djayadi Hanan rejected the Facebook post\u2019s claims that his firm was behind the survey.\n\n\u201cWe have never conducted any survey with results like that,\u201d he told AFP in an interview. \u201cThe post has irresponsibly used SMRC\u2019s name.\u201d\n\nThe most recent survey published on SMRC\u2019s website was a presidential poll from September 2018, several months before the one published in the Facebook post. It showed Widodo leading with 60 percent of the poll's respondents favouring him.", "lang": "en"}
