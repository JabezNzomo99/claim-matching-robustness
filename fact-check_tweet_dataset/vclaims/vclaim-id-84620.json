But a single Sikh gentleman with his sword ran towards them like a Tiger\u2026and see the effect on those anti-national and cowardly crowd.\u201d A video with the aforestated text is currently viral on social media and WhatsApp.\n\nThe viral video can be seen here:\n\nIn reality, neither was the National flag being burnt, nor did anyone raise \u201cHaay Haay Bharat\u201d or \u201cPakistan Zindabad\u201d slogans, nor was the mob comprised of Muslims. The only slogans that can be heard in the video are \u201cAtankwaad Haay Haay\u201d.\n\nThis issue was first reported by a website called Sikh Siyasat who describe themselves as a Punjab based Sikh News Network. Sikh Siyasant claimed that certain Hindutva activists who were burning an effigy fleed the scene after the local Sikh population got enraged. A longer version of the video that is currently viral was first posted by Sharnit Singh Rataul on his Facebook profile on June 6th, 2017, and can be seen below.\n\nAnother Sikh News site called Babushahi which published a related story on June 7th claimed that members of Shiv Sena were burning an effigy of the militant preacher Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale on the 33rd anniversary of Operation Blue Star. The Shiv Sainiks fleed when a man called Paramjit Singh charged at them.\n\nOn June 12th, a related report in Hindustan Times stated, \u201cRight-wing leader Sudhir Kumar Suri, who burnt effigy of slain militant preacher Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale on 33rd anniversary of Operation Bluestar, was arrested by police on Sunday for allegedly hurting religious sentiments.\u201d\n\nAs it can be seen, none of the claims in the viral video are factual. SMHoaxSlayer was the first to debunk this hoax. This is yet another instance where a fake video has been used to paint the minorities of the country as \u2018anti-national\u2019. Alt News has covered many such fake videos in the past such as an old video from Guatemala in Central America which was passed off as Indian Muslims burning a Marwadi woman for not wearing a Burkha or a video from Bangladesh which was passed off as a Hindu being killed by Muslims in Nawada, Bihar or fake videos of Indian Muslims celebrating Pakistan\u2019s win over India in Champion\u2019s trophy.\n\nPlease be a responsible netizen and verify information received on WhatsApp and various social media platforms before forwarding them.
