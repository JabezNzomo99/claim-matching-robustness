Ron Johnson, R-Wis., aired an ad that used a doctored photo that appeared to show then-President Barack Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani smiling and shaking hands.\n\nBut it\u2019s perhaps been long enough, because on Jan. 6, U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., tweeted the image.\n\n\"The world is a better place without these guys in power,\" he wrote.\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nAs the New York Times reported, Obama and Rouhani have never met in person. Rouhani is still in power.\n\nThe original image, taken by Reuters photographer Jason Reed in 2011, shows Obama smiling and shaking hands with then-Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.\n\nAs people responded to Gosar\u2019s tweet to point out that the image of Obama and Rouhani was manipulated, he responded that \"no one said this wasn\u2019t photoshopped.\"\n\n\"No one said Obama met with Rouhani in person,\" he added on Twitter.\n\nBut the image, which has been reshared on social media since Gasar\u2019s tweet, suggests that they did. When we fact-checked the Ron Johnson-supporting Restoration PAC for using it in 2015, we rated it Pants on Fire.\n\nMore than four years later, the image is still smoking.
