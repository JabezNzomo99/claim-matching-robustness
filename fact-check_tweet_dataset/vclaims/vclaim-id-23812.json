They had found a Reddit thread which had discussions of the same video being circulated in 2013, and about the incident being from 2008. The text contained in the thread said:\n\nReligious chants by a group of Russian members of the Hare Ram Hare Krishna sect near the Mapusa police station took a violent turn on Tuesday when the Russians clashed with the police and ended up getting assaulted by the public. Two policemen were injured in the clashes and the eight Russians have been arrested on charges of rioting and assaulting cops.\n\nAccording to the Mapusa police, a group of Russians dressed in saffron attire were seen marching along the main streets of Mapusa chanting \u2018Hare Ram, Hare Krishna\u2019, equipped with dholak (drum) and a harmonium.\n\nIrritated by the singing and consequent traffic congestion that resulted along the main road opposite municipal market, some citizens informed the police about the nuisance.\n\nA police team, led by PSI Tulshidas Dhavaskar and Head Constable Ramesh Kalangutkar, rushed to the site and requested the revelers to stop their activity.\n\nHowever, the revelers paid little heed to the police and continued with their activity. Finding himself on the defensive, PSI Dhavaskar requisitioned additional police force, following which about four constables were rushed to take stock of the situation.\n\nThe police team stopped the march at the taxi stand and asked the group to come to the police station. As the policemen were trying to take the members of the group to the police station, the group members allegedly began assaulting the cops. Police Constables Sushant Chopdekar and Prabhakar Porob sustained injuries in the scuffle.\n\nOn noticing the cops being at the receiving end of the group, general public intervened and thrashed the foreigners before handing them over to the police.\n\nWhile police managed to arrest eight members of the group, others fled from the site. Those arrested include Egoloboi Bable, Eugene Cathrina, Ekolo Valanko, Alexander Valanko, Costancio Roma, Terence Tubo, Gory Gorbelo and Andre Adito. All the eight accused have been booked under Sections 143, 145, 147 149 and 353 IPC. PSI Tulshidas Dhavaskar is investigating the case.\u201d\n\nAfter going through this piece of text, it can be clearly said that the claim being made about the video currently is false.", "lang": "en"}
