It was banned in international fixtures but this ban has been lifted.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-56059", "url": "https://fullfact.org/online/poppy-black-lives-matter-football/", "vclaim": "A number of viral Facebook posts claim that while football players are displaying the words \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d on their shirts, they were not or are not allowed to wear the poppy symbol.\n\nThis refers to old rules about whether a poppy could be worn and claims footballers are not allowed to wear a poppy are now incorrect. Footballers are not banned from wearing the poppy.\n\nWhat do the laws of the game say?\n\nThe laws of the game are shared by all footballing associations. Law four says: \u201cEquipment [which includes clothing] must not have any political, religious or personal slogans, statements or images.\u201d\n\nThere is some guidance on interpreting that law which sets out some examples of what is not permitted as a \u2018political\u2019 slogan or image. It also says: \u201cWhen commemorating a significant national or international event, the sensibilities of the opposing team (including its supporters) and the general public should be carefully considered.\u201d\n\nThe laws say: \u201cFor any offence the player and/or the team will be sanctioned by the competition organiser, national football association or by FIFA.\u201d\n\nHow has the law evolved?\n\nThe Facebook posts could be referring to the fact that in 2016 the four home nations men\u2019s teams were fined by FIFA for wearing the poppy in international qualifiers which FIFA deemed to be a breach of the laws of the game. We\u2019ve written about this before.\n\nBack then law four was much the same as it is now, but the section on interpreting the law was not yet present.\n\nHowever players in the Premier League were wearing poppies that season and didn\u2019t face fines. The Premier League is governed directly by the English Football Association (FA), which is a FIFA member but is able to make its own interpretations on the laws of the game.\n\nSo it\u2019s clear that different associations interpreted the law differently.\n\nFollowing appeals from UK associations, the laws of the game were then changed, allowing the wearing of the poppy and, indeed, at England\u2019s next international against Germany on 10 November 2017, both teams wore the poppy and were not fined.\n\nWhat is the current position of the Premier League and footballing associations?\n\nOver the past week, footballers in the Premier League have worn shirts with their names replaced by the words \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d\n\nPremier League footballers also wear the poppy in November, which the Royal British Legion describe as \u201ca way of showing appreciation for the service and sacrifice of our Armed Forces, veterans and their families, both past and present.\u201d The Premier League is also a partner of the Royal British Legion which runs the Poppy Appeal. A post claiming that football is supporting the \u201cBLM movement\u201d but not \u201cthe Poppy\u201d is wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether FIFA would also consider Black Lives Matter messaging to contravene the rules, should an international team choose to wear it, once international fixtures resume.\n\nAnother post claims the FA wouldn\u2019t let poppies be worn on shirts. This is incorrect. Players in FA competitions such as the FA Cup wear the poppy. The FA governs the England football team and, so, was supportive of the decision of the team to wear the poppy back in 2016. The FA has said it supports the decision of teams playing in the Premier League, English Football League and FA Cup to support the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nFinally, one post claims that footballers are forbidden to wear the poppy on their national shirts to mark the 100th anniversary of the ending of the First World War.\n\nThis is false. While the England men\u2019s team did not have any fixtures over the usual poppy-wearing period of late October to 11 November in 2018, the England women\u2019s team did. They wore the poppy in their match against Sweden on 11 November 2018, the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War.", "lang": "en"}
