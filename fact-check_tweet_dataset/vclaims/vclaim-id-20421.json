The actual results of the survey concerning Putin were the opposite of what TASS reported.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "June 29, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-20421", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/putin-pew-survey-tass-russia/28586309.html", "vclaim": "On June 26, the Washington-based Pew Research Center released the results of its annual global survey, which was conducted among 40,448 participants in 37 countries outside the U.S.\n\nAmong other things, Pew asked those surveyed how they feel about the leaders of four nations: U.S. President Donald Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nOn June 27, Russia\u2019s TASS state news agency posted a report in Russian portraying the results of Pew\u2019s survey as highly favorable to Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cAccording to the research, 27% of its participants regard the Russian leader with confidence, believing that he \u2018is doing the right things on the world stage\u2019,\" the TASS report says.\n\nIn fact, the phrase \u201cis doing the right things on the world stage\u201d does not appear in the text of Pew's report on the survey's results. Rather, it includes a table showing the country-by-country findings for all four leaders, which is headlined \u201cConfidence in \u2026to do the right thing regarding world affairs.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to TASS's positive spin on what the survey found about attitudes toward Putin, Pew\u2019s researchers wrote:\n\n\u201cPutin inspires little confidence as an international leader. Roughly, six-in-ten across the 37 countries surveyed say they have little or no confidence in him. Outside of Russia, only in Vietnam (79%) does a majority say they trust Putin\u2019s handling of world affairs. About half or more in the Philippines (54%) and Tanzania (51%) say the same.\u201d\n\nThe Pew report continued: \u201cIn Europe, with the exception of Greece, relatively few have confidence in Putin when it comes to international affairs. Poles (4%) express the least confidence. In Canada, roughly two-in-ten (19%) have confidence in the Russian leader.\u201d\n\nPolygraph.info asked Mark Kramer, a professor of Russian studies at Harvard University, on whether he thought the TASS report was the result of an honest translation mistake or a deliberate misrepresentation of facts.\n\n\u201cIt is one of the most common and unimaginative ways to lie with statistics,\u201d Kramer responded in an email.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the TASS people are devotees of Darrell Huff's classic textbook \u2018How to Lie with Statistics\u2019,\u201d Kramer said, referring to the book written in 1954 by a free-lance reporter who had witnessed, in Kramer\u2019s words, how public officials \u201coften manipulate statistics to make something bad look good.\u201d\n\nThe book, which became one of the best-selling statistics books in history, describes how public officials found they could often fool people by selectively repackaging statistics and presenting the manipulated results to a mass audience.\n\n\u201cThat's exactly what has happened here,\u201d said Kramer. \u201cRather than acknowledging the main thrust of the Pew Research Center's findings about Putin -- which is that Putin is widely mistrusted and widely viewed very negatively around the world -- the TASS journalists focus on the minority who view Putin positively.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
