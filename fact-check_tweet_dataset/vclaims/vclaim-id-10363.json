This doesn\u2019t tell us how many may have faced recent immigration problems though.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-10363", "url": "https://fullfact.org/immigration/windrush-generation/", "vclaim": "People born in Commonwealth countries who arrived in the UK before 1973, and have lived here ever since, have the right to live in the UK indefinitely. This also applies to the wives and children of those people. Many of them are UK citizens.\n\nThere have been reports that some of those people have lost access to services or potentially faced deportation because they have been unable to prove that they have lived in the UK since before 1973.\n\nIn June 2017 there were estimated to be 524,000 Commonwealth-born people living in the UK who arrived before 1971, and 57,000 of them self-report as not being UK citizens. This doesn\u2019t tell us how many have faced problems proving their right to be in the UK.\n\nThese figures are based on the Labour Force Survey (LFS), which provides \"estimates of population characteristics rather than exact measures\". As Commonwealth-born individuals who arrived in the UK before 1971 are a small subset of the LFS, there's more uncertainty around the accuracy of their estimated population size.\n\nThe government has this week said \"we have some made some mistakes, which we cannot continue to make\". It has also said it doesn\u2019t know of any cases where someone has been deported who had the right to remain in the UK, but it will check through the records to make sure, and a team has been set up to help people \u201cevidence their right to be here and to access the necessary services\u201d.\n\nWhat residency rights do people born in the Commonwealth have?\n\nThe passing of British Nationality Act 1948 made citizens of Commonwealth countries citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies.\n\nNew immigration rules were introduced in the intervening years, before the Immigration Act 1971 changed the law to grant only temporary residence to most people arriving from Commonwealth countries. This came into force in 1973.\n\nHowever, people born in Commonwealth countries (and their wives and children) who settled in the UK before 1973 were still allowed to remain in the UK indefinitely under the terms of the new Act. They retain that right today.\n\nThose who arrived in the UK as citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies between 1948 and 1972 are known as the \u201cWindrush generation\u201d\u2014named after a ship which brought Caribbean workers to the UK in 1948. Some media outlets include only those arriving from the Caribbean in the Windrush generation, while others refer to it as those from all Commonwealth countries.\n\nSo why are there problems now?\n\nVarious media outlets have reported the cases of individuals who arrived in the UK from Caribbean Commonwealth countries as children in 1950s and 60s. Some are now having problems accessing services or face deportation as they don\u2019t have the documents to prove they arrived before 1973.\n\nThe reports say some individuals are unable to prove their status because they have never applied for a British passport or been formally naturalised, or don\u2019t have complete documentary records of their residence.\n\nNew immigration rules introduced in 2014 require landlords and the NHS (among others) to see proof of residence in the UK before providing certain services. So some people born in Commonwealth countries may be having to prove their immigration status for the first time, and are encountering problems if they can\u2019t.\n\nHow many people are affected?\n\nThe Migration Observatory estimates there were 524,000 people living in the UK, in the 12 months to June 2017, who were born in Commonwealth countries and arrived before 1971. Of these, 57,000 said they weren\u2019t UK citizens.\n\nHowever there are limits to what the numbers can tell us. The Migration Observatory says that \u201cThese figures do not represent an estimate of the number of people who are now likely to have difficulty demonstrating their legal status in the UK.\u201d That will depend on whether or not they have the necessary documentation.\n\nThe information on nationality is self-reported\u2014so anyone who mistakenly believes they are a UK citizen will not be included in the 57,000. And those born in the Commonwealth who are UK citizens could also have problems if they have lost their proof of citizenship in the intervening years.\n\nThe data only records people arriving before 1971, whereas the Immigration Act was introduced in 1973. So anyone arriving in 1971 or 1972 will not be included in the data.\n\nThe data also excludes citizens of Malta and Cyprus (which are in the Commonwealth), as they have the right to live in the UK as EU citizens. It also doesn\u2019t count people who live in places like care homes.", "lang": "en"}
