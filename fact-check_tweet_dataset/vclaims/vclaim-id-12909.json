But since Congress created the Federal Refugee Resettlement Program through the Refugee Act of 1980, about 3 million refugees have resettled in the United States, according to the Pew Research Center. That comes out to an average of about 83,300 refugees per year. That means that even if the 300 refugees came to the United States in one year, they would represent less than 1 percent of the total number of refugees accepted on average per year since 1980.\n\nWhen a reporter at the briefing expressed skepticism about the number, in effect asking how the public can trust the administration, an official said: \u201cThe salient fact here is that there are 300 individuals who were admitted and welcomed to the United States through a refugees admissions program who either infiltrated with hostile intent or who radicalized after their admission to the United States.\u201d\n\nAs we reported in May 2016, about 10 terrorism-related cases since 2009 have involved refugees. In 2015, a State Department spokesman told us that of the nearly 785,000 refugees admitted through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program since 9/11, \u201conly about a dozen \u2014 a tiny fraction of 1 percent of admitted refugees \u2014 have been arrested or removed from the U.S. due to terrorism concerns that existed prior to their resettlement in the U.S.\u201d\n\nIn the past, administration officials considered a wide range of charges to mean \u201cterroristic activity.\u201d We previously awarded Three Pinocchios to White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller\u2019s claim that 72 people from the countries listed in the travel ban were implicated in terroristic activity. Some of the charges involved people convicted of providing material support, such as money or personnel, to groups that are designated as terrorist organizations. But also included were people convicted of passport fraud, visa fraud and making fraudulent claims to federal investigators.\n\n[Update: At least 70 percent of the 300 people under review are from countries not covered by the travel ban, according to officials interviewed by The Washington Post. More than half are or were Iraqi nationals \u2014 yet Iraq is not covered in the revised ban. Further: \u201cOfficials familiar with the data said roughly two-thirds of the people on the administration\u2019s tally also arrived seven or more years ago, before the government significantly tightened its vetting procedures for Iraqis entering the United States.\"]\n\n\u201cFar from being foreign infiltrators, the large majority of jihadist terrorists in the United States have been American citizens or legal residents. Moreover, while a range of citizenship statuses are represented, every jihadist who conducted a lethal attack inside the United States since 9/11 was a citizen or legal resident. In addition about a quarter of the extremists are converts, further confirming that the challenge cannot be reduced to one of immigration,\u201d according to the New America report on jihadist activity since 9/11.\n\nIt\u2019s irresponsible for the administration to tout this number repeatedly without context or giving the public additional information to understand whether refugees are a threat to the U.S. homeland. The burden of proof is on the speaker, yet administration officials repeatedly declined reporters\u2019 requests for more information. Moreover, the administration\u2019s credibility on factual accuracy is open to question, given the frequent false claims made by the president and other senior officials.\n\nThis 300 figure, without context, is problematic for three reasons. It represents a tiny fraction of all resettled refugees in the United States per year (83,380 on average), and since the refugee program began in 1980 (3 million). Since Sept. 11, 2001, roughly 190,000 refugees were accepted into the United States from the six countries listed in the immigration executive order. The 300 figure represents a fraction \u2014 though it is unclear how small or big \u2014 of the total open counterterrorism investigations (which could be 1,000 or up to 10,000). And we have no idea what charges are involved, or if these investigations will even result in any charges (or convictions, for that matter).", "lang": "en"}
