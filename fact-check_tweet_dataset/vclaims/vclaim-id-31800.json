They need to face the fact that I am in charge, this is my country and I will do as I please, they have no control over me. The people support me and will always support me.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Trump ever made these remarks. The image in question is photoshopped.\n\nMuch to the chagrin of Trump, House Democrats have sought to subpoena his financial records, leading to an ongoing legal battle in court. Yet there is no evidence that Trump ever made these comments, on Fox News or anywhere else.\n\nHe has given many interviews on \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d however this particular screenshot is doctored and actually comes from an April 25 interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. (The news ticker at the bottom of the screenshot lines up around 10 minutes into the interview.)\n\nInstead of the transcript shown in the meme, the on-air graphics simply say, \u201cOn the Phone: President Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nA Fox News spokesperson confirmed that the chyron is photoshopped as well, with the original text reading, \u201cTrump: I Want To See What Was On DNC Server,\u201d referring to how the Democratic National Committee went with a private security firm after it was infamously hacked, rather than allow the FBI to examine its servers firsthand.", "lang": "en"}
