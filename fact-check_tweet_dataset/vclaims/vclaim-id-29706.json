In the post, it is also being claimed that the video footage has been released by the Pentagon. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Video footage of the drone attack on the Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani. Fact: The footage is from a video game. The Pentagon did not release it. The same video can be found to be uploaded on YouTube in 2015. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, many similar videos were found in the search results. The same video was found to be uploaded on YouTube in 2015 with the following description: \u2018Development preview of our upcoming game for mobile platforms, \u201cAC-130 Gunship Simulator: Special Ops Squadron\u201d. Voted TOP 50 2014 App of the Year at SlideDB\u2019. So, it is an old video from a video game.\n\nAlso, previously, the same video was falsely used by Russia to claim that the US is working with ISIS.\n\nTo sum it up, a video game clip falsely shared as \u2018the video footage of the drone attack on Qassem Soleimani\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our video on the 10 Most Ridiculous Fake News of the Year 2019?", "lang": "en"}
