Goble, former special advisor to the U.S. Secretary of State. \u201cTo get to 100 million, however, requires two things: a relatively high estimate of losses in China from starvation and killings during the Great Leap Forward, and the inclusion of losses of Soviet populations during wartime. With those added, the number is far above 100 million -- probably closer to 150 million.\u201d\n\nBefore serving in academic posts in Eastern Europe, Goble also was an advisor to the director of Voice of America and the deputy director of research for Radio Liberty.\n\nThe Victims of the Communism Memorial Foundation (VOC), a U.S. non-government organization based in Washington, DC, says that the White House estimate of the death toll of communism in the 20th Century is in fact accurate and based on archival and forensic research.\n\n\u201cThose numbers are an accurate estimate of the worldwide death toll of communism in the 20th century,\u201d the VOC press office told Polygraph.info.\n\n\u201cThese data are derived from 20 years of archival and forensic research following the collapse of Soviet communism and easily verifiable by a modest academic inquest.\u201d\n\nVOC also noted that within the Soviet Union alone, the number of victims, including those who died in the Holodomor, the artificial famine engineered by the Stalin regime in Soviet Ukraine and parts of the North Caucasus region, approached 30 million.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the Chairman [Pushkov] chooses to deny these statistics and can only muster a non sequitur redirection to imperialism and Nazism,\u201d the VOC representative said.\n\nThe figure of 100 million victims of communism first emerged in the late 1990s from \u201cThe Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression,\u201d the product of a joint research by eight academics from different European countries who documented the death toll of communist regimes.\n\nThe resulting 800-page book, titled \u201cLe Livre noir du communisme. Crimes, terreur, repression,\u201d was originally published in France in 1997 and quickly became an international bestseller.\n\nReprinted by Harvard University Press in 1999, under the title \u201cThe Black Book of Communism Crimes, Terror, Repression,\u201d the research breaks down the death toll of Communism as follows:\n\n\u201cIn the late 1990s, when I was working on The Black Book of Communism for Harvard University Press, I realized that it is impossible to compile precise statistics concerning the numbers who died unnatural deaths under Communist regimes,\u201d Harvard University professor Mark Kramer, who edited the English version of \u201cThe Black Book of Communism,\u201d told Polygraph.info.\n\nKramer said that, according to his own estimates, based on demographic and archival evidence, 70-85 million people were killed by communist regimes. \u201cRegardless of whether it was somewhat higher or somewhat lower, there is no doubt that Stalinist communism was one of the most monstrously violent and cruel tyrannies that ever existed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is pointless to argue whether Stalinism was worse than Nazism or the other way around,\u201d Kramer added. \u201cBoth Stalinism and Nazism were abominable systems that made the 20th century the most violent century by far in history. Those two systems took violence and cruelty to unprecedented heights.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe 100th anniversary of the founding of the Bolshevik regime yesterday (November 7) should cause people to reflect on the tens of millions who were brutally killed by communist regimes,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cPushkov debases himself by trying to whitewash the appalling crimes of the Leninist-Stalinist regime.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
