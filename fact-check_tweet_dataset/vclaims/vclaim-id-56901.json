Supposedly, this has particularly taken place in the construction sector leading to accusations of unfair competition practiced by Chinese construction outfits. Rumours and allegations claiming that tens-of-thousands of Chinese citizens have immigrated into Namibia have persisted over the years.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, Yan Jung, the Charg\u00e9 d\u2019 Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Namibia, stated that there were under 4 000 Chinese citizens living in Namibia. Jung noted that the number has decreased from roughly 10 000 seven years earlier, as economic opportunities for Chinese nationals in Namibia have decreased.\n\nIn a 2018 New Era article, former Minister of Home Affairs and Immigration, Pendukeni Iivula-Ithana disputed speculative media reports which placed the number of Chinese residing in Namibia at 100 000. Such high figures might incorrectly include the number of Chinese nationals who have visited Namibia as tourists, as well as employment and short-term work visa holders. Iivula-Ithana stated: \u201cOur most reliable figures are based on records drawn from the issuance of permanent residence permits since 1990 up to 21 February 2017, which currently stands at 1 358.\u201d Additionally, employment permit holders accounted for 4 470, while temporary residence permit holders who accompany residents as dependents (usually spouses and children) accounted for 1 124.\n\nAlthough a precise number for Chinese nationals resident in Namibia could not be found, and will most likely only be available once a census has been conducted, it seems clear that the 130 000 figure cited in The Namibian article of 28 April 2020 was wildly exaggerated.\n\nNamibian journalists are encouraged to make sure that numbers they cite in their reporting are accurate and up-to-date, as such wrong reporting can fuel false narratives about foreigners, especially Chinese nationals, and stoke xenophobia.", "lang": "en"}
