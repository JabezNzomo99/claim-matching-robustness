It\u2019s faked.\n\nLast week Mr Field was suspended from the government following the release of footage showing him pushing a Greenpeace activist who was protesting at a speech by the Chancellor, Philip Hammond.\n\nAn image on Facebook purports to show tweets from Mr Field in 2011 claiming to have threatened a girl on the tube and in 2014 expressing opinions in favour of beating women and children.\n\nThese tweets are faked. There is no record of the tweets on Mr Field\u2019s Twitter account. There is also no record of them ever having been deleted from his Twitter account, according to Politwoops, a service that records politicians\u2019 deleted tweets.\n\nThe timestamps on the screenshots of the two fake tweets show that, if real, they would have been sent at exactly the same times as other tweets that were genuinely sent by Mr Field.\n\nThis suggests that the real tweets have been doctored to show fake text.", "lang": "en"}
