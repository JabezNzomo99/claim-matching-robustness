For not only did you provided free transportation for fans but also prevented any cases, any statements of hatred. It's a real example for the whole world.\"\n\nWhile it is widely recognized the Russian government turned the World Cup into a PR success, it is also true that not all expressions \u201cof hatred\u201d were tamped down.\n\u2022On June 20, FIFA fined the Mexican Football Association due to its fans\u2019 \u201chomophobic chant.\u201d\n\u2022On June 24, FIFA fined the Danish Football Association after fans threw objects at Australian fans and displayed a\u201csexist banner.\u201d\n\u2022Also on June 24, Poland was fined for a\u201cpolitical and offensive banner.\u201d\n\u2022On June 30, both Russia and Serbia were fined for fans displaying a neo-Nazi banner.\n\u2022Even the Sputnik story mentions the case of Croatian player Domagoj Vida, who was almost sanctioned by FIFA after he appeared in a social media video chanting \u201cSlava Ukraini,\u201d (Glory to Ukarine) after his team\u2019s victory over Russia on July 7. While many people do not consider \u201cSlava Ukraini\u201d to be a nationalist or discriminatory chant, FIFA did give Vida a warning. The assistant coach Ognjen Vukojevic, who also appeared in the video, was suspended from his duties and the Croatian Football Association was fined as well.\n\u2022A large group of Russian fans can be seen on a Twitter video on July 7, chanting epithets at the Croatian team following Vida\u2019s remark.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of the Sputnik article is that it was limited to the topic of football, while the two presidents discussed much more than just sports. Even on the Kremlin\u2019s official website we see the Croatian president reference the recent NATO summit as well as the then upcoming summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, but the transcript cuts off after that.\n\nPresident Grabar-Kitarovic\u2019s government Web site mentions her congratulations to Putin for a \u201chighly successful\u201d World Cup, but did not go on to mention her quoted comments on \u201cstatements of hatred.\u201d Her Web site went on to discuss more substantive issues, such as bi-lateral relations, economic cooperation and even the air quality in Slavonski Brod, a city in eastern Croatia, where Russia is credited with agreeing to allow cleaner Croatian gas to supply a refinery just across the border in Serbia.\n\nNone of that could be seen in the Sputnik article and most of it was excluded from the Kremlin transcript. Yet the praise for Russia\u2019s role in the World Cup remains. Polygraph.info sought comment from the Croatian government or President Grabar-Kitarovic\u2019s office in three separate e-mails, receiving no response.\n\nThis would not be the first time Russian media has quoted a foreign leader while leaving out vital context. In June, Polygraph.info reported the Russian state-owned news agency TASS\u2019s misrepresentation of Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz\u2019s comments during an official state visit. The TASS story portrayed Kurz\u2019s words as praise for Russia and its role in the Syrian and Ukrainian conflicts, while omitting his comments about upholding EU sanctions against Russia and the need for that country to uphold its end of the Minsk II agreements to resolve the conflict in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region.\n\nPolygraph.info was only able to discover the full context of those comments, in June, when the chancellor\u2019s office responded with more information.", "lang": "en"}
