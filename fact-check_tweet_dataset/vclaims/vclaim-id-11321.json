But they favor other security measures, including more Border Patrol agents and technology surveillance. They\u2019ve introduced and co-sponsored legislation toward those goals.\n\nAnd the $1.6 billion Trump claims is financing the border wall came from a $1.3 trillion spending package passed in the House and Senate with support from Democrats.\n\nThe White House did not provide supporting evidence for Trump\u2019s claim nor comment on the record.\n\nTrump in March reluctantly signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill, setting aside his threats to veto it because it did not include all the money he wanted for a border wall.\n\nThe bill included $1.6 billion explicitly designated for new and replacement fencing along the southwest border. That amount also covered $38 million for border barrier planning and design, and $196 million for acquisition and deployment of border security technology.\n\nAlthough the appropriations bill said the money was for fencing, Trump has touted it as being money for the wall he promised. In his claims, he\u2019s left out that some Democrats supported the measure.\n\nThe spending package passed in the Senate, 65-32, with 39 Democrats voting in its favor. In the House, it passed 256-167, with 111 Democrats supporting it.\n\nDemocrats have criticized a full-length version of Trump\u2019s proposed border wall as a waste of money. Instead most have pushed for other ways to secure the border.\n\nThey also opposed a June immigration bill introduced by Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., (which Trump initially supported). Aside from border wall funding, Goodlatte\u2019s bill included cuts to legal immigration and allowed so-called Dreamers to stay in the United States on a renewable nonimmigrant status. Democrats and moderate Republicans said the bill did not offer a permanent solution for Dreamers.\n\nOver the years, Democrats have sponsored and supported proposals to help secure the border and voted in favor of appropriation bills funding U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the federal agency in charge of enforcing immigration laws at the border.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York in 2013 sponsored a bill directing the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit two reports on border security strategy, including one on where fencing, infrastructure and technology should be used; authorized the use of the National Guard to help secure the border; called for an increase in the number of Border Patrol agents at the southern border, and other border security measures. The Senate passed the bill but it was not taken up in the House.\n\nMore recently, 30 Democrats co-sponsored a House bill introduced in January by Republican Rep. Will Hurd of Texas.\n\nThe bill intended to protect Dreamers from deportation. It also called for the deployment of \"the most practical and effective technology\" to achieve operational control of the border. Within a year of the bill\u2019s enactment, it directed the Department of Homeland Security to submit to Congress a comprehensive southern border strategy that included details on physical barriers, levees, technologies, tools, and other devices to secure the border.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware and the late Sen. John McCain of Arizona in February sponsored legislation similar to Hurd\u2019s House version. That proposal also authorized $110 million per year for five years for collaboration between local law enforcement and CBP.\n\nRep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., in January said that while the border wall was \"a monumental waste of taxpayers\u2019 money,\" he would be in favor of it if that\u2019s what it took to help Dreamers.\n\nTrump said, \"Democrats oppose any effort to secure our border.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s broad swipe fails to capture other actions under border security that Democrats have supported. Democrats have sponsored and backed legislation for border security, including surveillance technology.\n\nTrump also claims that the border wall is under construction and that he got $1.6 billion from Congress for it, but leaves out that Democrats also voted in favor of that appropriation.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim is inaccurate.
