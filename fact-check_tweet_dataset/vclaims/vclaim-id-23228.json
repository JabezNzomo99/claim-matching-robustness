Having worked down there pretty much most of the last 30 years, inside Mexico and in Central America, the cartels are really still the problem. ... At half a trillion dollars \u2014 $500 billion \u2014 that makes the cartel business and the drug traffic just in Mexico alone coming across to the United States bigger than Walmart.\u201d (Walmart reported just over $500 billion in revenue for 2018.)\n\n\u201cSenator Perdue intended to cite the $500 billion figure to reference the estimated value of the entire international drug trade,\u201d an aide to the senator said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \u201cThe senator was doing so during a line of questioning that emphasized the outsize role that the Mexican cartels play in that trade, particularly as it relates to the United States.\u201d\n\nWhen we asked about this, Perdue\u2019s staff modified the transcript of his remarks in their news release. It\u2019s an odd way to go about a correction. Perdue is now quoted in the news release talking about worldwide drug trafficking, but that\u2019s not what he said in the hearing and the news release doesn\u2019t mention the original error.\n\nCriticizing another estimate, the Rand study says: \u201cThe $20 billion figure appears to come from multiplying a $525-per-pound markup by an estimate from the Mexican government that 35 million pounds were produced in Mexico and then rounding up. However, no data support the claim that U.S. users consume 35 million pounds (~16,000 metric tons) per year, let alone that they consume this much marijuana from Mexico. ... This is three times the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime\u2019s ... upper bound for total U.S. consumption and nearly four times the amount estimated by the Drug Enforcement Administration.\u201d\n\u2022 None roughly $15.5 billion, though we note there\u2019s a wide disparity in the marijuana estimates. In a 2007 report, the Government Accountability Office said : \u201cAccording to the National Drug Intelligence Center, drug proceeds in Mexico in 2005 ranged from $2.9 billion to $6.2 billion for cocaine (including Central America), $324 million to $736 million for heroin, $3.9 billion to $14.3 billion for marijuana, and $794 million to $1.9 billion for methamphetamine. Mexican drug traffickers also grow marijuana in the United States; therefore, the amount of proceeds returned to Mexico is likely greater than the reported estimates.\u201d Adding up the midpoints for each range, the total would be, though we note there\u2019s a wide disparity in the marijuana estimates.\n\u2022 None between $18 billion and $39 billion in wholesale drug proceeds annually, a large portion of which is believed to be bulk-smuggled out of the United States at the Southwest Border.\u201d The Department of Justice\u2019s National Drug Intelligence Center estimated in 2008 that \u201cMexican and Colombian DTOs [drug-trafficking organizations] generate, remove, and launderin wholesale drug proceeds annually, a large portion of which is believed to be bulk-smuggled out of the United States at the Southwest Border.\u201d\n\u2022 None from $19 [billion] to $29 billion \u2014 travels annually from the United States into Mexico to fuel the operations of the increasingly violent and brazen criminal enterprises involved in drug trafficking.\u201d In 2010, the Department of Homeland Security was working with a different range. In a passage that doesn\u2019t mention Colombia, a DHS report said \u201can extraordinary amount of cash \u2014 estimates range\u2014 travels annually from the United States into Mexico to fuel the operations of the increasingly violent and brazen criminal enterprises involved in drug trafficking.\u201d\n\u2022 None some US $11 [billion] per year.\u201d Mexico\u2019s attorney general in 2007 said \u201cMexican banks receive about $1 billion from their US counterparts annually, but return up to $16 billion, of which about $10 billion \u2018does not have an explanation \u2026 and could be attributed to the flow of drug trafficking money,\u2019 \u201d this report adds. The U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime in a 2011 report said : \u201cAccording to estimates collected for a study on US-Mexico Security Cooperation (2010), the Mexican Government estimated drug-related cash flows from the USA to Mexico atper year.\u201d Mexico\u2019s attorney general in 2007 said \u201cMexican banks receive about $1 billion from their US counterparts annually, but return up to $16 billion, of which about $10 billion \u2018does not have an explanation \u2026 and could be attributed to the flow of drug trafficking money,\u2019 \u201d this report adds.\n\u2022 None well over $21 billion each year.\u201d Reuters reported in 2018 that \u201cthe cash-rich cartels [are] believed by the Mexican government to generateeach year.\u201d\n\u2022 None $5 billion to $7.5 billion, assuming El Chapo brought in $3 billion a year and had cornered 40 percent to 60 percent of the market. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in a 2018 report noted that the Sinaloa cartel, until recently run by Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, \u201cby some estimates ... had grown to control 40%-60% of Mexico\u2019s drug trade by 2012 and had annual earnings calculated to be as high as $3 billion.\u201d That would indicate the drug trade in Mexico was, assuming El Chapo brought in $3 billion a year and had cornered 40 percent to 60 percent of the market.\n\u2022 None $6 billion to $8 billion in Mexican drug-trafficking organizations\u2019 gross revenue from export and distribution of marijuana, cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine to wholesale markets near the American Southwest. The lead researcher, Beau Kilmer, told us that covers product trafficked by the Mexican cartels, but the drugs themselves might come from Mexico or another country such as Colombia. The 2010 study by Rand is careful to limit its scope. It estimatedin Mexican drug-trafficking organizations\u2019 gross revenue from export and distribution of marijuana, cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine to wholesale markets near the American Southwest. The lead researcher, Beau Kilmer, told us that covers product trafficked by the Mexican cartels, but the drugs themselves might come from Mexico or another country such as Colombia.\n\n\u201cWe did not estimate DTO revenues from moving the product throughout the U.S. or attempt to calculate their revenues from non-drug-trade activities,\u201d Kilmer wrote in an email. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for funding to update that analysis, but have not had any success. Given changes in U.S. drug use patterns, state-level drug laws and drug prices, I\u2019m sure that the distribution of the export revenues attributable to cannabis, cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine has changed. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the total figure grew larger, but I cannot tell you by how much.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re told Perdue meant to reference the worldwide drug trade. But there was no ambiguity in what he said: \u201cI want to focus on Mexico\u201d and \u201cat half a trillion dollars \u2014 $500 billion \u2014 that makes the cartel business and the drug traffic just in Mexico alone coming across to the United States bigger than Walmart.\u201d Perdue said twice that his question was focused on Mexico to the exclusion of other countries, and his office and campaign later amplified these remarks. His intentions were completely undetectable.", "lang": "en"}
