That\u2019s around 7% of all staff leaving in that year.\n\nThese figures are at record levels in recent years, as are the levels of staff from the UK leaving the NHS. But these levels were also increasing before the referendum.\n\nNone of these figures tell us whether the staff left the country or not, or whether their reason for leaving was in any way connected to the EU referendum result.\n\nThere\u2019s actually more to these figures than meets the eye.\n\nThe information about where a staff member is from is self-reported\u2014meaning that it could refer to their country of birth, their citizenship or their cultural heritage. NHS Digital, which publish the figures, also points out that the number of staff of \u201cunknown nationality\u201d leaving the NHS has decreased. As more people provide their nationality, it will increase the numbers in the other \u201cknown nationality\u201d groups.\n\nThese figures don\u2019t just include staff who leave the NHS permanently, they also count staff going on a career break or on maternity leave. We\u2019ve asked NHS Digital what proportion of \u201cleavers\u201d this would apply to.\n\nWe don\u2019t know why the 10,000 staff covered above left. But separate figures, looking at 5,700 NHS staff from the EU who left NHS England between June 2016 and March this year, examined why they had left. Again these figures include staff who may not have left permanently.\n\nAbout 30% of staff had an unknown reason for leaving. Another 24% resigned their post voluntarily because they \u201crelocated\u201d, 12% resigned voluntarily for \u201cother\u201d reasons and 9% left because their fixed term contract had ended.\n\nWhile the number of EU staff leaving the NHS has increased over the last few years, the number of EU staff working in the NHS has continued to increase. There were about 61,600 staff who said they were from the EU working in NHS England in June 2017.\n\nThese figures don\u2019t include GPs and other staff working in GP practices.", "lang": "en"}
