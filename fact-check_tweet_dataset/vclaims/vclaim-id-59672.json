The defendants in these cases would be held liable only if they failed to make reasonable efforts to follow public health guidelines and committed an act of gross negligence or intentional misconduct.\n\nSchumer was talking about another part of the bill, which would create a federal cause of action for medical malpractice cases involving the coronavirus. A health-care worker or facility would be held liable in court only for an act of gross negligence or intentional misconduct, as the bill is written. The Cornyn-McConnell proposal also would establish federal jurisdiction over all these cases, preempting similar lawsuits in state courts, which experts say have less onerous standards of proof for medical malpractice claims. The Republican bill says the liability shield would be in place until the federal government\u2019s coronavirus disaster declaration expired or 2024, whichever is sooner.\n\nRight off the bat, Schumer\u2019s claim suffers from a big inaccuracy. He said the bill would allow \u201cno medical malpractice lawsuits until 2024, even if they\u2019re not covid-related.\u201d The Senate minority leader did himself no favors by speaking in absolutes. The text of the Cornyn-McConnell bill clearly says patients can sue \u2014 and win if they prove gross negligence or intentional misconduct.\n\nA Schumer spokesman said the senator\u2019s claim was accurate because the GOP bill creates an all-purpose loophole. The legislation defines the \u201ccoronavirus-related health care services\u201d covered by the liability shield as including \u201cthe care of any individual who is admitted to, presents to, receives services from, or resides at, a health care provider for any purpose during the period of a Federal emergency declaration concerning coronavirus, if such provider\u2019s decisions or activities with respect to such individual are impacted as a result of coronavirus.\u201d\n\nReading that language closely, medical malpractice cases that don\u2019t involve covid-19 would be blocked by the liability shield in some circumstances, if the coronavirus \u201cimpacted\u201d the health-care provider or facility. Schumer spokesman Justin Goodman said that \u201cthe provider can be expected to say that the pandemic impacted their decisions and activities for all services they provided.\u201d\n\nA Senate Republican spokesman rejected that interpretation, noting that health-care providers being sued in these cases would have to offer proof that they were overburdened by the coronavirus. \u201cIt isn\u2019t enough for them to just \u2018say\u2019 it,\u201d the Senate GOP spokesman said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how the American legal system works. Murder defendants don\u2019t avoid trial by just saying \u2018I didn\u2019t do it.\u2019 Judges and juries decide those questions.\u201d\n\nIn a floor speech May 12 about a previous version of the bill, McConnell said: \u201cTo be clear now, we are not talking about immunity from lawsuits. There will be accountability for actual gross negligence and intentional misconduct. That will continue. We aren\u2019t going to provide immunity, but we are going to provide some certainty. \u2026 We are going to make sure it is the trial lawyers and not struggling job creators who will need to clear a very high legal burden.\u201d\n\n\u201cSchumer was right, though one needs to understand how the bill works in order to understand why he was right,\u201d David C. Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown University, wrote in an email. \u201cThere are a number of provisions of the bill that taken together make it impossible, or virtually impossible, to sue a health-care provider. Let\u2019s start with someone [who is] sick with the virus and doesn\u2019t get medical care that any competent provider would give. That person cannot sue, because the bill nullifies most state tort law and permits only cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct to proceed. The bill\u2019s definitions are even tighter than most state law, and, thus, unless the provider intended to inflict harm, the case would be dismissed at the threshold.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, if someone goes in for open heart surgery, and the MD is negligent and she dies, this law would not in my view protect that doctor from liability,\u201d Hoffman wrote in an email. But she and Vladeck both pointed to another potential loophole, where the bill says \u201cacts, omissions, or decisions resulting from a resource or staffing shortage shall not be considered willful misconduct or gross negligence.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo if someone dies of covid-related complications because no doctor, nurse, or respiratory therapist was available, that\u2019s not enough to make out a claim because a staffing or resource shortage would not be considered gross negligence or willful misconduct,\u201d Hoffman wrote, adding that \u201cthis provision makes me wonder what happens if covid-related care creates spillover elsewhere, such as shortages of ER staff, which then causes people who come in with more routine emergencies to be harmed or die. Is that a coronavirus-related medical liability action?\u201d", "lang": "en"}
