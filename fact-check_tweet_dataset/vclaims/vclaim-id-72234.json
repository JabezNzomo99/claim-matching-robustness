The state\u2019s increases were supposed to stop when the minimum wage hit $9 an hour last year. But then Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo struck a deal with state lawmakers in March to raise it to $15 an hour over the next several years.\n\nThe higher minimum wage is bad for businesses, which already struggle with taxes and regulations, said New York State Conservative Party Chairman Michael R. Long.\n\nThe state is \"already showing signs of various companies picking up and leaving,\" Long said.\n\nWhen asked about his claim, Long said he was not referring to any particular company.\n\n\"All someone needs to do is look at upstate,\" Long said.\n\nSo is Long right? Are some businesses leaving New York because of the higher minimum wage?\n\nThe state\u2019s hourly minimum wage has risen from $7.25 - still the federal level - to $9 since 2013.\n\nTipped workers, like those in the restaurant and hospitality industries, also saw a minimum wage increase in the last year. They used to make around $5 an hour without tips. They are now paid $6.80 to $7.65, depending on the industry and tips earned.\n\nStarting at the end of this year, a new set of minimum wage increases will be phased in across the state.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 New York City will reach $15 by the end of 2018. Small businesses in New York City have until the end of 2019.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 Westchester County and Long Island will reach $15 an hour in 2021.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 Upstate New York will reach $12.50 by the end of 2020. The Department of Labor will then determine the wage increase each year until the region hits $15.\n\nWages for tipped workers will increase at a different rate.\n\nStarting in 2019, the governor can pause the increase if it appears to cause more harm than good.\n\nCompanies moving out of New York\n\nWhen we spoke to Long about his claim, he said he did not have any particular company in mind.\n\nWe also reached out to business groups, including two chambers of commerce across the state's southern border, to see if they knew of any business that had moved or plan to move because of the state's rising minimum wage. They were able to provide examples of businesses that closed, but could not point to a company that moved out of state because of the wage increase. We also could not find any reports of businesses relocating because of the wage increase.\n\nSome suggested minimum wage was a factor in Verizon's decision to relocate jobs from two call centers in New York, but a representative from Verizon said the state's wage was not a factor in the move.\n\nWe found a handful of small business owners who said that minimum wage increases \u2013 or the prospect of more increases \u2013 were a factor in the failure of their businesses. There is no way to prove that, but restaurants and other small business often operate with little margin for error. Anything that increases costs \u2013 higher rents, more expensive food or other costs, higher wages \u2013 can hurt their businesses.\n\nBob and Ron\u2019s Fish Fry in Albany County closed in April after the new wage increase became law. The restaurant posted on its Facebook page that rising costs sunk it.\n\n\"Mainly the economy, high cost of seafood, demand,\" the business wrote in a post on the social media site, \"And to be honest there is no way we could pay the high minimum wage that is coming and mandatory 3 months paid sick leave- this state is going in the wrong direction for small businesses- that's the main reasons.\"\n\nWhen the Del Rio Diner in Brooklyn closed in July, it also cited the higher wage.\n\n\"The minimum wage, that\u2019s what broke the camel\u2019s back. It killed us,\" Larry Georgeton, the diner\u2019s co-owner, told Brooklyn Daily.\n\nNot only restaurants complained. A family-owned Ramada Hotel in Buffalo closed in July. The owner told The Buffalo News that higher wages and stricter regulations influenced their decision.\n\n\"It has been difficult to compete with all the new properties being built in Western New York, along with all the new proposed increases in wages and state regulations,\" Richard A. DiVita Jr., the hotel\u2019s chief operating officer, told the newspaper.\n\nThe owner of a restaurant that closed in East Aurora after 14 years of business also placed blame on the state\u2019s rising minimum wage.\n\nThe businesses also faced challenges outside of the minimum wage including the cost of resources and more competition.\n\nLong, the state\u2019s Conservative Party chairman, said New York State is \"already showing signs of various companies picking up and leaving\" because of the new minimum-wage legislation.\n\nWe found a handful of businesses that cited the higher minimum wage as a factor for closing. But we couldn't find any companies that relocated out of New York State because of the wage increase.\n\nWe rate this claim as Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
