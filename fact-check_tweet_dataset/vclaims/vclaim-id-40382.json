Let\u2019s check the authenticity of the claim.\n\nWhen the image in the post is subjected to reverse image search technique, a link that had the same image was obtained in the search results. From the information, the name of that flower was found to be \u2018Saguaro\u2019. It was found that it blooms every year in the months of May-June. \u2018Saguaro\u2019 flower is the state flower of Arizona, a state in America. So, the claim made in the post is false.\n\nWhen the image in the post is subjected to reverse image search technique, many search results were obtained. Information in a few of those search results hinted that the flower in the image is \u2018Salvia Hot Lips\u2019. So, when searched on Google with that name, an article by \u2018The Guardian\u2019 was obtained in the search result. The article had a similar image and the information in the article corroborated that the flower is \u2018Salvia Hot Lips\u2019. The plants are mainly found in southeastern Arizona and in the mountains of Eastern, Western, and Southern Mexico. \u2018Salvia Hot Lips\u2019 plant blooms every year from early summer to frost.\n\nWhen the image in the post is cropped and subjected to reverse image search technique, a link of a website that had the same image was obtained in the search results. From the article in that link, the name of that flower was found to be \u2018Protea cynaroides\u2019. It is the national flower of the Republic of South Africa. \u2018Protea cynaroides\u2019 or \u2018King Protea\u2019 blooms all throughout the year, with a concentration in the summer months.\n\nAlso, many other pictures of different flowers are falsely being shared as \u2018Mahameru Flowers\u2019. During the search process, no information was found about the existence of \u2018Mahameru Flowers\u2019 in the Himalayas.
