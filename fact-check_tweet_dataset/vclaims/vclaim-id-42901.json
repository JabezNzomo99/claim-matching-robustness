One nurse replies that \u201cit was getting bad,\u201d but then manufacturing had ramped up and filled the gap. But, he added, there was a shortage of personnel.\n\nShe added, \u201cI\u2019ve been reusing my N95 mask for a few weeks now. I just broke out a new one to come here, just in case I needed to wear it.\u201d She makes a few more remarks and then adds, \u201cMy youngest patient has been four days old \u2014 a four-day-old infant. And so PPE has been sporadic, but it\u2019s been manageable, and we do what we have to do. We\u2019re nurses, and we learn to adapt and we do whatever the best thing that we can do for our patients to get the job done and get the care provided. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to continue to do as covid-19 continues.\u201d\n\nIn the video, her comments are shortened to, \u201cI\u2019ve been reusing my N95 mask for a few weeks now \u2026 so PPE has been sporadic.\u201d Any nuance \u2014 that she is talking about \u201cpockets of areas,\u201d that it is an \u201cunprecedented time\u201d and that it has been \u201cmanageable\u201d \u2014 is missing.\n\nThe impression left is that Trump is a jerk, cutting Thomas off mid-sentence and then folding his arms in a defiant stance. But that\u2019s misleading, especially because she said she agreed with him. (We acknowledge that being challenged by a president might make many people back off a bit, but that\u2019s still not an excuse for eliminating her response.)\n\nThe rest of the video shows Trump bragging about \u201ctremendous supply.\u201d It leaves out the fact that two other nurses at the event told Trump that they did not see any issues, including one nurse from New Jersey who said that she often saw news reports about supply issues, but that \u201cin reality, I\u2019m not seeing it. I\u2019m in a hot zone right now.\u201d\n\nThomas\u2019s comment did appear to surprise Trump, but it\u2019s worth noting that the Food and Drug Administration on its website (updated for May 7) acknowledged that \u201cthe supply chain for these [PPE] devices will continue to be stressed if demand exceeds available supplies.\u201d Some manufacturers were distributing PPE based on previous usage, not projected use, the FDA said, adding that \u201cincreased use may exceed the available supply of PPE, resulting in shortages at some healthcare organizations.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump could have prepared the United States for the coronavirus, but instead of heeding warnings from Vice President Biden, public health experts, and the intelligence community, Trump wasted precious months downplaying the threat and blithely praising the Chinese government\u2019s spin,\u201d Michael Gwin, a Biden campaign spokesman, said in a statement to The Fact Checker. \u201cTrump\u2019s failure to act quickly \u2014 and his erratic leadership since \u2014 has left America dangerously behind where we need to be, especially in getting basic life-saving protective gear to nurses, doctors, and other essential workers on the frontlines of this fight. However, instead of listening to the direct concerns of nurses and other heroes combating the coronavirus about the shortages of protective equipment they face, Trump decided to throw a tantrum in the Oval Office and downplay the fact that health care workers are being forced to risk their lives every day because he has abjectly failed to do his job.\u201d\n\nThe campaign also pointed to a survey of nurses in the Boston area published May 7 that found that 50 percent say there is not enough PPE, and an April 16 memo from Veterans Affairs that says current protective medical gear supply levels \u201cdo not support providing a mask\u201d to all staff at its hospitals.\n\nOur main issue with this video is how it was edited to leave a misleading impression. Trump appeared to be taken aback by Thomas\u2019s comment, but the video leaves out much of her nuanced presentation. Then it cuts her response to Trump\u2019s query, making it appear as if he cut her off in mid-sentence, when in fact she said she agreed with the president. Then an added edit highlights the moment Trump crosses his arms.\n\nWhether Trump was listening to Thomas could be subject to dispute, but the video is edited to leave no other possibility. Trump challenged Thomas, but he did not cut her off. Still, PPE resources are still stretched in some communities, so her comment was not out of line.", "lang": "en"}
