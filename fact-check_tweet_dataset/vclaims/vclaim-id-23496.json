The video was shared on the afternoon of May 23 and within barely five hours, it garnered over one lakh views and 1,700 shares. In the video, PM Modi can be seen spending leisure time with his mother. Social media users claimed that the video was shot after BJP\u2019s massive victory in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, the video was viewed by more than 119,000 people from the page \u0938\u092c \u091c\u0928 \u0915\u0940 \u0916\u092c\u0930 . The video bears the logo of ShareChat, thus, hinting that it was earlier circulated on the social networking application.\n\nAlt News found that the video was not recently shot, but is from 2014. When we searched for the video using the keywords \u201cPM modi with his mother\u201d, we were unable to locate any recent clips. Upon scrolling a little further, we found that the same video was uploaded by ABP News in 2014.\n\nAccording to the report, PM Modi visited his mother before going to Delhi after he had become the Prime Minister for the first time in the 2014 general elections. PM Modi\u2019s clothes match the one in the video currently viral.\n\nWe also found that the original video was flipped and circulated online. In the viral clip, PM Modi can be seen sitting on his mother\u2019s right. However, in the 2014 ABP News footage, the Prime Minister is seated on his mother\u2019s left. The distinction is depicted in the photo montage posted below.", "lang": "en"}
