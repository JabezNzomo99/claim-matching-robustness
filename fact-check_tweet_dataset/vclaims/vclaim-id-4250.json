A member of Durga Vahini of RSS, Sandhya Phadke, took up the challenge and entered the ring. Watch the video to see what happened next \u2013 translated).\n\nThe above message accompanied with a video shows a freestyle wrestler throwing an open challenge to the crowd. Then, a woman in a saffron colour salwar kameez accepts the challenge and gets inside the ring. The wrestler takes the first strike and the woman in salwar kameez can be seen thrown off to a corner, but then she gets up and repeatedly pummels the wrestler, who is then rescued by a group of men.\n\nThat a Pakistani wrestler was defeated by an RSS member was shared by individual users on Facebook. It was circulating on WhatsApp.\n\nA Twitter user called ANAND tweeted the same message along with the video.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nAlt News had already debunked this video a year ago when it was widely circulated on social media. It is now being shared again. The freestyle wrestler seen in the video is NOT from Pakistan. She is Indian. Her name is BB Bull Bull. She is India\u2019s first professional wrestler. The lady in the saffron salwar kameez is Kavita Devi. Devi is a Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighter and former powerlifter from Haryana. She recently created history when she became the first female Indian wrestler to feature in the WWE.\n\nAccording to a report by The News Minute, the event was organised by Continental Wrestling Entertainment in Jalandhar in 2016. The CWE is an Indian professional wrestling promotion and training academy which is founded and owned by Indian-American professional wrestler The Great Khali. The same video can be seen on the YouTube channel of CWE. Moreover, Durga Vahini is the women\u2019s wing of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and NOT the RSS as claimed in this viral post.\n\nIt has been observed that nationalism is a popular theme with fake news purveyors who seek to incite popular sentiment through the use of misleading images and/or videos. This is yet another such instance wherein a harmless video of a wrestling bout meant purely for entertainment purposes is given a false, hyper-nationalistic spin.\n\n[Update: This article was updated on January 28, 2020, and on April 27, 2020, after the clip resurfaced with false claims.]", "lang": "en"}
