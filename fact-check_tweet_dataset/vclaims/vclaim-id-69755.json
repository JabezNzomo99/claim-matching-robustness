Dino Rossi,\" the voiceover in the ad says. \"Rossi first showed up in Olympia decades ago. He went to work! Health care stripped from 45,000 children.\"\n\nThey\u2019re referencing a 2003 budget measure, back when Rossi was the state Senate Ways and Means chairman.\n\nThe budget was looking bleak, so Republicans proposed large spending cuts that year. One, proposed by Rossi, was a $50 million cut in Medicaid spending. The cut would have eliminated coverage for nearly 40,000 low-income children, according to reporting at the time.\n\nBut the cut didn\u2019t fly with Democrats, and ended up being scrapped in the final budget. The final budget, which won bipartisan support, wasn't a specific cut, but it did include rules changes. Those changes ultimately resulted in the loss of coverage for 45,000 kids on Medicaid.\n\nWhile it didn\u2019t change any of the eligibility requirements, the budget changed state Medicaid policy in a way that lead to an enrollment decline later reported by state health care agencies. We were unable to trace this measure back to Rossi himself, but he did vote in its favor.\n\nFirst, it ended continuous eligibility, which meant if a family\u2019s income was over the income standard, the child\u2019s medical coverage would end. Second, certification periods went from every 12 to every six months. A signature became necessary for renewal, ending telephone renewals. Third, it adopted new income verification requirements; while it previously accepted a family\u2019s statements, it now verified the information provided through available databases.\n\n\"These changes were requested by the legislature and they did have the impact of reducing the children\u2019s caseload by at least 45,000,\" said Amy Blondin, chief communications officer for the Washington State Health Care Authority.\n\nAndrew Bell, spokesman for Dino Rossi, said the changes Rossi pushed forward in the budget ensured resources were given to the neediest families.\n\n\"So it seems like the HCA is saying that that was a combination of families who were making enough money to afford healthcare themselves moved off of Medicaid coverage, and a reduction in wealthy families who were cheating the system and taking health care from poorer families,\" Bell said. \"Either way, this seems to leave more resources available for truly needy families (which is the standard we've always used).\"\n\nThat\u2019s one way to interpret the drop.\n\nUsing data from the Medical Assistance Administration, the University of Washington Health Policy Analysis Program found most children leaving Medicaid weren\u2019t ineligible in an April 2004 study.\n\n\"In fact, only about 20 to 30 percent of the children removed are ineligible for Medicaid,\" the report read. \"Most are eligible but are inhibited from getting coverage because of the administrative barriers and hurdles described above.\"\n\nWhen the first two rules changed back (and income verification stay put) in 2005, the numbers mostly returned to normal.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think that \u2018wealthy\u2019 families were taking advantage of the program given the bounce back in enrollment,\" said Tricia Brooks, senior fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Children and Families.\n\nThe ad said Rossi stripped health care from 45,000 children.\n\nRossi wasn\u2019t solely responsible for the move, but he did support it. The 2003 Washington state Senate budget measure he voted for increased administrative hurdles for children seeking Medicaid coverage. Most of the eligible children regained coverage when the rules changed back in 2005.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
