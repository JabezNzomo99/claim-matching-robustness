While some viruses are seasonal, it\u2019s not yet clear if the new virus will follow the same pattern \u2014 and experts caution against banking on the weather to resolve the outbreak.\n\nThe outbreak of a respiratory illness now known as coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, began in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. According to the World Health Organization, as of Feb. 13, the virus has infected more than 46,000 people and killed at least 1,116.\n\nSome scientists and others have speculated that if the new coronavirus is similar to influenza and some other viruses, it could dissipate once temperatures rise and humidity increases. But right now, that\u2019s an unknown, and whether the virus will decline by April may also hinge on other factors, including the degree of spread and the effectiveness of containment efforts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible, but it is wishful thinking, by analogy with flu and other winter respiratory viruses,\u201d Columbia University epidemiologist Stephen Morse told us of an April timeframe. \u201cI\u2019d say wait until April, we\u2019ll know then if it\u2019s true.\u201d In the meantime, he recommended continuing to attempt to control the virus, and not being \u201clulled by hopeful, but quite possibly wrong analogies.\u201d\n\nThe president first referenced the weather potentially helping with the outbreak in an early morning tweet on Feb. 7, when he said he had just spoken on the phone with President Xi Jinping of China.\n\n\u201cNothing is easy,\u201d Trump said, but Xi \u201cwill be successful, especially as the weather starts to warm & the virus hopefully becomes weaker, and then gone.\u201d\n\nSeveral days later, in a White House meeting with state governors, he repeated the idea and was more specific on the outbreak\u2019s timeline.\n\nAt the time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had confirmed 12 cases in the U.S., although the agency announced an additional case in California that day. As of Feb. 13, the tally had risen to a total of 15.\n\nLater in his remarks to the governors, Trump praised China for \u201cdoing a good job\u201d with the outbreak, and again mentioned his call with the Chinese leader.\n\n\u201cI had a long talk with President Xi \u2014 for the people in this room \u2014 two nights ago, and he feels very confident,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe feels very confident. And he feels that, again, as I mentioned, by April or during the month of April, the heat, generally speaking, kills this kind of virus.\u201d\n\nTrump also said similar things at his rally in New Hampshire that evening.\n\nThere is a scientific basis for some of Trump\u2019s comments, as many respiratory viruses ebb in spring and summer, possibly because the warmer, wetter conditions hamper viral spread. But it\u2019s unknown if that applies to the new coronavirus \u2014 and it wouldn\u2019t be that the virus \u201cmiraculously goes away.\u201d\n\nNumerous human viruses, including influenza and some other coronaviruses (there are several), are seasonal, typically striking in the cooler months, with cases declining as summer nears. Scientists aren\u2019t exactly sure why this happens, but one of the prevailing theories is that it\u2019s because of the weather.\n\n\u201cWe know that some respiratory viruses in the air or on surfaces lose their ability to infect cells under warmer and moderately humid conditions,\u201d Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech, said in an email.\n\nMarr, who has studied viral survival under different environmental conditions, said the mechanism for this is unknown \u2014 and could involve various parts of the virus, including the viral envelope, surface proteins or genome \u2014 but there appears to be something about the colder, drier air that allows some viruses to better survive and spread. \u201cOnce the weather warms up, conditions are not as favorable for virus survival,\u201d she said.\n\nSeveral studies have found that absolute humidity in particular may be especially important in driving some of these effects. Absolute humidity, Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch explained, is essentially the amount of moisture in the air. \u201cThis is always low when it\u2019s cold because cold air can\u2019t hold much water or it will start to rain,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nLipsitch is a co-author on a paper that found in models of seasonal flu, outbreaks in temperate regions tend to start once absolute humidity levels fall.\n\nBeyond direct interactions between the environment and the virus, seasonality of certain viruses could also be due to social factors, such as the school calendar or indoor crowding, as well as changes in a person\u2019s immune system.\n\nExperiments in mice, for instance, have shown that inhalation of dry air may weaken the immune response against influenza infection. Some scientists have also suspected that in the winter, less sun exposure could lead to lower vitamin D levels, which could then potentially reduce the body\u2019s ability to fight off a virus.\n\nMarr said there wasn\u2019t yet a consensus among scientists about what leads some viruses to be seasonal \u2014 and it could be a mix of factors. \u201cIt could be due to differences in virus survival in air and on surfaces and/or it could be due to seasonal changes in people\u2019s immune function,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is an area of active research.\u201d\n\nDavid Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, agreed, noting that the drivers of viral seasonality are \u201coften hard to identify with certainty as so many environmental and behavioral factors change in tandem.\u201d\n\nUnknown If New Virus Is Seasonal\n\nWhether the new virus will be seasonal \u2014 and the outbreak improved by shifting weather \u2014 is unknown.\n\nLooking back to 2003\u2019s outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, Lipsitch said weather \u201cmay have helped a little,\u201d but that the outbreak subsided because of \u201cvery intensive control efforts based on quarantine of contacts and isolation of cases.\u201d The new virus is fairly similar to the SARS virus, sharing approximately 80% of its genome, which is reflected in its new name, SARS-CoV-2.\n\nLipsitch added that his ongoing analyses \u201cdo seem to show a little less transmission in more summery conditions\u201d for the new coronavirus and some other human coronaviruses responsible for common colds. But, he said, \u201cthat is not likely to be enough\u201d to make the new virus \u201c\u2018go away\u2019 on its own.\u201d\n\nMorse, the Columbia epidemiologist, noted that in Canada, one SARS outbreak was controlled by mid-April, but another peaked in late May. Another coronavirus, the one responsible for Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, thrives in high-temperature Gulf countries, suggesting it\u2019s not particularly susceptible to environmental conditions. But outbreaks of both viruses were driven by health care transmissions, Morse said, which so far does not appear to be the case with the new virus.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if this virus will be seasonal, because we haven\u2019t had previous experience with this virus, and SARS and MERS are not necessarily good analogies,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s possible it will be seasonal, but it\u2019s too early to tell, so it\u2019s just speculation.\u201d\n\nWhile the new virus could behave similarly to flu, several epidemiologists noted that there are additional reasons not to assume that will be the case.\n\nFor one, even though flu generally subsides in temperate regions when summer rolls around, there are instances in which flu has not always obeyed its own calendar.\n\n\u201cA number of flu pandemics have come in late spring or summer,\u201d Morse said, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic flu and the 1957 flu in the U.S.\n\nInfluenza viruses, too, do not show typical seasonal patterns in tropical areas, and the new coronavirus has already landed in those parts of the world.\n\nThe new coronavirus \u201cseems to circulate quite nicely in tropical areas,\u201d such as Singapore, Fisman said in an email, \u201cso it seems to me unlikely that it would stop circulating simply because of warmer weather.\u201d\n\nLipsitch added that if temperature or humidity are important factors for this new virus, air conditioning could undermine some of the potential benefit hot and humid climates bring.\n\n\u201cAn April end to the outbreak would be truly astonishing,\u201d Lipsitch said. \u201cI think it will just be getting under way in much of the world.\u201d\n\nMarr, who thinks it\u2019s \u201clikely\u201d the outbreak will \u201cdie down in the spring,\u201d nevertheless was wary of implying that the world should rely on a shift in weather to help control the virus. \u201cBoth containment efforts and a change in weather could help slow the outbreak,\u201d she said.\n\nThus, while the president\u2019s assertions are possible, and guided by some scientific thinking, they are hardly a given.\n\nIndeed, as Nancy Messonnier, the director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a Feb. 12 telebriefing, \u201cI would caution overinterpreting\u201d the idea that warmer weather would \u201cweaken\u201d the virus. Noting that the agency has had less than six weeks of experience with the outbreak, she said, \u201cI\u2019m happy to hope that it goes down as the weather warms up, but I think it\u2019s premature to assume that. And we\u2019re certainly not using that to sit back and expect it to go away.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
