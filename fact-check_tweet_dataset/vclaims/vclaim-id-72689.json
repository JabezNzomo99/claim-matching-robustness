The video footage actually shows students in costume to pay tribute to a popular regional movie character.\n\nThe report by regional television channel Janam TV contains video footage of students wearing black and waving white flags.\n\nThe report, which was posted on Janam TV's official Facebook page where it has been viewed nearly 850,000 times since it was published on December 29, 2018, claims the footage shows that a college in the southern Indian state of Kerala is a hub of Al Qaeda and Islamic State group sympathisers.\n\nJanam TV also posted the report on their official YouTube channel here, where it has been viewed more than 17,000 times.\n\nThe news report, in the local Malayalam language, says: \u201cStudents raise the flag of terrorists at the Varkala CH Mohammed Koya Memorial College in Thiruvananthapuram district. There are many names from Kerala linked to ISIS. These scenarios clearly show how Islam is strengthened by terrorism.\u201d\n\nOther media picked up the Janam TV story and published online reports, for example here, and it has also been shared widely on Facebook, for example here and here.\n\nThe original Facebook post's caption says: \u201cStudents raised the flag of terrorist organizations in the capital. IS-Al Qaeda organizations rooted in Kerala, they also raise the flag of terrorist organizations.\u201d\n\nThe footage actually shows an arts festival held on March 14, 2018 at the college in Kerala, also known as CHMM College for Advanced Studies.\n\nCollege principal Dr. B. Janardanan Pillai told AFP that the students were dressed in black to pay tribute to chief guest and famous regional actor Salim Kumar, who wears all black while playing a detective in the 2003 movie CID Moosa.\n\n\u201cThe students were wearing black dresses as part of cultural programme theme for our chief guest, no terrorists flags were raised. It is a ploy from Janam TV and its right-wing supporters to defame our college,\u201d he said in a January 1, 2018 telephone interview.\n\nThe college is planning to file a defamation case against the channel, he added.\n\nWhen contacted by AFP, Janam TV said it stood by its story.\n\nThe channel\u2019s editor-in-chief, GK Suresh Babu, told AFP by phone: \u201cThis was unconstitutional, students chanted radical slogans like \u2018Bolo Takbir\u2019 and were dressed in the same manner as IS and Al Qaeda terrorists.\"\n\nHe said the channel had been given the footage used in its report by a local source.\n\nThe college administration provided AFP with their photographs of the arts festival. Certain distinctive markers can be seen in both the photographs and the footage used in the Janam TV report.\n\nThis composite image created by AFP contains screenshots from the news report on the left hand side and cropped details from the photographs provided by the college on the right:\n\nIn the first pair of images, the same two students can be seen riding on a motorbike with a large front lamp and wearing long white scarves.\n\nThe second pair of images shows a black utility vehicle used by the students, while the third shows two students riding a black-and-yellow motorcycle. Distinguishing details such as the position of the car's headlamps and the pattern on the bike's frame can be identified.\n\nOne student wearing sunglasses and a distinctive white scarf with fringing is clearly visible in both the TV footage and the pictures provided by the college. This can be seen in another composite image created by AFP:\n\nActor and guest of honour at the event Salim Kumar told AFP that the Janam TV video showed the arts festival at which he had been present.\n\n\"This particular video that was circulated by the Janam TV was actually one among several videos that the students themselves had posted on social media. What Janam TV did was choose a video where I was not present, and then came up with baseless allegations,\" he said.\n\n\"I myself turned up in black dress. The kids behaved like any other normal college kid, it was a normal college function, nothing else,\" he added.\n\nOne of the photographs provided to AFP by the college shows students wearing black clothes and monochrome scarfs greeting Kumar as he arrives at the event, with the school's distinctive gate visible behind:\n\nSiddiq Saifudeen, a student at the college, provided AFP with a video he had shot of Salim Kumar arriving at the event which shows the scene in the college's photographs from a different angle:\n\nThis can be compared to a screenshot from the Janam TV report, which shows students dressed in black in front of the closed gates, with a poster of Salim Kumar clearly visible in the background:\n\nIn the Janam TV video, the students appear to wave white flags. The Islamic State group flag, which is black with white writing, cannot be seen in the footage.\n\nCollege principal Pillai told AFP of the flags being waved that day: \"Some of them were plain white flags, while a few had random drawings like college emblem or abbreviation of college written on it. First of all it was not black as to what extremists would carry, also the flags did not had anything written on it.\"", "lang": "en"}
