Kavanaugh denies the allegations.\n\n\"Kavanaugh accuser\u2019s husband breaks his silence, exposes \u2018sick issue\u2019 his wife has,\" said the headline on a Sept. 25 story posted on a website operating under the banner \"Virginia Press.\" Its URL is virginiapress31.site.\n\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\n\"According to Russell Ford, his wife Christine has long had issues with not getting \u2018the attention or respect she felt she deserved.\u2019 She\u2019s certainly getting a lot of attention now, which calls into question the validity of her claims that Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh attempted to rape her during a drunken high school party 36-years-ago. Were Christine Ford\u2019s unbelievable accusations rooted in her incessant need for attention all along?\" said the Virginia Press story.\n\nThe story accurately quotes Russell Ford\u2019s comments to the Washington Post about his wife not getting the attention or respect she felt she deserved.\n\nHowever, the Virginia Press site misrepresents what he said to paint it in a negative light. Russell Ford did not make those comments in efforts to expose a \"sick issue.\" That\u2019s a conclusion the website makes. Russell Ford\u2019s comments in the Washington Post story are in the context of how they met and built a relationship. Christine Blasey Ford grew up on the east coast and now lives in California, where she is a professor.\n\n\"She didn\u2019t always get along with her parents because of differing political views,\" Russell Ford told the Washington Post. \"It was a very male-dominated environment. Everyone was interested in what\u2019s going on with the men, and the women are sidelined, and she didn\u2019t get the attention or respect she felt she deserved. That\u2019s why she was in California, to get away from the D.C. scene.\"\n\nThe post also claims that Christine Blasey Ford has been berated by online student reviews. Bloggers made those claims based on reviews for another professor.\n\nThe Virginia Press website features several elements associated with websites promoting false information. There\u2019s no indication who\u2019s behind the website, where it\u2019s based or who are its authors. Stories have fields for comments but the website does not identify how to contact its operators.\n\nIt\u2019s headline claiming that, \"Kavanaugh accuser\u2019s husband breaks his silence, exposes \u2018sick issue\u2019 his wife has\" distorts what he said to create a false narrative.", "lang": "en"}
