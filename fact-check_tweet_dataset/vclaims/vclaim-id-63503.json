The claim stems from a satirical news website.\n\nThe website BIZ News published the article, titled \u201cDemocrats Introduce Bill To \u2018Euthanize Seniors\u2019 To Save Social Security,\u201d on May 10. It cites comments made by supposed Democratic Sen. Ginny Talia after a meeting of a Senate subcommittee.\n\n\u201cAmericans over 70 years old should just be euthanized,\u201d it quotes the senator as saying. \u201cThat\u2019s how to save social security.\u201d\n\nBut the claim that Democrats have introduced such a bill doesn\u2019t hold up. A search of House and Senate legislation turned up no matching or similar bills. Media outlets have also not covered any bill to that effect.\n\nNor is there any record of Talia serving in the Senate, according to GovTrack. She appears to be fictional.
