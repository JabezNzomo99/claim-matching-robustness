But the Australian Medical Association NSW (AMA) says this measure is not a true performance indicator. February 27, 2019.\n\nAMA NSW released a list of March 23 election priorities demanding the government develop a strategic \u201cwhole of system\u201d, long-term NSW hospital plan and capture \u201creal\u201d elective surgery waiting times.\u201d [1]\n\nAAP FactCheck has examined Mr Hazzard\u2019s claim that NSW beats all the other states and territories in delivering on-time elective surgery, a measure which the AMA NSW believes is limited and does not provide a true picture.\n\nAAP FactCheck examined the claims made by the minister and found them to be true.\n\nAccording to the most recent Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2017/2018 report, elective surgery is defined as \u201cplanned surgery that can be booked in advance as a result of a specialist clinical assessment\u201d. [2]\n\nCommon elective surgeries include the removal of cataracts, skin lesions and tonsils, hernia repairs, hysterectomies, hip and knee replacements, and varicose veins treatment. [2]\n\nPatients needing elective surgery are assigned to one of three categories depending on the urgency. Category one patients must have surgery within 30 days, category two patients within 90 days, and category three within 365 days. [2] [4]\n\nThe number of days calculated starts when a patient is seen by a specialist who judges the patient needs surgery and adds them to a waiting list. The number of days on the waitlist ends when the surgery is completed. [2]\n\nAccording to Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data, 97 per cent of NSW patients were admitted for elective surgery within the recommended time across all three urgency categories. All other states and territories recorded lower rates overall. [2] [4]\n\nQueensland came in second with 95 per cent and the Northern Territory rounded out the top three with 94 per cent. Both Western Australia and Victoria had on-time rates of about 90 per cent, while South Australia was 87 per cent, ACT 79 per cent and Tasmania the lowest with 73 per cent. [2]\n\nWhile these statistics fully support Mr Hazzard\u2019s claim, AMA NSW branch president President Dr Kean-Seng Lim told AAP FactCheck the minister\u2019s statement was \u201cmisleading\u201d.\n\nThe AMA has criticised the government for failing to keep a 2011 election promise to measure the \u201creal\u201d wait time for elective surgery. [1]\n\nThe AMA defines \u201creal\u201d as the time from when a GP refers a patient to a specialist to when surgery is completed. It says patients can spend months or years waiting to be seen by a specialist.\n\n\u201cIt is easy to hide behind the current figures by not including the true wait time from the point of referral. The current statistics that are being used are not telling the full story,\u201d Dr Lim told AAP FactCheck. [3]\n\nDr Lim\u2019s claim is supported by the Bureau of Health Information, a NSW medical advisory/watchdog body. In its 2017 report the BHI said the on-time data represented \u201ca component of the total waiting time for surgery\u201d.\n\n\u201cBefore a patient is added to a waiting list, they first need to be assessed by a surgeon and this can often involve waiting times to get an appointment. The number of people waiting for these sort of appointments is sometimes referred to as the \u2018hidden waiting list\u2019 or the \u2018waiting list for the waiting list\u2019,\u201d the BHI said. [3]\n\nAAP FactCheck concludes Mr Hazzard\u2019s claim that NSW is the best performing state or territory in delivering on-time elective surgery is true.\n\nThe AMA NSW is also correct in claiming on-time elective surgery data does not fully reflect a patient\u2019s journey from the GP to surgery.", "lang": "en"}
