Other government policies will have increased or decreased the cost of living for young people, without directly or indirectly taxing them.\n\nIn this piece, we\u2019re focusing on the direct effects of the tax system. Taxes obviously have indirect benefits, like NHS or education services that taxes are spent on. There are ways to include estimates of these kinds of benefits, but here we\u2019re just going to put the cash balance under the spotlight.\n\nHow much tax do young people pay?\n\nThe average household in which the main earner is under the age of 25 pays almost \u00a39,500 in tax annually, according to ONS figures for 2016/17. This includes direct taxes (like income tax), indirect taxes (like VAT on goods.) They receive about \u00a34,500 in cash benefits meaning the average household is taxed about \u00a33,750 more than they get back in cash benefits.\n\nA word of caution: the \u2018average household\u2019 is only a very broad measure, it won\u2019t tell you about how that varies across the population, or show anyone\u2019s individual experience.\n\nIn 2016/17 the net contribution of the average household where the main earner is under 25 is equivalent to 19% of their household income. That\u2019s lower than any other age group. However, while they made the lowest net contribution of any household of that age group under 65, they also have the lowest income, averaging around \u00a321,000 post-tax and post-cash benefits.\n\nMeanwhile, households where the main earner is aged between 50 and 54 contribute the most\u2014the equivalent of 39% of their household income in taxes. But they earn more than under 25s, because they have a higher income to start with.\n\nNot all of the taxes people pay comes off their income. 50-54 year-olds usually have more wealth built up than younger people and as they spend this they\u2019re likely to pay more towards taxes like VAT.\n\nHouseholds where the main earner is 25-29 have the highest income post-tax and benefits. They earn on average around \u00a340,000 pre tax and make a net contribution of around \u00a311,000, leaving them with around \u00a329,000.\n\nMost government policies, not just taxes, affect spending power\n\nTaxes and benefits are the most direct way in which the government alters the spending power of young people. But many other policies also have an impact.\n\nFor example, the Help to Buy programme launched in 2013 tried to help first time buyers by offering favourable loans, mortgages and ISAs, but the IMF warned that the scheme could just inflate prices making housing more unaffordable.\n\nOn the other hand, price regulation in the energy industry for certain consumers has arguably reduced the cost of living for those consumers, without using taxes or benefits.", "lang": "en"}
