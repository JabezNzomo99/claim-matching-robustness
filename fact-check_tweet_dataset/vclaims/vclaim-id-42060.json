The claim is misleading; authorities said the video shows police giving pray beads during National Integration Week, an annual unity initiative that is organised by the central government and held every year in November.\n\nThe 30-second video was published here on Facebook on November 30, 2019. It has been viewed more than 180,000 times.\n\nThe video\u2019s Hindi-language caption translates to English as: \u201cThis is the first step of the Shiv Sena government in Maharashtra as the police congratulated Muslims by handing prayer beads after Friday prayers. This video is getting viral very quickly.\u201d\n\nShiv Sena is a prominent political party in Maharashtra. The party won a majority in the state\u2019s legislature in October and Shiv Sena\u2019s leader, Uddhav Thackeray, was sworn in as Maharashtra chief minister on November 28. AFP documented the ceremony here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the video in the misleading post:\n\nThe video was also published with a similar claim here on Facebook where it has also been viewed more than 180,000 times.\n\nThe video was also shared on Facebook here and here, and on YouTube here and here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is misleading; a senior police officer told AFP the police in the video were not following any directive from the new state government and that the event was held for National Integration Week -- also known as Qaumi Ekta Week -- which is organised annually by the central government.\n\n\u201cThe event took place outside Kausa mosque in Mumbra was part of the central government\u2019s programme \u2018Qaumi Ekta Week\u2019 and it was not done on orders of the state government. This is totally false,\u201d GM Mujawar, a senior officer at the Mumbra police station, told AFP by phone on December 9.\n\nMumbra is a neighborhood in Thane, a city just north of Mumbai. The Kausa mosque is situated here on Google Maps.\n\nMujawar also said the event took place on November 29, the first Friday after Thackeray took office.\n\nAFP also spoke to Officer Vinayak Karade, one of the policemen distributing prayer beads, by phone on December 9.\n\n\u201cOur police station did that as part of Qaumi Ekta Week,\u201d Karade confirmed. \u201cLast Friday (November 22, 2019), we distributed roses and on November 29, 2019, we distributed prayer beads. This promotes integrity and harmony.\u201d\n\nKarade added that it is unfortunate that the video was shared with the misleading claim.\n\nNational Integration Week is organised every year and is intended to \u201cfoster and reinforce the spirit of communal harmony,\u201d the central government\u2019s official press release stated here. Official announcements on the celebratory week over the past decade can be seen here: 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018.\n\nNational Integration Week was also celebrated by other police departments in Maharashtra. Thane police\u2019s verified Twitter account shared images from another celebratory event here on November 25.\n\nThe video in the misleading posts was published here on a Hindi news Facebook page on November 29, one day before the misleading claim was made.\n\nThe video\u2019s caption reads: \u201cMumbra Police distributing Tazbih at Kausa Masjid after Namaz-e-Jumma.\u201d It makes no mention of the new Maharashtra government.\n\nTazbih, or Tasbih, are Islamic prayer beads and Namaz-e-Jumma refers to Friday prayers offered by Muslims.", "lang": "en"}
