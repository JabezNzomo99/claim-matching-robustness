{"title": "Fake Article on Rahul Gandhi Damaging to My Reputation: Mark Tully", "subtitle": "A post criticising the Gandhi family going viral on social media platforms was falsely attributed to senior journalist Mark Tully. Tully has issued a statement denying writing it. The veteran has been misquoted previously too.", "author": "www.thequint.com", "date": "2018-07-27T15:03:03+05:30", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-19600", "url": "https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/webqoof-fake-news-mark-tully-gandhi-analysis", "vclaim": "Tully is upset at the propaganda being peddled in his name but this is not the first time he\u2019s been a victim of fake news. Below is the transcript of his interview on the subject.\n\nThis hasn\u2019t happened with you for the first time.\n\nYes, you are right. I think this is the fourth time.\n\nDo you feel that this in a way creates an image for you that you wouldn\u2019t like to be associated with?\n\nAbsolutely. I feel it is very damaging to my reputation & I think it is very damaging to the congress party, too. I worked for the BBC for 30 years and I think I got a reputation for balanced journalism. I think this is outrageous really.\n\nIs there a way, that you see, that such things don\u2019t happen in the future? Would you like the government to take action against people who may have circulated this article?\n\nYes, I certainly think that like all fake news, there should be ways of dealing with it. Perhaps with the government or perhaps with however the thing was originally sent\n\nFor instance, I can\u2019t tell how many emails I\u2019ve received of people asking whether I wrote this or not and quite a few of them received Whatsapps about it. Well I think Whatsapp should certainly do something about it.\n\nAnd I\u2019m also approaching the Congress party because I think the congress party should take some action as well.", "lang": "en"}
