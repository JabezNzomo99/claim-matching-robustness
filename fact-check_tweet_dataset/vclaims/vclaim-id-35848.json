No, that's not true: While supporters of the so-called QAnon conspiracy theory claimed that several guests were wearing \"Q\" flag pins, we enhanced the images in question. The pins actually featured what appears to be a presidential seal, not the letter \"Q.\"\n\nThe claim originated from a video post published by And We Know on February 6, 2020, titled \"AWK NEWS 2.6.20: [DS] coup attempt against POTUS will not go unpunished\" (archived here).\n\nUsers on social media only saw this:\n\nThe narrator on the video showed several individuals who he claimed were wearing American flag pins with a \"Q\" on them at President Trump's State of the Union address on February 4, 2020. The suggestion was that this was a silent nod to the anonymous individual who believes that the \"deep state\" is actively plotting against Trump.\n\nOne of the individuals shown in the video wearing a pin was Jody Jones from Farmersville, California. His brother was murdered by an illegal immigrant.\n\nHere is a high-resolution photo of Jones in the U.S. House Chamber on Capitol Hill during the speech. Lead Stories enhanced that image, and it's clearly not a Q but rather what appears to be a U.S. presidential seal.\n\nAt a distance, the red stripe from the flag may give the appearance of a curly Q, but it is not.\n\nOthers suggested that even a young boy was seen wearing a Q flag pin, but it appears to be the same style pin that Jones was wearing:\n\nSome websites have been hawking Q-adorned flag pins, but they look nothing like what anyone was wearing at the State of the Union address.\n\nWe wrote about fake news on YouTube before.
