It was part of Transport for New South Wales\u2019 \u201cTowards Zero\u201d campaign that sought to \u201chighlight the human element of the road toll and encourage all road users to change the way we think about road safety,\u201d with the goal of reducing traffic fatalities to zero.\n\nIn the original video, a man in the street was interviewed, informed that \u201clast year, 347 people died on our roads,\u201d and asked what he thought would be a more acceptable number of deaths. After the man replied \u201c70,\u201d the announcer proceeded to show him what a group of 70 people looks like by bringing out 70 members of the man\u2019s family:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ra5LK8x86zU\n\n \n\n A man is interviewed in the street. Interviewer: So last year, 347 people died on our roads. What do you think would be a more acceptable number? [A group of 70 people emerges from around a corner and walks toward the man. They are all members of his family.] Interviewer: Actually, this is what 70 people looks like. [The man realises the people are all members of his family.] Interviewer: So, now what do you think would be a more acceptable number?\n\nRegardless of the underlying subject, the message remains a powerful one: It\u2019s sometimes all too easy for us to consider deaths as a mere abstraction or statistic \u2014 as something that happens to other, faceless people \u2014 when making life-and-death decisions, but our viewpoint becomes a very different one when we ponder the potential outcome of those decisions on people we know and love.", "lang": "en"}
