[...] The truth is if we want proper reform for a seven-day NHS and the resources that go with a successful NHS, it is the Conservative party that will deliver.\"\n\nAt Prime Minister's Questions, the Prime Minister boasted of the government's commitment to invest \u00a38 billion in the NHS in England, and how it could or would make possible improvements in mental health services and a seven day NHS.\n\nThe \u00a38 billion figure is totemic for the future of the NHS, but as the Nuffield Trust explained in our election report, it is not extra money to pay for extra services.\n\nIt is only what Simon Stevens, the NHS England Chief Executive, has said is the minimum needed to keep services at current levels given growing demands and costs on the NHS.\n\nThere are three important limits to how excited anyone should be about this eight billion pound promise:\n\u2022 It assumes a goal of maintaining existing levels of care. It won't pay for better mental health services, the seven day NHS, or anything else additional.\n\u2022 It assumes that the NHS can find \u00a322 billion in savings. Mr Stevens has said that is possible, but it requires a big jump compared to the level of savings the NHS has managed to find in recent years.\n\u2022 It assumes the government will provide the money steadily over the course of this Parliament, not in a lump at the end. That has not been promised.\n\nThe 'Stevens plan' that the Prime Minister referred to\u2014the NHS Five Year Forward View\u2014offers the promise that the standard of NHS services can be maintained for \u00a38 billion. That's a real boast. But paying for a seven day NHS or better mental health services is stretching way beyond what the money was intended for.", "lang": "en"}
