That claim originated from a self-described satirical website, but it has now spread to other websites and social media posts without a disclaimer.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi was in the news a lot during the partial government shutdown over her resistance to President Donald Trump\u2019s request for $5.7 billion to build a wall along the southern border.\n\nShe was also the subject of a story \u2014 originally published by the self-described satirical website, America\u2019s Last Line of Defense \u2014 that said she spent \u201calmost $500 million to renovate her office\u201d during the shutdown, which ended Jan. 25 after 35 days.\n\nThe story cites an \u201cinvestigative report\u201d from The Gateway Pundit, a conservative website, and seemingly provides a link to the report. The link, however, goes to a Daily Kos story about how \u201c40% of Louisiana state senators voted against making bestiality a crime-because they\u2019re homophobic.\u201d\n\nThe satirical story goes on to list some of Pelosi\u2019s alleged purchases for the renovation, including 47 72-inch curved-screen televisions, $4.7 million for a miniature kitchen with a staff of six chefs, and $47,000 for a \u201csolid vibranium letter opener.\u201d Vibranium is a fictional metal created by Marvel comics.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Last Line of Defense, which is listed in our \u201cMisinformation Directory,\u201d does include a disclaimer at the top of its home page stating: \u201cInformation you probably shouldn\u2019t trust.\u201d It also describes itself on its \u201cabout us\u201d page as a \u201cwhimsical playland of conservative satire.\u201d However, we regularly find that its content is reposted on other websites without such disclaimers. That was the case with its Pelosi story, which was shared over 2,000 times on the website toptopic.club, without any indication that it was intended to be satirical.\n\nWe also found others on social media sharing the bogus Pelosi story or referring to it. One Facebook page, The Left Can Go Right, posted the story with the comment, \u201cGet this awful woman OUT!!\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nDidadaug, Daisy. \u201cNancy Pelosi Spent $497 Million On Office Renovations During Shutdown.\u201d America\u2019s Last Line of Defense. 26 Jan 2019.\n\n\u201cThe Effects of the Partial Shutdown Ending in January 2019.\u201d Congressional Budget Office. 28 Jan 2018.", "lang": "en"}
