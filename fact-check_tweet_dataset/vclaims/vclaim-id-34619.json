The post also recommends wearing a beaded necklace of cotton around the neck. Vishvas News investigated and found that camphor comes in natural and synthetic forms. Nowadays mostly synthetic camphor is used. Burning of artificial camphor causes harm and produces more smoke. Therefore, the claim that burning camphor and inhaling its smell can combat air pollution is misleading.\n\nThe post viral on Twitter shared by a used named Sadhavi Khosla reads: \u201cUse more and more camphor (kapur) at home\u2026 lighting a wee bit of camphor and inhaling its lingering aroma helps. You may make a beads (mala) of camphor with cotton and wear it around your neck to counter #AirPollution it helps a lot.\u201d\n\nVishvas News started its investigation by searching about Camphor and how is it actually made. According to the official website of National Cancer Institute, Camphor is a substance that comes from the wood and bark of the camphor tree or is made in the laboratory. It has a very unique smell and taste and is used in commercial products (for example, mothballs). Camphor is used in topical anti-infective and anti-pruritic (anti-itching) agents.\n\nTo verify the viral claim, Vishvas News spoke to Dr. Loveleen Mangla who is a Pulmonologist in Metro Cancer Hospital. He said: \u201cThere is no scientific evidence that supports that burning camphor and inhaling it can counter air pollution. In fact, burning camphor produces more smoke.\u201d\n\nWe also reached out to Dr. Vimal N., who is an ayurveda doctor. He said: \u201cBurning of camphor and inhaling it to counter air pollution doesn\u2019t help. However, natural camphor does have certain health benefits but these days synthetic camphor is used mostly which is not good to use.\u201d\n\nWe further searched and found some reports that supported the fact that the burning of camphor can cause health issues. Here are some examples:\n\nOn April 7, 2016, an article published on The Hindu was headlined: Ban on camphor use in temples to be strictly enforced\n\nVishvas News investigated and found that camphor comes in natural and synthetic forms. Nowadays mostly synthetic camphor is used. Burning of artificial camphor causes harm and produces more smoke. Therefore, the claim that burning camphor and inhaling its smell can combat air pollution is misleading.", "lang": "en"}
