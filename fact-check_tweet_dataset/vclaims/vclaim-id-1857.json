The site is related to Newslo.com, which refers to itself in a disclaimer as \"the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web.\"\n\nStories on sites under the Newslo.com umbrella take a small bite of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. They feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference. But on other sites without the buttons, there\u2019s no way to know.\n\nIt appears DemocraticMoms.com edited some of the details of the original post, such as deleting Politicalo.com\u2019s reference to another April 16 Donald Trump tweet backing off his promise to label China a currency manipulator:\n\nThe headline also has been changed. The original on Politicalo.com read, \"Eric Trump: \u2018My father\u2019s tax return is irrelevant because we\u2019re going to cancel taxes for \"extra productive people\" anyway.\u2019\" DemocraticMoms.com subbed in the word WEALTHY instead, IN ALL CAPS for extra effect.\n\nOtherwise, the story contains entire paragraphs of Politicalo.com\u2019s story (Neither version notes that the radio interview is fake; Politicalo.com calls KXYL an Orlando station, but it\u2019s based in Texas.)\n\nDemocraticMoms.com has a cryptic About Us description that says only that their \"team will bring you everything you wanted to know, and some stuff you didn\u2019t even know you needed!\"\n\nThere was no apparent way to contact the site, but every post was steeped in anti-Trump fervor. No author information accompanies the profile that posted the article, either.\n\nDemocraticMoms.com was registered anonymously on Nov. 20, 2016, after Donald Trump was elected The owner is likely looking to capitalize on anti-Trump sentiment. In this case, it\u2019s by posting a parody story and implying it\u2019s real.\n\nIt\u2019s clear Eric Trump didn\u2019t say his dad was going to end taxes entirely for anyone, rich or otherwise.\n\nWe rate the statement Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
