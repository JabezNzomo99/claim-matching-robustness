This is false; the video has been edited from a speech by the senator in which she denied allegations she had fostered the prison drug trade.\n\nThe 1:28 video in this Facebook post, published on August 8, 2016 and watched more than three million times, shows De Lima speaking in the Philippine Senate plenary hall.\n\nTranslated to English, the accompanying caption reads: \u201cLet's share this guys! De Lima already admitted that she's a protector of drug peddlers. What is a fitting judgment for her! COMMENT and SHARE!\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nDe Lima was arrested in February 2017 on charges of drug trafficking following allegations she profited from selling narcotics at the prison during her time as justice secretary. She says she is innocent and the accusation is politically motivated by her opposition to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Here is an AFP story about the incident.\n\nHere is a transcript of part of De Lima\u2019s comments in the misleading video:\n\n\"But the truth is I was protector of the Bilibid drug lords.\u201d\n\n\u201cI myself started drugs at the National Bilibid prison. I myself continued operations of the National Bilibid Prison, of drugs, together with this is the confirmation that there is shabu laboratory inside the national penitentiary.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes Mr. President, there is shabu laboratory inside the Bilibid Prison even in the tunnels under it. Those who will search the tunnels will get a whiff of the smell of cooking methamphetamine.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly under my term did the luxurious makeshift tents of the druglords sprout in Building 14, separate from the ordinary prisoners.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. President, I am a druglord coddler and I am against the war on drugs because I am protecting the drug trade. Yes Mr. President, I will surrender my mandate\u2026\u201d\n\nThe misleading video is an edited version of a Senate speech by De Lima from August 2, 2016, during which she defended herself from accusations she was involved in the drug trade at Bilibid Prison.\n\nA report of the speech was published here by local news site GMA News on the day it was given.\n\nAn unabridged version of her speech was also published on the official YouTube channel of the Philippine Senate on the same day.\n\nAFP has published a side-by-side comparison of the original footage with the misleading video that appeared six days later:\n\nHere are the parts of her original speech which were edited and used in the misleading video:\n\n\u201cI myself started the war on drugs in the National Bilibid Prison.\u201d\n\n\u201cI myself continued cleaning up the National Bilibid Prison of drugs in follow-up operations before I resigned as secretary of justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes Mr. President, there is no shabu laboratory inside the Bilibid Prison, not even in the tunnels under it. Those who will search the tunnels will get a whiff not of the smell of cooking methamphetamine, but of methane that comes from the human waste of the prisoners above.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly under my term as Justice Secretary that the cleaning started in Bilibid. Only under my term were the luxurious makeshift tents of the druglords were demolished and they were transferred to Building 14, separate from ordinary prisoners. But of course, all of this has been sorely forgotten in the face of a formidable demolition campaign against me in the social media.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lies are intended to show me as protector of the Bilibid drug lords. But the truth is I was the only Justice Secretary since the 1986 EDSA Revolution who dared to eradicate the dominion of the drug lords inside Bilibid.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis well-oiled social media operation intends to take that away from me. In the eyes of the people they have already succeeded to a great extent. They project me as an enemy of this administration, that I am calling for an investigation on the drug killings because I am a drug lord coddler, that I am against the war on drugs because I am protecting the drug trade.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not surrender my mandate as a Senator of the Republic to these unelected and unaccountable personalities whose own motivations in the demolition of my person is highly questionable and utterly despicable.\u201d\n\nHere is the full transcript of her speech.\n\nA number of misleading videos alleging De Lima\u2019s involvement in the Bilibid drug trade have circulated before and after her arrest.\n\nHere is an earlier AFP factcheck debunking posts which claimed to show De Lima singing a rendition of \u201cCareless Whisper\u201d by British singer George Michael at a concert staged by a high-profile Bilibid inmate.", "lang": "en"}
