Most of the attempts in those six years happened in 2015 when 84,000 were made.\n\nThese numbers come with a health warning: they haven\u2019t got the status of \u201cOfficial Statistics\u201d or \u201cNational Statistics\u201d. They come directly from a Home Office operational system.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how many people are in the UK clandestinely\n\nThe Express says \u201cexperts estimate that for every migrant caught at least two are successful\u201d. Experts at the Migration Observatory at Oxford University told us they don\u2019t know of any studies which support this figure.\n\nEven if it\u2019s accurate, it isn\u2019t possible to simply multiply the Home Office figures on clandestine entry attempts by two to come up with a number of people illegally entering the UK.\n\nThe key word here is \u201cattempts\u201d. One person might try to enter the UK a number of times and be counted each time they do. It doesn\u2019t mean that 164,000 individual people tried.\n\nThe head of the UK\u2019s Border Force estimated last year that around 6,000 migrants managed to enter the UK without being detected by the Border Force. But this is just the figure for those who later admitted to having entered the country clandestinely.\n\nIt\u2019s notoriously difficult to get a fix on the number of people who might be in the country without permission. As the Migration Observatory has put it in the past, estimates are:\n\n\u201cinadequate, vague, contested and out of date. Any efforts to estimate the number of irregular migrants in the UK or in other countries are automatically limited by the simple reality that this is a set of people who, by definition, do not wish to be found or counted\u201d.\n\nThe most recent study estimated that somewhere between 417,000 to 863,000 irregular migrants and their children were living in the UK at the end of 2007. The majority were thought to be living in London. But this was based on data from the 2001 census\u2014there\u2019s been another since\u2014and no major formal studies have been done more recently.\n\nMost of those in the UK illegally are likely to have overstayed an existing visa or not stuck to the exact conditions of one, rather than snuck into the country.", "lang": "en"}
