It was a key part of his strategy to show that he was different from other Republican candidates. Here are some examples:\n\nIn an interview with the Brody File on the Christian Broadcasting Network on May 20, 2015, Trump declared: \u201cI\u2019m not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican. I\u2019m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid. Every other Republican is going to cut. Even if they wouldn\u2019t they don\u2019t know what to do because they don\u2019t know where they money is. I do.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Medicaid financing is open-ended, depending on how many people are enrolled and what care they need; states have to match a percentage of the federal funding. But under the proposal, states would just get a set amount of money per beneficiary, and thus would have to make up any additional costs. Most experts say this shift would put such a burden on the states that they would be forced to reduce Medicaid enrollment. (The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that $116 billion in costs would be shifted to the states over 10 years, not including the ACA expansion.)\n\nHouse Republicans have long pushed to convert Medicaid to a block grant system, so their proposal is not especially surprising. But clearly, this is a flip-flop on Trump\u2019s previous pledges not to cut Medicaid \u2014 which he had even touted as an example as to why he was not like other Republicans. Yet now he is embracing a plan that reflects a key GOP goal.\n\nThe \u2018big bubble\u2019 in the stock market\n\nTrump is right that the stock market performance has been unusually good. MarketWatch calculated that the first 50 days of Trump\u2019s presidency is the best for a Republican president since the Great Depression 84 years ago, and the sixth best overall. It is also the best 50-day return since Bill Clinton\u2019s start in 1993.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump often questioned the accuracy of the employment numbers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. While the official unemployment rate was about 5 percent, Trump claimed it was really 22 percent or even as high as 42 percent. In a speech to the Economic Club of Detroit on Aug. 8, Trump said the unemployment rate was \u201cone of the biggest hoaxes in modern American politics.\u201d On many other occasions, he derided the figures calculated by career economists as \u201cphony.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer was asked about this contradiction at a news briefing after the report\u2019s release. His response: \u201cI talked to the president prior to this and he said to quote him very clearly. They may have been phony in the past, but it\u2019s very real now.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
