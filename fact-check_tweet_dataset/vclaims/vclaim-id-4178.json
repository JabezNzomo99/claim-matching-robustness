Thank you, Kanye, thank you.\"\n\nWe decided to take a closer look at the numbers. It turns out Trump garbled the results of a real survey that showed a much more nuanced picture.\n\nTrump appears to have been referencing a Reuters weekly poll that showed his approval rating among black men going from 11 percent for the week ending April 22 to 22 percent for the week ending April 29.\n\nSo even if you take the Reuters poll at face value, Trump misstated the results. The poll showed Trump\u2019s support doubled among African-American men only, not African-Americans in general. (The poll showed that his approval rating among black Americans overall went from 8.9 percent to 16.5 percent over the same period.)\n\nBut there\u2019s reason to be wary of concluding, based on this poll, that Trump is enjoying a favorable shift in public opinion among black men.\n\nFirst, the sample size is small. Generally speaking, the smaller a poll\u2019s sample size, the more prone it is to error. And the two weekly polls in question looked only at small slices: The surveys were based, respectively, on feedback from 118 and 171 respondents.\n\nAccording to Reuters\u2019 own polling editor, the sample sizes for this particular poll \"were too small to reliably suggest any shift in public opinion.\" Chris Kahn, Reuters U.S. political polling editor, said the \"credibility interval\" (which is similar to the more familiar margin of error) was +/- 9 percentage points.\n\nSo while Trump claimed his approval rating among black men for the week ending April 22 was 11 percent, realistically it could have anywhere from 2 percent to 20 percent. His approval rating the following week for this group was anywhere from 13 percent to 31 percent.\n\nIn other words, according to Kahn, the polling \"leaves open the possibility that his approval also could have dropped in this time frame.\"\n\nKarlyn Bowman, a polling expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said news consumers should heed the Reuters polling editor\u2019s cautionary notes.\n\n\"Most polls do not have a large sample of African Americans, and so we have to be very careful in interpreting the results of any single survey. The margin of error is high,\" Bowman said. \"I would also not rely on a single survey to suggest that something new was occurring.\"\n\nWe were unable to find other polls that measured Trump's African-American support on a weekly basis.\n\nAnother issue with the poll\u2019s reliability concerns how it was conducted. Rather than calling randomly generated phone numbers, this poll allowed online respondents to opt-in to the survey.\n\nIn polling terminology, this survey used \"a non-probability online sample.\" As CNN\u2019s director of polling Jennifer Agiesta explained, \"those who participated signed up to take the poll rather than being randomly selected,\" meaning \"there could be bias in the sample.\"\n\nCharles Wheelan, a professor at Dartmouth who has written extensively about statistics and public policy, cautioned that online polls are highly vulnerable to \"selection bias,\" whereby the sample of respondents does not accurately reflect a population writ large.\n\n\"It\u2019s very difficult, if not impossible, to get an accurate cross-section using online tools because they are so biased by who is likely to be online and respond to a survey,\" Wheelan said.\n\nTrump said, \"I doubled my African-American poll numbers. We went from 11 to 22 in one week.\"\n\nEven if you take the Reuters poll at face value, Trump misstated the results. The poll showed Trump\u2019s support doubled among African-American men only, not African-Americans of both sexes.\n\nIn terms of the poll\u2019s accuracy, Reuters\u2019 own polling chief said the sample size was too small to reliably indicate Trump is enjoying a favorable shift in public opinion among black men.\n\nThe poll\u2019s reliability is also questionable given online respondents opted-in to the survey, which is less reliable than using a randomly-generated sample.\n\nWe rate this Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
