Thus suggesting that her injuries are fake. Ghosh was injured during violence in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) where masked goons attacked students on January 5-6. Shefali Vaidya was among those who made the allegation but later took it down.\n\nRSS-affiliated ABVP\u2019s national organising secretary Ashish Chauhan also shared the images. His tweet, now deleted, was retweeted by Dr Vijay Chauthaiwale, in-charge of BJP\u2019s foreign affairs department.\n\nAishe Ghosh\u2019s left arm is plastered, not the right. The photograph used to portray plaster on her right arm has been mirrored. Alt News found a similar image as the viral one where Ghosh can be seen at the same location. This was tweeted by Hindustan Times on January 7.\n\nA comparison of the viral image with the one above evidently proves that the former has been mirrored. The similarities in both pictures are as follows:\n\u2022 The man near the injured arm.\n\u2022 The man in the black jacket standing behind Ghosh.\n\u2022 The woman in red sweater beside the man in the black jacket.\n\nThe viral image is from the press conference addressed by Aishe Ghosh on January 6. A video of the event also shows her left arm plastered.\n\nFurthermore, multiple other photographs of the JNUSU president reported in the media show that her left arm is plastered.\n\nOne Rajesh Salunke who identifies himself as a \u201cstudent activist\u201d of ABVP raised suspicions about Ghosh\u2019s injury.\n\n@rose_k01) followed by BJ IT cell head Amit Malviya and BJP Delhi spokesperson Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga also tweeted the images.", "lang": "en"}
