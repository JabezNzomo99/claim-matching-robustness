This is false; the foundation said the tweet\u2019s preview image refreshed to a photo taken on May 30 when its website updated, and Twitter confirmed that thumbnails associated with tweets can change.\n\nThe misleading article concluded that \u201cthe whole thing was planned in advance.\u201d This is false; AFP on June 5 debunked the claim that George Floyd\u2019s death was staged.\n\nMore misleading articles are available here and here, and articles making similar false claims but citing a May 16 Obama Foundation tweet are available here and here. Facebook posts with the claim can be seen here and here, and an Instagram post is available here. The claim was also shared in Spanish and German.\n\n\u201cWebsites can choose a preview image (Twitter card), that shows up when the site is linked to in tweets. So older tweets may have the card change when the website updates the card,\u201d a Twitter spokesman told AFP in an email.\n\nA new search in Sipa USA\u2019s online archive for the name of the photographer, \u201cChristopher Dilts,\u201d with results limited to May 30, yields the original image, captioned: \u201cDemonstrators protest in response to the police killing of George Floyd on Saturday March 30, 2020 in Chicago, IL.\u201d\n\nTo clarify whether the photo was taken in March or May, AFP reached out to Dilts, who explained that the March date in the caption is incorrect due to an error on his part while sending in the demonstration photos.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a caption typo that I caught after filing (I was in the middle of the protest and honestly have no idea how I made an error like that). I caught it and re-uploaded, but apparently the new images didn\u2019t swap,\u201d Dilts told AFP.", "lang": "en"}
