A Video of Ahok being released on parole. Prabowo: this must be a Jokowi plot!!\u201d It also carries the sub-headline in red lettering \u201cAhok is free\u201d.\n\nThe headline refers to Prabowo Subianto, an opposition politician expected to run against President Joko Widodo in 2019 national elections.\n\nAhok is a political ally of Widodo, who is better known as Jokowi.\n\nAn English translation of Subianto\u2019s purported comments about the former governor\u2019s supposed release reads: \u201cThis is clearly a political scheme... The evidence is clear that Ahok has not been released in a transparent way. There must be a mistake in this case.\u201d\n\nThe article has been shared hundreds of times in at least three Facebook groups \u2013 including one called \u201cTeman Jokowi Ahok\u201d (Friends of Jokowi and Ahok).\n\nA similar video that claims to show Ahok\u2019s release has been viewed thousands of times on a series of YouTube clips, including this one uploaded on July 9.\n\nJosefina Agatha Syukur, Ahok\u2019s lawyer, said her client was still in jail.\n\n\u201cHe has yet to be released from prison,\u201d Syukur told AFP.\n\nAhok is in fact eligible to apply for parole under Indonesian early release regulations, but he has opted to serve out his full two-year term, which is officially done in May 2019, she said.\n\nAde Kusmanto, a spokesman for Indonesia\u2019s prison system, also confirmed that Ahok has not been released.\n\nAndre Rosiade, a spokesman for Prabowo\u2019s Gerindra party, denied that the politician made the comments attributed to him, which was backed up by no mainstream media reporting the comments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard any statement from Prabowo like what\u2019s written in the article. Also there is no mainstream media that has reported such comments,\u201d Rosiade said.", "lang": "en"}
