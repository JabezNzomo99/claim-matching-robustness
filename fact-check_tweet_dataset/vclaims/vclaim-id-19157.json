He said \u201cmy rhetoric \u2026 brings people together.\u201d But that is not how he is perceived by most Americans.\n\nA CNN poll in March found that nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said the phrase \u201cwill unite the country and not divide it\u201d doesn\u2019t apply to Trump. In a Pew Research Center survey published in June, 55% of those surveyed say Trump has changed the tone of political debate for the worse, while only 24% say he has changed it for the better.\n\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric has brought some people together, as evidenced by the large and boisterous crowds that attend his political rallies, and he has high job approval ratings among Republicans. But he has a well-earned reputation for responding strongly to political attacks \u2014 real and perceived.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, his wife, Melania, said of her husband, \u201cAs you may know by now, when you attack him he will punch back 10 times harder.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s combative approach has continued throughout his presidency, and at times he has made divisive and disparaging remarks that in some cases have drawn criticism even from his own party.\n\nHere is just a sampling of some those moments:\n\nIn a series of tweets in July, Trump told \u201c\u2018Progressive\u2019 Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe,\u201d to \u201cgo back\u201d to those countries.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nHe was referring to Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley and Ilhan Omar. Omar was born in Somalia, but the other three were born in the United States. Ocasio-Cortez was born in New York, Tlaib in Detroit and Pressley in Chicago.\n\nRepublican Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, who recently announced he will not run for reelection, told CNN that Trump\u2019s tweets were not only inaccurate, but \u201cracist and xenophobic.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic-led House adopted a resolution condemning Trump\u2019s \u201cracist comments.\u201d Only four Republicans, including Hurd, voted for it, but at least 40 Republican members of Congress criticized the president\u2019s remarks, according to a Reuters tally.\n\nA Fox News poll found that 63% of those surveyed thought that Trump\u2019s tweets about the congresswomen \u201ccrossed the line,\u201d and only 27% saw them as an \u201cacceptable political attack.\u201d\n\nFollowing his remarks, Trump\u2019s supporters at a rally in North Carolina chanted, \u201cSend her back,\u201d as Trump relitigated his case against Omar. The president later falsely said he tried to stop the chant \u2014 a claim that resulted in four Pinocchios from the Washington Post fact checker.\n\nAlso in July, Trump attacked Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, and in the process declared that his district in Baltimore is uninhabitable for humans. He called the district \u201ca disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess\u201d and claimed that \u201cno human being would want to live there.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with a local radio station, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, called Trump\u2019s comments \u201coutrageous and inappropriate.\u201d\n\nBaltimore is not alone. Trump also has denigrated Atlanta and San Francisco, among others.\n\nA day after calling Baltimore uninhabitable, Trump tweeted that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s district in San Francisco is \u201cnot even recognizeable lately,\u201d saying \u201c[s]omething must be done before it is too late.\u201d\n\nShortly before his inauguration, Trump tweeted that Democratic Rep. John Lewis\u2019 district, which includes Atlanta, is \u201cin horrible shape and falling apart (and not to \u2026 mention crime infested).\u201d\n\nTrump has often used the word \u201cinvasion\u201d to describe the so-called caravans of Central Americans traveling to seek asylum in the U.S. and other immigrants who cross the border illegally. At a May 8 rally in Panama City, Florida, Trump defended his use of the word \u201cinvasion,\u201d and expressed frustration at the inability to stem the flow of illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cI mean, when you have 15,000 people marching up, and you have hundreds and hundreds of people, and you have two or three border security people that are brave and great \u2013 and don\u2019t forget we don\u2019t let them and we can\u2019t let them use weapons,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe can\u2019t. Other countries do, we can\u2019t. I would never do that. But how do you stop these people?\u201d\n\nAt this point, an audience member yelled, \u201cShoot them!\u201d\n\nTrump shook his head and joked, \u201cThat\u2019s only in the Panhandle you can get away with that stuff.\u201d\n\nA frequent target of the president\u2019s attacks are legal U.S. residents who have lawfully entered the country through the Diversity Immigration Visa Program.\n\nAs we have written before, the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program uses a computer lottery system to randomly issue up to 50,000 immigrant visas each year to qualified applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States.\n\nAt a Jan. 9, 2018, immigration meeting at the White House, Trump inaccurately described the program this way: \u201cThey call it \u2018visa lottery,\u2019 I just call it \u2018lottery.\u2019 But countries come in and they put names in a hopper. They\u2019re not giving you their best names; common sense means they\u2019re not giving you their best names. They\u2019re giving you people that they don\u2019t want. And then we take them out of the lottery. And when they do it by hand \u2014 where they put the hand in a bowl \u2014 they\u2019re probably \u2014 what\u2019s in their hand are the worst of the worst.\u201d\n\nAs we have written, there is no evidence that other countries are gaming the system and sending the U.S. \u201cthe worst of the worst.\u201d Individuals, not countries, apply for the visa, and applicants are subjected to the same background checks as other visa applicants, including criminal background checks.\n\nTrump made similar claims at a Dec. 8, 2017, rally in Florida, saying \u201cwhen they pick the lottery, they have the real worst in their hands, oh, here they go.\u201d On Feb. 13, 2018, at White House immigration meeting, Trump said \u201cthey\u2019re not giving us their finest.\u201d At an Aug. 2, 2018, rally in Pennsylvania, Trump claimed that a person who \u201ckilled nine people\u201d could get a visa through the diversity program, even though there is a screening process that would specifically bar entry to a convicted killer.\n\nThe president regularly labels news stories he doesn\u2019t like as \u201cfake news,\u201d even when they are accurate, and has called news organizations \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d He first used the term \u201cenemy of the American people\u201d in a tweet on Feb. 17, 2017, less than a month into his presidency. A week later, in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump doubled down on the phrase, while making an inaccurate claim.\n\n\u201cThey are the enemy of the people. Because they have no sources, they just make \u2019em up when there are none,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw one story recently where they said, \u2018Nine people have confirmed.\u2019 There\u2019re no nine people. I don\u2019t believe there was one or two people.\u201d\n\nAs we wrote at the time, the Washington Post on Feb. 9, 2017, broke the story that then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn \u201cprivately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country\u2019s ambassador to the United States during the month before President Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials.\u201d The story \u2014 which cited \u201c[n]ine current and former officials\u201d as the sources \u2014 was accurate. Flynn later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about talking to the Russian ambassador about U.S. sanctions.\n\nIn a Jan. 17, 2018, speech on the Senate floor, then-Republican Sen. Jeff Flake criticized the president for an \u201cunrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press.\u201d In particular, Flake was critical of the term \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018The enemy of the people,\u2019 was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017,\u201d Flake said. \u201cIt bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase \u2018enemy of the people,\u2019 that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of \u201cannihilating such individuals\u201d who disagreed with the supreme leader. This alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president\u2019s party.\u201d\n\nThe president has had a running feud with Puerto Rico and its leaders.\n\nLast September, Trump rejected Puerto Rico\u2019s official estimate of 2,975 hurricane-related deaths after Hurricane Maria, tweeting that \u201c3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico.\u201d He said the death toll was \u201c6 to 18 deaths,\u201d and falsely claimed Democrats had produced the higher estimate \u201cto make me look as bad as possible.\u201d\n\nThen-Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who was running for Senate at the time, was among the Republicans who distanced themselves from Trump\u2019s remarks. \u201cI disagree with @POTUS,\u201d Scott tweeted. \u201cI\u2019ve been to Puerto Rico 7 times & saw devastation firsthand. The loss of any life is tragic; the extent of lives lost as a result of Maria is heart wrenching. I\u2019ll continue to help PR.\u201d\n\nIn April, Trump complained about the amount of federal disaster aid for Puerto Rico, falsely claiming that \u201cPuerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane\u201d and that it received \u201cmore money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before.\u201d\n\nAt the White House last year, the president met with Democrats and Republicans to discuss a bipartisan plan to remove the threat of deportation for so-called dreamers \u2014 young people who were illegally brought to the United States as children.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Dick Durbin later quoted the president as saying of African nations, \u201c\u2018Those shitholes send us the people that they don\u2019t want.\u2019 He repeated that. He didn\u2019t say that just one time.\u201d Durbin also quoted Trump as saying, \u201c\u2018We don\u2019t need more Haitians.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter the meeting, Sen. Lindsey Graham reportedly told his fellow Republican senator from South Carolina, Tim Scott, that the media reports about Trump\u2019s language at the meeting were \u201cbasically accurate,\u201d according to Charleston\u2019s Post and Courier.\n\nAs we wrote, Trump denied using those words, although he said in a tweet that he used \u201ctough\u201d language. \u201cThe language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used,\u201d Trump said, without explaining which remarks he denied making or what exactly he said at the meeting.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what was said, but the incident drew national and international rebukes, including from Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans. Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, said Trump\u2019s reported remarks, if true, were \u201cincredibly disappointing.\u201d In a statement, Rep. Mia Love, a Utah Republican whose parents came to the U.S. from Haiti, called them \u201cdivisive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President'[s] comments are unkind, divisive, elitist, and fly in the face of our nation\u2019s values,\u201d Love wrote. \u201cThis behavior is unacceptable from the leader of our nation.\u201d\n\nThese are just some examples.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,\u201d and as president ordered what he called a \u201ctravel ban\u201d on the citizens of seven predominately Muslim countries (Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen). That policy and other remarks about Muslims have caused a rift with leaders in the Muslim-American community.\n\nHe has also feuded with professional football players who knelt during the national anthem, mocked the physical appearance of women who have criticized him, and belittled political opponents in both parties with derogatory nicknames.\n\nAfter saying that his rhetoric \u201cbrings people together,\u201d Trump flew to Dayton, Ohio, and then El Paso, Texas, to comfort the victims of last week\u2019s mass shootings and thank law enforcement. After the president\u2019s visit, Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown said in a press conference that Trump was \u201creceived well by the patients\u201d and \u201cdid the right things.\u201d\n\nBut Brown also made statements at the press conference that angered Trump, and the president fired back. \u201cI had it with Sherrod Brown,\u201d Trump said.\n\nOn this day of unity, the president also went on Twitter to criticize \u201cSleepy Joe Biden,\u201d who gave a speech on the danger that Trump\u2019s \u201ctoxic tongue\u201d poses to the nation; describe Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas as \u201cthe lesser brother of a failed presidential candidate;\u201d and assail Fox News reporter Shepard Smith for having \u201cthe lowest rated show on @FoxNews.\u201d\n\nAs the first lady said, the president doesn\u2019t back down from a fight.", "lang": "en"}
