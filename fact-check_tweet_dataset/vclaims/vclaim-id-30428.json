Kirsten Gillibrand, D-NY, told the Press-Republican newspaper in Plattsburgh. \"It doesn\u2019t even have any oil for America to make our gas prices cheaper.\"\n\n \n\n \"It\u2019s literally oil from Canada taken through America, so we take all the risks of any kind of spill or any kind of problem, and then it exports it to Mexico and then straight to China or other places,\" she said.\n\nPolitiFact rated a similar claim from then-President Obama Mostly False in 2014. We checked with a few experts to see if anything has changed.\n\nIs Gillibrand right? Will the crude oil that flows through the pipeline immediately leave the U.S.?\n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline will transport crude oil from Alberta, Canada to Nebraska. The oil will then flow through another pipeline to Gulf Coast refineries, where it will be refined into petroleum products like gasoline.\n\nGulf Coast refineries export about two-thirds of their products, according to a U.S. Energy Information Administration report in January. The rest is sold in the U.S. That is a marked shift since 2012, when refineries exported about 38 percent of their products.\n\nThe Gulf Coast exports of crude oil -- oil that has not been refined into everything from butane to gasoline -- spiked during the same time period. Companies exported about 280,000 barrels of crude oil every day last year, compared to 4,000 in 2012.\n\nThe Gulf Coast imported more than 3.3 million barrels of crude oil a day in 2016.\n\nMost of that oil came from Latin America and the Middle East. Only 9 percent of the crude oil imported to the Gulf Coast came from Canada.\n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline was designed to transport oil to the Gulf Coast because refineries in the region are already equipped to process heavier crude oils, like those found in Canada\u2019s Alberta province. The same kind of crude oil comes to the region from Latin America.\n\nIf the pipeline transfers as much crude oil to the Gulf Coast as the federal government expects, total imports would increase by about 25 percent.\n\nThe U.S. State Department did not respond to most of Gillibrand\u2019s claim but did comment on how the pipeline could affect gas prices.\n\n\"As the final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement makes clear, gas prices throughout the United States are primarily driven by global market factors,\" a spokesperson said. \"The amount of Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) crude that makes its way to the Gulf region does not change this dynamic. Any impact on prices for refined petroleum products resulting from the approval and construction of the Keystone XL pipeline would be minimal.\"\n\nGillibrand suggests the crude oil imported through the pipeline would be immediately exported to other countries once it reaches the Gulf Coast. Experts say that is not the case.\n\n\"I don't believe that she is correct,\" said Mark Bateau, Director of the Energy Institute at the University of Michigan. \"In general, refineries designed to handle heavier crudes are the ones most likely to utilize this oil, in some cases instead of heavy crudes imported from places like Venezuela.\"\n\n\"I would say it doesn\u2019t accurately describe the likely outcome,\" said Stanley Reynolds, an environmental economics expert from the University at Arizona. \"It\u2019s true that the oil would come from Canada and then mainly go to the U.S. Gulf Coast for refining.\"\n\nTransCanada, the company building the pipeline, confirmed in an email that the pipeline was designed to reach refineries in the Gulf Coast region.\n\nExperts also say it\u2019s unlikely that none of the refined products will be sold in the U.S. once the pipeline is built.\n\n\"That refined oil product, gasoline or whatever, could be just as easily consumed in the United States as somewhere else,\" said Barry Rabe, an expert on environmental policy from the University at Michigan. \"There\u2019s nothing on the oil coming through a pipeline from Canada that requires all of that to be sold somewhere else.\"\n\nGillibrand said the Keystone XL pipeline \"doesn\u2019t even have any oil for America.\"\n\nExperts say the oil will not be exported straight to other countries, as Gillibrand said.\n\nIt is true that exports of petroleum products from Gulf Coast refineries have increased considerably in recent years. That\u2019s part of why PolitiFact rated a similar statement by Obama Mostly False in 2014. While the trend adds a grain of truth to her claim, it does not mean all of the oil that will come from the Keystone XL pipeline will be immediately exported.", "lang": "en"}
