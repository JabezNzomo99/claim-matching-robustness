Young Edison\u2019s troubles with a formal classroom setting, as well as his affection for his mother are well documented.\n\nEdison\u2019s early life is succinctly described in the National Park Service\u2019s biography of him:\n\nThomas Alva Edison was born on February 11, 1847 in Milan, Ohio; the seventh and last child of Samuel and Nancy Edison. When Edison was seven his family moved to Port Huron, Michigan. Edison lived here until he struck out on his own at the age of sixteen. Edison had very little formal education as a child, attending school only for a few months. He was taught reading, writing, and arithmetic by his mother, but was always a very curious child and taught himself much by reading on his own. This belief in self-improvement remained throughout his life.\n\nAccording to a U.S. Library of Congress biography of Edison, he was indeed labeled \u201caddled\u201d by a school administrator, an event that led his mother to remove him from school, but this information was not conveyed to her in a letter nor was it hidden by her from young Thomas:\n\nEdison was a poor student. When a schoolmaster called Edison \u201caddled,\u201d his furious mother took him out of the school and proceeded to teach him at home. Edison said many years later, \u201cMy mother was the making of me. She was so true, so sure of me, and I felt I had someone to live for, someone I must not disappoint.\u201d At an early age, he showed a fascination for mechanical things and for chemical experiments.\n\nBased on fictitious combinations of various actual slivers of truth, a number of heartwarming tales about the decision to homeschool Edison and his ability to overcome early educational struggles have been spun for a century. On November 19, 2016, the Facebook page \u201cLove What Really Matters\u201d became the latest to follow in that tradition, posting a video based on the text from a >reddit post. The video\u2019s script reads as follows:\n\nOne day, as a small child, Thomas Edison came home from school and gave a paper to his mother. He said to her \u201cMom, my teacher gave this paper to me and told me only you are to read it. What does it say?\u201d Her eyes welled with tears as she read the letter out loud to her child \u2026 \u201cYour son is a genius. This school is too small for him and doesn\u2019t have good enough teachers to train him. Please teach him yourself.\u201d Many years after Edison\u2019s mother had died, he became one of the greatest inventors of the century. One day he was going through a closet and he found the folded letter that his old teacher wrote his Mother that day. He opened it \u2026 The message written on the letter was \u201cYour son is mentally deficient. We cannot let him attend our school anymore. He is expelled.\u201d Edison became emotional reading it and then wrote in his diary: \u201cThomas A. Edison was a mentally deficient child whose mother turned him into the genius of the Century.\u201d A positive word of encouragement can help change anyone\u2019s destiny.\n\nThe veracity of this version of events, however, is belied by the actual account given by Thomas Edison himself in a rare interview to a long-extinct newspaper and literary journal called T.P\u2019s Weekly published on 29 November 1907. This interview is the earliest documented account of Edison\u2019s leaving formal schooling and is therefore likely to be the source of the historical fiction regarding his early education:\n\nOne day I overheard the teacher tell the inspector that I was \u201caddled\u201d and it would not be worthwhile keeping me in school any longer. I was so hurt by this last straw that I burst out crying and went home and told my mother about it. Then I found out what a good thing a good mother is. She came out as my strong defender. Mother love was aroused, mother pride wounded to the quick. She brought me back to the school and angrily told the teacher that he didn\u2019t know what he was talking about, that I had more brains than he himself, and a lot more talk like that. In fact, she was the most enthusiastic champion a boy ever had, and I determined right then that I would be worthy of her and show her that her confidence was not misplaced.\n\nAs Edison\u2019s first-person account stated, no letter to his mother was involved in these events, and Edison was never kept out of the loop for the sake of sparing his already hurt feelings. One of the most prolific and ingenious inventors of all time, Thomas Edison would be homeschooled until he set out on his own at the age of sixteen, openly grateful for his mother\u2019s support and education throughout his life.", "lang": "en"}
