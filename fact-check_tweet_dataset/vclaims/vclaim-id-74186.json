The passage lamented how \u201cgadabouts\u201d (defined by Cambridge Dictionary as \u201ca person who goes out a lot and does not worry about other things they should be doing\u201d) were still frequenting taverns despite the risk of contracting the plague:\n\nThere are two slightly differing versions of the passage, one describing the taverns as \u201cfull of gadabouts\u201d (as in the above meme), and the other describing them as \u201cfair full of gadabouts,\u201d as in the example below:\n\nThis is not a genuine quote from Pepys. This is a modern piece of writing that originated with a social media account parodying Pepys.\n\nPepys was a naval administrator and member of English Parliament. He was most famous, however, for recording a daily diary for nearly 10 years starting in 1660. Pepys wrote about several significant historical events during this time period, such as the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the Great Fire of London, and the Great Plague of London in 1665. The above-displayed passage, however, was not written by him.\n\nThis quote originated with the Twitter account @Pepys_Diaries, a sort of parody account that reimagines Pepys as if he were a modern-day writer. This account provides a pretty big clue that these are not real quotes, as it uses the handle \u201cFakeyPepys.\u201d Also, it is noted in the account\u2019s bio that quotes from the real Pepys can be found on the Twitter account @SamuelPepys.\n\nOn March 20, 2020, the parody account posted the now-viral quote:\n\nOddly enough, this is not the only entity posting fake diary entries from Pepys as if they were written during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. On March 9, for instance, The Fence magazine published the \u201cCoronavirus Diaries of Samuel Pepys.\u201d\n\nPepysdiary.com, a website dedicated to Pepys\u2019 actual writings, addressed this misquote in a March 2020 article. The website noted that another quote from the parody account had also gone viral:\n\nThere\u2019s been a parody Samuel Pepys twitter account running for a while at @Pepys_Diaries. It\u2019s a modern-day take on Pepys, imagining him writing in the modern world. Unfortunately one of the account\u2019s recent tweets, drawing parallels between the Plague and 2020\u2019s coronavirus, has been quoted out of context and spread around as if it\u2019s a real excerpt from the diary. The tweet: \u201cOn hearing ill rumour that Londoners may soon be urged into their lodgings by Her Majesty\u2019s men, I looked upon the street to see a gaggle of striplings making fair merry, and no doubt spreading the plague well about. Not a care had these rogues for the health of their elders!\u201d (Update: There\u2019s at least one more quote that\u2019s being passed around as if it\u2019s genuine, but is also from the fake diary account: \u201cThe taverns are fair full of gadabouts making merry this eve. And though I may press my face against the window like an urchin at a confectioner\u2019s, I am tempted not by the sweetmeats within. A dram in exchange for the pox is an ill bargain indeed.\u201d Screenshots of this, attributed to Samuel Pepys in 1664, get passed around Twitter and Facebook as if it\u2019s a prescient example of Pepys\u2019s diarising. There are obvious things that point to why it\u2019s not a real quote (as outlined in this Londonist article), and misuses of language that are apparent to those of us who read the real diary, but that doesn\u2019t stop those who aren\u2019t too familiar with the period.", "lang": "en"}
