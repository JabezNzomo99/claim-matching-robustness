In this video, a representative can be heard speaking about the recent mob-lynching in Jharkhand where Tabrez Ansari was tied to a pole and forced to chant \u2018Jai Shri Ram\u2019.\n\n\u201cTabrez Ansari ke liye awaaz UNO tak pahunchgayi. India is getting defamed because of Gau Rakshaks in front of the whole World\u2026 Shame,\u201d is the most common caption used to share the video.\n\nIn the video, the speaker begins his note by saying, \u201cIn the last five years Muslims in India have seen a rise in hate crimes committed against their community. In the last five years, there have been lynching of Muslims and Dalits across India by fanatic Hindu mobs ostensibly for the protection of the holy cow,\u201d then goes on to talk about the lynching of Tabrez Ansari. \u201cTen days ago, 24-year-old Tabrez Ansari was beaten for hours until he died in the hands of the Hindu mob in the eastern state of Jharkhand for not chanting Jai Sri Ram,\u201d he states. The clip quote-tweeted by AIMIM President Assauddin Owaisi. Several people have reached out to Alt News, asking about the veracity of the claim that mob-lynchings in India was discussed at the UN.\n\nAlt News found that Tabrez Ansari\u2019s case and mob-lynchings in India were indeed raised at the 7th Meeting of the 41st Regular Session held before the UN Human Rights Council. Paul Newmman Kumar Stanisclavas of the NGO Centre for Africa Development and Progress raised the issue. The complete video is posted on the official website of the United Nations Web TV. At 2:09:36 hours in the video, the relevant portion can be heard.\n\nUN Human Rights Council is a United Nations body whose mission is to promote and protect human rights around the world and is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nWhile addressing the session, Newmman said that India is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights but in the last five years, mob-lynching against Muslim and Dalits in India have been on a rise.\n\nHis entire speech on the issue is as follows:\n\n\u201cIn the last five years Muslims in India have seen a rise in hate crimes committed against their community. In the last five years, there have been lynching of Muslims and Dalits across India by fanatic Hindu mobs ostensibly for the protection of the holy cow. Since April 2017, at least 10 Muslims have been lynched in public in suspected hate crimes. The attacks have contributed to a growing sense of insecurity among Muslims and intensified religious tension. The recent trend is to make Muslims chant Jai Sri Ram. Ten days ago, 24-year-old Tabrez Ansari was beaten for hours until he died in the hands of the Hindu mob in the eastern state of Jharkhand for not chanting Jai Sri Ram. Recently, a Muslim teacher has attacked in a train for being Muslim. He was heckled to say Jai Sri Ram, when he refused he was beaten and forced to get off the train. Member of Parliament, Pratap Sarangi, of the ruling party, in his first speech in the Parliament, asked why people who refuse to chant Hindu slogans should be allowed to live in India. These fanatic Hindu mobs have moved around with apparent impunity. The Indian state has remained mute to the cries of the minorities.\u201d\n\nIt is noteworthy that BJP MP Pratap Chandra Sarangi, in his maiden Parliament speech, did not say that people who refuse to chant Hindu slogans should not be allowed to live in India. His comment was on \u2018Vande Mataram\u2019 and not \u2018Jai Shri Ram\u2019 or any other Hindu slogans.\n\nNewmman ended his speech by urging the UNHRC to intervene and requested India to follow the principles laid down in its Constitution.\n\nIt is, therefore, true that the issue of mob-lynchings, including the recent murder of Tabrez Ansari, was raised at the UN.", "lang": "en"}
