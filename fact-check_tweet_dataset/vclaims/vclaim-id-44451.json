This claim was in response to a question from the SNP MP Carol Monaghan about unaccompanied child refugees.\n\nHome Office data shows that 41,396 asylum seekers and refugees under the age of 18 were granted leave to remain in the UK between 2010 and 2019.\n\nBut not all of these were unaccompanied.\n\n11,338 (27%) were classified by the Home Office as an unaccompanied asylum seeking child while 16,671 (40%) were accompanied.\n\nThe remaining 13,387 young people granted leave to remain were part of resettlement schemes. We cannot tell from these statistics whether these young people were accompanied by a parent or carer, or if they were unaccompanied.\n\nThe Home Office confirmed to us that 41,000 was the figure for the total number of children granted protection since 2010.", "lang": "en"}
