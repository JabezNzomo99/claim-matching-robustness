We will update our story on receiving a response.\n\nSiasat even said that at this ranking BJP had overtaken the German Nazi party ( The National Socialist German Workers' Party). Below is the text that accompanied the graphic.\n\n\"At this ranking the BJP has not only overtaken much known rebellious German Nazi party but is also rubbing shoulders with world renown notorious dictatorial political parties like the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz, PML(N), the National Resistance Movement \u2013 Uganda, Progressive Action Party of Cuba which came third, Vietnam\u2019s Communist party, the Kuomintang of China and the Nationalist Fascist Party of Italy.\"\n\nThe fake story seems to be based on a graphic that has been viral on social media for a while now. A variation of the same graphic says BJP was voted the fourth most corrupt party in the world according to a survey conducted by BBC. On placing both graphics next to each other, the rankings are the same, making it evident that BBC's logo has been swapped with that of CNN's.\n\nIn March this year, a fake story by fake news site BBC News Point about the Congress being ranked 4th among the top 10 most corrupt parties in the world, went viral. The story was subsequently debunked by many sites. 'BBC survey' claiming that Congress 4th most corrupt party in the world is fake.'\n\nBBC News Point is a fake news site that has no relation to the actual British Broadcasting Corporation in the United Kingdom (BBC). After being called out the site moved the story to another fake URL Fox News Point - https://www.foxnewspoint.com/top-10-most-corrupt-political-party-in-the-world-2017/", "lang": "en"}
