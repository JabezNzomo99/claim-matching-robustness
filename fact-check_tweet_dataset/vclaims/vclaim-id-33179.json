Let\u2019s try to find the authenticity of the claim. \n\n\n\nClaim: Runny nose and coughing sputum suggest that one does not have COVID-19. They are not symptoms of COVID-19. Fact: In the advisories issued by WHO, it can be seen that \u2018runny nose\u2019 and \u2018sputum production\u2019 are also symptoms of COVID-19. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn the WHO\u2019s website, \u2018runny nose\u2019 can be seen in the symptoms list of COVID-19.\n\nThe \u2018sputum production\u2019 can be seen as a symptom of COVID-19 in the \u2018Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\u2019 (submitted on 28 February 2020).\n\nAlso, according to \u2018AFP\u2019 article, there is no medical expert with the name \u2018Dr. Khin Maung U\u2019 at a hospital in Shenzhen and also, there is no \u201cShenzhen Hospital\u201d. Previously, FACTLY has debunked the claim that garlic protects people from the new Coronavirus; the article can be read here.\n\nTo sum it up, \u2018runny nose\u2019 and \u2018sputum production\u2019 are also symptoms of COVID-19.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
