The footage was filmed in May 2012 \u2013 eight years before the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 and shows a victory parade in the Hougang neighbourhood.\n\nOther videos of the same parade can be matched to the Facebook video, taking particular notice of the man on the bus wearing a yellow garland round his neck and the same election material pasted on the side of the vehicle (here , here).\n\nGoogle Street View can also help to date the video. Images from April 2011 from Hougang Avenue 5 shows the exact location of the parade (tinyurl.com/y77lpjf2). However, the same location in 2019 shows the road has been updated with a grassy island in the centre (tinyurl.com/ybarv2xf). The video on Facebook matches the location in the 2011 Street View.\n\nFalse. The video does not show Worker\u2019s Party members shaking hands with crowds of supporters amid the COVID-19 pandemic. It was shot in 2012.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our work to fact-check social media posts here .", "lang": "en"}
