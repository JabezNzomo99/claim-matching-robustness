Far from citing any peer-reviewed scientific paper, the article states that its primary source of information is an article from the company Providr, a clickbait mill Snopes exposed for fraudulent Facebook practices in multiple 2018 investigations. The article itself, which in reality devotes only a few sentences to the headline claim, cites questionable websites like Natural Health and Healing 4 You and Organic Facts to support its argument. Finally, that claim relies on one of the most overused tropes in pseudoscientific literature: the notion of \u201cdetoxifying your body\u201d through nutrition:\n\nLow potassium is associated with just about every single health issue caused by smoking \u2026 This is why it is effective to use while quitting smoking. It puts potassium back into your system and gets your adrenal glands working in conjunction with the rest of your body. Then your body naturally decides which toxins to eliminate through bowel movements, urine, and sweat. Everyone knows the importance of keeping vitamin C. What many people don\u2019t know is that nicotine blocks your ability to adequately absorb it into the blood. On the upside, one glass of OJ delivers well above the recommended daily value. So when you drink a glass mixed with Cream of Tartar, you twice [sic] the medical benefits.\n\nPotassium tartrate (and other potassium chemicals) exists as potassium ions in the body, which are undeniably crucial for several important cellular processes, and a factor in multiple health conditions. Despite its chemical importance, no scientific basis exists for any claim that it can affect the removal of nicotine from the body or ease the cessation of smoking. Instead, Shareably relies on vague, scientific sounding non sequiturs that do not actually provide support for the headline claim.\n\nPatrick Mulholland, a professor at The Medical University of South Carolina and an expert in the biological processes underlying addiction, described the claim as \u201cridiculous,\u201d telling us via email that \u201cthere is currently no known mechanism by which increasing [potassium] in the diet will reduce smoking or relapse in individuals with nicotine dependence.\u201d\n\nThe most obvious implication made with these vague internet claims is that smoking somehow lowers levels of potassium in the body \u2014 a medical condition known as hypokalemia. \u201cThere is no evidence that smoking itself causes hypokalemia\u201d Mulholland told us. In fact, he added, \u201cacute nicotine exposure can increase [potassium] levels\u201d in the bloodstream. In other words, smoking cigarettes, while undeniably bad for your health, does not create a potassium deficiency in the body that could be rectified by the addition of more potassium. (As another problem, \u201clittle is known\u201d about how potassium levels in the body are affected by diet in the first place.)\n\nWhat about the claim that potassium helps \u201cflush\u201d nicotine out of the body by \u201cget[ing] your adrenal glands working in conjunction with the rest of your body\u201d such that \u201cyour body naturally decides which toxins to eliminate through bowel movements, urine, and sweat?\u201d This is essentially gibberish. Cream of tartar has \u201ca long history\u201d as a purging agent for one simple reason: it has a diuretic effect, which means it increases the amount of water expelled from the body in urine.\n\nIt is unclear, however, how that action would serve to increase the metabolism \u2014 i.e. breakdown \u2014 of nicotine. These chemicals are broken down into metabolites by the liver before being excreted as urine. Further, from an addiction standpoint, the rapid removal of nicotine from the body \u2014 even if potassium tartrate could cause that effect \u2014 would counterproductively serve to increase the frequency of cravings, not reduce them.\n\nThe alleged role Shareably suggests vitamin C plays in this process is even less precise. A closer look at these arguments reveals them to be especially flimsy. The first proffered argument does not actually provide support for the assertion that potassium helps you remove nicotine and/or quit smoking, it merely suggests adding the orange juice to replace all the lost vitamins from the purging. To be clear, this would be a solution to a problem that didn\u2019t exist before the treatment, not a path toward quitting smoking.\n\nAnother explanation they provide is simpler, but decidedly less-impressive sounding: \u201cdrinking [orange juice and cream of tartar] will drastically alter the way things taste, including cigarettes,\u201d implying that the unpleasant taste would make people less likely to smoke. This explanation may hold the closest relevance to their claims of smoking cessation, but it is one that is unsupported by any actual scientific research. The National Institute on Drug Abuse does not endorse that notion, and a review of the literature suggests that very few people, if any, have tested it.\n\nAs a final note, consuming too much cream of tartar can lead to adverse health effects on its own \u2014 there have been rare cases of \u201clife-threatening\u201d hyperkalemia (too much potassium) resulting from people using cream of tartar as a cleanse.\n\nOne of the driving features of pseudoscientific clickbait is that it floods a reader with bits and pieces of actual science that are then misrepresented or distorted. This article is no different.\n\nFor example, the piece asserts that \u201clow potassium is associated with just about every single health issue caused by smoking.\u201d Correlation is not causation. The association presented here is used to falsely suggest that because people with low potassium and people who smoke share similar medical maladies, supplementation with potassium would be the solution. The problem with this argument is that one of the most common symptoms that chronic smokers experience is also the defining feature of hypokalemia: hypertension. Hypertension, in turn, is a major factor in most of the other complications \u2014 cardiac problems, etc. \u2014 at issue in smoking. That link does not mean smoking-connected hypertension is related to potassium levels in the bloodstream, nor has any research been published supporting that notion.\n\nSimilarly, the article asserts that nicotine \u201cblocks your ability to adequately absorb [vitamin C] into the blood.\u201d While it is true that smokers generally have lower levels of vitamin C in their body, this association is used to support the notion that vitamin C has an important role to play in smoking-related maladies without ever explaining what role vitamin C deficiency is alleged to play in either preventing the removal of nicotine from the body or prolonging someone\u2019s efforts to quit smoking.\n\nBecause no published support exists for the claim that cream of tartar can play any role in either the removal of nicotine from the body or as an aid to quit smoking, and because the scientific facts used to make that argument are incorrect, distorted, or irrelevant, we rank this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
