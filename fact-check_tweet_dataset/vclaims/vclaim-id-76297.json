Ted Cruz is slamming Trump on the issue in a campaign ad airing just days before the Nevada Republican presidential caucus on Feb. 23.\n\n\"Eighty-five percent of Nevada is owned and regulated by the federal government,\" says Cruz in the ad. \"And Donald Trump wants to keep big government in charge. That\u2019s ridiculous.\"\n\nThe ad has aired dozens of times in Reno through the lead up to Nevada's caucus, . We thought Cruz\u2019s claim merited fact-checking, because public lands management is a critical issue with Nevada voters.\n\nAn on-screen graphic refers to a January interview with Field & Stream magazine, where he would be hesitant to give federal land over to state and local governments.\n\n\"I don\u2019t like the idea, because I want to keep the lands great, and you don\u2019t know what the state is going to do,\" he told an interviewer. \"I mean, are they going to sell if they get into a little bit of trouble?\"\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign offered a of his proposed policy in an answer to a candidate questionnaire, but said the bigger issue was land management and not transfer of ownership.\n\n\"The issue is not that so much of the state is public land; it is how that land is managed,\" the campaign wrote, promising to cut \"needless bureaucratic red tape.\"\n\nCruz, on the other hand, takes a more libertarian stance on public land issues and said the amount of land owned by the federal government is \"unacceptable.\"\n\n\"I believe we should transfer as much federal land as possible back to the states and ideally back to the people,\" he in December.\n\nCruz fought with the Bureau of Land Management over the to \"claim 90,000 acres of disputed land near Texas\u2019s Red River,\" and for a time Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy\u2019s standoff with the federal government over his unpaid grazing fees.\n\nAnd many of the Texas senator\u2019s Nevada supporters in the state Legislature that \"would lay claim to almost all federally managed public lands and water rights in the state.\"\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Nevada\u2019s expressly gives up the state\u2019s rights to all \"unappropriated public lands\" to the federal government, which is why it\u2019s worth quibbling with candidates like Cruz and promise to \"return\" control to its citizens \u2014 who have never held a claim to the federally owned land in the past 151 years of Nevada statehood.\n\nCruz says that Trump wants to keep \"big government\" in charge of Nevada\u2019s public lands.\n\nTrump has answered questions on public land management twice. He has not advocated for transferring ownership, but he has focused on cutting bureaucratic red tape. Cruz exaggerates Trump's position slightly by saying Trump favors \"big\" government.\n\nWe rate the ad's statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
