Jason Smith sent out a tweet last month paralleling job growth with tax cuts, citing the George W.Bush, Reagan", "author": "www.politifact.com", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-69161", "url": "http://www.politifact.com/missouri/statements/2017/dec/24/jason-smith/no-solid-evidence-tax-cuts-created-jobs/", "vclaim": "We reached out to Smith\u2019s office to see where he got his information, and spokeswoman Maggie Starks said the numbers came from the White House. The White House looked at how jobs grew over a five-year period after each president signed tax legislation.\n\nThe law went into effect at the end of May 2003, but the White House started its calculations in January. In the first month of 2003, U.S.employment numbers were at 130.6 million jobs; five years later, there were 138.4 million jobs. This is an increase of about 7.8 million jobs, which is what Smith (and the White House) said were created.\n\nWe started looking at job growth beginning in January of that year like the White House did. In January 1964, there were 57.5 million jobs available. Fast forwarding five years, there were 69.4 million jobs, showing an increase of about 12 million jobs, right on par with Smith\u2019s claim.\n\nIn January 1981, the start of the year the tax cuts went into effect, there were about 91 million jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The same time five years later, the number was at 98.7 million jobs. This is an increase of 7.7 million jobs, over 7.1 million less than Smith claimed.\n\nTaxes aren\u2019t the only aspect that affect an economy, and it\u2019s hard to prove if they can have that big of an impact on jobs, said Chris Edwards, the director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute.\n\nEdwards said the tax cuts probably did help businesses create jobs, but there was so much else going on during those time periods that no economist could pinpoint the overall jobs picture to one policy change.\n\nAparna Mathur, a resident scholar at American Enterprise Institute, echoed Edwards\u2019 statement, and said, \"it\u2019s hard to establish between tax cuts and the number of jobs created because there are too many confounding factors associated with tax changes that could have led to the job growth.\"\n\nLee Price, former chief economist of the House Appropriations Committee and fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, said although jobs went up in the years after the named tax cuts, one could also argue that the tax hikes of 1993 and 2010 were responsible for the creation of millions of jobs for the following several years. The Institute for Policy Studies is a progressive think tank in Washington D.C.\n\nSmith claimed that the Bush, Kennedy and Reagan administrations signed into law tax cuts that created millions of jobs by saying, \"America needs the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct. Check out the record of #jobs created by #TaxCuts 7.8 million new jobs after Bush\u2019s 2003 tax cuts 12 million new jobs after Kennedy's 1964 tax cuts 14.8 MILLION new jobs after Ronald Reagan\u2019s tax cuts in 1981.\"\n\nJobs were created after each of the laws went into effect, but some of Smith\u2019s numbers were off, and experts agree that there are too many factors that create jobs to simply say tax cuts are the reason.", "lang": "en"}
