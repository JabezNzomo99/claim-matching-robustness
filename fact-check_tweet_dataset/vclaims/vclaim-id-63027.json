The following article deals specifically with the specific claim that hand sanitizer will \u201cspontaneously combust\u201d if left in a hot car.\n\nIn April 2020, a series of photographs started to circulate on WhatsApp and Telegram that supposedly showed the aftermath of a car fire caused by an unattended bottle of hand sanitizer.\n\nThese posts, many of which were written in Portuguese, urged people to be cautious about leaving hand sanitizer in their cars because, they claimed, it can spontaneously combust.\n\nA month or so after these posts went viral in Brazil, a similar rumor started to circulate on English-language pages. In addition to being spread by anonymous social media users, these warnings also made their way onto the pages of a real fire departments. The Western Lakes Fire District of Wisconsin (WLFD) in Wisconsin, for instance, shared the following post to its Facebook page on May 21:\n\nSoon after, a number of news outlets picked up on this story and ran articles about how a fire department was warning people not to leave hand sanitizer in their cars. Although WLFD truly did post the above-displayed warning, the department later removed the post for stirring confusion.\n\nFor starters, the picture has not been officially linked to a fire caused by a bottle of hand sanitizer exploding into flame. A number of experts have also weighed in to say that while hand sanitizer does contain alcohol and is flammable, it would require a tremendous amount of heat for spontaneous combustion. Although this sort of fire may be technically possible (more on that later), we\u2019ve yet to see any official reports about a car fire starting this way. Lastly, the WLFD did state that a fire could be started via \u201cmagnification of light through the bottle,\u201d but this is true for any plastic bottle and has little to do with its contents.\n\nWLFD deleted its original hand sanitizer warning and replaced it with the following message:\n\nOur goal in the WLFD is to provide timely, accurate, and educational information while responding to the needs of our customers. It\u2019s become clear that a recent post about hand sanitizer was taken in many different directions from our original goal. We want to take the opportunity to clear up some misunderstandings and assure our position is understood. While we never made the claim that the photo utilized was from our district or from an exploding container of hand sanitizer, it has become clear that that inference and speculation made is seem as though it was. It was to illustrate a door fire resulting from contact with open flame which was the center of our post. Our message was intended to center on preventing fire or injury from the use of hand sanitizer. It also regarded the past history of issues stemming from clear bottles being stored in vehicles. These bottles typically store bottled water or as of late; hand sanitizer. While infrequent, there have been cases in the recent past were reflecting light placed through a clear bottle was able to focus onto a combustible surface and cause a fire. This has primarily been through water bottles but since hand sanitizer is often stored in the same vessel we wanted to pass it along for your safety. The principle is identical and obviously an additional issue would occur if it happened in the presence of an alcohol based product. The open flame comment was to remind people that when hand sanitizer is wet on any surface it will ignite when exposed to flame. With the recent increase in utilization of this product we wanted to remind our customers that it\u2019s important not to allow this to occur. Many people have been sequestered in their homes and with an upcoming holiday accompanied with nice weather we knew grilling, fire pits, and other enjoyments would be in place. While we never referenced grilling in one\u2019s vehicle, we did center on smoking and wanted to assure that the correlation was made illustrating that is also an open flame. We didn\u2019t want anyone injured exercising good hygiene practices and then unintentionally coming in contact with open flame. Video representation of this happening is included for our fans to watch. We simply want our customers to be happy healthy and well and most importantly enjoy the time they have together with family and friends. Our message quickly came became misconstrued and we wanted to assure that we made it right. We apologize for any confusion and wish you an enjoyable holiday weekend.\n\nJudging from the amount of mail Snopes received, many people were still confused about what dangers may lurk in bottles of hand sanitizer. So let\u2019s take a closer look at the questions this viral post sparked.\n\nMany hand sanitizers contain alcohol, and these alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHS) are flammable. The Federal Aviation Administration wrote in a 2010 report:\n\nHand sanitizers also give off vapors, and these vapors are also flammable.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) writes:\n\nOne of the major fears that people had after encountering this rumor on social media was that their hand sanitizer was going to \u201cspontaneously combust\u201d if left too long in a hot car. We won\u2019t say that this is impossible, but we will say that it is extremely unlikely.\n\nAccording to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), hand sanitizer would have to be exposed to extreme heats (over 700 degrees Fahrenheit) in order to spontaneously combust.\n\nThose sort of temperatures just aren\u2019t going to be seen inside of a parked car (so long as that car is parked on Earth). A 2018 study published in the journal Temperature found that the average temperature in a parked car on a 95-degree day was about 116 degrees. Specific parts of the car, such as the dashboard, climbed closer to 160 degrees, but that is still far from the 700 degrees needed for spontaneous combustion.\n\nCan a Bottle of Hand Sanitizer Focus Sunlight into a Strong Enough Heat Source to Start a Fire?\n\nThis claim has more to do with the magnification properties of plastic bottles than it does with the contents of said bottles. In fact, in 2017, a similar warning was circulated on social media that said leaving a water bottle in your car on a hot day could result in a fire.\n\nAlthough it is technically possible for a fire to start in this manner, again, it is very unlikely. The sun, the bottle, and a flammable source would all have to be in perfect alignment on a rather hot day to ignite a fire.\n\nIn June 2020, Illinois\u2019 Waukegan Fire Department reported that a small bottle of hand sanitizer had started a car fire. The organization later amended their statement to clarify that the fire was started in the manner described above \u2014 a plastic bottle focusing direct sunlight into beam hot enough to start a fire \u2014 so its cause was unrelated to the substance in the bottle.\n\nAll Smoke and No Flame?\n\nThe claim that hand sanitizer was causing car fires first gained traction in Brazil in April 2020 via social media posts on WhatsApp. This spurred the country\u2019s Corpo de Bombeiros de Campo Grande (Campo Grande Fire Department) to issue a warning about the potential dangers of leaving hand sanitizer in a hot car. However, the fire department admitted that it had yet to see any fires caused in such a manner. Likewise, we have yet to uncover any confirmed reports about hand sanitizer causing a fire while left in a parked car on a hot day.\n\nHowever, many hand sanitizers are still flammable and do pose some risks. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should not be used near open flames, and people storing large amounts of hand sanitizer should adhere to the National Fire Protection Association\u2019s Flammable and Combustible Liquids code.\n\nAlthough keeping a small bottle of hand sanitizer in your car won\u2019t result in spontaneous combustion, cautious drivers may want to store their hand sanitizer (and any other liquids kept in plastic bottles) out of direct sunlight in their glove boxes or center consoles.", "lang": "en"}
