The men were therefore not dressed as army men but cops. We searched for police emblems of different Indian states and compared them with the one seen in the photograph and found that the emblem was of the Andhra Pradesh police.\n\nA comparison between J&K police emblem and the emblem used by AP police shows clear dissimilarities between the two.\n\nA further search on Twitter revealed that the image was tweeted by the official handle of the CPI(M) on July 26, 2016. The party claimed that Andhra Pradesh police had come down heavily upon SFI students protesting against the closing down of social welfare hostels in the state.\n\nAccording to a July 20, 2016 report in The Hans India, SFI had organised protests \u201cdemanding enhancement of mess and cosmetic charges and reopen the closed social welfare hostels.\u201d The government had reportedly shut down over 500 hostels in the state.\n\nIn conclusion, an image from Andhra Pradesh shot in 2016 was shared by Pakistani political commentator Zaid Hamid as brutality against Kashmiri women by RSS members dressed in Indian army fatigue. Hamid had earlier tweeted a video from Sri Lanka as atrocities on Muslims in India.", "lang": "en"}
