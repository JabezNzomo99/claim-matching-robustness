It was a years-old hoax created from a stock image.\n\nBack in May 2018, the University of W\u00fcrzburg in Germany held a TEDx-sponsored event with the theme of \u201cFuture Societys\u201d [sic], at which a speaker gave a controversial presentation on the subject of \u201cWhy our perception of pedophilia has to change\u201d and stated that \u201cpedophilia is an unchangeable sexual orientation.\u201d (TEDx events \u201care organized independently under a free license granted by TED\u201d and \u201care not controlled by TED,\u201d according to the parent organization.)\n\nSpurred by a Breitbart article about the controversy created by that TEDx presentation (dubbed \u201c#TEDogate\u201d), users on the 4chan imageboard website began creating and posting disparaging memes about it, including the one displayed above:\n\nAfterwards, that image was circulated by itself on Facebook, without any context explaining its origins, as if it were a genuine advertisement that had been run on the social media network.", "lang": "en"}
