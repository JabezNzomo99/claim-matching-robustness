If it shows Mark Zuckerberg it means your account is not hacked. If not, then, you need to change the setting\u2026 Try it now\u2026 It works!\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The text then turned into the words, \"I\u2019m gay.\" That\u2019s because the series of numbers in this case corresponded to a Facebook page titled \"I\u2019m gay.\" The series of numbers was the account\u2019s Facebook page ID.\n\n\"Today\" created a Facebook page called, \"Don\u2019t panic! This is just a test,\" and ran an experiment asking users to type the page\u2019s ID number into the same formula and, you guessed it, the text changed to the words, \"Don\u2019t panic! This is just a test.\"", "lang": "en"}
