Trump\u2019s Twitter account has a blue checkmark, signifying Twitter has verified the account as authentic, whereas the account shown in the screen grab does not. It has the wrong handle \u2013 @realDonaldTrump_ rather than @realDonaldTrump. (RELATED: Did Mel Gibson Say Hollywood \u2018Is An Institutionalized Pedophile Ring\u2019?)\n\nA search of Trump\u2019s verified Twitter accounts \u2013 @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS \u2013 turned up no matches for the tweet. Nor did the Daily Caller News Foundation find the tweet in the Trump Twitter Archive, a database of Trump\u2019s tweets dating back to May 2009. The DCNF also searched an archive of his deleted tweets, but found no similar tweets.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a tweet has been falsely attributed to Trump. Social media users often fabricate Trump tweets using websites such as FakeTrumpTweet.com and FakeTweetGenerator.com, but in this case, the tweet came from an account attempting to impersonate the president by using the same profile picture and a similar username. Check Your Fact has debunked numerous fake tweets attributed to Trump in recent months.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
