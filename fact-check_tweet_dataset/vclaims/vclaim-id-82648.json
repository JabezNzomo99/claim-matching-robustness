The image was featured in an article by The Times.\n\nThe account flipped the orientation of the picture to trick search engines.\n\nThe fake handle using an alias 'Brandon Davies' was set up on March 30, 2019. The account's bio described itself as a British nationalist covering elections in India. It also claimed to have voted in favour of Brexit.\n\nWhile the account barely had over 900 followers at the time of writing this story, it came into focus for a tweet critical of Congress President Rahul Gandhi. That tweet alone had nearly 11,700 Likes .\n\nIt was also retweeted by Tajinder Bagga, a spokesperson for the Bharatiya Janata Party in Delhi, with a following of over half a million on Twitter.\n\nA screenshot of the tweet was also shared on Facebook where it received over 1500 shares.\n\nThe account is currently following Indian politicians, known right-wing Twitter handles and a few left-wing satire handles in India.\n\nScreenshot of some of the accounts followed by the fake account\n\nAnother telltale sign that the account was fake was that it did not follow a single individual account from the UK. The only British accounts it was following were @KensingtonRoyal \u200f @10DowningStreet \u200f and the @RoyalFamily \u200f .\n\nThe fake account has now changed its profile picture to a photo of 62-year old Nigel Addison whose profile picture was stolen and misused by another fake troll account in the UK.", "lang": "en"}
