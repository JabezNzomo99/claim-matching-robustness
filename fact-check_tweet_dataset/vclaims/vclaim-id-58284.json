In 2016, a South African pastor reportedly gave his congregants Dettol, but no one appears to have died in that incident.\n\nThe post, which features a picture of a man pouring a red liquid into a woman\u2019s mouth, claims, \u201c59 people die as Pastor gives them dettol to drink in church to prevent Coronavirus in Kenya.\u201d Dettol is a brand of antiseptic cleaning solution.

Had such an incident occurred, it would have been picked up by media outlets, yet none have reported on it, except to debunk it.\n\nA reverse image search of the featured photo turned up matches in two South African media reports from 2016. The Daily Sun article, which puts up the headline \u201cFrom Pastor Doom To Pastor Disinfectant,\u201d reports that \u201cProphet Rufus Phala of AK Spiritual Christian Church made his church members drink Dettol, claiming they will be healed (sic) sickness.\u201d The South African outlet Eyewitness News also wrote about the incident in December 2016 and used the same image as that in the Facebook post.\n\nDettol South Africa released a statement addressing the incident at the time, saying, \u201cDettol Antiseptic Liquid is not for human consumption and is for external use only, and we condemn the reported usage as inappropriate.\u201d\n\nThe statement went on to say Dettol South Africa has \u201cbeen in contact with Prophet Rufus Phala\u201d and has \u201casked him to stop this practice.\u201d Anyone who consumes Dettol should see a doctor, the company also advised in the statement. No media outlets reported that congregants died in the 2016 incident.\n\nThe claim appears to stem from a March 19 article published on the website Kenya Today. That article, titled \u201c59 people die as Pastor gives them dettol to drink in church to prevent Coronavirus,\u201d alleges Phala gave his congregants Dettol to prevent COVID-19 infection. But a spokesperson for the South African Police Service told AFP Fact Check that the claim was false and \u201cdenied any investigations into the deaths of 59 people linked to the consumption of Dettol,\u201d according to the outlet.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
