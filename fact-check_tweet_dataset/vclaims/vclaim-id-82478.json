Bahut saara aaloo ka ban raha hai, chips wagairah. Everything is being made, also export bhi kitna hota hai.\n\nThe above was tweeted by news agency ANI on April 5, along with a sound bite of BJP MP and actor Hema Malini, who is responding to a question posed by a reporter.\n\nThe video clip begins with the reporter asking \u201c\u2026Aloo ki factory lagayenge, ek taraf aloo dalenge doosri taraf sona niklega? (Potato factory will be set up, insert potato from one end and gold comes out from the other? \u2013 translation).\n\nTo this, Hema Malini responds by saying, \u201cSabse pehle toh hamari sarkar bahut saari jagah mein factory laga chuki hai. Bahut saara aaloo ka ban raha hai, chips wagairah. Everything is being made, also export bhi kitna hota hai. (Firstly, our govt has set up factories at many places, lot of potato (products) like chips etc. are being made. Everything is being made. A lot is being exported- translation).\n\nWhat is to be noted over here is that the video clip is 18 seconds long, and begins abruptly with the reporter\u2019s question already underway. The question is with reference to what Rahul Gandhi had supposedly once said- about setting up a \u2018potato factory\u2019, where potato turns into gold when inserted into a machine. Gandhi has been the butt of jokes on social media and beyond over his purported \u2018aloo sona\u2019 remark.\n\nThe version posted by ANI via its tweet is truncated. Like pointed out earlier, the video clip begins abruptly. Another version of the same video, which was posted on Twitter, clearly shows that the reporter asks Hema Malini, \u201cRahul Gandhi kehte hain na aloo ki factory lagayenge ek taraf aloo dalenge doosri taraf sona niklega?\u201d (Rahul Gandhi says potato factories will be set up, we will put potato from one end and get gold from the other?- translation).\n\nIt is the reporter herself who says, \u201cRahul Gandhi kehte hain (Rahul Gandhi has said)\u201d. She is referring to the Congress president having made this ridiculous statement.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Rahul Gandhi had never said that he would set up a \u2018potato factory\u2019 where machines would miraculously turn potatoes into gold. The basis for this claim is a curtailed video clip of a rally in which Gandhi had criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Gandhi was actually referring to PM Modi, saying that the latter had told farmers that he would set up a machine to convert potatoes into gold.\n\nABP News had fact-checked this popular misinformation in January 2018. As can be seen in the video posted below, Rahul Gandhi had said,\n\n\u201cAloo ke kisano ko kaha, aisi machine lagaunga, iss side se aloo ghusega uss side se sona niklega. iss side se aloo dalo uss side se sona dalo. itna paisa banega apko pata nai hoga kya karna hai paise ka. Mere shabd nahi hai Narendra Modi ji ke shabd hain\u201d (He told potato farmers, i will set up such a machine, that i will insert potato from one end and extract gold from the other. put potato at one end and extract gold from the other. You will make so much money that you will not know what to do with it. These are not my words. These are the words of Modi ji- translation).\n\nThe complete video was uploaded on the Congress president\u2019s YouTube channel. The relevant portion begins at 17:50 minutes. Rahul Gandhi was speaking at Patan, Gujarat at a public rally in November 2017. It may be noted that Rahul Gandhi\u2019s claim amounts to political rhetoric, since there is no record of PM Narendra Modi having ever made any such statement.\n\nThe reporter\u2019s query to Hema Malini was based on misinformation which was made popular over time through repetition. It may be reiterated that Rahul Gandhi had never made such a statement, and was in fact accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of having made that pledge to farmers.", "lang": "en"}
