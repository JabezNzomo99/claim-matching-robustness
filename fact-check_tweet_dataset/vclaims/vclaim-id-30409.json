Newspapers & various online media outlets picked up from the Prime Minister\u2019s speech on the occasion of 50th year celebrations of Indian Merchant Chamber Ladies Wing. A closer analysis of what the PM said and how it was interpreted by the media reveals that it is a classic case of misreporting and trying to manufacture something that always existed.\n\nWhat did the PM really say?\n\nThe Prime Minister said the following with respect to passport in his speech.\n\nThe PM made the following two statements with respect to passport.\n\u2022 It is not mandatory for a woman to submit her marriage certificate or divorce decree while applying for passport\n\u2022 A woman can choose whether the name in the passport should be of her mother or the father and not both parents.\n\nLet us examine both the statements.\n\nSubmission of Certificates no more mandatory\n\nThe government in December 2016 had announced new passport rules. Among other things, the new rules include the following\n\u2022 No affidavit or Marriage Certificate required for married applicants:Married applicants would not be required to provide Annexure K or any marriage certificate.\n\u2022 Name of Spouse not required for separated/divorced applicants:The Passport application form does not require the applicant to provide the name of her/his spouse in case of separated or divorced persons. Such applicants for passports would not be required to provide even the Divorce Decree.\n\nHence this statement of the PM is true that the current government has simplified the passport rules and removed the mandatory rule about submission of marriage certificate or a divorce decree. This is not just for a woman, but is equally applicable to a man.\n\nDid the PM say anything about the maiden name?\n\nThe second statement of the Prime Minister was about a woman\u2019s choice of having her mother\u2019s or father\u2019s name in the passport. The statement had nothing to do with retaining the maiden name. In fact, the PM\u2019s statement was about another change in the rules made in December 2016. The change was made to make it easy for single parents to obtain passports for their children. Unlike earlier, the passport application form now requires the applicant to provide the name of father or mother or legal guardian, i.e., only one parent and not both. This would enable single parents to apply for passports for their children and to also issue passports where the name of either the father or the mother is not required to be printed at the request of the applicant. Earlier, it was mandatory to mention both the father\u2019s & mother\u2019s name in the passport application. Again, this rule is not just for a woman, but for any single parent.\n\nWhat about the Maiden name then?\n\nNothing changed with respect to the maiden name. A woman always had the choice to retain her maiden name or change it after marriage in the passport. She has to submit relevant proof in case of a change in name. Many women choose to retain their maiden name even after marriage and their passports reflect the same.\n\nFor a married woman/man, it is mandatory to fill in the name of the spouse in the passport application though it is not mandatory to submit the marriage certificate.\n\nThe statements made by the PM are equally applicable to a woman as well as a man as per the new passport rules. Most media houses misinterpreted the PM\u2019s second statement and reported as if he was referring to the woman\u2019s maiden name in the passport. They went to the extent of saying that this is something new and has not existed before. The media not only misinterpreted but also misreported the PM\u2019s speech.", "lang": "en"}
