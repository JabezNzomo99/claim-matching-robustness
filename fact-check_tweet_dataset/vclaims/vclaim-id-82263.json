For instance, the population of the United States is 60 percent larger in 2015 than it was in 1965, so it may not be relevant to compare raw numbers. There are definitional issues, such as what constitutes an \u201canti-poverty\u201d or \u201cwelfare\u201d program. Is it all means-tested programs, including health insurance such as Medicaid that also assists people above the poverty line? Or should it be limited to traditional anti-poverty programs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)?\n\nUnder that rubric, the \u201cfederal government is spending almost $1 trillion a year on welfare programs that provide cash, food, housing, medical treatment, social services, training, and education to poor and low-income Americans,\u201d providing benefits and cash to almost 100 million recipients, Watts said. \u201cDr. Carson recognizes the need and value of public assistance. Our point is the way government has addressed it, by virtually throwing money to programs, that have mostly proved ineffective or inadequate at reducing poverty.\u201d\n\nThe poverty rate in 1965 was 17.3 percent, when the \u201cwar on poverty\u201d announced by President Lyndon Johnson began to be implemented; Watts noted that in 2010 it was 15 percent. (It was 14.5 percent in 2013, the first drop since 2006.) Watts also provided two other figures, though without providing a source: In 1965, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) \u201chad roughly 400,000 cases (recipients),\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2015, TANF (the successor to AFDC) had 3.1 million recipients. That alone is 8 times.\u201d\n\nDefinitions are important for this number, which is made up primarily of people on Medicaid (64.9 million people in 2014) and food stamps (46.5 million in 2014). But Medicaid is increasingly aimed at the elderly (people in nursing homes) or the disabled. \u201cMedicaid spending per participant is much higher for people who are elderly, disabled, or pregnant than it is for nondisabled children or for working-age adults who are not disabled or pregnant,\u201d the Congressional Budget Office said in a report. The Medicaid rolls have also expanded because the Affordable Care Act extended it to some people with income above the Federal Poverty Level.\n\nThe 100 million figure is a bit misleading, though, because it includes anyone who resides in a household in which at least one person (such as someone who is disabled) receives a means-tested payment. As of the fourth quarter of 2012, the Census Bureau says, the number stood at 109 million, but the Medicaid figure is listed as nearly 82 million, far higher than the number of people who actually receive Medicaid. Indeed, other census data indicates that 82 percent of the households that receive means-tested benefits included at least one person who was working.\n\nIn saying that the poverty rate has barely changed, the Carson campaign is referring to the official poverty rate. It is worth noting that even by the official metric, the rate has declined slightly since 1965. But increasingly scholars believe the official figure is not especially informative because noncash benefits such as Medicaid, food stamps or public housing are not recorded as income, meaning it does not capture the effect of anti-poverty programs that Carson suggests are ineffective.\n\nCarson\u2019s $19 trillion figure is within the range of estimates by right-leaning organizations that have placed spending for anti-poverty programs at $15 trillion to $20 trillion in the past 50 years. These figures, which are in inflation-adjusted dollars, include spending on about 80 means-tested programs by the federal government, plus state and local governments. The estimates include items such as nearly $100 billion for education programs, with about half devoted to Pell Grants for college, as well as the refundable portion of the Earned Income Tax Credit \u2014 which one can receive receive if you hold a job. So some might find it debatable that all of these programs constitute \u201cwelfare.\u201d\n\nThe core welfare program remains what is now called TANF. That was created in the welfare overhaul signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996, replacing what was known as AFDC \u2014 which dated to the New Deal legislation in the mid-1930s. AFDC was intended to provided financial aid to children whose families had low or no income, but concerns grew that some recipients had become too dependent on it, so the new law placed time limits on benefits.\n\nThe other problem is that many of the programs were just getting started in the mid-1960s, so it does not really reflect a true base. A 2013 Congressional Budget Office report traced the growth of means-tested programs from 1972. The CBO\u2019s numbers show that Medicaid participation increased from 16.5 million in 1972 to 53.2 million in 2011 and food stamps grew from 11 million people in 1972 to 44.7 million in 2011. Meanwhile, housing assistance participation grew from 2.1 million people to 3.7 million, while SSI benefits (established in 1972) went from 3.9 million in 1975 to 7.8 million in 2011.", "lang": "en"}
