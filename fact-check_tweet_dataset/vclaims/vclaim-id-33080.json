The man, who is wearing what appears to be a South Sudanese military uniform, boasts that he is able to protect the country\u2019s President Salva Kiir thanks to this mysterious power. What\u2019s behind the trick? AFP filmed a demonstration with a forensic ballistics expert to show that the man was firing blanks rather than live ammunition. Another firearms expert called the man\u2019s behaviour \u201cincredibly dangerous\u201d, warning that children could be seriously hurt trying to copy him.\n\nOne Facebook post sharing the video, which we\u2019ve archived here, has been viewed more than 190,000 times since it was published on July 23 and shared more than 3,000 times.\n\nThe man appears to shoot himself in the mouth with three different guns, releasing smoke and a loud bang. He is then heard gloating about how he can protect South Sudan\u2019s President Salva Kiir.\n\n\u201cWe can protect Kiir anywhere, man,\u201d he says.\n\nAnother Facebook post, sharing a shorter version of the video, says in the caption that it shows the soldier \u201cshow[ing] off his spiritual powers\u201d. \u201cNote how spits out cartridges as though they were peanuts,\u201d says the caption on the video. \u201cI strongly believe he is from the original bloodline of the ancient Egyptians.\u201d\n\nA third version of the video was uploaded alongside the caption: \"It's only in South Sudan where a Soldier can use his mouth to stop a bullet from a close range. We are Brave\".\n\nHow we know the man was not using live ammunition\n\nWe paid a visit to the shooting range of the National Gun Owners Association of Kenya in Kirigiti, Kiambu County, for a demonstration from NGOA chairman Antony Wahome, a forensic ballistics expert.\n\nHe explained to AFP how the man in uniform managed to release only smoke while firing the gun into his mouth.\n\n\u201cWhat basically he did was to separate the cartridge to get an empty case then used the empty shell to pull the trigger. When you shoot the gun with this empty shell, you will only hear a sound and see some smoke but there is nothing,\u201d Wahome explained.\n\nDuring the demonstration, we noted the difference in sound between a gun loaded with live bullets and one loaded with an empty cartridge shell. A loud bang is heard from a gun firing a live bullet, while that from an empty shell is quieter. Hear the difference yourself in this video:\n\nA round of ammunition has four components:\n\n1. The case or shell - the container that holds all the other ammunition components together.\n\n2. The primer - an explosive chemical compound that ignites the gunpowder when struck by a firing pin.\n\n3. Gunpowder - A chemical mixture that burns rapidly and converts to an expanding gas when ignited.\n\n4. Projectile - The object expelled from the barrel. A bullet is a projectile, often containing lead.\n\nThe man in the video is firing a gun using only the first of the four elements, which is why he remains unhurt.\n\nWhat the man is doing is still dangerous\n\nArthur Alphin, a US ballistics expert and retired army officer, said that live ammunition produces a recoil effect -- a backwards motion -- when the trigger is pulled. This does not happen in the video, another sign that the man was firing blanks.\n\n\u201cThey are NOT using live ammunition. There is zero effective muzzle blast, there is zero recoil, and there is zero function of the firearms,\u201d he told AFP via email.\n\nHe expressed disgust at the video, saying it could cause harm to children seeing it on social media.\n\n\u201cThe guys in this video are incredibly dangerous. They should be removed from office, stripped of their rank. What if some child saw this and tried it with live ammunition?\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the man in the video appears unhurt, blank bullets can be dangerous.\n\nAs reported by NewYork Times in 1984, the actor Jon-Erik Hexum of the US TV series \"Cover-Up\" died after inadvertently shooting himself in the head with a pistol that fired blanks.\n\nWho is the man in the video?\n\nWe\u2019re still trying to confirm exactly when and where the footage was filmed. The man is wearing what appears to be a uniform of the Sudan People\u00b4s Liberation Army (SPLA), the army of South Sudan. On his chest you can see the SPLA emblem -- featuring the black, red and green of the country\u2019s flag -- and on his shoulder, the army\u2019s green and yellow insignia. Here\u2019s a screenshot alongside a picture of Kiir in army uniform, for comparison.\n\nAn AFP reporter in South Sudan identified the uniform as that of the Tiger Battalion, the security force guarding the president.\n\nWe\u2019re still trying to identify the man -- if you know who he is, you can get in touch here.", "lang": "en"}
