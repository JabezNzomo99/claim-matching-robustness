Ilhan Omar demand that the Capitol tree be topped by a Qo'Nos crescent moon? No, that's not true: The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to mislead Trump supporters and Republicans into sharing made up stories that are clearly marked as satire when you actually click them. Articles from the site are frequently copied by foreign-run fake news websites and that is exactly what happened with this one. The people liking and sharing these stories are enriching foreign website operators or a liberal from Maine via the ad revenue generated with the content which is probably not what they expected or wanted.\n\nThe claim originated from an article published by BustaTroll.com on December 9, 2019, titled \"Omar Demands Capitol Tree Be Topped By Qo'Nos Crescent Moon\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe Christmas tree on Capitol Hill is a longstanding tradition in Washington. It has been placed in the same spot for decades and has been adorned in the same way year after year. A key feature of this has been its topper - a bright and shining gold star, seen for miles around and symbolic of the Star of Bethlehem. It is a key element of the Christmas Story and it's one that Democrats, led by Ilhan Omar, want to do away with. Omar has issued yet another demand, this time affecting our cherished tradition on The Hill. \"In the interest of equal representation,\" she says, she wants to see that beautiful star removed and replaced with a celestial symbol more indicative of another culture. She and a pack of other leftists in government want the new crown to be the Crescent Moon of Qo'Nos, an ancient religious scholar of renown.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe fake story - which uses Qo'Nos, which refers to the star Kronos in the Klingon language of Star Trek - goes on to make up a quote attributed to Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota and favorite target of conservatives:\n\nBustaTroll.com is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run by self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry extremely visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nHere is a video of Blair explaining how his process works:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes bustatroll.org as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
