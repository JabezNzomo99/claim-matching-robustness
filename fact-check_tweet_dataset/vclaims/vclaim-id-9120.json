Its 2017 GDP was $2.747 trillion, surpassing the United Kingdom\u2019s $2.625 trillion GDP.\n\nState Senate leader Kevin de Le\u00f3n spotlighted California\u2019s economic and social achievements during his speech this week at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Democrat from Los Angeles touted the state\u2019s newly established $15 per hour minimum wage, efforts to keep college affordable and California\u2019s hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs.\n\n\"We\u2019ve made unprecedented progress in every area,\" De Le\u00f3n told a cheering crowd. \"And when we elect Hillary Clinton as our next president, I know that our progress will be America\u2019s progress.\"\n\nThe state senator then repeated a talking point California leaders love to make on national and international stages, about the size of the state\u2019s economy:\n\n\"These are the progressive policies that have made California the sixth largest economy on planet Earth,\" De Le\u00f3n said.\n\nWe won\u2019t wade into the debate over whether progressive or other policies have positioned the state\u2019s economy on such a high perch.\n\nBut we will examine the provocative \"sixth largest economy on planet Earth\" claim by itself.\n\nState Senate leader Kevin de Le\u00f3n makes the \"sixth largest economy\" claim at the 1:45 minute mark in this video.\n\nState leaders have made this hypothetical comparison for years, examining California\u2019s gross domestic product against nations across the globe.\n\nWith nearly 40 million people, the state has a larger population than many countries. It also boasts a diverse set of industries from technology to tourism and entertainment.\n\nIn June, Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s administration released figures showing California, with a GDP of more than $2.4 trillion in 2015 had jumped two spots in these unique world rankings ahead of France and Brazil and into sixth place behind the United Kingdom.\n\nFirst on the list is the United States, followed by China, Japan and Germany.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s place on the list has fluctuated over time. It had been 10th as recently as 2012 due to the effects of the financial and housing slumps.\n\nThe rankings use International Monetary Fund data. California is the only state on the list of nations.\n\nExperts have said California\u2019s rise in the rankings reflects its strong economic growth compared with the rest of the world. They have cited Silicon Valley\u2019s continued tech boom as a critical factor.\n\n\"It speaks to California doing relatively well in a sluggish global economy,\" Jeff Michael, director of the University of the Pacific\u2019s Center for Business and Policy Research, told the Sacramento Bee in June.\n\nDe Le\u00f3n\u2019s statement, made in a short 4-minute speech, did not include much context.\n\nWhen adjusting for the state\u2019s high cost of living, California\u2019s GDP ranking drops to 11th in the world, according to the California Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office.\n\nA tweet on June 14, 2016 from the California's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office.\n\nCarson Bruno, who studies California policy at the conservative Hoover Institution, says there\u2019s a lot missing from the \"sixth largest economy claim.\"\n\nIn California, \"housing costs more; electricity and gas cost more; and even most goods and services cost more than the national average,\" he wrote in a post on RealClearMarkets.com. \"In many respects California's cost of living is much more like a Western European nation than it is like the rest of the U.S. The widely reported global rankings ignore this reality.\"\n\nDe Le\u00f3n\u2019s spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nState Senate leader Kevin de Le\u00f3n recently claimed at the Democratic National Convention that California has \"the sixth largest economy on planet Earth.\"\n\nThis hypothetical comparison rests on California\u2019s $2.4 trillion GDP, which moved slightly above that of France and Brazil in 2015 to sixth in the world.\n\nThe ranking, and De Le\u00f3n\u2019s statement, however, ignore California\u2019s sky high cost of living and Silicon Valley\u2019s role in the state\u2019s economic growth. The state\u2019s GDP drops several places when adjusted for cost of living.\n\nDe Le\u00f3n\u2019s statement, while accurate, could have used this additional information or clarification.\n\nWe rate his claim Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
