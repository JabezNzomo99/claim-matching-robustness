Apronax is an anti-inflammatory drug.\n\nThe Facebook post, which has been shared around the world, including by users in Australia, has attracted 77, 000 views and more than 620 shares.\n\nClaim 1: COVID-19 is nothing but \u201cdiffuse intravascular coagulation (thrombosis)\u201d.\n\nThis claim is false. The Australian Government\u2019s Department of Health describes COVID-19 as \u201ca respiratory illness caused by a new virus\u201c. The World Health Organization lists COVID-19 as an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Coronaviruses, the WHO says, are a large family of viruses, several of which cause \u201crespiratory infections\u201d. The virus responsible for COVID-19 is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\nThere have been several studies which found severe COVID-19 cases associated with thrombosis, which is blood clotting inside blood vessels. A study in Ireland found abnormal blood clotting in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. An Italian study observed \u201cthromboembolic events\u201d in 28 out of 388 patients with COVID-19 in intensive care in Milan.\n\nProfessor Huyen Tran, a director of the Clinical Thrombosis Centre with the Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, told AAP FactCheck in an email that severe COVID-19 infection \u201cappears to be associated with an increased rate of venous thrombosis\u201d.\n\nProf Tran said there have also been \u201csporadic case reports of arterial thrombosis\u201d.\n\nClaim 2: The Facebook post says Italian doctors who performed autopsies discovered that COVID-19 \u201cis not a virus\u201d but a bacteria that causes death and the formation of blood clots.\n\nThe claim COVID-19 is \u201cnot a virus\u201d is false. The World Health Organization states that it is a \u201cnew virus\u201d that was unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Italy\u2019s Health Ministry (Ministero della Salute), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Johns Hopkins Medicine in the US all list COVID-19 as a newly identified coronavirus.\n\nThe claim is contradicted by a preliminary study by Italian pathologists who performed autopsies on 38 victims of COVID-19 in northern Italy. One of the pathologists, Dr Aurelio Sonzogni of Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, told fact checkers PolitiFact the study did not change the fact that COVID-19 is a virus that can\u2019t be treated with antibiotics. PolitiFact noted the study had not been peer reviewed for publication in a medical journal.\n\nClaim 3: The post says the way to treat COVID-19 is \u201cantibiotics, anti-inflammatory, and anticoagulants; such as: aspirin\u201d. It claims the Italian Ministry of Health changed its COVID-19 treatment protocols and started giving \u201cAspirin 100mg and Apronax\u201d to their positive patients.\u201d\n\nItaly\u2019s health ministry website says in a Q & A on treatment for COVID-19 that \u201cthere is no specific treatment for the disease caused by the new coronavirus\u201d.\n\nThe ministry\u2019s website refers to the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) for drugs available to COVID-19 patients. In an AIFA document, titled \u201cDrugs usable for the treatment of COVID-19 disease\u201d, aspirin is not listed. It is also not included on the clinical trials list.\n\nThe World Health Organization confirms that antibiotics should not be used in trying to prevent or treat COVID-19. The WHO says there is \u201cno specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus\u201d.\n\nProf Tran told AAP FactCheck there is no evidence that aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as Apronax are effective in the treatment of COVID-19.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the post to be false or unsupported by evidence. The claim that COVID-19 is \u201cthrombosis\u201d is false. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines COVID-19 as an infectious respiratory disease caused by a new coronavirus. The claim COVID-19 is \u201cnot a virus\u201d is also false. The WHO, Italy\u2019s Health Ministry, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Johns Hopkins Medicine in the US all list the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 as a newly identified coronavirus. Regarding the third claim, the World Health Organization says antibiotics should not be used to prevent and treat COVID-19 and Italian health officials say there is no specific treatment for COVID-19. Professor Huyen Tran told AAP FactCheck there was no evidence to show that aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs were effective COVID-19 treatments.
