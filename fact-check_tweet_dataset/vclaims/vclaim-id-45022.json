Like several American cities, Atlanta, too, has been witnessing a wave of protests and police action over the last few days.\n\nMany Facebook users have shared the 10-second clip along with the caption, \"Atlanta has deployed a child militia at Lenox Mall fitted with riot shields and batons\"\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral claim is misleading. The uniformed persons in riot gear seen in the video are members of Georgia National Guard and of eligible age to join the force.\n\nThe archived versions of the post can be seen here and here. The post is viral on Facebook,\n\nThe Atlanta police department has retweeted a post by Georgia National Guard calling the viral claim of using child soldiers to assist local law enforcement as \"rumors\" and \"false\". The tweet clarifies that to become a member of the Georgia National Guard, one has to be of legal age, i.e. 18 years old, or 17 with parents' consent.\n\nInternational fact-check website \"Snopes\" has also confirmed with the Atlanta police department that the men seen in the video clip were members of Georgia National guard and all of them were of eligible age.\n\nHence, the claim made in the viral post is misleading, as none of the uniformed persons in riot gear seen in the video is a child soldier.\n\nWhy has the US erupted?\n\nRacial tensions have been simmering in the US following the death of 46-year-old African-American George Floyd in Minneapolis after his arrest by a white police officer turned fatal. The incident took place on May 25.\n\nA store, suspecting Floyd of using a counterfeit note, had called the police, following which an officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. Floyd was filmed pleading and repeatedly saying \"I can't breathe\".\n\nFour police officers were fired and Chauvin charged with murder. But protests broke out across the country with demonstrators clashing with police and setting buildings and vehicles on fire in several cities.\n\nAlso Read | `Death By Racism\u2019: Part of America\u2019s DNA from the start?\n\nWATCH | Protests across US over George Floyd killing", "lang": "en"}
