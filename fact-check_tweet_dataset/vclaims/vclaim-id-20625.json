A reporter went to the market to check what P127 could buy.\n\nIn fact, the economic managers only said this is the budget that a typical minimum-income family works around with, based on their spending habits recorded by government 3 years ago.\n\nWhat NEDA said: In a statement on Wednesday, June 6, NEDA said that it only showed \"how a hypothetical monthly budget of P10,000 will be affected by a 4.6% inflation rate.\"\n\nAt the start of the briefing, Edillon said the table was based on the budget of an \"average Filipino family.\"\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say this is actually your average minimum wage worker with a monthly budget of P10,000, and this would be the breakdown of that budget based on the 2015 Family Income and Expenditure Survey,\u201d Edillon said.\n\nEdillon did not state in any part of the briefing that P10,000 was enough for a Filipino family to live a decent life.", "lang": "en"}
