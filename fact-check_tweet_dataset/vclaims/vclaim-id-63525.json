It was shared as early as May 12 and was still being circulated as of writing.\n\nThe facts: As of May 25, there is still no announcement by the government about the extension of quarantine measures after May 31.\n\nOf the places enumerated in the graphic, only Cebu City is still under ECQ. Metro Manila, Bataan, Bulacan, Laguna, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, and Zambales are already under modified ECQ (MECQ) until May 31. The rest are currently under GCQ.

It wrongly said that ECQ was extended until May 15.\n\nOn May 21, the Facebook page of Nueva Ecija TV 48 denied issuing the false advisory and urged the public to be mindful of sharing untrue information.\n\n\u201cMuling ipinababatid sa publiko ng pamunuan ng Nueva Ecija TV48 na walang kinalaman ang network sa ipinapakalat na pekeng balita (Nueva Ecija TV 48 wishes to inform the public that we do not have anything to do with the false advisory),\u201d Nueva Ecija TV 48 said.\n\nOn May 23, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said that Metro Manila will \"more likely\" be placed under GCQ by June 1. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
