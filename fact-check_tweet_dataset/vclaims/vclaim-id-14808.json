Jay Inslee has claimed that the top two fastest-growing jobs in the United States are in clean energy: solar photovoltaic installers and wind turbine technicians. That\u2019s not the case \u2014 at least not yet.\n\nThe governor is referring to Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 projections that these two occupations will be the fastest-growing by 2026. But there isn\u2019t any evidence yet that they are currently the fastest-growing occupations.\n\nAlso, the two occupations combined employed an estimated 14,500 people, as of May 2018. Even if its projections turn out to be accurate, BLS notes that \u201cthe number of new jobs is projected to be relatively small.\u201d\n\nIt is also worth mentioning, although the governor doesn\u2019t, that four oil and natural gas occupations are on the bureau\u2019s list of \u201cfastest growing occupations,\u201d and collectively those occupations would add more jobs to the economy than solar installers and wind turbine technicians.\n\nInslee, a Democratic presidential candidate who is making climate change his No. 1 campaign priority, spoke about green jobs at a town hall televised by CNN on April 10, when moderator Wolf Blitzer followed up on a question that an audience member had asked regarding the economic impact of clean energy on \u201cAmericans who live in coal-, gas- and oil-dependent economies.\u201d\n\nBlitzer, April 10: So what happens to the approximately 1.2 million Americans right now, still working fossil fuel extraction and power generation? Inslee: \u2026 Look, one of the things we talk about in this is that we need a just transition. This is going to be a huge transition. We are a fossil fuel-based economy largely right now, and we know we\u2019re going to have to go to clean energy sources by the midcentury. This is just a scientific fact. But while we do this, we have to make sure that people during that transition have opportunities along with everyone else. So we need to do the kind of things we\u2019ve done in Centralia, Washington, where we are closing our last coal-fired plant, to have about a $55 million fund to help those employees in training and transition assistance, to help businesses where we can make sure that local economy continues to thrive, and give a transition period of several years so that there\u2019s not, you know, trauma for these families. \u2026 And we know that there are going to be jobs aplenty. It\u2019s interesting, there are 3 million people \u2014 you mentioned a million in fossil fuels \u2014 there are 3 million people tonight working in clean energy in the United States. It\u2019s growing twice as fast as the rest of the U.S. economy. The most rapidly growing job in America is solar installer, and second is wind turbine technician.\n\nA day later, Inslee wrote an opinion piece published by CNN and repeated the claim about the top two \u201cmost rapidly growing\u201d jobs.\n\nIn both instances, Inslee spoke about the growth in jobs for solar installers and wind turbine technicians in the present tense. But the links in Inslee\u2019s op-ed, which we included in his quote, provide no evidence that these jobs are currently the fastest growing.\n\nInstead, both articles refer to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 most recent biennial employment projections released in October 2017 that provide projections for job growth in 2026, compared with employment levels in 2016.\n\nBLS projects that there will be a 105 percent increase in solar photovoltaic installers and a 96 percent increase in wind turbine technicians from 2016 to 2026. The third fastest-growing occupation is home health aide, which also appears on the bureau\u2019s list of occupations with the \u201cmost new jobs\u201d at the end of the 2016-2026 period.\n\nBy 2026, BLS projects there will be 11,800 additional solar installers and 5,600 new wind turbine service technicians. For context, the third fastest-growing occupation \u2014 home health aides \u2014 will add 431,200 jobs.\n\nThe bureau\u2019s list of the top 30 \u201cfastest growing occupations\u201d also includes four oil industry occupations: Roustabouts, oil and gas; service unit operators, oil, gas, and mining; rotary drill operators, oil and gas; derrick operators, oil and gas. Collectively, those four occupations are projected to add 28,900 jobs, while the two clean energy occupations cited by Inslee would add 17,400.\n\nBLS does not provide annual projections for the green jobs cited by the governor. It does, however, annually estimate the number of solar installers and wind turbine technicians using the Occupational Employment Statistics survey.\n\nAs of May 2018, there were an estimated 8,950 solar installers and 5,580 wind turbine service technicians. But BLS spokesman Gary Steinberg told us those figures actually represent a moving three-year average, so they should not be compared with previous years. He referred us to an FAQ that said, \u201cThe OES methodology that allows such detailed area and industry estimates also makes it difficult to use OES data for comparisons across short time periods.\u201d\n\nThat means there is no official employment data that would support Inslee\u2019s claim that \u201c[t]he most rapidly growing job in America is solar installer, and second is wind turbine technician.\u201d\n\nJared Leopold, Inslee\u2019s campaign spokesman, told us that the governor was using shorthand to describe future job growth and didn\u2019t intend to suggest the jobs are currently the fastest growing. He cited other publications that referred to \u201cfastest-growing jobs,\u201d such as CNBC\u2019s report on the BLS projections.\n\nHowever, that CNBC report also provided the context when listing the \u201cfastest-growing jobs,\u201d such as noting that \u201cthese jobs are projected to grow quickly\u201d between 2016 and 2026.", "lang": "en"}
