Raju Upman who claimed to a Congress worker tweeted this video along with the caption, \u201c\u092c\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0915\u093e \u092a\u0939\u0928\u0915\u0930 \u092a\u093e\u0915\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u093e \u091d\u0902\u0921\u093e \u0932\u0939\u0930\u093e \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0925\u093e \u092f\u0939 \u0906\u0930 . \u090f\u0938 .\u090f\u0938 . \u0915\u093e \u092d***.\u201d The video was viewed over 1 lakh times and received 4,000 retweets before the account was taken down. (archive)\n\nThe video is also being shared on Facebook with the same claim. Some users are also claiming that the person is a BJP leader.\n\nDr Fareekappa Kaginelli, who is currently serving as an SP in Andhra Pradesh\u2019s Kurnool district, replied to Upman\u2019s tweet that the claim is incorrect. Dr Kaginelli clarified that the burqa-clad person was caught by the police for illegally carrying alcohol from Telangana to Kurnool. The incident took place on August 7.\n\nHe also shared a video clip of ETV Andhra Pradesh broadcast on August 7, which gives more information about this viral video. As per the video broadcast, AP police had arrested a few people including this burqa-clad man for smuggling alcohol.\n\nWe reached out Dr Kagenelli who confirmed that the social media claim is false and that it was a matter of alcohol smuggling. To escape the police, the man dressed up as a woman while crossing the state border from Telangana to Andhra Pradesh. He was accompanied by another man who was driving the bike. They hoped that the police would not stop them at the check-post if one of them wore a burqa. However, both were arrested. A copy of the FIR has been shared with us. As per the complaint, Satish Goud (46) and Mohammad Arif (35) were arrested at Panchlingla check-post in Kurnool district.\n\nIn this manner, the video is being circulated with a false claim that a burqa-clad man affiliated with BJP or RSS was waving the Pakistani flag and was arrested by the police.", "lang": "en"}
