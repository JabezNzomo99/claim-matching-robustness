According to Cohen\u2019s lawyer, attorney-client communications were among the seized records.\n\nDescribing the raid as a break-in, Trump said it signalled the end to legal rules designed to protect communications between a client and an attorney.\n\nBecause Trump\u2019s reaction seemed more an expression of opinion rather than a statement of fact, we decided to look more closely at the law around attorney-client communications, rather than issue a Truth-O-Meter rating.\n\nAttorney-client privilege is a set of rules that apply to communications between a client and their lawyer, said Mark Osler, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas and former assistant U.S. attorney.\n\n\"The purpose of these rules is largely to protect the confidentiality of these communications and to ensure that a client feels free to be frank and honest while seeking legal advice,\" Osler said.\n\nThe logic underlying the rule is that the legal system benefits if clients are encouraged to communicate openly with legal counsel, said Robert Weisberg, a professor at Stanford Law School and an expert on criminal law and criminal procedure.\n\nWhile a lawyer can invoke privilege to shield communications, it is the client who technically \"owns\" it, Weisberg added.\n\nWhat is 'the crime fraud exception' to attorney-client privilege?\n\nGenerally, attorney-client privilege covers communications or documents that relate either to a lawyer providing legal advice or gathering legally relevant client information. But the law makes some exceptions.\n\nWhile discussions about a client\u2019s past crimes would typically be privileged, communications about a current or future crime involving a lawyer and client are not covered. There\u2019s a similar exception for fraud, which more typically arises in civil rather than criminal contexts; together, these are referred to as the crime fraud exception.\n\nWeisberg said the exception could be invoked at various stages: from the investigative phase, through a grand jury or at trial.\n\nLegal experts said it\u2019s too early to tell if the crime fraud exception applies to any seized communications between Trump and Cohen.\n\n\"The crime fraud exception would most likely come into play if the two were discussing how to actively and prospectively violate the law, for example, by lying on loan documents,\" Osler said.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment to the Constitution is designed to guard against unreasonable government searches and seizures. Generally, that means law enforcement is required to obtain a warrant from a court \u2014 based on a showing of probable cause \u2014 before a search may be lawfully executed.\n\nThe amendment doesn\u2019t entitle lawyers to special treatment when faced with a search or seizure. But in the interest of protecting attorney-client privilege, law enforcement has traditionally taken extra precautions in these cases.\n\nThose requirements are set out in the Justice Department\u2019s U.S. Attorney\u2019s Manual. Specifically, Section 9-13.420 lays out guidelines searching the premises of attorneys.\n\n\"The Department of Justice policy is designed to show the judge you\u2019re being very careful here,\" said Weisberg. But he added that failing to follow the rules would not necessarily make evidence inadmissible.\n\nDepartment rules call for federal prosecutors to get authorization from the U.S. attorney or assistant attorney general, and consult with the department\u2019s criminal division before seeking a warrant. They must also consider less intrusive means to getting the information before executing a raid.\n\nThe raid of Cohen's office was approved by officials in the office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and approved by a federal judge, according to ABC News.\n\nWeisberg said it's \"very unusual\" for investigators to seize an attorney's documents. Typically, subpoenas would be the main tool for obtaining this kind of information, he said. But prosecutors might depart from using their subpoena power if they believed a target of their investigation ran the risk of refusing to comply with a request, or could destroy evidence.\n\n\"Less intrusive options would include a request for the relevant material \u2014 but that might be impractical if there is reason to think that evidence would be destroyed rather than produced,\" Osler said.\n\nAn additional layer of oversight comes in the form of a special team that\u2019s assigned to sort through communications and separate those for which the privilege applies and those for which it doesn\u2019t, Osler said.", "lang": "en"}
