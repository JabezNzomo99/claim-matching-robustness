The image has been doctored; it consists of at least two separate images.\n\nThe image is contained in this tweet, which has been retweeted more than 1,000 times since it was posted on April 22, 2018.\n\nThe caption of the tweet states: \u201cMeanwhile in Australia... A Dingo eats a Shark while 2 snakes have sex...(or fight..) #Australia\u201d.\n\nDingos are wild dogs found in Australia; here is an webpage about them on the Australian Museum website.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading tweet:\n\nReplies to the tweet from some Twitter users indicated they believed it was a real photo.\n\nThe image below contains four of these replies, selected by AFP, with the posters\u2019 identity redacted:\n\nThe same image and similar claims have been shared tens of thousands of times across social media, such as here on Facebook, here on Twitter and here on Reddit.\n\nBritish comedian Ricky Gervais also shared the photo in this April 28, 2018, tweet with a caption that reads: \u201cJust when I was thinking of coming to Australia with my next tour\u2026.\u201d\n\nBut the image is not a genuine photo; it has been doctored.\n\nThe area where the grass meets the sand is a horizontal line separating two images that have been combined into one, as shown below with red and yellow rectangles:\n\nThe upper half of the misleading image, which shows a dingo and a dead shark, has been shared repeatedly online since at least 2011.\n\nFor example, it appears here on a website from the Czech Republic; in this 2013 Reddit post and here in a post dated October 16, 2011, on a website called The Meta Picture, alongside the caption: \u201cA wild dingo eating a shark. Welcome to Australia.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the image as it appears in the Meta Picture post. It remains unclear whether this is a genuine photo or if it, too, has been doctored:\n\nThe bottom half of the misleading image, which shows two snakes entwined, matches this photo posted to image-sharing site Imgur on February 9, 2012, with title: \u201cTook a rare photo of 2 Copperhead Snakes in Australia\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of that post:\n\nYouTube videos of copperhead snakes mating here and here also show two snakes entwined around each other in a similar fashion to the photo.\n\nAn information page on copperhead snakes here on the Australian Museum website says:\n\n\u201cCopperheads are restricted to relatively cool and cold environments in southeastern parts of Australia, including Kangaroo Island, Tasmania and the Bass Strait Islands.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, on its page about dingoes, the Australian Museum says:\n\n\u201cHaving been in Australia for over 4,000 years, Dingoes inhabited many parts of mainland Australia but never became established in Tasmania.\n\n\u201cAfter European colonisation and the growth of pastoralisation, there was a concerted effort to remove Dingoes from farming areas. As a result, Dingoes are mostly absent from many parts of New South Wales, Victoria, the south-eastern third of South Australia and from the southern-most tip of Western Australia.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
