The sources of those figures are either untraceable, subject to a lot of uncertainty, or no longer relevant to the way the NHS works today.\n\nWe don\u2019t know the answer to this question, whether it turns out to be \u00a310 billion or something very different.\n\nThe NHS \u2018internal market\u2019 was introduced in the early 1990s\n\nThe National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 first introduced the 'internal market'. This meant the parts of the NHS that pay for care were divided from the parts that provide it (the purchaser/provider split).\n\nBefore that \u201cproviders, usually hospital doctors, had largely determined what services would be provided\u201d.\n\nIn the 1990s, for the first time health authorities and some GPs could decide who to buy care from, creating competition between providers. This could be purchased from other NHS organisations, private companies or charities.\n\nThere have been other changes since then. The introduction of 'free choice' of provider for patients in 2008 and one of the focuses of the Health and Social Care Act in 2012 was increasing the choice of, and competition between, potential providers of healthcare.\n\nA claim long on history but short on sources\n\nClaims about the cost of the internal market tend to focus on comparing NHS admin costs before and after the early 1990s, although not everyone who makes the claim uses the same numbers.\n\nGenerally, the pattern goes like this: People claim administration costs on the NHS were about 5-6% of its budget before the 1990s, about 12% in the mid to late 1990s, 14% in the early 2000s, and speculate the proportion has grown even more since then.\n\nThe figures then get applied to the size of the NHS budget today, or recently, to calculate how much \u2018more\u2019 the NHS is paying each year. Most of those answers come in at around \u00a310 billion.\n\nNone of the sources for any of the figures are easy to find, and in some cases they\u2019re virtually impossible to pinpoint.\n\nWe went back and tried to find where these figures originally came from.\n\nEstimates around 5-6% are hard to pinpoint\n\nMr Williamson\u2019s office confirmed to us his source was a quote from Dr Jacky Davis in 2014, which we factchecked at the time. She used a figure of 6% pre-1990s and compared it to 15% as of 2013 and arrived at around \u00a310 billion as an answer.\n\nFigures of 5% and 6% pre-1990s have been widely quoted, but those instances rarely point to a primary source. According to Dr Charles Webster in 2002, who worked as the official historian of the NHS:\n\nEven if we accept this figure, we don\u2019t know what it means exactly. There are a lot of different things you could include when counting admin costs on the NHS.\n\nSome estimates include staffing costs as well as legal costs and office supplies\n\nA 1995 study by NHS campaigners also took this 6% figure, and calculated their own updated version to compare it to. They claimed that by 1993 admin costs had doubled to about 12%.\n\nThis actually has a proper source, albeit an obscure one. The Department of Health\u2019s annual statistics publication for England in 1994 showed that if you add up things like staff salary costs, legal costs and office supplies, you can arrive at a figure of 12% of the total budget spent on admin costs.\n\nBut without knowing more about the older figures, we\u2019ve no reason to trust that this is comparing like-with-like. Definitions of admin costs can vary a lot, and different studies look at different combinations of costs like the salary costs of managers, and clerical support workers, or including things like office supplies.\n\nReforms in the 1990s did have an impact, but it\u2019s difficult to put a number on it\n\nEven with the uncertainties spelled out above, it\u2019s clear that the early 1990s was no ordinary period for the NHS.\n\nIt\u2019s very obvious from the 1994 statistics that in the early 1990s, the NHS underwent a significant transformation. The number of managers, administrative and clerical staff surged between 1988 and 1992, as did the amount spent on managers\u2019 salaries and executives\u2019 remuneration.\n\nThese increases were thought to be \u201cdriven by the need to negotiate and monitor contracts between purchasers and providers\u201d.\n\nSo it\u2019s almost certain that the internal market, as one of the biggest reforms to the structure of the NHS at the time, had a role in the changes in staff and so changes in costs associated with that. The trouble is saying how much exactly, and accounting for the savings this new structure could have brought about elsewhere.\n\nEstimates for the mid-2000s focused on admin staffing costs\n\nThe figure of 14% in the 2000s comes from a study, commissioned by the Department of Health at the time, which is unpublished. The authors told us that this was in part because it was a short-term project and was never peer-reviewed, but they provided us with a copy.\n\nIt did indeed estimate the costs were 13.5% of the health budget, based on estimating the salaries of managers and administrators in the NHS. But it also cautioned that these findings were uncertain, saying: \u201cOur preliminary estimate should be regarded as no more than an initial guide and should only be used as such.\u201d\n\nThe same study also warned against considering management costs in isolation. These can also contribute towards the performance and efficiency of the health care system, according to the researchers.\n\nEven without these extensive cautions, we know that the 13.5% isn\u2019t comparable to some of the earlier figures that have been quoted, because this is just a measure of salary costs rather than going into other aspects of the administration budget. We also know the study never intended to measure the specific effect of the \u2018internal market\u2019.\n\nThese aren\u2019t estimates of the cost of the internal market\n\nWhether or not these figures are robust or comparable is academic here\u2014none of them can tell us what the internal market has cost the NHS.\n\nA lot has changed about the NHS since the 1990s. The use of information technology has transformed, there\u2019s more regulation, more targets for waiting times and more specialisation in the roles of clinicians and managers. These will all have increased admin costs, and a lot of it would have happened with or without the 1990s reforms introducing the internal market. Some researchers have tried to take some of these costs into account, reducing the overall cost estimate.\n\nThere\u2019s also nothing in these figures that considers possible financial benefits of an internal market that offset the costs, such as resources being used more efficiently\u2014this has also been the subject of debate.\n\nTo find out the role of the internal market in all of this, we\u2019d need to estimate what the NHS would be spending today if the reforms had never happened, and compare this to what\u2019s actually being spent. This would still give very uncertain results, but would be the only way to answer the question. We\u2019ve seen no evidence that such a study has been undertaken.\n\nIf you know of useful research in this area we should take a look at, please get in touch.", "lang": "en"}
