Also, the incident unfolded nearly three decades ago, not while he was vice president.\n\nRegardless of how old it is, the issue was recently trotted out like it was new information by the misnamed bipartisanreport.com \u2014 a website that posts stories with a liberal slant. We\u2019ve written about its misleading stories before.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission in 1990 about Pence and three other Republican candidates using campaign contributions for personal use, the commission could not agree on whether those candidates violated existing campaign finance laws.\n\nThe six FEC commissioners \u2014 three Democrats and three Republicans \u2014 split along party lines when they voted on whether to adopt the recommendation of the commission\u2019s general counsel (see page 67). The general counsel had recommended finding that the candidates had not violated the law (see page 56) because it allowed for \u201cwide discretion\u201d in how campaigns chose to spend money. The general counsel\u2019s office cited earlier FEC opinions that allowed for campaigns to pay for candidates\u2019 living expenses.\n\nIn Pence\u2019s case, he used campaign funds to pay his mortgage of nearly $1,000 per month, make payments on his wife\u2019s car, pay golfing greens fees, and pay for parking tickets, according to the general counsel\u2019s finding.\n\nPence did not dispute that he had used campaign funds for personal expenses. He said at the time, \u201cI\u2019m not embarrassed that I need to make a living.\u201d\n\nWhile the commissioners deadlocked on the outcome of that particular case, they did unanimously agree to consider amending the rules for candidates\u2019 personal use of campaign funds. The FEC adopted new rules in 1995.\n\nThe controversy had been revisited during the 2016 presidential election when the Washington Post published a story about Pence\u2019s early political spending.\n\nThe bipartisanreport.com story accurately cites the Post article, but its headline is misleading.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\nHouse-Dunphy, Carissa. \u201cVP Mike Pence Busted Stealing Campaign Funds To Pay His Mortgage Like A Thief.\u201d Bipartisanreport.com. 3 Sep 2018.\n\nHelderman, Rosalind, et al. \u201cMike Pence used campaign funds to pay his mortgage \u2014 and it cost him an election.\u201d The Washington Post. 15 Jul 2016.", "lang": "en"}
