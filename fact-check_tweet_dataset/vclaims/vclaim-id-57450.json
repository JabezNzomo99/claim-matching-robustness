The number was contained in a report issued by Imperial College London on March 16.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the lead author of the report, epidemiology professor Neil Ferguson, told the New York Times that the British researchers had shared their projections with a White House task force a week before and had sent an early copy of the report to the White House.\n\nBirx herself referenced the British report at a coronavirus task force press briefing on March 16, when the Trump administration announced that it would issue more restrictive social distancing guidelines. Birx said the White House task force \u2014 working with groups in the U.K. and drawing on \u201cnew information coming out from a model\u201d \u2014 recommended limiting gatherings to fewer than 10 people. The Trump administration\u2019s recommendations were consistent with the British report made public that same day.\n\nAnd the British report was not the first indication that the coronavirus death toll could be quite high if the disease were left unchecked. On March 13, the New York Times reported that officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and epidemic experts from around the world had gathered on a conference call the previous month to explore worst-case scenarios for the coronavirus\u2019 toll. The CDC modeled four scenarios and estimated that 200,000 to 1.7 million U.S. residents could die, the Times reported. Yet, Trump portrayed the potential death toll as new information on March 29, when he announced that he was extending the federal social distancing guidelines until April 30. Previously he had expressed an interest in relaxing them sooner as way to revive the struggling U.S. economy, saying on March 24 that he would \u201clove to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter,\u201d April 12. At the White House briefing at which he announced the extension, Trump also cited the 2.2 million potential casualty figure \u2014 an estimate he said he had been seeking for \u201ca long time.\u201d Trump, March 29: I just want to reiterate, because a lot of people have been asking, \u201cWell, what would have happened if we did nothing? Did nothing \u2014 we just rode it out.\u201d And I\u2019ve been asking that question to Tony and Deborah, and they\u2019ve been talking to me about it for a long time. Other people have been asking that question. And I think we got our most accurate study today, or certainly most comprehensive. Think of the number: 2.2 \u2014 potentially 2.2 million people if we did nothing. If we didn\u2019t do the distancing, if we didn\u2019t do all of the things that we\u2019re doing. With social distancing remaining in place, Trump said he hoped to severely limit the number of deaths. \u201cIf we can hold that down, as we\u2019re saying, to 100,000 \u2014 that\u2019s a horrible number \u2014 maybe even less, but to 100,000; so we have between 100- and 200,000 \u2014 we all, together, have done a very good job,\u201d he said. In an appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on March 29, Fauci said that even with mitigation efforts that have been put into effect, 100,000 to 200,000 Americans could die from the disease. Trump struck a very different tone at a Fox News virtual town hall on March 24, when he was still talking about reopening the country by Easter. Trump, March 24: Well, you have to make the decision. Look, we lose thousands \u2014 I brought some numbers here. We lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu. We don\u2019t turn the country off \u2014 I mean, every year. Now, when I heard the number \u2014 you know we average 37,000 people a year. Can you believe that? And actually, this year we\u2019re having a bad flu season. But we lose thousands of people a year to the flu. We never turn the country off. We lose much more than that to automobile accidents. We didn\u2019t call up the automobile companies and say, \u201cStop making cars. We don\u2019t want any cars anymore.\u201d We have to get back to work. This was more than a week after news reports about the British report and the CDC\u2019s worst-case scenarios for coronavirus. According to CDC statistics on March 30, there have been 140,904 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, in the U.S., and 2,405 deaths. In addition to warning against social gatherings with more than 10 people, the federal guidelines urge Americans not to eat at restaurants or go to bars, to steer clear of discretionary travel, and to frequently wash their hands for 20 seconds. While the guidelines are voluntary, many state and local governments have implemented stricter limits. Until Trump extended them, the federal guidelines were set to expire March 31.", "lang": "en"}
