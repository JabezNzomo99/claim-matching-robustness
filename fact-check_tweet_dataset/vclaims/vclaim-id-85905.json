So we asked Perry spokesman Travis Considine for the evidence.\n\nHe quickly provided two documents. One was a 2008 news release from the Texas Health Department, stating the immunization rate for children under age 3 was 65 percent in 2002 and had climbed to 77.3 percent in 2007. The other was 2014 CDC news release showing the vaccination rate for kindergartners in Texas was over 97 percent.\n\nIn other words, he was selling apples and oranges. There\u2019s a huge difference between counting the rate for those under 36 months and counting the rate for children going into kindergarten. This was quickly discovered by digging into the CDC document and finding the data for Texas children between the ages of 19 and 35 months.\n\n\u201cYou are absolutely right about that,\u201d said Anna C. Dragsbaek, president of The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based nonprofit that aims to eradicate vaccine-preventable diseases. \u201cKindergarten immunization rates are not what the CDC or what public health experts look at. It\u2019s the younger kids who really need the shots.\u201d\n\nBut in 2013 (the most recent year with data), the recommended schedule is \u201c4:3:1:4:3:1:4.\u201d That translates to 4+ doses of pertussis-containing vaccine; 3+ doses of polio vaccine; 1+ dose(s) of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine; the full series of Hib vaccine (3+ or 4+ doses depending on product type received); 3+ doses of hepatitis B vaccine; 1+ dose(s) of Varicella vaccine and 4+ doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.\n\nSo, for ages 19 to 35 months, the comparison of the vaccination rate in Texas for the recommended schedule in each year is:\n\nEven if you just compared the same \u201c4:3:1:3:3\u201d series in each year, the Texas vaccination rate would just be 76.4 percent in 2013. In other words, no matter how you slice it, the rate has actually declined since 2007.\n\nYet, ironically, Dragsbaek said that Perry had an excellent record on promoting vaccination. In 2003 he signed a bill that made it easier for parents to cite philosophical objections to giving children vaccines, but even so, \u201cmy experience has been that Governor Perry was a fairly strong pro-vaccine governor,\u201d she said.\n\nPerry apparently had little reason to inflate his record on vaccinations, but he did so anyway. The vaccination rate went up about 14 percent, not 50 percent, and it stalled in the last half of his tenure of governor. This doesn\u2019t quite rise to Four Pinocchios, but it\u2019s close.", "lang": "en"}
