The image has been doctored from an original campaign poster which said Aquino was the author of a bill reducing the price of fuel.\n\nThe post shares what appears to be a campaign poster from Aquino, who is currently seeking a second term as senator, in which he takes credit for the cleanup of Manila Bay.\n\nIn January 2019, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the cleanup of the bay, which has suffered from pollution and poor water quality.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s status, when translated to English, says: Scrap food boy is at it again. You take credit for everything, it\u2019s creepy what you're doing. In 2030, the name of the country may not be the Philippines anymore my fellow DDS. But Paolo Bam Aquino already. #OtsoDiretsoZero #Don'tBeStupid #NeverAgaintoLiberalParty\n\nThe text in on the purported campaign material says: SAVE MANILA BAY. Sen. Bam Aquino is fighting for this. Sen. Bam Aquino. He pushed for the Manila Bay cleanup #SupportBam\n\nAquino is referred to as \u201cScrap food boy\u201d by his critics after he filed a bill which requires food-related companies to donate excess food to food banks.\n\nHe is seeking another term as a senator and is a member of the Liberal Party, the main opposition party in the Philippines.\n\nA reverse image search of the photo in the misleading Facebook post traced it back to this Twitter post with the hashtag #bam2019.\n\nAFP searched for a copy of the photo on Aquino\u2019s official Twitter account @bamaquino and found this tweet dated October 18, 2018:\n\nThe tweet contains a series of campaign posters with the #SupportBam hashtag.\n\nHere is the original photo:\n\nThe text on the original photo says: Reduced price of fuel. Sen. Bam Aquino is fighting for this. Sen. Bam Aquino. Author of the Lower Price Bill. #Support Bam\n\nIn September 2018, Aquino filed a bill seeking the suspension of the excise tax on fuel.\n\nA search of Aquino\u2019s official website found no posts in which he had referred to the Manila Bay cleanup.\n\nHere is the screenshot for the search results:\n\nA search of his official Facebook account as well as his official Instagram account also uncovered no campaign material on the Manila Bay cleanup.\n\nThe original campaign poster on lowering fuel prices is also available on his official Facebook account:\n\nA spokesperson from Aquino's office told AFP that they had not produced or issued the campaign material in which Aquino supposedly claimed credit for the Manila Bay cleanup.\n\n\u201cNo. It was an edited version of one of our official posters that we released last October 2018. Here is the link of our original poster for your reference. As you can see, they've used the same layout and photo, but changed the text, \u201d Nicco Atos, Aquino's media relations officer told AFP in a February 1, 2019 email.\n\nThe misleading Facebook post has been shared more than 2,000 times by Facebook groups and pages with over two million followers according to data from social media monitoring tool Crowdtangle.", "lang": "en"}
