The raising of the middle finger is widely considered an obscene hand gesture.\n\nIn another manipulated (right), Revilla is seen holding a marker supposedly stolen from the precinct.\n\nSince its posting, the photo with the middle finger has garnered over 5,600 likes and over 12,000 shares, while the photo with the marker has over 4,900 likes and 2,600 shares.\n\nBong Revilla is running for reelection in the Senate following his acquittal from plunder charges in the multibillion-peso pork barrel scam.\n\nThe views and information in \u2018Tsek.ph\u2019 are those of their respective authors and owners and do not reflect the official policy or position of the media and academic partners of Tsek.ph.", "lang": "en"}
