The claim is misleading; five of the photos show an arcus cloud formation in the neighbouring Aceh province; one of the photos shows Mount Sinabung erupting.\n\nThe six images were posted here on Facebook on August 10, 2020. The post has been shared more than 8,100 times.\n\nThe post also includes a text graphic; a statement from the Malaysian Meteorological Department; and the department\u2019s map of Peninsular Malaysia.\n\nThe post\u2019s Malay-language caption translates to English as: \u201cAllah is the greatest\u2026 No Wonder the Weather Is Weirdly Hot.\u2026 There Is An Eruption of Sumatra\u2019s Sinabung Volcano\u2026 We\u2019re At The End of Time Now\u2026 There Are Many Signs of Doomsday\u2026 Are We Aware Or Not???\u201d\n\nThe text graphic states: \u201cSmoke and ashes from the Sinabung volcano is expected to enter Malaysian airspace starting tonight.\u201d\n\nMount Sinabung erupted on August 10, 2020, emitting a massive amount of ash and smoke 5,000 metres (16,400 feet) into the air. It plunged local communities into darkness with a thick layer of debris, according to an AFP report here.\n\nThe images also appeared in other Facebook posts here, here and here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is misleading; most of the images show an arcus cloud formation in Indonesia's Aceh province.\n\nThe natural phenomenon in Aceh was reported by CNN Indonesia here.\n\nThe first photo shows a huge grey cloud of smoke in the sky. A reverse image on Google, followed by a keyword search on Google and Twitter, found the video was posted here on Twitter on August 10, 2020.\n\nThe Indonesian-language tweet translates to English as: \u201cSinabung erupted again\u201d.\n\nThe eruption of Sinabung was also reported by the Indonesian media here and here.\n\nThe second photo shows a huge cloud over a number of houses.\n\nA reverse image search followed by a subsequent keyword search on Google found the photo was taken from this clip. It was uploaded to Twitter on August 10, 2020, by Arief Arbianto, whose bio says he lives in Aceh.\n\nTranslated to English, the caption reads: \u201cPlease pray that Meulaboh City will be alright. This morning's view of clouds over the city of Meulaboh, West Aceh.\u201d\n\nOne day later, on August 11, 2020, Indonesia\u2019s Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency (BMKG) released this statement explaining the phenomenon.\n\nTranslated to English, the Indonesian-language statement is titled: \u201cWeather Phenomenon of Clouds Shaped Like a Tsunami in the Aceh Region August 10, 2020\u201d.\n\nThe statement further says: \u201cScientifically in the field of meteorology, the cloud phenomenon is called the Arcus cloud\u2026 the feature of the Arcus cloud can be found between the Cumulonimbus and Cumulus clouds. An arcus cloud is a general occurrence although the frequency is rare, it has a low cloud base height, and their formation horizontally extends as if they were waves.\u201d\n\nThe statement goes on to say: \u201cThe existence of this cloud is purely a cloud formation phenomenon that occurs due to dynamic conditions of the atmosphere and has nothing to do with the potential for earthquakes or tsunamis or mystical things.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the second photo in the misleading post (L) and the Twitter video (R):\n\nThe third photo shows a huge cloud over a road and a dirt field.\n\nA reverse image search followed by a subsequent keyword search on Google found that the photo was taken from this clip, which was posted on the Twitter account of Jakarta-based Radio Elshinta on August 10, 2020.\n\nThe Indonesian-language tweet, translated to English, partly reads: \u201cThe natural black cloud phenomenon around West Aceh and Nagan Raya has gone viral on Social Media. It is believed the cloud which looks like sea waves occurred this morning (August 10).\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the third photo in the misleading post (L) and the Twitter video (R):\n\nThe fourth photo shows a huge cloud over the sea.\n\nA reverse image search followed by a subsequent keyword search on Google found that the photo was taken from this footage, which was posted on August 10, 2020, by another Aceh-based Twitter user.\n\nIts Indonesian-language caption translates to English as: \u201cCumulonimbus cloud over the waters of southwestern Aceh hopefully things that we don\u2019t want won't happen\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the fourth photo in the misleading post (L) and the Twitter video (R):\n\nThe fifth photo shows a huge cloud over a mosque while the sixth photo depicts a cloud in the background overlooking a road.\n\nA reverse image search followed by a keyword search on Google found the two photos originated from this footage, which was posted on August 10, 2020, by a Twitter user based in Aceh.\n\nThe Indonesian-language caption partly says: \u201cTaken at 9:35 am Indonesian Western Time, West Aceh regency, Meulaboh\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the fifth and sixth photos in the misleading post (L) and the Twitter video (R):\n\nThe mosque seen in the footage is the Great Mosque Baitul Makmur Meulaboh.\n\nThe Arcus cloud formation in Aceh on August 10, 2020, was also reported by different Indonesian news outlets, including Kompas.com and CNN Indonesia.", "lang": "en"}
