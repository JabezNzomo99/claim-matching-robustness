This is false; McDonald's and a representative from the Canadian beef industry say the fast food chain is still using beef from the country.\n\n\u201cMcDonald's has announced they will be buying all of their meat in the US,\u201d the April 30, 2020 post claims, adding that \u201cit is time to stop going to McDonald's if they are willing to take our Canadian money but refuse to support our beef industry.\u201d\n\nAlthough McDonald\u2019s has had to reduce the amount of beef sourced in Canada during the novel coronavirus pandemic, the central claim made in the post is false.\n\n\u201cDue to unprecedented COVID-19 impacts on the Canadian beef supply chain, McDonald\u2019s Canada had to temporarily adjust our supply to incorporate beef from outside Canada in order to meet the current demand,\u201d a spokeswoman for McDonald\u2019s Canada told AFP via email.\n\n\u201cAs of June 29, 2020, Canadian beef accounts for 81 percent of total beef used in the production of all beef burger patties since adjusting our beef supply, on average. McDonald's is committed to supporting Canadian ranchers and farmers, and we look forward to returning to sourcing 100 percent Canadian beef as quickly as possible,\u201d she added.\n\nThis was confirmed by a representative from Canada\u2019s beef industry.\n\n\u201cWe understand the decision made by McDonald\u2019s Canada and their need to temporarily supplement Canadian beef with outside sources while our processing capacity has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic\u201d a spokeswoman for the Canadian Cattlemen\u2019s Association told AFP via email.\n\n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s Canada is still a loyal partner to Canadian farmers and ranchers and has committed to sourcing 100 percent Canadian beef as soon as the supply is available.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
