However, the meme is based on the false assumption that Time\u2018s \u201cMan of the Year\u201d designations were intended to signify greatness and approval, and were only assigned to people who have had beneficial effects on the world. That is not the case \u2014 Time\u2018s standard for the title has been identifying the person who has \u201chad the greatest impact on the news,\u201d regardless of whether that impact was positive or negative:\n\nTIME\u2019s choices for Person of the Year are often controversial. Editors are asked to choose the person or thing that had the greatest impact on the news, for good or ill \u2014 guidelines that leave them no choice but to select a newsworthy \u2014 not necessarily praiseworthy \u2014 cover subject.\n\nThe magazine has nominated several controversial figures as \u201cMan of the Year\u201d since the tradition began in 1927, including Joseph Stalin, Nikita Khruschchev, and the Ayatollah Khomeini. Osama bin Laden was strongly considered in 2001, but the the title went to New York mayor Rudy Giuliani instead.\n\nIn Time\u2018s 1938 \u201cMan of the Year\u201d article, Hitler was labeled the \u201cgreatest threatening force that the democratic, freedom-loving world faces today.\u201d That was as much an endorsement of Hitler\u2019s actions in 1938 as it would be today \u2014 in other words, not at all.", "lang": "en"}
