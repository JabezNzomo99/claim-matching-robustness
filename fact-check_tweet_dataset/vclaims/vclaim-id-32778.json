MPs are entitled to food expenses of up to \u00a325 per night, but only if they are staying overnight outside of both their constituency and the London area as part of their parliamentary activities. This can be for food bought during the day, and cannot include alcohol.\n\nOn breakfast specifically, guidance for MPs on expenses states that \u201cIf the hotel\u2019s nightly rate includes breakfast, the full amount will be reimbursed\u201d provided that the overnight cost of the hotel is \u201cup to a limit of \u00a3175 per night in the London Area and \u00a3150 elsewhere in the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve written before, food and drink, including breakfast, is also available to purchase within the House of Commons. While this is not directly subsidised, catering services across the House of Commons do run at a loss, meaning that public money is effectively spent subsidising the overall catering operation. This catering is not exclusively for MPs\u2014there are about 14,500 other staff members and pass-holders and an unknown number of visitors who can use the House of Commons catering facilities.", "lang": "en"}
