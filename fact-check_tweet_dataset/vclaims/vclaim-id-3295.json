Tim Scott was on \u201cThis Week\u201d and answered a question about whether Trump unfairly singles out minorities for criticism. He said: \u201cHe attacks anyone he perceives or believes is attacking him or the country, right or wrong.\u201d\n\nThe false story claims that Bacon had said something similar: \u201cI think he attacks anyone he perceives or believes is attacking him or the country.\u201d\n\nThe actor also supposedly said: \u201cHe should be given the Medal of Freedom for talking his mind in such a bold, honest, and straightforward manner.\u201d\n\nBut, in reality, that\u2019s almost exactly what Ted Nugent wrote in a 2015 column defending Trump against establishment Republicans shortly after Trump announced his run for the presidency. Nugent wrote: \u201cDonald Trump should be given the Medal of Freedom for speaking his mind in such a bold, honest and straight-forward manner.\u201d\n\nThen, the false story has a reworded version of something boxing champion Mike Tyson said in 2015. The story claims that Bacon said: \u201cHow about we have a go at something new. How about we run America like a business, where no colors matter. Whoever can carry out the activity, lands the position.\u201d\n\nThis is what Tyson actually said: \u201cLet\u2019s try something new. Let\u2019s run America like a business, where no colors matter. Whoever can do the job, gets the job.\u201d\n\nLastly, the made-up story claims that Bacon said: \u201cHe has no speechwriters, no editing, no nothing. You just have to like the guy,\u201d and, \u201cTrump is not a politician. He does not need your money, and he will speak his mind, God damn it, whether you like it or not.\u201d\n\nBut it was Gene Simmons, the bassist for KISS, who said almost the exact same thing to Rolling Stone in 2016. Simmons also told the magazine that he wasn\u2019t necessarily supportive of Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\n\u201cHe has no speechwriters, no editing, no nothing,\u201d Simmons said. (Trump did have speech writers during his 2016 campaign, though.)\n\nSimmons also said, \u201cTrump is not a politician. He does not need your money, and he will speak his mind, God damn it, whether you like it or not.\u201d\n\nAn identical story also has been published on a website called Tomi Lahren NEWS. It attributes all of the same quotes to actor Gary Busey, who did endorse Trump. That site uses the image of conservative commentator Tomi Lahren without actually being affiliated with her.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cKevin Bacon: \u2018We Are Blessed To Have Donald Trump As Our President, He Is The Only One Who Can\u2026\u2019\u201d TheConservativeOnline. 3 Dec 2017.\n\nGrow, Kory. \u201cGene Simmons on Donald Trump: \u2018He\u2019s Good for the Political System.\u2019\u201d Rolling Stone. 30 Mar 2016.\n\n\u201cActor Gary Busey Says: \u2018We Are Blessed To Have Donald Trump As Our President, Trump Is Smart And Powerful He Is The Only One Who Can\u2026\u2019 Do You Support Gary Busey?\u201d Tomi Lahren NEWS. 4 Dec 2017.", "lang": "en"}
