Citing \u2018reports\u2019 the article claims, women asked them to fix the LPG rates before deciding whether women need to enter Sabarimala. It also says, BJP and Congress are working together to score politically, leaving people confused about their real political intentions.\n\nBOOM did not find other Malayalam dailies reporting the incident. And, though the image of women holding the cylinder was not of Kerala, Eyewitness did not specify that it is a representational image. Moreover, it is evident that there were attempts to hide the fact that the photos are from Orissa.\n\nA comparison of the original image and the image used by Eyewitness shows that it has been edited to cover the Oriya text in the banner behind the women. And, since the image has been cropped, the scarves wrapped around their neck are not fully visible. However, the original picture (see the image on the right) shows that the scarves have the conch, BJD\u2019s logo, printed on it.", "lang": "en"}
