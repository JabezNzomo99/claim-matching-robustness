Preventing infection through the use of vaccines has been the most effective means to combat such diseases and reduce their death rates around the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) states on its website.\n\nAngela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Center for Infection and Immunity at the Columbia University School of Public Health, also told the Daily Caller in an email, \u201cNo viral pathogen for which we have vaccines were made in a lab.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo say that any virus that originated from nature has its remedy in nature, ignores the fact that all human viruses came from nature, and that we have made vaccines for many of them,\u201d Vincent Racaniello, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University, told The Associated Press. \u201cI am unaware of any remedy from nature that prevents infection with any human virus.\u201d\n\nNo vaccine against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is currently available, though a number of candidates are currently undergoing clinical trials, according to the WHO.", "lang": "en"}
