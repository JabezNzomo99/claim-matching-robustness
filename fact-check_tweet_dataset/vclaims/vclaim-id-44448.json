The tweet has amassed close to 5,000 retweets so far. In the clip, a Muslim clergyman while making a provocative statement says*, \u201cThe way they have been torturing us. If we give a signal and instigate our young children then our children have way more strength than them. It\u2019s because they find them alone. Remember they are our children, through the media, we want to let the whole people of this country know that we are the children of the man who stood on the dome of Kubbat Al Sakhra and said to Jews that Jews, you have ten people who want to live and I have the ones who want to die. We are the community, which embraces death.\u201d It is important to note here that the clip is being shared in the backdrop of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and ahead of the upcoming Delhi assembly elections.\n\nSwarajya columnist Shefali Vaidya also quote-tweeted the same video posted by one Geetika Swami and opined, \u201cWhere is the outrage on this?\u201d. The combined retweet count of Swami and Vaidya\u2019s post exceed 4,500.\n\nWith a keyword search on Google, Alt News found that the same video was shared by Facebook page \u2018Yogi Adityanath -True Indian\u2018 in July 2019. Thus, the video is not recent and unrelated to anti-CAA protests.\n\nMufti Raees Ahmed, the district president of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hindi, had participated in a protest organized by the Muslim community on June 27, 2019. It was a demonstration outside at Dehradun court in the wake of Tabrez Ansari\u2019s lynching in Jharkhand. He gave the objectionable speech while speaking to media persons and according to a Times of India report, a case was registered with the Kotwali police under section 153 A (1)(b) [promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion] and 505-2 [hate speech] of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\n\nA longer version of the statement issued by Mufti Raees Ahmed can be heard in the video clip posted below.\n\nIn conclusion, an old video of a provocative statement given by a Muslim clergyman after Tabrez Ansari\u2019s lynching was shared by BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra in the backdrop of anti-CAA protests and the run-up to the assembly elections in Delhi on February 8, 2020. Patra has tweeted the video without context, giving the impression that it is a recent speech. Moreover, the speech was made in Uttarakhand and not Delhi, as claimed on social media.", "lang": "en"}
