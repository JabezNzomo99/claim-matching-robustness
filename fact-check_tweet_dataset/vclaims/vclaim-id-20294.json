The photograph was sourced to Associated Press, which described it as, \u201cPakistani men prepare the graves of Saturday\u2019s bombing victims in Quetta, Pakistan, Sunday, Feb. 17, 2013.\u201d This photograph seemed to be of the same location as the viral image but taken from a different angle.\n\nGetty Imageshas also stocked similar photographs of mass graves from the 2013 bombing in Pakistan. However, these are also not identical to the viral image but seem to have been shot at the same location.\n\nWhile Alt News was unable to confirm the exact time and location of the viral photograph, we could ascertain that it has existed on the internet since at least 2016. Therefore, cannot represent the aftermath of Balakot airstrike.\n\nAfter India\u2019s airstrike on JeM camps and succeeding reports that there were no casualties in the attack, misinformation on social media is being circulated in large numbers to prove that the airstrike caused massive devastation in Pakistan. Earlier, images from the 2005 Kashmir earthquake were shared as the impact of IAF airstrike. Misleading videos are also being shared on social media to assert the same. In fact, a social media user manufactured a WhatsApp chat with a \u2018Pakistani friend\u2019 to falsely claim that 292 terrorists were killed in the February 26 airstrike.", "lang": "en"}
