And wages have improved since 2014.\n\nAverage hourly earnings adjusted for inflation of all private-sector workers increased 2.6 percent since the end of 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That indicates that \u201ctoday,\u201d as McConnell put it, workers are a good bit better off than they were in 2014.\n\nMcConnell discussed the economy when asked on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d about the political success of businessman Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee (at the 3:17 minute mark).\n\nTo measure income for the \u201caverage person\u201d we went to the Census Bureau and reviewed the data for real (inflation adjusted) median personal income. The most recent data (table P-7) show that it was $28,757 in 2014, down $396 from $29,153 in 2008.\n\nWhen we asked McConnell\u2019s office where he got his figure of \u201cabout $3,000 or $4,000 a year,\u201d we were given data for median household income (table H-8) from the Census Bureau. McConnell didn\u2019t say \u201caverage household;\u201d he said \u201caverage person.\u201d But he\u2019s wrong about average household, too.\n\nIn fact, by one report, average household income has fully recovered from the 2007 recession.\n\nBy McConnell\u2019s measure, using Census data, there was a decline of $1,656 in median household income (not \u201c$3,000 or $4,000\u201d) as of 2014 (not \u201ctoday\u201d). According to the Census Bureau, the median household income in 2014 dollars (inflation adjusted) was $55,313 in 2008 and $53,657 in 2014.\n\nBut that figure of $1,656 is outdated. As we mentioned earlier, average hourly earnings for private-sector workers increased 2.6 percent since the end of 2014, so today the \u201caverage person\u201d is doing better now than even 2014.\n\nThe average household is doing better, too.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s office did not cite this, but there is a more up-to-date source of median household income and that\u2019s from Sentier Research, which provides monthly household income figures while the Census Bureau publishes annual figures.\n\nIn 2012, GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney cited Sentier Research to make the exaggerated claim that the median income in America had fallen by $5,000 under Obama. It was a staple of his stump speech. But, as we wrote at the time, Romney\u2019s $5,000 figure dated to the start of the recession in December 2007 \u2014 more than a year before Obama took office.\n\nSentier Research now shows that median household income has fully recovered from the Great Recession, which officially ended June 2009.\n\nIn its latest report, Sentier says household median income was $57,243 \u2014 up $343, or 0.6 percent, from the start of the recession in December 2007.\n\nIt\u2019s time for McConnell to retire this Republican talking point, which was misused in 2012 and flat out wrong in 2016.", "lang": "en"}
