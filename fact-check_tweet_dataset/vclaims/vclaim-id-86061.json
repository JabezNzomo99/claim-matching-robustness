He said he has begun conversations with his soon-to-be colleagues on the Hill. The amount in total annual benefits that a single parent with two kids can receive, pegged at $35,000, is \u201cin essence a bribe not to work that hard or a bribe not to marry somebody with a full-time job,\u201d he said.\n\nGrothman described it as a conservative estimate. He said he subtracted the $6,634 figure from the total because the school aid may not apply to single parents in general, yielding a result of $34,658, or nearly $35,000. But Grothman also believes BadgerCare Plus should be added to the total cost. He said he gave analysts a set of circumstances to compare, in order to quantify the \u201cmarriage penalty.\u201d The cost could have been lower or higher based on the circumstance he gave analysts, he conceded.\n\nA 2013 Cato Institute report on the total level of welfare benefits by state examined how much a \u201ctypical welfare family,\u201d of a single mother with two children, would receive for what researchers determined was a typical welfare package. That included Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) cash assistance, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, which is still popularly known by its former name, food stamps), Medicaid, housing assistance, utility assistance and the Women, Infants and Children program (WIC). Researchers also accounted for federal and state tax deductions, exemptions and credits, such as the earned income tax credit and child tax credit.\n\nBut Grothman doesn\u2019t provide any evidence for his assertion that single parents who make $10,000 a year are content living on government wages, rather than trying to earn more money. As the Cato report notes, \u201cmost welfare recipients today are required to either work or participate in some form of job search activities.\u201d In the Wisconsin report\u2019s scenario, the single parent is attending technical college full-time \u2014 which could translate to future employment. There are working, low-income parents who are eligible for and receive assistance. Researchers from Cato acknowledged this: moving from welfare to work does not automatically mean that the person loses all welfare benefits.\n\nAs a side note, let\u2019s remember that Americans in general, not just the poor, benefit from the way government benefits and tax incentives are structured. For example, the home-mortgage interest tax deduction and deductions for state taxes can reduce taxes significantly for upper-income taxpayers. (A family paying $50,000 in mortgage interest, in a 35 percent tax bracket, saves more than $17,000 in taxes.) Grothman told us he does not support any tax benefits that he deems overly generous, whether they benefit the rich or the poor.\n\n\u201cOne thing we have learned in public finance is that taxes have significant effects on portfolio behavior, even if there is less certain effect on work and saving. Not getting married is the major tax shelter for low- and moderate-income households with children. In many low-income communities around the nation, marriage is now the exception rather than the rule,\u201d according to congressional testimony by economist Eugene Steuerle from the Urban Institute.\n\nThe single parent in the Wisconsin legislative analysis received even more than Grothman\u2019s claim. The report\u2019s analysts acknowledged that the specific situation they studied would apply to a small portion of Wisconsin residents \u2014 fewer than 260 out of the state\u2019s total population of 5.7 million (that is, less than 1/200th of 1 percent of the state\u2019s population). Even if student aid was subtracted from the figure, it would still be difficult to figure out how many single parents fit his narrow focus.", "lang": "en"}
