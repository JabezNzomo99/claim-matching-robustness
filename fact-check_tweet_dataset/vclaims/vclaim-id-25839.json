Thousands of farmers led by the Bharatiya Kisan Union held a 10 day long march from Haridwar to the national capital to reach Kisan Ghat, Delhi on Gandhi Jayanti. However, the police set barricades at the UP-Delhi border preventing them from entering Delhi. The police also used tear gas and water cannons on the farmers when they attempted to break the barricades. Around 14 people including policemen were injured in the clashes. The government and the police came under heavy criticism for using force against the farmers. Later they were allowed to enter Delhi only on Wednesday.\n\nCLAIM: \"Look at the farmer with a brick in his hand, facing a cop with a gun\".\n\nFACT: It is a 2013 image from Khera in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh during a clash between police force and villagers post the Muzaffarnagar riots.\n\nFacebook page I am With Barkha Dutt with around 7.5 lakh followers shared the image with the caption \u090f\u0915 \u092c\u0941\u091c\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0917 \u0905\u0928\u0926\u093e\u0924\u093e \u092a\u0930 \u0938\u0940\u0927\u0947 \u092c\u0902\u0926\u0942\u0915 \u0924\u093e\u0928 \u0926\u0947\u0928\u093e \u0915\u0939\u093e\u0902 \u0915\u0940 \u0936\u0942\u0930\u0935\u0940\u0930\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0938\u093e\u0939\u0947\u092c ! \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u092f\u0947 \u0915\u093f\u0938\u093e\u0928 \u0905\u092a\u0930\u093e\u0927\u0940 \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u092f\u093e \u0906\u0924\u0902\u0915\u0935\u093e\u0926\u0940 ? \u0921\u0942\u092c \u092e\u0930\u094b \u0924\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0936\u093e\u0939\u094b\u0902.
