She apparently was working at the behest of a fringe conspiracy group with a history of such stunts. They stated their intent was to troll Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nA woman at a town hall event held by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez abruptly stood up and suggested \"eating babies\" to combat climate change.\n\nAn Oct. 3, 2019, town hall event in New York City hosted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., was going smoothly until a woman in a black jacket stood up and started rambling her fears about apocalyptic climate change. Then she took her jacket off, revealing a T-shirt that read, \u201cSave the planet. Eat the children.\u201d\n\nThe woman said she was glad Ocasio-Cortez supported the Green New Deal but stated it was not enough. \u201cYour new campaign slogan has to be this,\u201d she stated, taking her jacket off and revealing the shirt. \u201cWe got to start eating babies. We don\u2019t have enough time. \u2026 Even if you would bomb Russia, we still have too many people, too much pollution!\u201d\n\nWords and images from the event shared online prompted reactions from many, including U.S. President Donald Trump and his eldest son, Donald Jr.\n\nDuring the town hall, Ocasio-Cortez responded to the woman by talking about the need for positive solutions to climate change and concluding, \u201cWe are never beyond hope\u201d before quickly moving on to another question.\n\nAlthough some on the political right criticized her response, Ocasio-Cortez followed up on Twitter by explaining that she had been operating under the assumption that the woman was mentally ill and in crisis.\n\n\n\n It turned out the woman in question was neither an Ocasio-Cortez supporter nor a person having a mental-health emergency but apparently acting at the behest of a group called Lyndon LaRouche PAC. The stunt was meant to troll Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nHistorian Matthew Sweet described the group as a \u201cbizarre political cult\u201d in an interview with The Washington Post about the incident. Sweet, who has studied the group\u2019s history, told the Post that the woman\u2019s stunt fell in line with their standard operating procedures. \u201cThe tactic,\u201d Sweet told the Post, \u201cis you go to a political meeting and you create a disturbance that disrupts the meeting, and more importantly, that creates a kind of chaos.\u201d\n\nThe group, dubbed LaRouchians, has been around for decades, and was founded by conspiracy crank Lyndon LaRouche, who died in February 2019 at the age of 96 after building a \u201cworldwide following based on conspiracy theories, economic doom, anti-Semitism, homophobia and racism.\u201d\n\nLaRouche\u2019s conspiracy theories involve proffering claims that the Queen of England controls the international drug trade and that Adolf Hitler, whose forces bombed England in World War II, was a British agent.", "lang": "en"}
