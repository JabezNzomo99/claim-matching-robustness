I mean\u2026they live in trailers by the water, right?\u201d\n\nThe remark was allegedly captured on tape by a \u201ctrue patriot\u201d sound engineer who vowed to hold on to it unless he needed to \u201csave the country\u201d or himself.\n\nThe story is fabricated, as is every story on the site. Its Facebook page includes this disclaimer:\n\nThe same disclaimer also appears verbatim on the Facebook page for another fake news site, TheLastLineofDefense.org, and the two web sites appear to be related.\n\nAs American As Apple Pie also has another, more vaguely-worded, disclaimer on its web site:\n\nWhen no one can trust the lying fake news liberal media anymore because they hate us and guns and Harley Davidson and meat and OUR president, As American as Apple Pie is here to be your beacon of something you can kinda rely on sometimes, but not really because only God can control our fate in this crazy, twisted world. God Bless America and Amen.\n\nWe called a phone number listed on As American As Apple Pie\u2019s Facebook page and got this voicemail message:", "lang": "en"}
