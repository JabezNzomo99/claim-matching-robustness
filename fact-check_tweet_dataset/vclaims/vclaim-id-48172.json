No, that's not true: A scam website is luring visitors by promising free pizza in exchange for completing surveys but the whole thing is a scam designed to steal personal information. The setup is similar to earlier scams targeting different brands before.\n\nThe fake offer appeared in a post (archived here) posted on Facebook under the title \"Just tell us what is your favorite Pizza and get 2 Extra Large Pizzas!\" It opened:\n\nThe site is part of a larger network of scam websites that all operate in the same manner. First three questions are asked, typically asking if you are satisified with some brand, if you have used their product or if you would recommend it to others. Three possible answers are offered each time \"Yes,\" \"No\" or \"Don't remember.\"\n\nNo matter what answers are given, visitors are redirected to a screen that looks like this, inviting them to share and like the page on Facebook to claim the prize:\n\nThe comment form at the bottom is also fake: Comments are automatically appearing but they do not come from real people; the whole thing is scripted: If the page is reloaded the same comments start appearing again. Clicking the share button does bring up a real share popup from Facebook but it does not share the exact URL of the page: It varies the random-looking string of letters and numbers at the end so that to Facebook it will look like a new and different article that is being shared. This makes it harder to detect and do something about it because each individual link needs to be individually reported and taken down.\n\nClicking the like button takes people through a series of redirects via various pages, probably depending on which ads or scams the people behind the site need to promote at the time. But no prize will show up at your door in the end.\n\nThe scammers behind the site regularily launch new sites targeting different brands and businesses but they all look similar. arlier versions we spotted were aimed at Dunkin' Donuts, JetBlue, Starbucks, Costco, Little Caesars and Alaska Airlines.", "lang": "en"}
