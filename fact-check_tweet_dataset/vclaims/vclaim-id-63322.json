(We\u2019ve fact-checked many throughout the COVID-19 pandemic so far.)\n\nBut other details led us to doubt the veracity of this message.\n\nFirst, the message claims \u201cthe peak\u201d of novel coronavirus infections will hit between March 27 and April 7, but there is no such universal peak date reported. Various regions are estimated to experience peak caseload at different times, depending on a number of factors, such as when outbreaks in the area first manifested and whether social-distancing measures were in place.\n\nSecond, public health leaders worldwide, including the NHS, have instructed people to stay at home and practice social distancing in order to slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus. If you or someone you live with have symptoms, the NHS says you should self-isolate and not leave your home, even to buy food. However, for everyone else, they advise that essential trips out of the home should be kept to a minimum.\n\nAll of the National Health Service\u2019s advice for coping with the COVID-19 pandemic can be found here.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a viral hoax exploited public fears over COVID-19 and falsely warned that it might soon be impossible to leave one\u2019s home even to purchase basic necessities.", "lang": "en"}
