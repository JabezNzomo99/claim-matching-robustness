The simple fact is that female workers are only about 70% as productive as male workers and that is why they are paid less.\u201d\n\nThis appears to be a fabrication. We can find no evidence that Mr Francois has ever said this.\n\nThe Facebook account that posted the quote lists itself as \u201cSatire/parody\u201d, but it describes its purpose as \u201cto tell you about the fibs quitters and politicians tell about the EU and other issues and to expose their embarresing [sic] moments\u201d. It also appears that many of the people commenting below the quote believed it to be accurate.\n\nWhen we contacted his office, a spokesperson for Mr Francois told us, \u201cThis is a complete sham. As Mark is a strong meritocrat, he has never used those words, nor would he. This post is clearly fake news.\u201d\n\nWe cannot find this quotation in Hansard, which keeps a record of everything said in Parliament. Indeed, having searched online, we cannot find it attributed to anyone.", "lang": "en"}
