We meet our commitments. That\u2019s one of the reasons why almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago when I took office.\"\n\nDoes the world really like us more now than they did eight years ago?\n\nThe White House referred us to our own archives and a fact-check of former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson. Carlson claimed that most polls show the world has \"lower regard\" for the United States now under Obama than under President George W. Bush. We rated that claim False.\n\nSo what about Obama's claim?\n\nThe president is putting words into pollsters\u2019 mouths when he specifically says strength and respect, but he\u2019s generally right that world opinion of the United States has improved.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of how the United States stacked up over the course of Obama\u2019s presidency, according to various polls. Positive opinions are expressed with a plus sign, and negative ones with a minus. The number outside of the parentheses indicates the net favorability.\n\nWe\u2019ll go through the available data one by one\n\nIn its 2015 survey of more than 130 countries, 45 percent approved of the job performance of the leadership of the United States, while 28 percent disapproved. That\u2019s up 11 percent in favorability while down 6 percent unfavorability from 2008.\n\nIn Pew\u2019s June 2008 survey of 23 countries, 43 percent of respondents had a favorable view of the United States while 48 percent of respondents had an unfavorable view on average.\n\nIn 2015 survey of 39 countries, the United States\u2019 favorability jumped up to 69 percent while unfavorability dropped down to 24 percent.\n\nOut of the 21 countries included in both surveys, 18 had a more positive view of the United States in 2015 than they did in 2007. Russia, Lebanon and Jordan on the other hand had a more negative view.\n\nViews toward the United States improved the least out of the three sets of polling, but they did improve.\n\nIn 2008, an average of 35 percent of people surveyed in 34 countries said the United States is \"having a positive influence\" while 47 percent said it had a negative influence. Six years later, the global average jumped up to 42 percent positive and 38 percent negative.\n\nObama said, \"Almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago when I took office.\"\n\nThe general sentiment that the United States is viewed more positively around the world is supported by three different sets of polls, but they don\u2019t specifically talk about strength or respect.", "lang": "en"}
