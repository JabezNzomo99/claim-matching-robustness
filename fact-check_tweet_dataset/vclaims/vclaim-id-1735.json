Looking across all 35, the UK actually spends more than the average on health.\n\nHowever, the definition of health spending used for this comparison includes private healthcare and social care. Go back a few years to when the definition was different, and the UK came out below average.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said before, these comparisons are tricky.", "lang": "en"}
