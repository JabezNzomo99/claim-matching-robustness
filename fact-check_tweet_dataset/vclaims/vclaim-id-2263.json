I will immediately fire you, no matter who you are!\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

But Hunt told the paper that \"it was an internet hoax.\"\n\nHere\u2019s what Hunt has actually said about anthem protests: \"It\u2019s not something where I\u2019ve spoken specifically to the players or any specific player about it. But the entire team knows that our desire is for them to stand during the national anthem.\"", "lang": "en"}
