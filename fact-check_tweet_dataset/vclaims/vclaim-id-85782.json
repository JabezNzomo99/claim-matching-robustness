It\u2019s one of the big coal-powered electric plants that must comply with new environmental regulations \u2014 imposed by the Obama administration \u2014 and in 2012, the company announced that it would shut down its coal-burning furnaces, even though it relied on coal that was mined locally.\n\nThe company said the reason for the shift is that retrofitting the plant to comply with the new coal regulations, using a scrubber system, would have resulted in a 31 percent increase in electricity rates for eastern Kentucky residents. The company instead will shift to electricity generated from a plant in West Virginia that meets the new regulations, which will result in only an 8 percent increase. Earlier this year, Kentucky regulators also approved a plan to convert part of the plant to natural gas, which will be used for peak periods.\n\nGrimes and McConnell have both been critical of the environmental regulations, but her assertion that \u201cMcConnell didn\u2019t fight to get the scrubbers it needs to reduce coal emissions\u201d makes little sense. First, it\u2019s unclear why a senator would be seeking to provide scrubbers to an investor-owned company. Second, going the scrubber route would have jacked up utility rates for what is already one of the poorest parts of the state.\n\nRetrofitting the plant for the new coal regs \u201cwas not in the best interests of our customers\u201d because of the potential rate increase, said Melissa McHenry, AEP\u2019s director of external communications. She said there is nothing that McConnell could have done to help the company get the scrubbers, since it is a state regulatory issue. When a company makes a decision like this, it makes a filing that seeks recovery of the costs of investment. \u201cThere is no involvement of a senator in that process,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Grimes campaign defends this language on the grounds that McConnell voted against budget plans that would have boosted funding for clean coal technology \u2014 research that the campaign claims might have made scrubbers less expensive. But, despite McConnell\u2019s negative vote, the spending bills were approved and the investments were made anyway. (The argument also seems at odds with her rhetoric that the regs are bad in the first place.) Most of the votes cited by the Grimes campaign took place after AEP\u2019s decision to close the plant, so there\u2019s really no justification for this statement.\n\nThe Rainforest Action Network, Sierra Club and BankTrak in 2012 issued a report that ranked Wells Fargo as one of the top five worst banks on coal financing, with an overall grade of \u201cD.\u201d In 2013, Wells Fargo earned a \u201cC\u201d for mountaintop removal but retained a \u201cD\u201d for coal-fired power plants. And in 2014, its score for mountaintop removal improved to \u201cB\u201d \u2014 making it one of the first banks to earn such a rating \u2014 yet it still only earned a \u201cD\u201d for financing coal-fired plants.", "lang": "en"}
