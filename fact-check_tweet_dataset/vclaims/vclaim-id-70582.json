And her Aug. 1, 2012, column did pretty much the same.\n\n \n\n Casting the nomination of Ted Cruz for U.S. Senate as a harbinger of doom, Collins wrote that Texas \"does tend to treasure the extreme\" in politics, saying, \"The current Republican state platform calls for an end to the teaching of \u2018critical thinking\u2019 in public schools.\"\n\n \n\n Collins is actually a bit late to this party: Major liberal websites launched assaults on this part of the 2012 platform (adopted June 8) as early as June 26, and Comedy Central\u2019s \"Colbert Report\" satirized it July 17.\n\n \n\n Mainstream media weighed in, too. A July 9 Washington Post blog entry was headlined \"Texas GOP rejects \u2018critical thinking\u2019 skills. Really.\" Miami Herald columnist Leonard Pitts wrote July 21: \"The Texas GOP has set itself explicitly against teaching children to be critical thinkers.\"\n\n \n\n Austin American-Statesman opinion columnist Ken Herman reported July 21 that the party\u2019s deputy executive director, Chris Elam, told him the platform subcommittee did not intend to indicate that the party opposed critical thinking skills.\n\n \n\n We began our research by trying to contact Collins but did not hear from her. Her column gives no information about her claim beyond that single sentence.\n\n \n\n We pulled the complete wording of the \"Knowledge-Based Education\" plank from the 2012 platform:\n\n\n\nWe oppose the teaching of Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) (values clarification), critical thinking skills and similar programs that are simply a relabeling of Outcome-Based Education (OBE) (mastery learning) which focus on behavior modification and have the purpose of challenging the student\u2019s fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority.\n\n\n\n Next, we contacted Elam, who told us by email that party chairman Steve Munisteri had given a good explanation in a July 24 interview with Austin\u2019s KVUE-TV.\n\n \n\n Munisteri told KVUE, \"The platform plank is against a specific type of teaching called 'outcome-based education.'\n\n \n\n \"The reason why critical thinking is mentioned is some places try to disguise the program of outcome-based education and just re-label it as 'critical thinking.' \"\n\n \n\n That\u2019s supported by the wording in the platform.\n\n \n\n Following the lead of a July 6, 2012, Chronicle of Higher Education blog post on the Texas platform fracas, we looked back to the 2010 platform. Its \"Knowledge-Based Education\" plank said, \"The primary purpose of public schools is to teach critical thinking skills, reading, writing, arithmetic, phonics, history, science, and character \u2026 We oppose Outcome-Based Education (OBE) and similar programs.\"\n\n \n\n Both platforms support critical thinking when it comes to \"controversial theories\" such as evolution, which \"should be taught as challengeable scientific theories ... Teachers and students should be able to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these theories openly and without fear of retribution or discrimination of any kind.\"\n\n \n\n Next, we set out to see if we could determine whether opposing outcome-based education is also, de facto, opposing critical thinking in the larger sense.\n\n \n\n The debate over outcome-based education caught fire in the 1990s as outcome-based curricula were installed in U.S. school districts. In the Lexis newspaper archive and on the web, we saw a dozen news stories and opinion pieces from as many states -- Texas included -- describing public concern about the new approach.\n\n \n\n Opponents said the outcome-based approach was antithetical to critical thinking. They claimed it \"dumbed down\" curricula and influenced students to adopt liberal attitudes because the \"outcome\" of their studies was predetermined by academia.\n\n \n\n Supporters claimed it encouraged -- in fact, taught -- critical thinking. Rather than testing students on facts learned by rote memorization, they said, it required children to demonstrate that they had learned to analyze the material.\n\n \n\n So what the heck is it? The news stories we read indicate outcome-based education takes different forms nearly everywhere it\u2019s applied. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram gave a description in an Oct. 30, 1996, news story about opposition to OBE-like elements in the state\u2019s planned education overhaul:\n\n\n\nUnder outcome-based education, academic and personal goals are set for students before they can graduate. The program stresses that children are not allowed to fail, so they might be given the same test or report over and over until they do the work satisfactorily. It also may eliminate traditional grades, competitive student assessments and distinct subjects and grade levels.\n\nMethods of implementing outcome-based education include awarding group grades instead of individual grades and eliminating honors programs.\n\nThe \"founding father\" of OBE, education reformer William Spady, gave an example in an interview for the December 1992/January 1993 issue of Educational Leadership magazine, published by ASCD (formerly the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development).\n\n \n\n Asked whether an outcome might be \"The student will be able to list the five causes of the Civil War,\" Spady replied: \"No, sorry; that is not an exit outcome. But, \u2018Identify and explain the fundamental causes and consequences of the Civil War\u2019 would be an enabling outcome worth pursuing en route to some larger exit outcome.\"\n\n \n\n Today, a divide remains between the \"OBE teaches kids to think\" side and the \"OBE suppresses thinking\" side.\n\n \n\n We didn\u2019t find allusions to \"critical thinking skills\" being used as a code phrase for OBE, but did note that a Feb. 15, 1994, news story in the Dallas Morning News said some educators were avoiding the name \"outcomes-based education\":\n\n\n\nBecause of the controversy, many educators are going to great lengths to avoid being associated with outcomes-based education.\n\n\"We've always had outcomes,\" said state school board member Diane Patrick. But \"we'd be foolish to call it outcomes-based education right now. That would be very unwise.\"\n\n\n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n As Collins says, the Texas GOP platform does state that the party opposes \"critical thinking.\" But Collins leaves out some important context. The platform makes it clear that its opposition is centered on one type of education model: outcome-based education.\n\n \n\n That\u2019s just the kind of situation addressed in PolitiFact\u2019s definition of Half True: \"The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\"\n\n \n\n By those lights, Collins\u2019 statement is Half True.", "lang": "en"}
