Russia held the G-8 presidency first in 2006 with a summit in St. Petersburg.\n\nPutin\u2019s claim that \u201cour colleagues refused to come to Russia due to known reasons at some point,\u201d is true and refers to Russia\u2019s second presidency in 2014, when the G-8 summit was supposed to take place in June in Sochi, the city where Russia hosted the 2014 Winter Olympic Games. That changed when Moscow moved to annex Crimea from Ukraine in March, when the other members of the Group declared the suspension of the G-8 format and return to the G-7.\n\n\u200bThe Group\u2019s joint statement strongly condemned but did not permanently ban Russia.\n\n\u201cThis Group came together because of shared beliefs and shared responsibilities. Russia's actions in recent weeks are not consistent with them. Under these circumstances, we will not participate in the planned Sochi Summit. We will suspend our participation in the G-8 until Russia changes course and the environment comes back to where the G-8 is able to have a meaningful discussion\u201d the leaders wrote in The Hague Declaration in March 2014.\n\nThe G-7 left the door open for Russia to rejoin if Moscow fulfills its international obligations, which so far Russia has not done.\n\nIt was Russia\u2019s own decision to leave the Group permanently in January 2017.\n\nNotably, Vladimir Putin\u2019s personal frustration with the Group had been reported long before the 2014 suspension \u2013 the Russian President skipped the world leaders meeting in Camp David, the U.S. presidential retreat near Washington, DC, in May 2012, and Putin\u2019s \u201cloneliness\u201d was a trending world headline during the G-8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.\n\n\u200bRussia\u2019s partnership in the G-7 had become increasingly problematic due to Vladimir Putin\u2019s domestic and foreign policies, at odds with other members of the Group. In 2013, Putin\u2019s pro-Assad positions over the conflict in Syria collided with the other seven \u2013 with remarks like then-President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cof course our opinions do not coincide\u201d and Putin\u2019s, \u201cWe have different perspectives on the problem.\u201d\n\nMr. Putins\u2019 comments Sunday came as the G-7 summit wrapped up in Canada with President Trump refusing to sign the joint communiqu\u00e9, Trump suggesting Russia rejoin the G-7 and the U.S. presidential openly feuding with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nRussia remains a member of the G-20, the global forum for financial and economic cooperation, which includes South American, South Asian and African representation. The Group will meet at the end of November in Argentina.", "lang": "en"}
