Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Emerson ever penned this phrase. It may be a variation of a line written by poet Muriel Strode.\n\nEmerson was a philosopher, poet and essayist who featured prominently in the 19th century transcendentalist movement that emphasized intuitive, spiritual thinking over scientific, empirical thinking. He published a sizable body of work during his lifetime, including the well-known essay \u201cSelf-Reliance.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation searched a complete collection of his works, as well as his personal letters, for similar or matching phrases. However, the searches turned up no statements resembling the one attributed to Emerson in the Facebook post.\n\n\u201cThat quote does not appear in Emerson\u2019s works. It is a false attribution,\u201d confirmed a spokesperson for the Ralph Waldo Emerson Society in an email to TheDCNF.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely not an Emerson quotation, although it is attributed to him all over the Internet,\u201d Jeffrey Cramer, editor of \u201cThe Portable Emerson,\u201d said via email to TheDCNF. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to track down its origin.\u201d\n\nQuote Investigator, a website dedicated to researching the sources of quotations, traced a variation of the phrase back to the 1903 poem \u201cWind-Wafted Wild Flowers,\u201d written by Strode. The opening line of the poem reads as follows: \u201cI will not follow where the path may lead, but I will go where there is no path, and I will leave a trail.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
