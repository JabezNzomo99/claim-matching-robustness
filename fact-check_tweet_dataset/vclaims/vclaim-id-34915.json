She is Divya Allola Reddy, the founder of \u2018Klimom\u2019, a farm cafe in Hyderabad which focuses on nutrients in cow\u2019s milk and dissemination of the same among the people. This video is of a programme organised on World Milk Day in 2018. At 48 seconds, the woman can be heard introducing herself as Divya Allola Reddy. She was conferred the National Gopal Ratna award in 2018. Moreover, the name of this lady and the name of the Hyderabad victim are not the same. The lady in her speech takes the name of her husband, Gautam Reddy. However, none of the media reports on the Hyderabad case referred to the victim being married.\n\nMoreover, according to a report published in Deccan Chronicle on April 10, 2019, Divya Reddy is 35 years of age, whereas the Hyderabad rape victim was 26 years old.\n\nThus, a video shot in 2018 on the occasion of World Milk Day showing Divya Allola Reddy receiving an award was shared widely on social media as the Hyderabad gang-rape and murder victim.", "lang": "en"}
