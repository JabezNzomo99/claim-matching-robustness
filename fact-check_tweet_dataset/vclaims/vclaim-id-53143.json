However, the identities and nationalities of the perpetrators and victim is unclear.\n\nBOOM found that the same video uploaded in November 2016 to YouTube by Kwong Wah Yit Poh or Kwong Wah Daily - a Malaysian Chinese daily.\n\n\n\nThe caption when translated reads, \"(Penang, 28th) A video of a severely beaten foreign worker circulated on social networks, arousing the anger of netizens. In the video, a man wearing a net T-shirt 5.0 T-shirt watched the abuse of foreign workers. .\" \n\n\n\nWe also found several social media posts with the viral video posted in November 2016 posted with different captions.\n\nBOOM could not independently verify the incident, however we were able to establish that the video is several years old and is likely to have been shot in Malaysia.", "lang": "en"}
