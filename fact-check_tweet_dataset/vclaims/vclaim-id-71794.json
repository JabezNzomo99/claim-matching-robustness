The posts attribute the advice to \u201cChinese medicine and professors\u201d. We spoke to medical professionals practising both Chinese and Western medicine, who told us the advice was unfounded -- and that it\u2019s dangerous, as it could encourage people to delay urgent treatment for a stroke victim.\n\nThe hoax has been circulating for more than a decade -- originally via a widely-circulated chain email, as reported by the New York Times in 2006.\n\nThirteen years later, thousands of people have again been sharing the harmful advice about how to treat a stroke, a sudden interruption of the blood supply to an area of the brain which can be fatal or leave the victim with serious disabilities.\n\nOne of the posts has been shared more than 2,500 times since it was published by a Nigerian user in Prayer Rain, a public Facebook group with over 300,000 members, in June. We\u2019ve archived the post here.\n\n\u201cHOW TO SAVE SOMEONE FROM STROKE. THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE A NEEDLE IN YOUR POCKET,\u201d it reads. It goes on to describe a supposed Chinese medicine technique for saving a stroke victim\u2019s life by pricking their fingers and earlobes with a needle.\n\nSimilar posts have been shared from accounts in Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa, among others.\n\nThe comments under the posts suggest many users believed the advice, with some expressing gratitude for the tip.\n\nIgnore this \u2018dangerously misleading\u2019 advice -- seek urgent medical help after a stroke\n\nConsultant neurologist Dr. Dilraj Singh Sokhi, the head of Stroke Services at the Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi, told AFP that the treatment recommended in the Facebook post was \u201cdangerously misleading\u201d and could delay potentially life-saving emergency medical treatment.\n\n\u201cTime is of the essence,\u201d Dr. Sokhi told AFP in an interview at the hospital.\n\n\u201cFor every minute that passes, one million nerve cells are dying in the brain during a sudden stroke attack to the brain. We know that the sooner you get to a relevant healthcare facility the better the outcome, as the treatment we can provide can only be given within the first few hours of the stroke.\u201d\n\nThe needle technique recommended in the post could be harmful in itself, Dr. Sokhi warned.\n\n\u201cThe pain experienced by injuring these most sensitive parts of the body might cause the patient\u2019s blood pressure to rise and worsen the stroke. Also, if the needles are not sterile there is a risk of transfer of infections.\u201d\n\nDr. Sokhi gave an interview on KTN television recently which covered the urgent nature of strokes and the emergency treatments available.\n\nNo, this is not a treatment recommended by Chinese medicine practitioners\n\nThe posts attribute the advice to Chinese medicine. But registered practitioner Wendy Wong, an assistant professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told AFP that the posts gave a misleading interpretation of acupuncture techniques used in traditional Chinese medicine.\n\n\u201cIn the national healthcare system in China, in a Chinese medicine hospital, they will use acupuncture together with Western medicine for acute stroke,\u201d Dr. Wong told AFP via email. This is applied to different parts of the body, \u201cfrom the limbs to the body trunk\u201d, depending on the nature of the stroke.\n\n\u201cIt is recommended that (people) seek consultation or immediate help from a Western medical doctor, since different countries have different regulation of Chinese medicine,\u201d she said.\n\nLike Dr. Sokhi, she stressed that professional medical personnel \u201cshould be the first to consult\u201d in the event of a stroke.\n\n\u201cTo protect patients' safety, I would like to say this article on Facebook is rather misleading,\u201d Dr. Wong told AFP.\n\nDr. Sokhi described the social media posts as \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is important for the general public to understand what the symptoms of an acute stroke are, and the commonly used abbreviation is FAST,\u201d he said.\n\nThe abbreviation is used by emergency health services such as the Red Cross and St John Ambulance to help people recognise the symptoms of a stroke. FAST stands for:\n\nFace: Ask the person to smile. Does one side of their face droop?\n\nArms: Ask the person to raise their arms. Are they having difficulty keeping both of them raised?\n\nSpeech: Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase. Is their speech slurred or strange?\n\nTime: to call emergency services if you recognise any of these symptoms, and make sure that the person is taken to hospital urgently.\n\nAccording to the World Stroke Organization, strokes are the second leading cause of death for people over the age of 60 around the globe, and the fifth leading cause in people aged 15 to 59. One in six people will have a stroke at some point in their lifetime.", "lang": "en"}
