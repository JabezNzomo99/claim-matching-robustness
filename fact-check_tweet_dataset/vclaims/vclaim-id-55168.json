Never receive or make calls while rain is falling heavily with thunderstorms.\u201d\n\nThe post has three claims, namely:\n\n1. That the man was receiving phone call in the rain\n\n2. That thunder -lightning- struck and the man was burnt (roasted).\n\n3. That receiving or making calls during thunderstorms can get one burnt (roasted).\n\nForensic analysis carried out by The ICIR on the photo using InVid WeVerify application shows that the image was not manipulated, except for the texts printed at the upper edge of the photo.\n\nAlso, an image search of the photo using Google Reverse Image reveals that the photo was first shared on Twitter in June 2018, but without the printed text or caption.\n\nAlthough search for that particular image with the caption on any news website yielded no result, findings by The ICIR show that two Twitter users with the handles: @Mano07512038 and @kaja_maiden shared that same image with other photos allegedly of the same incident involving the burnt man on June 11, 2018 and June 12, 2018 respectively.\n\nThe ICIR digged deeper and discovered that the burnt person in the image was that of a retired teacher who was found dead inside his burnt car in Ambalakkulangara, near Kakkattil, in Kozhikode district, Kerala state in India on June 6, 2018.\n\nThe deceased was identified as Koyyalummal Nanu, from Koyyal, a news website, www.OnManorama.com reported. It was also reported in the Malayalam language edition of the website.\n\nWhen the image was subjected to further search using TinEye, it came out with five results which indicated that another news website, Mathrubhumi, also reported the incident on June 7, 2018.\n\nTo ascertain the authenticity of the images, especially the one showing the burnt man alongside those used on the news sites, The ICIR contacted the journalist who reported the story on www.OnManorama.com via email and Twitter.\n\nThe journalist, Anupama Mili, who replied via Twitter, confirmed that the photos were of the same incident that she reported.\n\nAlso, when asked to confirm if the \u2018burnt man\u2019 in the photo was the same victim mentioned in her report (as published on the news site), she said \u201cYes, this is.\u201d\n\nKuttyadi Police Inspector, Sunil Kumar, told Mathrubhumi.com that he (the burnt man) may have set himself on fire by pouring petrol on his body.\n\nAlthough no post-mortem report was received, Sunil Kumar pointed out that the doctors had informed him that the cause of death was suicide.\n\nExperts also pointed out that the cause of the car burning was not a short circuit or any other accident, the news report stated.\n\nFrom all the media reports, The ICIR was able to confirm that the man was burnt by, and reportedly died from, the fire which spread from petrol kept inside his car.\n\nSimilarly, the local Police neither retrieved any phone from the scene of the incident nor mentioned it among items recovered from the scene, according to media reports.\n\nIt is therefore evident to conclude that the man was not receiving phone call in the rain when the incident happened.\n\nFurther findings by The ICIR reveal that none of the locals who reported the incident to the Police and fire brigade mentioned that there was any thunderstorm or rain around the area when the incident occurred, though the ground around the scene of the incident was wet (as seen in the photos).\n\nThe ICIR could not independently verify the cause of the wetness at the scene of the incident, but believes this may not be unconnected with the water used by the fire brigade in putting out the fire from the victim\u2019s car.\n\nMoreso, local Police in the area reportedly told the media that \u201cthe fire is obviously spread from inside\u201d of the car.\n\nThis invalidates the claim that \u201cthunder\u201d \u2013 lightning- struck and the man was \u201croasted\u201d as a result of the thunderstorm.\n\nThunder is the sound caused by lightning, It is however the lighting that strikes.\n\nFindings by The ICIR show that there is a misconception globally that cell phones attract lightning strike which may burn (roast) the person receiving phone call during a rainy weather.\n\nJohn Jensenius, lightning safety specialist for the U.S. National Weather Service, reportedly said, \u201cIf someone is struck by lightning and they have a cell phone on them, it will usually melt or burn. People have taken that and blamed the cell phone, but in reality it is unrelated.\u201d\n\nAlthough there are media reports of people killed or injured by lightning, including that of a man struck by lightning while talking on his cell phone in Kuala Lumpur in 1999, \u201cIt\u2019s the place you\u2019re located that is more of a concern than anything else. If you\u2019re near a cell phone tower, that\u2019s bad because lightning will come and hit the cell phone tower,\u201d said AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist, Dan Kottlowski.\n\nThe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) also affirmed Kottlowski\u2019s position, saying lightning is not attracted to people carrying mobile phones.\n\n\u201cPeople are struck because they are in the wrong place at the wrong time. The wrong place is anywhere outside. The wrong time is anytime a thunderstorm is nearby,\u201d it stated.\n\nFurther findings by The ICIR reveal that using a corded telephone during a rainy-stormy weather or thunderstorm is discouraged because the phone is physically connected by wires to the outside.\n\n\u201cA cellphone, however, has no such physical connection and the electric current from a nearby lightning strike cannot reach it. It is perfectly safe to use a cellphone during a thunderstorm,\u201d the Chicago Tribune reported.\n\nA similar fact-check done by www.Snopes.com on the topic also corroborated the fact that using cell phones during stormy weather is safe.\n\nPart of the reports reads \u201cCell phones (and cordless portable phones) used indoors during electrical storms are perfectly safe because there is no wire through which the electrical discharge could travel. (The belief that lightning can \u201cfollow the radio waves\u201d into a cell phone is completely unfounded.)\n\n\u201cAnd although some people feel cell phones pose a risk when used outdoors because lightning is attracted to metal (it\u2019s not \u2014 metal is merely good at conducting electrical currents), handsets generally contain insignificant amounts of metal,\u201d it concluded.\n\nThe caption on the picture did not indicate what kind of phones it was referring too, because electrical discharge could travel through a land line phone with outlet wiring connected to a phone service provider.\n\nIt is however unlikely that the man was in his car with a land line telephone on the road.\n\n1. The claim that the man was receiving phone call in the rain is FALSE.\n\n2. The claim that thunder \u2013 lightning \u2013 struck and the man was burnt \u201croasted\u201d is also FALSE.\n\n3. The claim that receiving or making calls during thunderstorms can get one burnt (roasted) is MOSTLY FALSE. However, when hit by a lightning bolt electrical discharge can pass through a land line telephone with outlet wires, this is not applicable to the ubiquitous cell phone.", "lang": "en"}
