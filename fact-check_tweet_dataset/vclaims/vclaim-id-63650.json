Few images alleged to be that of Babri Masjid are also being shared in the post. Through this article let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Inside pictures of Babri Masjid released by the British Museum. Fact: British Museum has not released any inside pictures of Babri Masjid. Images of different monuments across the globe are being shared as those of Babri masjid. Except for one (for which no credible source is found), all the other images are not related to Babri masjid. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn reverse image search of the photo shared in the post, a similar photo was found in an article published in Britannica website about Kalaburagi city. Kalaburagi, also called Gulbarga, is a city in the northeastern part of Karnataka state. In the article, it is mentioned that the photo shows the view of Jamia Masjid in Gulbarga, Karnataka. When we searched for more information using these keywords \u2018Jamia Masjid in Gulbarga\u2019, a similar photo was found on the Alamy website. In this website also, it is mentioned that it shows the view of Jamia Mosque in Gulbarga.\n\nOn reverse image search, we found that the mosque in the image is not Babri Masjid, but Motijheel Mosque in Murshidabad. We can find this image on the official website of Murshidabad Municipality.\n\nOn reverse image search, a similar photo from another angle was found on the \u2018Archnet\u2019 website. On the website, it can be read that the photo was clicked in the \u2018Ye\u015fil Cami\u2019 mosque (Turkey). A similar colour photo clicked recently can be found on the \u2018Shutterstock\u2019 website.\n\nOn reverse image search through Yandex, a colored image of the same monument was found on a travel website. On the website, it is described that the photo is related to \u2018Ibrahim Rouza, Bijapur (Karnataka)\u2019. A search with the keywords \u2018Ibrahim Rouza Arches\u2019 led us to \u2018Flickr\u2019 where we found similar images.\n\nWhen we ran a reverse image search we came across a document which featured this image. The document describes the images as \u2018Window of the Mosque of Ibu Tulan\u2019. When we searched on google with \u2018Window of the Mosque of Ibu Tulan\u2019 as the keyword we found a similar image on V&A, a leading museum of art and design website. On the website the image is described as the Window grille in the mosque of Ahmad ibn Tulun, Cairo.\n\nWe found this image on Alamy, and according to the description on the website, the image is of Noh Gunbad Mosque in Balkh, Afghanistan.\n\nWhen we searched for formation regarding this image we found many social media posts attributing the image to Babri masjid. However, we could not find any credible source to conclude that this image is related to Babri masjid.\n\nAlso, when we searched on google using the keywords \u2018British museum released Babri masjid photos\u2019 we could not find any news reports related to this. In the wake of foundation laying ceremony of Ram temple in Ayodhya on 05 August 2020, posts like these are being shared.\n\nTo sum it up, except for one (to which we could not find a substantial source) all the remaining images are not related to Babri masjid.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
