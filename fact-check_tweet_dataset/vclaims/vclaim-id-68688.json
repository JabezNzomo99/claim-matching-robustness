But since that report, the numbers have changed: The rich have gotten richer while overall global wealth has decreased, according to the underlying data used by Oxfam.\n\nBased on the latest data from Credit Suisse, the wealth of the bottom 50 percent of the global population is $409 billion. The six wealthiest people in the world add up to about $416.2 billion, according to Forbes.\n\n\"The 1 percent now controls more wealth than the 99 percent of the rest of us combined, and it\u2019s only getting worse,\" said Rusu.\n\n\"I think this statement is correct but it is not very meaningful because the bottom 50 percent has essentially no wealth,\" said economist Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nMost of the wealth of the rich is from fungible private wealth, which is an asset\u2019s interchangeability with assets of the same type. \"It is probably the case that one-half the world\u2019s population has almost no fungible private wealth. So by that measure, Bernie Sanders may be right,\" said Richard Burkhauser, professor emeritus of policy analysis at Cornell University College of Human Ecology.\n\nRusu further explained that the Oxfam reports have seen a drop in private wealth, compared to the world\u2019s collective wealth, but this has to do with an improved data collection method and not necessarily a change in people\u2019s wealth.\n\nWhile giving a speech in Fulton, Missouri, Bernie Sanders stated that the six richest people in the world had as much wealth as the bottom half of the world\u2019s 3.7 billion people.\n\nAccording to global wealth disparity research, it is factually accurate to say that six men are, collectively, richer than the bottom 50 percent of the world.\n\nHowever, an expert cautioned about reading too much into this specific statistic because of the way wealth is measured and improvements in data collection.", "lang": "en"}
