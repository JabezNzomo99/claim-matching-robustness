Bernie Sanders honeymooned in the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War.\n\nThis trip was not a \"honeymoon\" in the traditional sense and did not occur during the \"height of the cold war.\" The purpose of this trip was to establish a sister city in Russia, not for the newlyweds to enjoy a romantic getaway. Bernie and Jane Sanders took their real honeymoon in St. Lucia in the Caribbean the following year.\n\nJane Sanders and then-Mayor Bernie Sanders traveled to the Soviet Union shortly after their wedding as part of a government trip to establish a sister-city relationship between Burlington, Vermont, and Yaroslavl. Sanders has previously joked that this trip was a \"strange honeymoon.\"\n\nIn February 2020, news reports broke that Russia was once again working to meddle in the United States presidential election. These reports renewed concerns about U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s connections to Russia, but also about alleged ties of his Democratic opponents, chiefly U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nCritics of Sanders were quick to claim that he had \u201choneymooned\u201d in the Soviet Union, implying that the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate may have some sort of nefarious ties to, or at the very least a soft spot for, Russia.\n\nFormer Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, for instance, posted on Twitter:\n\nLikewise, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani claimed that Sanders \u201cliked Communism so much\u201d that he \u201choneymooned\u201d in the Soviet Union:\n\nFox News anchor Sean Hannity went so far as to claim that Sanders honeymooned in the Soviet Union during the \u201cheight of the Cold War.\u201d\n\nA bit of truth exists to this claim. Sanders did travel to the Soviet Union shortly after his wedding in 1988, and Sanders himself has described this trip as a \u201cvery strange honeymoon.\u201d However, a romantic getaway was not the main focus of this trip. Sanders, who was the mayor of Burlington, Vermont, at the time, took a 12-person delegation of city representatives and officials, including his new wife Jane Sanders, the director of the Mayor\u2019s Youth Office, on a trip to the Soviet Union to establish a sister city relationship with Yaroslavl.\n\nFurthermore, this trip occurred in June 1988. This was not the \u201cheight of the Cold War,\u201d as Hannity claimed. This trip occurred during the final years of the Cold War (which ended roughly in 1991) while tensions were de-escalating.\n\nSanders explained the purpose of this trip in a November 1987 news article published in the Burlington Free Press:\n\n\u201cThe concept of the sister-city program is very simple but very profound,\u201d Sanders said at a news conference. \u201cThe Goal is that by encouraging citizen-to-citizen exchange \u2026 we can break down the barriers and stereotypes which exist between the Soviet Union and the United States.\u201d The mayor acknowledged that the idea may draw some opposition, but said he hoped that most people in Burlington would support the concept, regardless of their political affiliation. \u201cUltimately in my view, peace is going to come about when human beings start talking to human beings and this is a part of that process.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn May 31, 1988, a few days after Sanders\u2019 wedding and the day the Burlington delegation was set to leave for the Soviet Union, The Associated Press reported that this trip wasn\u2019t exactly a honeymoon:\n\nCritics of Sanders were not the first to claim that the Democratic presidential candidate had \u201choneymooned\u201d in Russia. In fact, Sanders himself described this trip as a \u201cromantic honeymoon\u201d in his 2015 book \u201cOutsider in the White House.\u201d However, this appears to be a bit of a tongue-in-cheek reference as he describes the trip a few sentences later as a \u201cvery strange honeymoon.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Sanders\u2019 campaign told us that the senator has \u201cjoked for years,\u201d including in the above-quoted passage, that this trip was a \u201cstrange honeymoon.\u201d Furthermore, the spokesperson told us that this trip was pre-scheduled before Sanders\u2019 marriage proposal, and that the wedding date was set to \u201ccoincide with that trip because they didn\u2019t want to take more time off.\u201d\n\nBernie and Jane Sanders took their real honeymoon the following year in St. Lucia in the Caribbean. The New York Times reported in December 2015 (emphasis ours):\n\nThe couple married in 1988, squeezing their wedding in before a trip to Yaroslavl, in the Soviet Union, Burlington\u2019s sister city. The trip \u2014 which the couple jokingly referred to as a honeymoon \u2014 has become something of a punch line for Republican candidates who accuse Mr. Sanders of Bolshevism. Ms. Sanders has also seemed to have fun with the idea. In August 1988, she jokingly responded to an inquiry to her office about Russian-language courses, beginning \u201cDear Fellow Traveler.\u201d The couple had a more traditional honeymoon a year later, in St. Lucia in the Caribbean.\n\nIt should also be noted that the suggestion for Yarsovl to become Burlington\u2019s sister city did not originate with Sanders. An April 1988 article from the Burlington Free Press reported that Robert Daniels, a University of Vermont history professor, suggested Yaroslavl to be Burlington\u2019s sister city, noting that the two cities share similar \u201cforest and dairy\u201d environments, and that Yaroslavl\u2019s university was comparable to the University of Vermont.\n\u2022 Bernie and Jane Sanders were married on May 31, 1988.\n\u2022 A few days later, Bernie Sanders led a 12-person delegation (which included Jane Sanders) to the Soviet Union to establish a sister city relationship between Burlington, Vermont, and Yaroslav, Russia.\n\u2022 Bernie Sanders has joked about this trip being a \u201cstrange honeymoon.\u201d\n\u2022 Bernie and Jane Sanders took their real honeymoon the following year in St. Lucia.\n\nA spokesperson for Sanders told us: \u201cSt Lucia was the real honeymoon, Yaroslav was a pre-scheduled trip the day after they were married. It was a fun joke to call it a honeymoon, but not a real one.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
