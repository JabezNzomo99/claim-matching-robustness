No, that's not true: the story was made up by a site that makes a living by inventing tales of bizarre crimes and sex acts so people would visit the site and click on their ads. The story is not real, it did not actually happen.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on June 19, 2018 titled \"Sweden: 6-year-old migrant was in fact 35-year-old midget from Syria\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nStockholm | Swedish authorities have identified a 35-year-old former ISIS soldier that had been masquerading as a 6-year-old boy for over a year.\n\nKhalid Ali Razzaz's identity was finally revealed after school officials at Eriksdalsskolan Elementary School became suspicious of the man's indecent sexual behavior with school personnel. Razzaz apparently touched a number of women teachers in an \"inappropriate manner\" according to the school administration, as well as displayed \"highly sexualized behavior\" in front of other classmates.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail and may have mistaken it for real news:\n\nThe tiny terrorist is real enough though:\n\nBut the website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories. The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Museum Employee NOT Arrested For Sexually Assaulting Wax Sculpture of Donald Trump\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Man Claiming To Be The Real Prince Harry Found Dead In Irish Hotel\n\u2022 Fake News: Couple NOT Stuck Together For 16 Hours After Mistaking Super Glue For Lubricant\n\u2022 Fake News: Black Lives Matter Leader NOT Exposed As White Man Using Tanning Injections\n\u2022 Fake News: Florida Man Did NOT Drop Down Pants, Did NOT Sodomize Pink Flamingo To Death", "lang": "en"}
