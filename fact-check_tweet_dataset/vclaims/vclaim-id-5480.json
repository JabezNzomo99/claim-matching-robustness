We found that the attack is pretty close to the mark, though somewhat overstated.\n\nClinton\u2019s barb stemmed from an interview Trump did with Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier on May 6, 2016.\n\nAt one point in the interview -- around the 16:40 mark here -- Baier asked Trump about whether he had ever met Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, which is an issue Trump had been coy about in previous interviews. Trump told Baier that once again he would have no comment on the question, in order to protect Putin\u2019s confidences.\n\nTrump went on to say, however, \"I know Russia well. I had a major event in Russia two or three years ago, Miss Universe contest, which was a big, big, incredible event. An incredible success.\" (Trump sold the pageant in 2015.)\n\nWe won\u2019t gauge whether experience putting on a beauty pageant can give someone important foreign-policy insights -- something Clinton was clearly skeptical of during her speech. But it is true that Trump mounted the event in Russia in 2013. (As Politico\u2019s Michael Crowley reported, Trump \"watched 86 contestants don shimmering evening gowns and skimpy swimsuits for what he would call \u2018the world\u2019s biggest and most iconic beauty contest.\u2019 \")\n\nSo Clinton certainly has a point that Trump referenced his leadership of the Miss Universe pageant as a credential, and we didn\u2019t notice any subsequent efforts by Trump to backtrack on what he said.\n\nHowever, Clinton overstated the case modestly when she accused Trump of claiming the pageant as \"foreign policy experience.\"\n\nTrump definitely cited his pageant experience as evidence that he could work with Russia and Putin -- but the discussion with Baier never broadened out to foreign policy generally. Later in the exchange, for instance, he said that \"they (Russia) want to be friendly with the United States ... (but) they really dislike Obama.\"\n\nSo Trump didn\u2019t say that the pageant helped him understand foreign policy overall. But he did say that it would help him get along with Russia.\n\nClinton said that Trump \"says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia.\" Trump did cite that as evidence of how he could navigate a relationship with Russia and work with its president, Putin, but he didn\u2019t go so far as to say it bolstered his foreign policy experience more generally.
