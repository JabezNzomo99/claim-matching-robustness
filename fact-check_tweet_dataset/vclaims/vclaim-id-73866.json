The artist confirmed it is not based on a real mountain.\n\nThe image shows what appears to be a mountain top with a pattern of snow and rock that resembles a sleeping woman. The text accompanying the image identifies the mountain as \u201cSleeping Lady Mountain In Alaska, About 33 Miles Northwest Of Anchorage.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you believe this is a picture from a high altitude plane over some mountains?\u201d text above the picture reads. \u201cWhat do you see hidden in plain sight!\u201d\n\nThe caption seems to be referencing Alaska\u2019s Mount Susitna, located about 33 miles from Anchorage and sometimes nicknamed as \u201cSleeping Lady.\u201d When looking across Cook Inlet, the silhouette of the mountains appears to make the form of a sleeping woman, according to Science Daily.\n\nBut the image is not, in fact, a photo taken from a plane of that Alaskan mountain formation. A search for images of Mount Susitna on Getty Images and ShutterStock turned up no results of the Facebook image. Rather, the picture is a piece of artwork created by artist Jean-Michel Bihorel.\n\nThe piece, titled \u201cWinter Sleep,\u201d can be found in Bihorel\u2019s online portfolio. Bihorel confirmed to Check Your Fact via Facebook Messenger that the piece is \u201cfull 3d digital artwork.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t even inspired by any real mountain,\u201d Bihorel said. \u201cIt is a full 3d digital artwork. Not a photo manipulation.\u201d (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show A Russian River Frozen Like The \u2018Scream\u2019 Mask)\n\nThe legend behind the \u201cSleeping Lady\u201d nickname for the Mount Susitna formation details how a woman fell asleep while waiting for her fianc\u00e9 to return home from war, according to Alaska.org. While some sources describe the story as being derived from native lore, the Anchorage Chronicle and others suggest it is of more modern origin, The Sun reported.", "lang": "en"}
