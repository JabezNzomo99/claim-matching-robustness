The photo actually shows him praying before a 2011 Denver Broncos football game.\n\nTebow, a former NFL player and current minor league baseball player, has publicly demonstrated his Christian beliefs on numerous occasions, from genuflecting on the football field to painting bible verses into his eye black. In 2010, he appeared alongside his mother in a Super Bowl advertisement for Focus on the Family, an anti-abortion Christian organization.\n\nThe Facebook post, which features Tebow in his signature kneeling pose, uses the image to suggest that his alleged 2012 protest against abortion was received differently than former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s protests against racism. In late August 2016, Kaepernick refused to stand for the pre-game playing of the national anthem in protest of racism.\n\n\u201cHe was praised by fans for being a \u2018model American,\u2019 then was given 3 new NFL contracts in addition to a Major League Baseball contract,\u201d reads the caption. \u201cUnlike Colin Kaepernick, who CLEARLY stated that his protest has nothing to do with the flag or military, Time (sic) Tebow specifically said he couldn\u2019t stand for a flag that allowed for abortion. If you can\u2019t see the hypocrisy in this then chances are you are part of the problem.\u201d\n\nThe accompanying image does not, however, show Tebow kneeling during the national anthem. Taken by Associated Press photographer Julie Jacobson, the photo actually depicts him praying before a Denver Broncos football game against the Chicago Bears in December 2011, per its caption. Tebow is widely known for kneeling in prayer before, during and after football games.\n\nThe Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any credible media reports of Tebow ever kneeling during the national anthem to protest abortion or any other social issue, further adding to the post\u2019s dubiousness. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show Former NFL Players Joe Namath And Al Woodall Kneeling During The National Anthem)\n\nIn June 2018, Tebow responded to a similar viral social media post in an interview with USA Today, saying, \u201cI think that\u2019s sometimes one of the things that\u2019s a little bit sad is sometimes people will just try to create something that had zero truth. I never did anything during a national anthem but stand and support my country.\u201d\n\nHis statement came after rapper T.I. reposted an image with the same claim on Instagram, according to the Washington Times.", "lang": "en"}
