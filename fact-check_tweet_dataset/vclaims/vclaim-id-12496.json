Soon after, both Pakistani and Indian social media ecosystems were brimming with photographs that claimed to depict an overwhelmed mother of the officer.\n\nA few social media users also shared the images with the narrative that they depicted wing commander Abhinandan\u2019s mother praising PM Imran Khan for releasing her son.\n\nAlt News found that the photographs were first shared by a Facebook user Yasmeen Arora Munshi using the caption, \u201cA MOTHER of INDIAN pilot ABHINANDAN begging to IMRAN_KHAN for the release of his SON THANKS IMRAN KHAN.\u201d Her post received more than 5,300 shares at the time of writing this article.\n\nThe claim is viral on both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nAlt News reverse-searched the images and traced them back to October 4, 2018, when they were tweeted by a user Namrah Khan.\n\nWe also compared the old woman\u2019s photograph with the images of wing commander Abhinandan\u2019s mother available on the internet. The pictures don\u2019t match.\n\nRecently, Alt News debunked another piece of misinformation related to the officer\u2019s family. A video was made viral with the false claim that wing commander Abhinandan\u2019s wife was requesting the BJP to not politicise soldiers\u2019 sacrifices.", "lang": "en"}
