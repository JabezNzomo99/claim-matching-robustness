However, we were able verify the mistake on this map by viewing a third-party copy of the episode uploaded to YouTube. While that video has been removed due to copyright-infringement issues, we managed to capture the few seconds that this mislabeled map appeared on CNN:\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to \u201cEarly Start\u201d for a comment on the mistake and will update this article if more information becomes available.\n\nSome viewers may have been skeptical of this image for a few reasons. For one, viewers might have doubted that a major news network could make such a mistake. Also this image was circulated on the heels of another mistake involving the state of Alabama. U.S. President Donald Trump erroneously claimed that Alabama was in Hurricane Dorian\u2019s path, a statement that was quickly refuted by the National Weather Service:\n\nCNN was one of the news outlets that criticized Trump for incorrectly saying that Alabama was in danger of being hit by Hurricane Dorian.", "lang": "en"}
