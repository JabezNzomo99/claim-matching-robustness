Serious bias,\" Trump said in a Nov. 27 tweet.\n\nIt was the last in a series of 13 tweets in which Trump, without evidence, claimed \"millions of people\" across the nation voted illegally on Nov. 8, robbing him of a plurality of popular votes - even though he won the crucial majority of Electoral College votes. The latest returns show Democrat Hillary Clinton drew about 2.3 million more popular votes than Trump, a Republican.\n\nOur colleagues at PolitiFact National looked into Trump\u2019s claim that millions voted illegally and rated it Pants on Fire. We investigated Trump\u2019s claim about Virginia, to see whether \"serious voter fraud\" occurred in the state.\n\nClinton won Virginia, garnering 1.98 million votes compared with Trump\u2019s 1.77 million, according to tallies posted by the Virginia Department of Elections. In other words, she got about 210,000 more votes than Trump.\n\nWe emailed Trump\u2019s campaign and his transition team to learn the basis of his fraud claim but did not get a response.\n\nAs news of Trump\u2019s comments swirled, the Virginia Department of Elections issued a prepared statement from Commissioner Edgardo Cortes batting down the president-elect\u2019s statement.\n\n\"The claims of voter fraud in Virginia during the November 8 election are unfounded,\" Cortes said. \"Virginia's election was well administered by our 133 professional local registrars, with help from hundreds of election officials and volunteers who worked to guarantee a good experience for eligible Virginia voters. The election was fair and all votes cast by eligible voters were accurately counted.\"\n\nMartin Mash, a policy adviser for the Department of Elections, told us in an email that the department has not received any specific allegations of vote fraud during the Nov. 8 election. Vote-fraud allegations would be forwarded to law-enforcement officials, he said. Michael Kelly, a spokesman for Democratic Attorney General Mark Herring, said in an email that his office has not received any reports of illegal voting in this election.\n\nWe contacted John Fredericks, who was chairman of Trump\u2019s Virginia campaign. He said on Election Day that officials from from Trump\u2019s campaign and the state GOP set up a call center in Richmond to take reports of voting irregularities. Although the center received hundreds of calls, nothing caused great concern, he said.\n\nFredericks told us he is not aware of any \"massive voter fraud on Election Day\" beyond \"many isolated incidents\" of people voting without having proper identification who wanted provisional ballots.\n\nFredericks added that flaws in the state\u2019s election system allow avenues for illegitimate ballots and that there are \"real examples of real potential voter fraud or the groundwork for voting fraud being laid.\"\n\nFor example, Fredericks pointed to a well-publicized case from Harrisonburg where 18 to 20 people who died ended up on voter rolls. The FBI is probing that case of potential voter fraud. But it should be noted that that this irregularity was discovered in September - well in advance of Election Day.\n\nAnother case being prosecuted in Alexandria involves what appears to be a relatively small number of fake voter registration applications, and it was also found before Election Day, the Richmond Times-Dispatch noted in an article this week.\n\nWe also emailed the Republican Party of Virginia for its take on Trump\u2019s \"serious voter fraud\" claim. GOP Chairman John Whitbeck said state Republicans are deferring to the incoming White House administration for a response to Trump\u2019s claim.\n\nA final note: Our colleagues at PolitiFact New Hampshire and PolitiFact California also gave Pants on Fire ratings to Trump\u2019s claim of serious voter fraud in those states.\n\nTrump said there was \"serious voter fraud in Virginia\" during this presidential election.\n\nThe top state election official in Virginia says the charge is \"unfounded.\" The former chairman of Trump\u2019s Virginia campaign says he\u2019s unaware of any \"massive voter fraud on Election Day.\"\n\nThere\u2019s a burden on Trump to prove his sensational claim, and the president-elect offers no evidence. We rate his statement Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
