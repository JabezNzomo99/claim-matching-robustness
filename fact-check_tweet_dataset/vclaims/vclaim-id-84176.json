The claim is misleading; the video has been doctored from other reports in which there was no mention of any move to name the minister in an ongoing corruption probe.\n\nThe misleading video was shared on YouTube here on March 26, 2019, and has been viewed more than 200,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the video:\n\nThe Indonesian language caption translates to English as: \u201cSomeone is panicking!!!! The KPK will soon name Puan Maharani as a suspect of e-ID corruption suspect\u201d.\n\n\u201cKPK\u201d refers to Indonesia\u2019s Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK). This is its official Facebook page.\n\nPuan Maharani is an Indonesian minister. She has served in President Joko Widodo\u2019s cabinet as Coordinating Human Development and Culture Minister since 2014. She was listed as the 26th minister in the Working Cabinet in this government press release on October 29, 2014.\n\nThis is her official Instagram account, and this is her photo shared on the official Twitter account of her ministry.\n\n\u201cSuspect of e-ID corruption\u201d is a reference to the KPK\u2019s investigation of alleged corruption related to an Indonesian electronic identity card project. This is a Jakarta Post report published on April 24, 2018, about the case.\n\nKeyword searches about Puan Maharani found that the footage of her in the misleading video was taken from this clip posted by Indonesian news site Tribunnews on March 25, 2018.\n\nBelow is the genuine Tribunnews video:\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading video (L) next to a screenshot of the Tribunnews video (R):\n\nThe comparison shows that in the misleading video, the Tribunnews logo on the top right corner of the screen has been cropped and removed, and the words \u201cLIVE JAKARTA\u201d and \u201cUPIL NEWS\u201d have been added, above the misleading caption claiming the minister will be named a corruption suspect.\n\nThe misleading footage was uploaded on a YouTube account called Upil Gajah, which claims to provide \u201cPOPULAR NEWS\u201d but does not list any links to any mainstream Indonesian media groups on their profile, which can be seen here.\n\nThe original Tribunnews video shows her denying claims that she was involved in corruption.\n\nTranslated into English, the video title reads: \u201cDenial of Puan Maharani for Setya Novanto's Faithful Statement Regarding Case E KTP\u201d.\n\nThe Tribunnews video does not mention any plan by the KPK to name her a corruption suspect.\n\nA reporter in AFP\u2019s Jakarta bureau analysed the Indonesian-language audio in the misleading video and found it did not include a reference to KPK\u2019s plans to name her a corruption suspect.\n\nThe first few sentences that can be heard in the misleading video translate into English as: \u201cThe Coordinating Human Development and Culture Minister, Puan Maharani, disputed her involvement in the electronic ID card case. This daughter of Indonesian fifth president Megawati Soekarnoputri said about it in her office on Jalan Merdeka Barat in Central Jakarta on Friday.\u201d\n\nAFP searched the first sentences from the video on Google and found they came from this Tribunnews published on March 23, 2018.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Tribun news article:\n\nThe headline, translated to English, reads: \u201cIndonesian Democratic Party-Struggle politician Puan Maharani claims she did not receive electronic identity card money.\u201d\n\nThe news article does not include any mention of a KPK plan to name her a corruption suspect.\n\nKPK chairman Agus Rahardjo told AFP by phone that the claims in the YouTube video were false. \u201cIt is a hoax,\u201d he said.", "lang": "en"}
