The original video was recorded in the year 2015, where Denzil Keelor talked about the wars of 1962 and 1965.\n\nThe archived version of the tweet can be seen here.\n\nAsif Ghafoor tweeted the video with the caption: \"Admission of Indian failure and losses on 27 February 2019 by a well-decorated Indian Air Force veteran Air Marshal Denzil Keelor. #Surprise\"\n\nHis tweet attracted more than 3,000 retweets. The video has gone viral on Facebook as well.\n\nOn reverse search one of the keyframes from the viral video, we found the long version of the same video on YouTube. It was posted on August 9, 2015, by a verified channel \"WildFilmsIndia\" with the title \"Nehru lost India the war: Air Marshal Denzil Keelor speaks about India's battle losses\".\n\nAccording to the long description with the video, this interview was the part of a planned series by the production house on the 1962 and 1965 wars that India fought. Wilderness Films India invited retired Air Marshal Denzil Keelor to the show.\n\nIndia Today's anchor/Editor Shiv Aroor pointed out the fake claim of Asif Ghafoor on Twitter.\n\nAsif Ghafoor later put a clarification on Twitter by accepting that the video was doctored.\n\n\n\n It is clear that the viral video is around four-years-old, where Denzil Keelor talked about the wars India fought in 1962 and 1965.", "lang": "en"}
