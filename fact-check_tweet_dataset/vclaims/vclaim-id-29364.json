The Cypriot foreign minister said it was Russian-made missile, launched by Syria against an air strike. Photos posted to social media indicated it was an S-200 surface-to-air missile, which has been supplied to the Syrian Arab Army. Multiple reports indicate Syria was responding to an alleged Israeli air raid.\n\nThe Russian state news agency RIA Novosti referred to the missile as an \u201cunidentified object,\u201d but later acknowledged that it was a missile, citing Turkish journalist H\u00fcseyin Ekmek\u00e7i, who initially misidentified the missile as an S-125, an earlier model of Soviet-made surface-to-air missile (Ekmek\u00e7i later posted an update correctly identifying it as an S-200). RIA Novosti, however, at the time of this publication, did not correct or update its headline but continued referring to the missile as an \u201cunidentified object.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time Syrian air-defense has had problems with their S-200 system. Last September, an S-200 accidentally downed a Russian reconnaissance plane, also around the time of an Israeli air raid. The accident was believed to have been a result of human error \u2013 failure to properly identify the target before launching the missile.", "lang": "en"}
