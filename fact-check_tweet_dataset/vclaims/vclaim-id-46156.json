One posting to the Public Freakout section of Reddit, which racked up 75,000 upvotes in less than 24 hours, was entitled: \u201cSince people were not taking the police seriously the Kenyan government started using the Maasai tribe for the curfew.\u201d\n\nThis video is miscaptioned. The Kenyan government did not employ members of the Maasai tribe to whip people who failed to self-quarantine. This video actually comes from a Kenyan comedian and was created for entertainment purposes.\n\nThe video was first uploaded to the Mbuzi Seller YouTube account on April 2, 2020. Although Mbuzi Seller didn\u2019t provide too much information about the video, it was tagged with words such as \u201ccomedy\u201d and \u201centertainment.\u201d\n\nWhile the person in this video is not a member of the Maasai tribe who was employed by the Kenyan government to whip people who disobeyed self-quarantining orders, the video was taken in Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic and shows a person who is encouraging (in their own weird way) social distancing.\n\nMbuzi Seller responded to a number of comments below this video. In one message, they wrote that the coronavirus was \u201cno joke.\u201d In another, they explained that people should practice social distancing and stay 1 meter away from one another.\n\nWhile this video was created by a YouTuber and does not show a deputized government official in action, the government in Kenya has reportedly used violent tactics to enforce its stay-at-home orders.\n\nKenya\u2019s dusk-to-dawn curfew was intended to encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Instead, security forces unleashed beatings and tear gas, injuring dozens of people, potentially exposing many more to the virus and damaging public trust in the government\u2019s strategy to contain the outbreak. In cities across Kenya, policemen and other uniformed officers used their boots and batons in a brutal crackdown \u2014 with some incidents caught on video \u2014 seemingly carried out to drive home the seriousness of the curfew measure that took effect Friday.", "lang": "en"}
