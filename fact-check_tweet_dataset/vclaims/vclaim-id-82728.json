I was on text-based discussion groups talking about urban legends. So when the Web came along, I started writing up a collection of Disney-related legends and other categories. Since that was the days before search engines, I was an early adopter. It took a left turn and became the place where everybody started sending stuff to find out, things they were getting in their e-mail, [asking] is this true or not. So it spread to hoaxes and scams and missing kids and fake photos. It took a surprisingly long time, but eventually, politics became a thing. We were doing this in \u201994, \u201995. And it wasn\u2019t until the 2000 election when I saw the first political pieces come out that lent themselves to debunking.\n\nA: Everything goes into the mixture. We don\u2019t write about it just because one person asked about it in an e-mail. We\u2019re also wary about astroturfing by fake news sites. A lot of them [the websites] are disgruntled, because Facebook was using us as a metric to determine who not to give much organic reach to. We didn\u2019t have anything to do with it. We didn\u2019t cooperate with them. But they were using us as a measuring stick to limit the reach of fake news and they [the websites] got all cranky with us. So I think sometimes, some of them are sending fake inquiries to us to try to get us to write about their articles.\n\nA: Pretty much. I don\u2019t know where all these people who write to us are, because I never encounter them in real life. All the people I know socially, don\u2019t talk about politics, and certainly not vociferously. So I don\u2019t know where the audience actually is. Other than writing about politics, I don\u2019t have any involvement with it. I haven\u2019t worked on any campaigns, I haven\u2019t put any signs or bumper stickers out. My registration tends to differ. Being in California, by the time we have our primary, it\u2019s usually moot because both parties pick their candidates. So I tended to shift my voter registration: Is there actually any election I\u2019m going to be able to have a say in, even if it\u2019s not the candidate I prefer?\n\nA: Well, the political conversation is messy overall. I\u2019m sure, like a lot of people here [at the summit], you often get a sense of despair like nobody\u2019s paying any attention to what you\u2019re actually writing. They\u2019re just determined to believe what they want to believe. Or, you write this long expository article and they focus on some minor aspect of it, completely outside of the thrust of what you\u2019ve written, to claim it\u2019s wrong or it should be disregarded. So, I have to say, I don\u2019t have much faith that it does any good. But I\u2019m not the one sitting there trying to measure it, like others are. I\u2019m just going by the reader reaction.\n\nA: In the aspect that he can keep saying things that aren\u2019t true and it doesn\u2019t hurt him? Well, I wonder if it\u2019s not in some way related to what we do. There are people who say, \u201cOh, there are fact-checkers out there, and you\u2019re supposed to take their word for it because they say so. Well, these people say so, and they\u2019re not backing down, and there are people who claim they\u2019re wrong.\u201d So they see it as the same thing [as Trump\u2019s actions]. \u2026 In a sense, it\u2019s like if you\u2019re in a bar, and you see some guy stand up and slug somebody in the face, [you think] \u201cOh my gosh, that guy hit him.\u201d But if you come into a bar and you see two guys already fighting, you just assume they\u2019re equally culpable.\n\nA: Well, it just makes sense. They generally speak to something that people already believe, or confirm something they want to believe. That\u2019s kind of what people cling to. For a lot of them \u2026 if you present something authoritatively enough, [they\u2019ll believe it]. We tried that years and years ago at the beginning [when] everybody started sending us stuff to find out if something is true. So we thought, \u201cOK, they\u2019re telling us this, but how do they know [if our answer is true]?\u201d\n\nSo I made up an article about Mister Ed, that he\u2019s a zebra, not a horse. I put in all these convoluted reasons \u2014 because the show is in black-and-white, viewers couldn\u2019t tell the difference, and all these technical explanation of how television worked and how zebras were easier to train than horses. And one day, sometime later, I was standing in line at a grocery store and I was looking at the tabloids. One of them [the National Enquirer] had this headline: Shocking truth revealed, Mister Ed was a zebra. They\u2019d gone and interviewed Alan Young [who played Wilbur Post in the television show] to find out whether this was true or not. So there\u2019s a lot of market for, you just say something authoritatively and people will believe it. A lot of memes bank on that. It\u2019s full of numbers or stats, [and people think], \u201cHow can you dispute this?\u201d Since they\u2019re anonymous, too, it lends to it. You can\u2019t disclaim it as being obviously the product of whomever or whatever.\n\nA: The one that I ended up spending the most time on was a long-standing Hollywood rumor that Clark Gable was once driving drunk and hit and killed a pedestrian, and MGM covered it up and sent someone else to prison in his place. Since this was pre-online databases, I spent a lot of time in the early years at the UCLA [University of California at Los Angeles] research library going through microfilm of old magazines. I had to make several trips to go through old issues of Variety, to find out where Clark Gable was when. I found out it supposedly happened on two different dates that were widely separated by several years. I eventually dug up the same story being told about someone completely different \u2014 John Huston\u2019s son. The very same story was told about him. But that was a lot of time and footwork, in the days before you can just sit at home and do it.", "lang": "en"}
