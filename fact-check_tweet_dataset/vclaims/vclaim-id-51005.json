Ilhan Omar \u201cthreatened\u201d to send shawarma to Republican members of Congress to \u201cgive them a taste of her culture.\u201d\n\n\u201cShare to say arrest her now!\u201d reads part of the caption.\n\nThe Daily Caller found no evidence Omar ever made such a threat to her Republican colleagues.\n\nSocial media websites are replete with misinformation about politicians. In this case, the meme makes a dubious claim about Omar, one of three Muslims now serving in Congress. An iteration of this particular claim has been shared on Facebook more than 146,000 times.\n\n\u201cMusslamic (sic) Democrat, Ilhan Omar, has threatened members of Congress,\u201d claims the post. \u201cShe\u2019s told several Republicans that she\u2019ll send them \u2018shawarma\u2019 to \u2018give them a taste of her culture.'\u201d (RELATED: Did Ilhan Omar Vote Against Making Female Genital Mutilation A Felony?)\n\nHowever, the Caller didn\u2019t find any media reports of Omar threatening to send her Republican colleagues shawarma, a popular Middle Eastern dish containing meat shaved off a vertical rotisserie. Neither her social media accounts nor ProPublica\u2019s archive of her deleted tweets have any mentions of the dish either.\n\nThe claim likely originated as a piece of satire. America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, a widely known satirical content producer, and other parody news pages have shared the meme on Facebook in recent months. Bustatroll.org has also previously included shawarma in satirical articles about Omar.\n\nOmar\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.", "lang": "en"}
