John Lewis that \u201crooms full of people\u201d are dangerous as part of an argument for mail-in voting.\n\nWhile Obama did briefly mention mail-in voting and how it would be a facet of the 2020 election during his eulogy, he never referenced \u201crooms full of people\u201d being unsafe as part of an argument for mail-in voting.\n\nObama, as well as two other former presidents and many prominent politicians, attended the July 30 funeral service in Atlanta for Lewis. During the funeral, he delivered a eulogy for the civil rights icon.\n\nMultiple Facebook posts claim that during his eulogy, Obama \u201ctold a room full of people, that rooms full of people is (sic) too dangerous so we must mail in vote,\u201d with some directly attributing the words \u201crooms packed full of people\u201d to the former president. But the alleged comments do not appear in a transcript of the eulogy.\n\nObama only briefly mentioned mail-in voting, the transcript from The New York Times shows. He did not explicitly mention the new coronavirus or the pandemic during his eulogy, nor did he state that \u201crooms full of people\u201d are unsafe so people \u201cmust\u201d vote by mail.\n\n\u201cWe may no longer have to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar in order to cast a ballot,\u201d he said. \u201cBut even as we sit here, there are those in power who are doing their darnedest to discourage people from voting \u2013 by closing polling locations, and targeting minorities and students with restrictive ID laws, and attacking our voting rights with surgical precision, even undermining the Postal Service in the run-up to an election that is going to be dependent on mailed-in ballots so people don\u2019t get sick.\u201d\n\nObama went on to advocate for expanded voting rights, including a suggestion of \u201cadding polling places,\u201d according to the transcript.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released guidance for polling places, including disinfecting surfaces frequently touched by multiple people and modifying the layout of polling stations to maintain social distancing.\n\nThe mischaracterization of Obama\u2019s eulogy appears to have started circulating on social media the same day as the funeral.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
