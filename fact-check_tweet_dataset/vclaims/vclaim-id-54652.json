A spokesperson for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) confirmed he is not the author.\n\nFauci, the NIAID director, has become a popular target for misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThis particular Facebook post attributes to Fauci a viral essay about COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. It attempts to compare research about the coronavirus to what scientists know about other viruses such as chickenpox and HIV, as well as criticize people for not taking precautions against COVID-19.\n\n\u201cHow dare you risk the lives of others so cavalierly,\u201d Fauci is quoted as writing. \u201cHow dare you decide for others that they should welcome exposure as \u2018getting it over with\u2019 when literally no one knows who will be the lucky \u2018mild symptoms\u2019 case, and who may fall ill and die.\u201d\n\nThe post concludes with Fauci allegedly writing, \u201cI reject the notion that it\u2019s \u2018just a virus\u2019 and we\u2019ll all get it eventually. What a careless, heartless stance.\u201d (RELATED: Did Dr. Anthony Fauci Say All Americans Should Be Microchipped?)\n\nHowever, the viral essay is misattributed. There is no record of Fauci ever publishing the essay. While the Wisconsin Gazette did attribute the words to Fauci, it does not provide sourcing, and no other news outlet appears to have done so.\n\n\u201cI can confirm Dr. Fauci did not write this essay,\u201d NIAID spokesperson Laura Leifman told the Daily Caller in an email.\n\nThe essay appears to have originated with Amy Wright, a resident of Asheville, North Carolina. She confirmed to the fact-checking website Snopes that she originally authored the essay in a June 14 post and later made minor edits to the message and grammar.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very unfortunate that anyone would have tried to attribute this to Dr. Fauci,\u201d she told Snopes. \u201cThe only possible outcome of doing so would be to reduce one\u2019s credibility. It\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
