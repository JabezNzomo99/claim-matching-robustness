She has said \u201cmy predecessors did the same thing,\u201d and insisted she \u201cfully complied with every rule\u201d in preserving her work emails.\n\nWe have taken issue with those claims, and now so does the State Department Office of Inspector General, which issued a report on May 26 that contradicts several of Clinton\u2019s claims about her emails:\n\u2022 The IG report cited department policies dating to 2005 that require \u201cnormal day-to-day operations\u201d to be conducted on government servers, contrary to Clinton\u2019s claim that her server was allowed. It also said she \u201chad an obligation\u201d to discuss her email system with cybersecurity officials, but there\u2019s \u201cno evidence\u201d that she sought or received their approval.\n\u2022 The IG report said Clinton should have turned over her emails before she left office \u2014 not 21 months after she left. \u201c[S]he did not comply with the Department\u2019s policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act,\u201d the report said.\n\u2022 Clinton has said her emails \u201cwere captured and preserved immediately on the system at the State Department\u201d because she emailed department officials at their government accounts. The IG report said that is \u201cnot an appropriate method of preserving any such emails that would constitute a Federal record.\u201d\n\nThe IG report also said the only other secretary of state to use personal email \u201cexclusively\u201d for government business was Colin Powell, contrary to Clinton\u2019s claim that her \u201cpredecessors\u201d \u2014 plural \u2014 \u201cdid the same thing.\u201d The IG also said that, like Clinton, Powell did not comply with policies on preserving work-related emails.\n\nBut the IG report said the comparison to Powell \u2014 who did not use a private server \u2014 only goes so far. It said during Clinton\u2019s tenure, the rules governing personal email and the use of nongovernment systems were \u201cconsiderably more detailed and more sophisticated,\u201d citing specific memos that warned department employees about the security risks of not using the government system.\n\n\u201cSecretary Clinton\u2019s cybersecurity practices accordingly must be evaluated in light of these more comprehensive directives,\u201d the report said.\n\nBrian Fallon, a Clinton campaign spokesman, told us that even though the IG report contradicts Clinton\u2019s past statements, that \u201cdoesn\u2019t make her statements untruthful.\u201d He said Clinton, who declined to be interviewed by the inspector general\u2019s staff, \u201cbelieved \u2014 past tense\u201d that her use of a private server was allowed, that it was no different than Powell using a commercial email account to conduct government business. She no longer believes that, he said, although she continues to say \u2014 as she did in an ABC News interview on May 26 after the IG report came out \u2014 that the use of personal email was allowed.\n\n\u201cIt did not occur to her that having it on a personal server could be so distinct that it would be unapproved,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cWe\u2019re not intending to say post the IG report that her server was allowed. We don\u2019t contest that. We\u2019re saying \u2026 the use of personal email was widespread.\u201d\n\nOn March 2, 2015, the New York Times reported that Clinton exclusively used a private email account to conduct government business while secretary of state from January 2009 to February 2013. The Associated Press followed with a report that Clinton\u2019s email account was hosted on a private server at her home in New York.\n\nThe disclosures triggered a series of actions, most importantly an FBI investigation into the handling of classified government material. The investigation is ongoing, and may or may not be completed before the Nov. 8 presidential election.\n\nSeparately, the State Department Office of Inspector General \u2014 which is headed by Steve A. Linick, an appointee of President Obama \u2014 conducted a review of the Office of the Secretary\u2019s \u201cemail records management and cybersecurity requirements\u201d since 1997, covering the tenures of five secretaries of state and their staffs. The result is a 79-page report that identified \u201csystemic weaknesses \u2026 that go well beyond the tenure of any one Secretary of State.\u201d It made eight recommendations to the department.\n\nFor our purposes, we reviewed the report in the context of statements that Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, has made about her unusual email arrangement since it was first disclosed more than a year ago.\n\nAs we have written before, Clinton has said her email arrangement was \u201callowed\u201d by her department and \u201cfully above board.\u201d Even after the report came out, Clinton continued to make this claim, saying in an ABC News interview on May 26 that \u201cit was allowed.\u201d\n\nThe IG report says that that was not the case.\n\nThe IG report said that it has been department policy since 2005 \u2014 four years before Clinton took office \u2014 that \u201cnormal day-to-day operations\u201d be conducted on government servers.\n\nThe report also said that in 2007 the department adopted additional policies requiring \u201cnon-Departmental information systems\u201d used to \u201cprocess or store department information\u201d to meet the same security controls as the department\u2019s systems, and requiring that they be registered with the department. Clinton did not adhere to either policy.\n\nState Department Inspector General, May 26: The Department\u2019s current policy, implemented in 2005, is that normal day-to-day operations should be conducted on an authorized Automated Information System (AIS), which \u201chas the proper level of security control to \u2026 ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the resident information.\u201d The FAM [Foreign Affairs Manual] defines an AIS as an assembly of hardware, software, and firmware used to electronically input, process, store, and/or output data. Examples include: mainframes, servers, desktop workstations, and mobile devices (such as laptops, e-readers, smartphones, and tablets). This policy comports with FISMA [Federal Information Security Management Act], which was enacted in December 2002 and requires Federal agencies to ensure information security for the systems that support the agency\u2019s operations and assets, including information security protections for information systems used by a contractor of an agency or other organization on behalf of an agency. FISMA defines information security as protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide for the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the information and systems. In 2006, as required by FISMA, NIST [National Institute of Standards and Technology] promulgated minimum security requirements that apply to all information within the Federal Government and to Federal information systems. Among these are requirements for certifying and accrediting information systems, retaining system audit records for monitoring purposes, conducting risk assessments, and ensuring the protection of communications. In 2007, the Department adopted additional policies to implement these requirements, including numerous provisions intended to ensure that non-Departmental information systems that process or store Department information maintain the same minimum security controls. Further, non-Departmental systems that are sponsored by the Department to process information on its behalf must be registered with the Department.\n\nThe IG report said Clinton \u201chad an obligation\u201d to discuss her email system with the department, but it could find \u201cno evidence\u201d that Clinton sought approval for her unusual email arrangement. If she did, the report says her request would have been denied by the bureaus of Diplomatic Security and Information Resource Management.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has cited a National Archives and Records Administration regulation adopted in 2009 as evidence that Clinton was allowed to send and receive work-related emails \u201cusing a system not operated by the agency,\u201d as the rule states. That\u2019s true, as far as it goes. The IG report says it found \u201cmany examples of staff using personal email accounts to conduct official business.\u201d But the report also made a distinction between occasional use and exclusive use of personal email.\n\nThe report said it found only three department employees in 19 years who \u201cused non-Departmental systems on an exclusive basis,\u201d and two of them were secretaries of state (Clinton and Powell). The other was Jonathan Scott Gration, a former ambassador to Kenya, who ignored instructions in July 2011 not to use commercial email for government businesses and resigned in mid-2012 when the department initiated disciplinary action against him.\n\nThe IG report cited the Gration report as an example of how the process should work. \u201c[T]he Department\u2019s response to his actions demonstrates how such usage is normally handled when Department cybersecurity officials become aware of it,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe 2009 NARA rule that the Clinton campaign cites does allow for the occasional use of personal email, as we just said, but it also requires that the department \u201censure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system.\u201d\n\nClinton has insisted that she complied with that records requirement, too, because she sent emails to department staffers who had government email addresses. At a March 10 press conference, when she first took questions about her unusual email arrangement, Clinton said \u201cthe vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses, which meant they were captured and preserved immediately on the system at the State Department.\u201d\n\nThe IG report said that is not the case. It said Clinton\u2019s method of preserving work-related emails was insufficient under the Federal Records Act.\n\nFallon, the Clinton spokesman, said \u201cwe agree in retrospect\u201d with the IG finding that \u201cher practice of copying aides on her emails did not end up producing a full record since State\u2019s IT systems didn\u2019t save everything. But that doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t take steps to comply.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur goal was to explain her state of mind at the time, because she was copying and sending\u201d emails to people within the State Department,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cShe believed that all those emails were captured,\u201d he said.\n\nOn multiple occasions, Clinton has said she was not alone in using personal email for government business. That is correct, but she distorts the facts when saying that what she did was the same as other secretaries of state, as she did in a CNN interview on July 7, 2015, in a March 9 debate, and again in the ABC interview on May 26 after the report came out.\n\nShe was wrong to say \u201cmy predecessors did the same thing,\u201d as we have pointed out before. The IG report confirms that among Clinton\u2019s predecessors only Powell used personal email for government business. Madeleine Albright did not use email at all, and Condoleezza Rice did not use personal email to conduct government business, the IG report says.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry, who followed Clinton, told the inspector general\u2019s office that he \u201cinfrequently\u201d used personal email for government business \u201cwhen responding to a sender who emailed him on his personal account.\u201d\n\nEven now Clinton twists the facts when she claims, as she did in the ABC News interview, that \u201cpersonal email use was the practice for other secretaries of state\u201d \u2014 meaning Powell and Kerry. It was the practice for Powell, but it was the exception for Kerry, so the plural use of \u201csecretaries\u201d is misleading \u2014 especially in light of the IG report.\n\nIn what reads like a direct rebuttal to Clinton\u2019s claim that other secretaries of state have done the same thing, the IG report notes that the department\u2019s policies on the use of personal email and nongovernment computer systems were \u201cconsiderably more detailed and more sophisticated\u201d during Clinton\u2019s tenure. It said she should be \u201cevaluated\u201d differently than her predecessors.\n\n\u201cBeginning in late 2005 and continuing through 2011, the Department revised the FAM [Foreign Affairs Manual] and issued various memoranda specifically discussing the obligation to use Department [computer] systems in most circumstances and identifying the risks of not doing so,\u201d the report says. \u201cSecretary Clinton\u2019s cybersecurity practices accordingly must be evaluated in light of these more comprehensive directives.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the policies we outlined from the mid-2000s, the report noted specific instances in which State Department officials acted to discourage the use of personal email for government business.\n\nFor example, on March 11, 2011, the assistant secretary for diplomatic security sent a memo to Clinton that said there has been \u201ca dramatic increase since January 2011 in attempts by [redacted] cyber actors to compromise the private home e-mail accounts of senior Department officials.\u201d That was followed by two high-level meetings in April and May 2011 on cybersecurity that were attended by \u201cthe Secretary\u2019s immediate staff.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was a cable that went out under Clinton\u2019s name that \u201crecommended best practices for Department users and their family members to follow, including \u2018avoid conducting official Department business from your personal e-mail accounts,\u2019\u201d the report said, quoting from Clinton\u2019s cable.\n\nThe report also addressed some other notable issues:\n\u2022 The department did not ask the four former secretaries of state, including Clinton, to sign separation agreements certifying that they had turned over all work-related documents. Clinton has been criticized by Republican strategist Karl Rove and others \u2014 for failing to sign the statement, but that was part of the department\u2019s \u201csystemic weaknesses\u201d and not unique to Clinton.\n\u2022 Two staffers in the Bureau of Information Resource Management expressed \u201ctheir concerns about Secretary Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email account in separate meetings\u201d with the bureau director. \u201cAccording to the staff member, the Director stated that the Secretary\u2019s personal system had been reviewed and approved by Department legal staff and that the matter was not to be discussed any further,\u201d the report said. But no legal review was done and no approval was granted.\n\u2022 Hackers attempted to access Clinton\u2019s server on Jan. 9, 2011, and a phishing email message was sent to Clinton on May 13, 2011, that contained a suspicious link. Both attempted breaches should have been reported. \u201cHowever, OIG found no evidence that the Secretary or her staff reported these incidents to computer security personnel or anyone else within the Department,\u201d the report said.\n\u2022 Clinton and seven of her former department staffers declined to be interviewed by the IG\u2019s office, as well as \u201can individual based in New York who provided technical support for Secretary Clinton\u2019s personal email system but who was never employed by the Department.\u201d\n\nClinton admits she made a mistake when she decided to use a personal email and server to conduct public business. But she has been less than forthright as she has tried to spin the facts in an attempt to minimize her admitted mistake.\n\nThe IG report makes it clear that occasional use of personal email for government business would have been acceptable as long as Clinton\u2019s emails were preserved by the department before she left office. But the department policies at the time prevented her or anyone else from using a personal account exclusively for government business \u2014 let alone a personal server, which should have been registered with the department but was not.\n\nUpdated, May 27: This article was revised to clarify Fallon\u2019s comments on the IG\u2019s finding that Clinton \u201cdid not comply with the Department\u2019s policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act.\u201d We added that Fallon said the Clinton campaign agrees with the IG finding that \u201cher practice of copying aides on her emails did not end up producing a full record since State\u2019s IT systems didn\u2019t save everything. But that doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t take steps to comply.\u201d\n\nFor all of our stories on Clinton\u2019s emails click here.\n\nU.S. State Department, Office of the Inspector General. \u201cOffice of the Secretary: Evaluation of Email Records Management and Cybersecurity Requirements.\u201d 26 May 2016.\n\nSchmidt, Michael S. \u201cHillary Clinton Used Personal Email Account at State Dept., Possibly Breaking Rules.\u201d New York Times. 2 Mar 2015.\n\nU.S. State Department. \u201cBiographies of the Secretaries of State: Hillary Rodham Clinton (1947\u2013).\u201d Accessed 26 May 2016.\n\nGillum, Jack and Ted Bridis. \u201cHouse committee subpoenas Clinton emails in Benghazi probe.\u201d Associated Press. 5 Mar 2015.\n\nU.S. State Department, Office of the Inspector General. \u201cAbout Steve A.
