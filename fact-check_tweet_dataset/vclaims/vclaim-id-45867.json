A man wearing a white T-shirt flanked by uniformed guards on both sides directs the group to the corner where the body is buried. The men can be heard talking among themselves in Hindi. The viral video, shot on a mobile phone, has a logo of KTN News across it.\n\nBOOM has not included the video owing to its disturbing nature.\n\n\n\nBOOM found that the text accompanying the video on Indian Facebook pages have gotten several details wrong including the name of the accused, the name of the victim and the location of the crime.\n\nThe viral video has been shared from right-wing Indian Facebook pages like \u0915\u091f\u094d\u091f\u0930 \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0942 \u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930 \u092c\u0928\u093e\u0928\u093e (Make A Radical Hindu Rashtra) and Yogi The Great CM with Hindi caption which translates to 'Heart wrenching incident.

A man named Zainab raped a six-year-old girl. This evil man raped a six-year-old girl in Hyderabad. Not only did he rape her, he buried her alive'.\n\nThe caption of the second post appears to have mixed up the name from another rape-and-murder victim from Lahore that shook Pakistan in 2018. Seven-year-old Zainab Ansari, was raped and murdered in Lahore's Kasur district in 2018. The district had seen similar cases since 2015 and the crimes were suspected to be the handiwork of a serial killer. A Pakistani anti-terrorist court had on February 17 sentenced the convicted killer Imran Alii to death. Zainab's death had seen countrywide protests in Pakistan.
