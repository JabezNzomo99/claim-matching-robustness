Modiji Giving Free Balance. Click here http://balance.modi-gvt.in\u201c. When one clicks on the link, it takes you to a webpage which asks for your name, phone number, mobile service operator (Airtel, Idea, Vodafone etc.) and which state you belong to. There\u2019s a prominent \u2018Recharge Now\u2019 button at the end of the form. Right below this button, there\u2019s a running ticker of partly obfuscated numbers with the title \u201cLatest Successful Recharge\u201c. At the top, it says \u201c\u0926\u0947\u0936 \u092c\u0926\u0932 \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0902\u0964 (Desh Badal Raha Hai)\u201d, a slogan that has often been used by PM Modi/BJP in its campaigns.\n\nThe web design of this site is optimized for mobile users. The messaging such as invoking PM Modi in the WhatsApp chain message and the slogan \u2018Desh Badal Raha Hai\u2019 are optimisations well thought out to scam mobile internet users who are newly introduced to smartphones, technology, Internet and haven\u2019t yet figured out the perils of the world of Internet. The possibility of getting something for free makes even those who are otherwise wary of such websites try out their luck. After all, the only personal information that is being traded is a mobile number and a name. For those who do submit the form after inputting all the personal details, no \u2018free balance\u2019 is received, ever. However, they do end up giving up their name and phone number to some unknown person who\u2019s running this scam.\n\nWe traced the origins of this website and we found that the person who\u2019s created balance.modi-gvt.in operates a host of such scam sites. We\u2019re listing a few of them here.\n\nThe person who has created these websites and is making them viral via WhatsApp is probably getting thousands of names and mobile numbers which he/she can trade with advertising/marketing companies and make money. The other source of income would be the advertisements on the site. Quite a successful business model. We traced the person who\u2019s running these websites under a variety of email addresses. However, we are not sure if the identity that is being used to run these sites is an original identity or a stolen identity. Hence, we decided not to reveal the identity of the person. It is for the law enforcement agencies to look into such scams and act upon them as soon as possible.\n\nMany other copy-cat websites like the ones above have come up with identical web design and we are listing them below. We feel that these websites are probably handled by other individuals as we could not find any web traces connecting the next set of web sites to the previous ones.\n\nThere\u2019s another person who has registered a series of domain names with email addresses that fit a pattern and is also running scams likes the ones mentioned above.\n\nbig-great-sale.com is registered with email address 00krazy0076@macr2.com\n\n jio-internet-speeder.com is registered with email address 00krazy0071@macr2.com\n\n free-net-recharge.com is registered with email address 00krazy0077@macr2.com\n\n jio-net-speeder.com is registered with email address 00krazy0065@macr2.com\n\n jio-unlimited-net.com is registered with email address 00krazy0061@macr2.com\n\n \u2026 and so on.\n\nWhile all of the above websites want to scam people into trading their personal information such as names and phone numbers, the more dangerous kinds are the ones that will try and install malware into your phone/computer. For eg, if one goes to trickybuzz.com, it will show a pop-up message stating \u201cCongratulations Phone User \u0906\u092a\u0915\u094b \u092e\u093f\u0932 \u0917\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0902 Nude Scanner Camera!\u201d. It then asks you to download an application by pressing the \u201cDownload\u201d button. DO NOT CLICK ON THE BUTTON. It is a phone malware.\n\nWebsites like free-4gb-netpack.com and camera-nude-scanner.asia show the picture of a nude woman on the front page, ask if you wish to chat with a hot girl. Then, they make you answer a questionnaire and convince you to share the website multiple times over WhatsApp to unlock \u2018hot girls in your area\u2019.\n\nThere are thousands of such scams which are being propagated via WhatsApp. The research for this article took just a few hours. India\u2019s multiple law enforcement agencies with their cyber cells have much more bandwidth to go after these scamsters and bring them to the book. So, the obvious question is, how does a person who has been running multiple scammy sites over a longish period of time get away without our law enforcement agencies taking note?", "lang": "en"}
