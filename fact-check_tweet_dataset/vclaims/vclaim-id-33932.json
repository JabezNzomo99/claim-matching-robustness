Think about who comes to that. He had promised that every fundraiser he would do would be open-door, but this one was closed-door.\u201d\n\nHer attack misfired somewhat. Buttigieg did hold a high-dollar fundraiser in a wine cave, but it was not closed off to onlookers. In fact, it was the first fundraiser Buttigieg opened up after sustaining weeks of criticism from, among others, Warren. A reporter who attended it filed a pool report.\n\nAt the debate, Buttigieg responded by noting that Warren seeded her presidential campaign with a sizable financial transfer from her 2018 Senate campaign. For that race, Warren did not have the same restrictive fundraising practices in place that she does now.\n\nThe U.S. population, standing at more than 320 million, rounds out to nearly 5 percent of the world population. Going only by this metric, yes, 95 percent of all the theoretical consumers of U.S. goods are \u201coutside of our borders.\u201d\n\nThere are various ways to frame this, but note that Sanders says \u201calmost any major country.\u201d That\u2019s generally code for members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a group of the 36 wealthiest countries. But Sanders appears to be operating off stale data. (His staff has previously pointed to a 2012 UNICEF report that showed the United States just behind Romania.)\n\nSanders is drawing on a 2017 report from the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies, which said that three billionaires \u2014 Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos (who owns The Washington Post) and Warren Buffett \u2014 had total wealth of $248.5 billion, compared with $245 billion for the bottom 160 million of the United States. The wealth of the three men has gone up since then.\n\n\u201cThe real scandal here is that the bottom half of the U.S. families owns essentially no wealth on net, because debts cancel out whatever small assets they may have, on average,\u201d Saez said in an email. \u201cIf you exclude cars (consumer durables), the wealth of the bottom 50% is actually slightly negative according to the most recent distributional Fed statistics. You don\u2019t even need to be a billionaire to actually own more than what the bottom half of Americans own! Billionaires in the Forbes 400 owned slightly less than 1% of total wealth back in 1982, they now own about 3.5% of total wealth. That\u2019s another alarming trend.\u201d\n\nHouseholds with $1 billion or more in assets would start paying 3 percent on assets above $1 billion. At least that was in Warren\u2019s first iteration of her tax plans. She said this tax would raise $2.75 trillion over 10 years. But to help fund her plan for universal health care, she recently announced that she would also charge another 3 percent to billionaires, for a total of 6 percent. So that\u2019s six pennies.\n\n\u201cBy asking billionaires to pitch in 6 cents on each dollar of net worth above $1 billion, we can raise an additional $1 trillion in revenue,\u201d Warren said in explaining how she would fill the $20.5 trillion hole created by her Medicare-for-all proposal. While 6 percent a year may not seem like much, over 10 years it would quickly add up.", "lang": "en"}
