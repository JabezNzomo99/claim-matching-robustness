The money was distributed over three rounds in December 2018, February 2019 and April 2019.\n\nSenator McKenzie, currently Minister for Agriculture, was the Minister for Sport at the time and was responsible for awarding the funding.\n\nIn its report, published on January 15, 2020, the ANAO assessed the handling of each round of funding.\n\nFor Round 1, the ANAO found that the applications recommended were chosen by the minister\u2019s office rather than Sport Australia. The report concluded: \u201cNinety-one (41 per cent) of the approved projects were not on the list of 426 endorsed by the Sport Australia board.\u201d\n\nFor Round 2, the ANAO found Sport Australia \u201cdid not play a role in deciding which applications should be recommended\u201d. Sport Australia had identified 204 applications to recommend to the minister\u2019s office but did not provide them. The minister\u2019s office told Sport Australia which applications would be approved. The report found: \u201cOne hundred and sixty-two (70 per cent) of the approved projects were not on the list of 204 applications Sport Australia planned to recommend.\u201d\n\nFor Round 3, the ANAO again found Sport Australia was not involved in deciding on recommendations. Sport Australia did identify 245 applications for recommendation but the minister\u2019s office had already told the body which applications would be approved. The report stated: \u201cOne hundred and sixty-seven (73 per cent) of the approved projects had not been recommended by Sport Australia.\u201d\n\nAmong its findings, the ANAO said there was \u201cevidence of distribution bias in the award of grant funding\u201d and that the award of funding \u201cwas not consistent with the assessed merit of applications\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe award of funding reflected the approach documented by the Minister\u2019s Office of focusing on \u2018marginal\u2019 electorates held by the Coalition as well as those electorates held by other parties or independent members that were to be \u2018targeted\u2019 by the Coalition at the 2019 Election,\u201d the ANAO report said.\n\nThe auditor\u2019s report concluded that: \u201cThe successful applications were not those that had been assessed as the most meritorious in terms of the published program guidelines\u201d.\n\nAAP FactCheck emailed Mr Dutton\u2019s office on January 24 to ask what basis Mr Dutton had for saying Senator McKenzie made recommendations on advice from Sport Australia.\n\nIn an emailed response, a spokesperson for Mr Dutton said: \u201cThe Minister doesn\u2019t have anything further to add to what he has stated publicly.\u201d\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck has found Mr Dutton\u2019s statement that Senator McKenzie made recommendations on advice from Sport Australia does not reflect the findings of the ANAO report.", "lang": "en"}
