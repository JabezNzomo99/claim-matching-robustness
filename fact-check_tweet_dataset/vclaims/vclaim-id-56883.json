An image of the tweet has also been shared on Facebook.\n\nHowever, this claim is incorrect. The photo editor behind the story shared the photo\u2019s metadata and a copy of the file to Twitter to prove it had been taken in April 2020, during the lockdown. The metadata suggests it was taken at 5:53pm on 23 April 2020.\n\nThey also shared evidence indicating that several supposed inconsistencies in the photograph\u2014such as the cranes in the background, or the length of shadows\u2014 were in fact authentic. A picture from a webcam at a nearby business taken less than an hour later shows what appear to be the same vehicles seen in the photograph in the same position.\n\nSome people commenting on Twitter also suggested the photo had been taken or cropped in a way to make visitors to the seafront seem closer together. \n\n\n\nWe have written before about how some authentic photos of crowds can still be potentially misleading when using long telephoto lenses, by making the crowds appear denser. In this case, the metadata indicates the picture was taken with an iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s zoom lens, which suggests that effect could play a slight, but limited, role\u2014far less than could be achieved with a professional telephoto lens.", "lang": "en"}
