It left me just numb. I still see that yarn in my sleep.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, our colleagues at FactCheck.org were not that impressed with the commercial\u2019s claims, reviewing it as part of an article titled \u201cHealth Care Spin.\u201d They noted that the ad highlighted the fact that McCain proposed a tax on health benefits but never mentioned that he also proposed a tax credit that, for many Americans, would offset any tax increase.\n\nOf course, McCain did not become president. And Obama, who has argued against adopting an individual mandate, as proposed by Hillary Clinton, ended up embracing exactly that option\u2014and even accepted a variation of an idea from McCain that he criticizes in this ad.\n\nPoliticians change their minds\u2014and their policies\u2014all the time, sometimes for political reasons but also because circumstances change. But within the benefit of hindsight, could McCain have made the same attack ad against Obama? The Truth Teller Video above also examines the claims.\n\n\u201cMcCain would tax health benefits for the first time ever\u201d\n\nStarting in 2018, the Affordable Care Act will impose a 40-percent excise tax, known as the \u201cCadillac tax,\u201d on generous health plans, which is defined as a plan that exceeds an annual limit of $10,200 for an individual and $27,500 for a family. Proponents of the provision believe it will help hold down health-care costs.\n\nMcCain wanted to do away with the tax-free status of employer-provided health benefits entirely. (Employer-provided benefits is a bit of an accident of history: Companies began to extend health benefits in respond to government-imposed wage freezes in the 1950s.) So health benefits would have been taxed as ordinary income, but people would also have received a tax credit.\n\n\u201cHis plan would raise costs for employers offering health care, so your coverage would be reduced or dropped completely.\u201d\n\n\u201cA survey by the International Foundation of Employees Benefits Plans (IFEBP) found that 16.8 percent of respondents had already started to redesign their health plans to avoid the \u201cCadillac\u201d tax and 40 percent said they are considering action,\u201d NBC News reported. \u201cA survey of Fortune 1000 companies by Towers Watson, a top benefits consulting firm, found a much higher number. Sixty percent of the these major companies, which employ about 20 million American workers, say the looming excise tax is already having a \u2018moderate\u2019 or \u2018significant\u2019 influence on benefits decisions for 2014 and 2015.\u201d\n\nThis was a point of real contention, as Obama said he would mandate coverage and McCain wanted to expand high-risk pools in many states that were designed to cover those who had been denied coverage or had high health-care costs. McCain\u2019s proposal was a more free-market approach, given that relatively few people have extremely expensive medical problems. He figured it would be better to create special insurance pools, modeled on existing states pools, rather than force insurance companies to include them with everyone else. (The Post reported at the time the experience in the state pools was quite mixed.)\n\nObama did mandate coverage of pre-existing conditions as he promised, but he also adopted the concept of high-risk pools as a $5 billion transitional program between the adoption of the law in 2010 and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in 2014.\n\nThis ad is a textbook example of why no voter should cast ballots based on promises or claims made in campaign ads. Such ads serve more as a guide for the general direction a candidate might take, such as McCain wanting a more free-market approach and Obama advocating a more top-down government-managed system.\n\nBut if you are counting on the specifics to turn out to be true, don\u2019t hold your breath. Even if your candidate wins, his warnings about the other side\u2019s plans may turn out to be true.", "lang": "en"}
