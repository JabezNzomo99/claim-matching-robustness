Several of them, including Secretary Perry, have now deleted their posts. Some even mocked up their own versions of the meme poking fun at their fellow-stars.\n\nMany people who shared it expressed the sentiment that even if the post\u2019s claims weren\u2019t accurate, it was better to be safe than sorry.\n\nBut the post isn\u2019t true. Instagram\u2019s settings haven\u2019t changed: it doesn\u2019t own your pictures and your messages aren\u2019t about to become public.\n\nInstagram referred us to the profile of its head, Adam Mosseri, where he shared a story saying the meme was not true.\n\nHe also linked to an article in the fashion trade journal WWD, which quotes Instagram\u2019s brand communications manager Stephanie Otway saying there was no truth to the post.\n\nInstagram certainly collects data about you, and can share that with other groups. But it doesn\u2019t actually own your photos. Its terms of service say:\n\n\u201cWe do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use it.\n\n Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service.

At the time Facebook clarified that the post wasn\u2019t true and did so again in 2016, saying \u201cYou own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it's shared through your privacy and application settings.\u201d\n\nThere are some clues it\u2019s not real\n\nThe image\u2019s text varies in size, which is one sign it isn\u2019t legitimate. The text of the word \u2018Instagram\u2019 also seems to have been overlaid on the image.\n\nThe wording of the message is also suspect\u2014grammar mistakes and sporadic capital letters can be something to look out for when deciding whether a post is what it says it is.", "lang": "en"}
