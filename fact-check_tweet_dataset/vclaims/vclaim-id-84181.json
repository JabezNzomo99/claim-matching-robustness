However, Health Canada, the Ontario Ministry of Health and the Canadian Lyme Disease Foundation actually say the best way to remove ticks is with fine-tipped tweezers.\n\nAs concerns about tick season were reported in Canadian media, social media posts about tick removal started circulating, often shared with messages of concern or as an attempt to help friends or pet lovers.\n\nFor example this April 13, 2019 Facebook post has been shared more than 51,000 times.\n\nThe caption on the image states: \"'I had a pediatrician tell me what she believes is the best way to remove a tick.' Apply a glob of liquid soap to a cotton ball. Cover the tick with the soap-soaked cotton ball and swab it for a few seconds (15-20); the tick will come out on its own and be stuck to the cotton ball when you lift it away.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nHowever, health officials in Canada have actually stated that the best way to remove ticks is with fine-tipped tweezers.\n\nThis the official advice on the Health Canada website about removing ticks.\n\nIt says: \"Using clean tweezers, grasp the head as close to the skin as possible and slowly pull straight out. Try not to twist or crush the tick.\"\n\nThis is the official advice on ticks from the Ontario government.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the advice:\n\nLiam Remillard, from the Canadian Lyme Disease Research Network, also told AFP by email that the soap technique described in the Facebook post \"is not the approved tick removal method endorsed by both the Government of Canada and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\"\n\nJim Wilson, President of the Canadian Lyme Disease Foundation, told AFP by email: \"We do not recommend this soap and cotton ball method.\"\n\nDavid Jensen, a media relations coordinator from Ontario's Ministry of Health, told AFP by email.\n\n\"Lyme bacteria can pass from the tick into your bloodstream if you crush or damage the tick while removing it,\" he stated. \"This is why you should pull the tick straight out with fine-tipped tweezers.\"\n\nThis page on the Canadian government's website states Lyme disease, spread by the bite of infected ticks, is a threat in Canada.\n\nThis government report shows that cases of Lyme disease have risen from 144 in 2009 to 2,025 cases in 2017.", "lang": "en"}
