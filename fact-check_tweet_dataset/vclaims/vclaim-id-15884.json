Only a great person like you can accomplish such a huge task in a jiffy- translated).\n\nThese words have been tweeted by BJP leader and former MP CM Chowkidar Shivraj Singh Chouhan, along with a video clip of a speech of Congress president Rahul Gandhi. The video clip is 13 seconds long.\n\nIn the clip, Rahul Gandhi is heard saying, \u201c\u2026Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Bhupesh Baghel ji, Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh Hukum Singh Karada ji\u2026\u201d, mockingly suggesting that the Congress president has said that the CM of MP is Bhupesh Baghel (and not Kamal Nath). Chouhan\u2019s tweet has been retweeted by union minister Chowkidar Smriti Irani.\n\nExpectedly, the video clip has been shared in droves by social media users on Facebook, who have posted it on their timelines.\n\nThe video of Rahul Gandhi, tweeted by Chouhan and retweeted by Irani has been clipped. Gandhi was addressing a rally in Neemuch, Madhya Pradesh on May 14. The video of the same is posted below, uploaded on YouTube by the Congress party on its official account.\n\nAs can be seen in the above video, at 00:07 minutes, Rahul Gandhi begins his speech by saying, \u201cKamal Nath ji, Madhya Pradesh ke Chief Minister, Bhupesh Baghel ji, Chhattisgarh ke Chief Minister, Hukum Singh Karada ji, P C Sharma ji\u2026\u201d\n\nRahul Gandhi had referred to Kamal Nath, followed by his designation as the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh. He did the same with Bhupesh Baghel who he introduced first by name and then his designation as the CM of Chhattisgarh. The part where he mentions Kamal Nath was left out of the video clip, so as to suggest that Gandhi has referred to Bhupesh Baghel as the CM of MP.\n\nThe India Today group misreported the event, stating that Rahul Gandhi had bungled with the names of the chief ministers of Congress-ruled states. An article published on the website was titled, \u2018Rahul Gandhi mixes up names of CMs of Congress-ruled states, Twitter has field day\u2019. The channel even tweeted about it.\n\nNews Tak, the digital news channel of the India Today group, had reported on May 15 that Rahul Gandhi had committed a gaffe at his rally in Neemuch, MP. The video report was published with the title, \u201cBlunder by Rahul Gandhi in his Neemuch speech\u201d (translated). The report was laced with text which said, \u2018Bhupesh Baghel called CM of MP\u2019 and \u2018Hukum Singh Karada called CM of Chhattisgarh\u2019.\n\nThe video of the News Tak report also began exactly at the point where the name of Kamal Nath was omitted, so as to make it seem as if Rahul Gandhi had committed a faux pas. This was however not the case, as pointed out above.\n\n8 constituencies of Madhya Pradesh will vote in the final phase of the Lok Sabha election on May 19. As expected, ahead of polling, misinformation related to the state has reared its head.\n\nUpdate: The article has been updated to include misreporting by India Today", "lang": "en"}
