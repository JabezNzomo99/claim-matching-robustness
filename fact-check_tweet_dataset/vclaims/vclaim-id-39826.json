The quote has also been attributed to Mr Johnson in a Daily Express article.\n\nThe tweet implies that Mr Johnson is lying, and continues \u201cfacts don\u2019t matter anymore\u201d.\n\nBut there\u2019s no evidence that Mr Johnson said this.\n\nThe phrase is not in the pre-released draft of his conference speech. And we\u2019ve reviewed subtitles of the speech itself, using Full Fact\u2019s internal technology, which also show no mention of this claim.\n\nBoris Johnson did say \u201cit was this Conservative government that tackled the debt and the deficit left by the last Labour government\u201d. But this is not the same thing as saying the Conservatives have \u201cwiped out the national debt\u201d.\n\nIn theory it\u2019s possible that Mr Johnson made the claim somewhere other than during his keynote conference speech. But we\u2019ve seen no evidence for that either.\n\nThere are only a handful of tweets which report Mr Johnson as saying \u201cwe have wiped out the national debt\u201d, and the first one came from the Twitter user who made the claim we\u2019re fact checking here. None are from journalists who were at the conference.\n\nAdditionally, Googling the phrase \u201cwe have wiped out the national debt\u201d only returns repetition of that original tweet and no evidence Mr Johnson has ever used those words.\n\nSince 2010 the debt has increased and the deficit has decreased\n\nAlthough the claim attributed to Mr Johnson seems to have been fabricated, it\u2019s worth examining what he did say in more detail.\n\nHe stated that \u201cit was this Conservative government that tackled the debt and the deficit\u201d. Government debt has continued to rise since the Conservatives came into office in 2010, but the deficit has fallen in recent years.\n\nGovernment debt is the total amount of money the government owes from its borrowing over the years plus interest payments.\n\nThe deficit is effectively how much the government has borrowed each year.\n\nThe size of the government deficit rose significantly following the financial crisis in 2007/08.\n\nSince 2010/11 (when the Conservatives came back into office as part of the Coalition government) the deficit has fallen in all but one year, which in turn means that the national debt has continued to grow, but at a slower rate. Whether you consider this to mean the government has \u201ctackled the debt and deficit\u201d is a matter of interpretation.\n\nThe deficit fell from \u00a3158 billion (or 10% of GDP) in 2009/10 to \u00a341 billion (2% of GDP) in 2018/19.\n\nAs the size of the economy tends to grow over time, expressing the deficit as a percentage of the UK\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) is the best measure, as it tells us how much was borrowed relative to the total value of goods and services made in the UK each year.\n\nGovernment debt currently stands at just below \u00a31.8 trillion, which is 81% of GDP. In May 2010 when the Conservatives came to office, it was worth \u00a31 trillion or 64% of GDP.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that a debt-GDP ratio of 81% isn\u2019t that high by the standards of the last century, and it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing that a government has debt\u2014almost all countries do. There is a debate among economists about whether there is a level of debt that is too high.", "lang": "en"}
