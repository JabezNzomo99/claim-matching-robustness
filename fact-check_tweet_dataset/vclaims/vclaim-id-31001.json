The quote attributed to Russell in the Facebook post appears to fall into the latter group.

Beverly Bayzat, a library assistant at the Bertrand Russell Archives, confirmed in an email to the DCNF that the library had no records of the saying.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d have to say this is not a Russell quote,\u201d said Andrew Irvine, a Russell scholar at the University of British Columbia, in an email to the DCNF. \u201cBoth I and a colleague have looked up this quote in the past and we\u2019ve never been able to find a source.\u201d\n\nThe website Quote Investigator traced a variation of the quote back to a 1931 article in The Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, where it appeared without attribution. This article is the earliest known instance of the quote, though elements of it appeared earlier, according to etymologist Barry Popik.\n\nWhile there is no evidence that Russell wrote this quote about war, he may well have agreed with the sentiment. A lifelong peace activist and proponent of nuclear disarmament, Russell often wrote about the subject of war. In his book \u201cFact and Fiction,\u201d he wrote, \u201cEither Man will abolish war, or war will abolish Man.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
