In the case of the UK, France and Spain, the figures are in the right ballpark for the maximum amounts available from state pensions.\n\nBut like then, these figures are misleading, because the countries\u2019 pensions systems are different.\n\nCompared to these other countries, the UK state pension is essentially a flat rate with the exact amount dependent on years of contributions and age. Spanish, German and French pensions are calculated using more complex formulas that depend on previous earnings, so their maximum weekly pensions appear higher as those would be for the countries\u2019 higher earners.\n\nMany UK workers pay into additional non-compulsory workplace pensions as well, and those are dependent on earnings.\n\nWe\u2019ve written about this issue is more detail here.\n\nThe source of these numbers isn\u2019t clear\n\nThe closest match we found in the past was this table from a Which? article published in 2013. This shows figures very close to the ones in the Facebook post (but in annual terms rather than weekly).\n\nBoth the OECD and the International Social Security Association (ISSA), are cited as the source of the numbers. The OECD told us they were not the source of the monetary figures, and the ISSA told us the figures didn\u2019t seem to be sourced from them directly.\n\nThe UK\u2019s pension system is quite different to the other countries listed\n\nComparing pensions between countries \u201cis complicated by substantial differences in the structure of pension systems across the developed world\u201d, according to a recent House of Commons Library analysis.\n\nSome comparative figures can give the impression that UK pensioners are considerably worse off in retirement than those in other advanced economies. That\u2019s because UK pensioners get a much higher proportion of their retirement income from occupational pensions or personal savings, as opposed to state pensions and benefits.\n\nWhen you just look at public pensions and benefits, UK pensions are considerably lower than those of other major advanced economies.\n\nAll the countries listed in the graphic generally have higher public spending on old-age pensions as a proportion of GDP (the size of their economies) than the UK does . Using figures for 2015, the equivalent of 5.2% of UK GDP went into public spending on pensions, compared to 7.7% in Spain, 7.9% in Germany and 12.1% in France.\n\nThose figures are just counting pensions and benefits provided by the state, not occupational pensions or voluntary savings people make.\n\nBut that\u2019s only one part of what people get through a pensions system. It doesn\u2019t properly factor in how people\u2019s lifetime earnings can affect their pension entitlements.\n\nThe OECD measures what\u2019s called a \u201cpension replacement rate\u201d\u2014which broadly speaking expresses what pensioners receive relative to their previous earnings when working.\n\nUK pensions are relatively low on this measure as well. If you just consider mandatory public and private pensions, an average UK pensioner\u2019s income is worth 29% of their earnings at retirement, compared to 51% in Germany, 75% in France and 82% in Spain.\n\nBut pensions in both the UK and Germany tend to get top-ups from voluntary pensions, which pushes their ratios to 62% for the UK and 65% for Germany when included (with the other countries staying the same).", "lang": "en"}
