Underwood, assumed the role in an acting capacity.\n\nNow, it\u2019s up to state lawmakers to choose an interim replacement for the post \u2014 which some believe should be filled by a woman. But former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has not been appointed to the job, as one story claims.\n\nThe website Liberty Raise published the May 9 article under the headline \u201cNew York Governor Appoints New Permanent Attorney General, And She ALREADY Lost To Trump.\u201d Facebook users rightly flagged that story as false: It was first published on the website Daily World Update, which calls its work satire. (Liberty Raise does not include such a disclaimer.)\n\nThe article\u2019s claims rely on a fictitious statement by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo that, in part, reads: \u201cWe are excited that Secretary Clinton has agreed to serve in this capacity for the remainder of the term.\u201d\n\nThere is no public record of Cuomo ever releasing such a statement, as a search of the governor\u2019s announcements shows.\n\nPlus, the position isn\u2019t even Cuomo\u2019s to fill: According to the state constitution, such vacancies are to be filled by the state Legislature. Voters will then elect an attorney general in November.\n\nThe made-up story also claimed that Cuomo said Clinton would continue \u201cSchneiderman\u2019s agenda including the aggressive prosecution of President Trump\u2019s former attorney.\u201d But the investigation into Michael Cohen\u2019s finances and business deals isn\u2019t being handled by the state attorney general\u2019s office \u2014 it\u2019s a probe by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nFarrow, Ronan and Jane Mayer. \u201cFour Women Accuse New York\u2019s Attorney General of Physical Abuse.\u201d The New Yorker. 7 May 2018.\n\n\u201cNew York Governor Appoints New Permanent Attorney General, And She ALREADY Lost To Trump.\u201d Daily World Update. 9 May 2018.\n\n\u201cNew York Governor Appoints New Permanent Attorney General, And She ALREADY Lost To Trump.\u201d Liberty Raise. 9 May 2018.\n\n\u201cStatement From Acting Attorney General Barbara Underwood.\u201d Press release.
