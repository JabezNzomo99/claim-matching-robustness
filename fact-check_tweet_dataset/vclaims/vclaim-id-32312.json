A parody account dedicated to journalist Pushpendra Kulshreshtha @KPUSHPENDRA15 shared the clip and claimed that it shows Pakistani policemen thrashing Hindu women, a minority in the country. The video is circulating in the view of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) which seeks to provide a legal route for non-Muslim minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan to apply for Indian citizenship.\n\nThe clip is massively viral on Facebook.\n\nAlt News broke the video into multiple keyframes using InVID and reverse-searched one of the frames on Google. This led us to a January 4, 2019 broadcast by Pakistan-based channel News 24 HD. According to its report, policemen in Punjab brutally thrashed women.\n\nA keyword search redirected us to a January 6, 2019 report in Dawn which said, \u201cAccording to police sources, Haleema Bibi, wife of Nazir, her sister-in-law Anwari Bibi and four others were present in their house in Mohallah Rehmanabad when ASI Ghulam Mohammad Jappah, with two constables and a private person, Aashi Jappah, forced their entry on the pretext of arresting a suspect.\u201d The report also added that three cops were suspended.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Hindu women were beaten is baseless.\n\nA Pakistani journalist Tayyab Ahmad Jutt shared the suspension letter of the three policemen \u2013 an officer and two constables.\n\nAn old incident from Pakistan\u2019s Punjab was thus revived and communalised on social media in the view of protests against the CAA.", "lang": "en"}
