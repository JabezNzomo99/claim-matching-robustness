Maybe you can help!\u201d With a puzzled emoji, a South African Facebook user\n\nwhat seems to be TV news from the USA.\n\nIt\u2019s a report on the murder trial of one Hannah Stephenson, a 16-year-old girl accused of stabbing a classmate to death, with a screwdriver, in Detroit, Michigan. The video shows a weeping white teenager sitting in court between her unhappy parents.\n\nHannah has been given \u201cthe harshest possible sentencing\u201d, the news anchor says.\n\n\u201cShe will be tried as a black adult.\u201d\n\nThe video cuts to the judge: \u201cDue to the extreme and violent nature of this crime, the court finds it fitting to try the defendant as an African American.\u201d\n\nThe news anchor continues: \u201cOnce the trial begins next week, all courtroom images of Hannah will depict her as a 300-pound muscular black man. And jury members will be instructed to imagine her as such.\u201d\n\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing\u2019\n\n\u201cThis lets you now they been f***g us throughout time.\u201d\n\n\u201cSad that we are viewed by the colour of our skin. The judge should be disbarred and every case of his should be investigated.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust a fact that being a black person, you are charged with higher sentences.\u201d\n\n\u201cWTF. They said picture her as a 300lb black man. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing. That is really f***d up!\u201d\n\npointed to what it is:\n\nSatire uses humour to show that injustices are ridiculous. In this case, the injustice is that, in the USA, black people are more likely to receive far harsher sentences, for the same crime, than white people.\n\nThe video was produced by\n\n, has been publishing satire on American society since the late 1980s.\n\nThe \u201cjoke\u201d is that the white teenager would only get the punishment she deserved for an \u201cextreme and violent\u201d crime if she were tried as \u201ca 300-pound muscular black man\u201d.\n\nAre black people really given harsher sentences than white people in the USA?\n\nYes, according to academic articles, news reports, government studies and global organisations.\n\nthat \u201csignificant racial disparities persist in all aspects of the American criminal justice system, according to a\n\nstudy. The report finds discrimination against people of colour in the policing, pretrial, sentencing, parole, and post-prison stages of the country's justice system.\u201d\n\nby the US Sentencing Commission had found that black men convicted of the same crimes as white men received federal prison sentences that were, on average, nearly 20% longer.\n\nconcluded that \u201cblacks receive sentences that are almost 10 percent longer than those of comparable whites arrested for the same crimes\u201d.\n\nThe people who commented on the Facebook post weren\u2019t wrong to be outraged. That\u2019s the power of satire.", "lang": "en"}
