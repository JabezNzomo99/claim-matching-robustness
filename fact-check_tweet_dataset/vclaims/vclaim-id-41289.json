Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: The photo shows a police officer arresting a woman in Australia for wearing a burqa. Fact: The photo was taken in 2015 when the police officers in Spain arrested a woman for her alleged involvement in terrorist activities. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the photo in the post is run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, a newspaper article with the same image is found in the search results. The photo was taken in 2015 when the police officers in Spain arrested an 18-year old Moroccan woman for allegedly recruiting women to join ISIS. So, the photo was not taken in Australia and she was not arrested for wearing a burqa.\n\nTo sum it up, the burqa-clad woman in the photo was arrested in Spain for terrorist activities, not in Australia for wearing a burqa.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
