They know I am one of those ready to give my life for Russia, and that I have a good army capable of attacking and defending. We will see who comes out on top,\u201d Kadyrov said.\n\n\u201cDo you regard the United States as an enemy of your country?\u201d HBO host Bryant Gumbel asked.\n\n\u201cAmerica is not really a strong enough country for us to regard it as an enemy of Russia,\u201d Kadyrov answered.\n\nIn April 2013, the United States imposed sanctions on Ramzan Kadyrov for human rights violations, in accordance with the Magnitsky law.\n\nA popular Russian comedy show \u201cComedy Club\u201d ridiculed Kadyrov\u2019s claims with a song called \u201cBatyanya Ramzan.\u201d The word \u201cbatyanya,\u201d meaning father, is a vernacular form of address to a person old enough to be the speaker\u2019s parent, and is also prison slang for a mafia chief.\n\nGarrick Kharlamov, the show\u2019s host, sang: \u201cHey USA! You must know that if something goes wrong, a Russian tank will not come for you, a MiG-25 will not fly to you, a strategic missile carrier will not sail to you, an Su-27 will not fly to you! It will be much more serious, scarier than a Topol-M [ICBM] \u2013 Ramzan-Batyanya! Whoever offends Russia will be punished!\u201d\n\nObservers on both sides of the Atlantic saw Kadyrov\u2019s claims of military superiority over the U.S. as \u201cbraggadocio\u201d \u2013 except for the Kremlin.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin\u2019s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said \u201cthere was nothing extraordinary\u201d in Ramzan Kadyrov\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cThe Kremlin wouldn\u2019t mind such discourse since it\u2019s in line with the general understanding of Russian-U.S. relations,\u201d Ekaterina Sokirianskaia of the International Crisis Group told Polygraph.info.\n\nCalling Kadyrov a \u201clocal warlord,\u201d she said he spoke aiming to \u201cprovoke and intimidate.\u201d\n\nKadyrov\u2019s \u201cposturing\u201d and \u201cbaseless threats\u201d might be a response to \u201chigh tensions after Trump\u2019s airstrike on a Russian supply base in Syria,\u201d said Brian Williams, a University of Massachusetts professor and author of the book \u201cInferno in Chechnya: The Russian-Chechen Wars, the Al Qaeda Myth, and the Boston Marathon Bombings.\"\n\n\u201cThe Americans see in Kadyrov a pinpoint dictator of a micro-republic and take his threats with a basket of salt,\u201d Williams said.\n\nAlthough the exact number of servicemen in Kadyrov\u2019s \u201carmy\u201d has never been revealed publicly, estimates range between 2,000 and 30,000.\n\n\u201cKadyrov does not really have an army in a real sense; he has bands of paramilitary loyalists who are armed for most part with light infantry weapons like AK-47s, PK-40 machine guns and rocket grenades,\u201d Williams said.\n\n\u201cThis ad hoc paramilitary force is in no way, shape or form what we would define as an army,\u201d he added. \u201cThis motley force could not stand up to the might of the United States\u2019 troops that toppled out the Saddam Hussein regime. This is braggadocio, but not a reality-based threat.\u201d\n\nBoth Sokirianskaia and Williams noted that Kadyrov\u2019s troops are useful to Russian intelligence in covert military operations abroad.\n\nAccording to Williams, \u201cKadyrov\u2019s loyalists have been utilized by the GRU (Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency) and FSB as force multipliers in low-level conflicts in places ranging from Cambodia to Ukraine and Syria. The Russian military sees in the Chechen paramilitary force a weapon that is loyal and willing to fight much harder than the Russian troops, (and) experienced in counterinsurgency and insurgency.\u201d\n\n\u201cKadyrov is convinced that he has a special value\u201d because he is ready to fight wherever Putin tells him, Sokirianskaia said.\n\n\u201cIndeed, his experienced and well-trained army can be useful for the Kremlin in the context of modern hybrid wars,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are ready to implement assignments that might not be suitable for the regular Russian forces.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
