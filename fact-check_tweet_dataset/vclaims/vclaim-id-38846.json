The package sailed through the House and Senate with bipartisan support, but not without some partisan sniping.\n\nSome stories \u2014 like this one \u2014 are going around claiming Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi delayed the bill in order to use the crisis as a political weapon against Republicans.\n\nThe claim surfaced as Republicans and Democrats were still negotiating details of the spending package, such as where the money would come from and provisions on treatment costs.\n\nThe story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe article cites a recent report by conservative website Red State. That report, based on comments made by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., says Pelosi held up the bill so that the campaign arm of House Democrats could run ads against Republicans on Super Tuesday about their lack of action regarding the virus.\n\nIn a March 2 interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham, McCarthy claimed Pelosi \"withheld the bill last week. You know why? So the DCCC could run ads against seven Republicans.\" He repeated the statement in a press conference the following day.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the official campaign arm of House Democrats, released ads related to the coronavirus in seven Republican districts.\n\nBut when McCarthy made the comments, he and other Republicans were participating in negotiations about the package. There is no indication that Pelosi deliberately held up the bill for the sake of the ad campaign.\n\nThe DCCC announced on March 2 that the ads would run on Facebook in seven Republican congressional districts to call on their representatives to \"stand up\" to the Trump administration for an affordable coronavirus vaccine.\n\nThe ads target comments made by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who said during a hearing that the administration \"can\u2019t control that price because we need the private sector.\"\n\n\"The Trump administration would rather pad the pockets of drug manufacturers than provide access to an affordable coronavirus vaccine,\" the ads say. The clip ends with the Republican representative\u2019s name, asking if they agree.\n\nReports indicate the bill stalled because of Democrats\u2019 attempts to limit the cost of vaccines and other treatments that are developed in response to the outbreak.\n\nPelosi has been consistent about those provisions in multiple statements.\n\nIn a joint statement on Feb. 27, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that any package Congress approves must be \"entirely new funding \u2014 not stolen from other accounts\" and must include provisions ensuring that:\n\n\"The president cannot transfer these new funds to anything other than the coronavirus and fighting infectious diseases; vaccines are affordable and available to all the need it; interest-free loans are made available for small businesses impacted by the outbreak; and state and local governments are reimbursed for costs incurred while assisting the federal response to the coronavirus outbreak.\"\n\nPelosi called for the same provisions in another statement on Feb. 29, after the first coronavirus-related death was reported in the U.S. The Democrats\u2019 requests did make it into the final bill.\n\nDrew Hammill, Pelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff, pointed us to a response he made to McCarthy on Twitter, in which he called the accusation \"disgusting and false.\"\n\n\"[email protected], call your office. The bipartisan negotiations on the coronavirus funding supplemental are still underway. Your staff have been participating in those talks. This is a disgusting and false accusation.\"\n\n\"It was a particularly outrageous statement,\" Hammill added in an email, \"because McCarthy\u2019s own staff was participating in ongoing negotiations that had not concluded when he said this.\"\n\nWe reached out to McCarthy\u2019s office for a response but did not hear back in time of publication.\n\nThe bill, which dwarfed the $2.5 billion in funding that the Trump administration initially proposed, was introduced in the House on March 4 and swiftly passed that day, 415-2. The two nays were from Republican Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona and Ken Buck of Colorado. It passed the Senate the following day, with only Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., voting against it.\n\nThe funding includes more than $3 billion for research and vaccine development and $2.2 billion for prevention, preparedness and response efforts. It also allocates $1 billion for state and local response.\n\nStories claim Pelosi held up coronavirus emergency funds so that Democrats could campaign on the issue.\n\nDuring negotiations with Republicans on the funding package, Pelosi pushed for language on how the aid would be paid for and on the cost of treatments. Meanwhile, the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm ran ads targeting a Trump administration official\u2019s comments about vaccine costs.\n\nThe stories make unsupported claims about Pelosi\u2019s motives and omit the role Republicans played in the bill\u2019s negotiations.
