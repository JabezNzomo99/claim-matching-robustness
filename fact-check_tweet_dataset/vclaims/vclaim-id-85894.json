Tonight, I\u2019m announcing we\u2019ll launch six more this year. Bipartisan bills in both houses could double the number of these hubs and the jobs they create. So get those bills to my desk and put more Americans back to work.\u201d\n\nObama: \u201cToday, the federal minimum wage is worth about 20 percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan first stood here. Tom Harkin and George Miller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to $10.10. This will help families. It will give businesses customers with more money to spend. It doesn\u2019t involve any new bureaucratic program. So join the rest of the country. Say yes. Give America a raise.\u201d\n\nObama: \u201cAs we speak, American diplomacy is supporting Israelis and Palestinians as they engage in difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there; to achieve dignity and an independent state for Palestinians, and lasting peace and security for the State of Israel \u2013 a Jewish state that knows America will always be at their side.\u201c", "lang": "en"}
