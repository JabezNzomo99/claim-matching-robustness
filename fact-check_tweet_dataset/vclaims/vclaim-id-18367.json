The Quint got in touch with the Amravati police and they confirmed to us that the video was shot during a mock drill and it doesn\u2019t show the police arresting terrorists.\n\nPolice Sub Inspector Mundhe verified the video and said, \u201cThe video shows a mock drill by the Amravati city police near Ambadevi temple.\u201d However he couldn\u2019t remember the date when the drill was held, but added that it could be last Monday (22 July).\n\nIn January earlier this year, a message had gone viral on social media claiming that all \u201cofficers have been requested to inform their family and loved ones to avoid Chandni Chowk and other crowded areas in Delhi and Bangalore\u201d as two Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) groups have reached Delhi and \u201care planning on carrying out two suicide attacks\u201d. But The Quint got in touch with DCP New Delhi IPS Madhur Verma who acknowledged that the message has been doing rounds on WhatsApp and clarified, \u201cDelhi Police has not issued any such notice.\u201d The message was circulated around Republic Day.\n\nA video of a man lying on the ground tied-up, after presumably being nabbed by the police, along with the accompanying sound of two gunshots in the background, had gone viral, with a message stating that the police had \u201ccaught a terrorist who was shooting everywhere at Jaipur Airport\u201d. But in reality, the video was recorded on the night of 16 August 2018, that showed a former bodyguard named Shankar being nabbed by the CISF for drunkenly jumping out of a moving car and snatching the pistol off an on-duty CISF security officer near the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi.", "lang": "en"}
