Here is a fact check of his recent claims. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the front-line workers before you catch it. The front-line workers, many, many are taking it.\u201d\n\n\u2014 at a round table with restaurant executives on Monday \u201cHydroxychloroquine is used by thousands and thousands of front-line workers, so that hopefully they don\u2019t catch this horrible disease or whatever you want to call it.\u201d\n\n\u2014 in a cabinet meeting on Tuesday This lacks evidence. It is certainly possible that some doctors and health care workers are still taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventive treatment, but there is little support for the president\u2019s repeated suggestion that the practice is widespread.\n\nThe American Medical Association said in a statement that it \u201cdoes not know of any tracking or surveys examining personal use of hydroxychloroquine among health care workers.\u201d The American Nurses Association was more emphatic, saying that it \u201chas not received reports from nurses or other front-line health care workers utilizing hydroxychloroquine as a preventative treatment for Covid-19. Furthermore, to date, research has not shown clear evidence that hydroxychloroquine has a preventative effect for Covid-19.\u201d In March, The New York Times and other news organizations reported that some doctors were prescribing themselves and their family members hydroxychloroquine and hoarding supplies, according to pharmacy boards across the country. That behavior, however, appears to have declined after a warning from the Food and Drug Administration that the drug could cause serious heart problems for coronavirus patients, studies questioning its efficacy and a series of regulations from states and medical boards restricting its use. \u201cWe have not received from the state boards of pharmacy any new concerns regarding the continued stockpiling of hydroxychloroquine,\u201d said Al Carter, the executive director of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy.\n\n\u201cOnce states began implementing emergency limitations and guidelines on the amount of hydroxychloroquine that could be prescribed and dispensed for acute use, the complaints from pharmacists and state boards of pharmacy decreased significantly,\u201d Mr. Carter added. Mr. Trump may have been referring to front-line workers who are participating in clinical trials on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in preventing Covid-19 infection. Thousands are currently enrolled in these trials, and many are still recruiting eligible volunteers. Participants in these trials, however, represent a tiny fraction of the health care and front-line workers across the country. There are over one million active doctors and nearly three million registered nurses alone.\n\u2022 For a night at the theater, bring a negative coronavirus test.\n\u2022 Why is Europe having so much trouble vaccinating people? Shortages are just part of the problem. Researchers conducting these trials also said that interest in taking the drug, even in a clinical setting, had waned recently. One of the largest trials coordinated by Duke University School of Medicine and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, a nonprofit established by the Affordable Care Act that funds clinical research, has enrolled 550 health care workers, out of a goal of 15,000. Among a larger group of 12,000 front-line workers who have been sharing their experiences through the school\u2019s website, two-thirds were previously interested in participating in the hydroxychloroquine trial, but that is down to about half \u201csince the media hype,\u201d said Dr. Adrian Hernandez, who directs the Clinical Research Institute at Duke. Another doctor conducting a clinical trial who spoke on the condition of anonymity said many colleagues had stashes of hydroxychloroquine in their offices and used it as a preventive measure in the early days of the pandemic. Use is continuing but is no longer as widespread, the doctor said, especially after the F.D.A. warning and as supplies of personal protective equipment became less scarce. The doctor\u2019s clinical trial, too, has lost recruitment because \u201cpeople got scared,\u201d the doctor said. Dr. H. Michael Belmont, a professor of medicine at New York University, said his study had recruited 125 participants out of a capacity of 350, partly because of strict eligibility requirements, partly because cases in New York had decreased and partly because studies showing the drug\u2019s ineffectiveness \u201creduced somewhat the enthusiasm.\u201d Taking hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic should really be done only in a research setting, Dr. Belmont emphasized. \u201cYou do it outside a clinical trial, you lose the opportunity to answer scientific questions,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd if you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape. They were very old, almost dead. It was a \u2018Trump enemy\u2019 statement.\u201d\n\n\u2014 in remarks to reporters on Tuesday False. Mr. Trump was referring to a study of 368 Veterans Affairs patients \u2014 all male with a median age over 65 \u2014 hospitalized with Covid-19 infections. It found no evidence that hydroxychloroquine reduced patients\u2019 chances of being put on a mechanical ventilator and that the drug was associated with \u201cincreased overall mortality.\u201d But he was wrong that it was the \u201conly bad survey\u201d that threw cold water on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine. When Mr. Trump dismissed the study of veterans this month, The Times noted that the current body of research was limited to a few studies criticized for methodological errors and was insufficient to support the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, another malaria drug, as treatments. Since then, more research has been published. Two studies, each observing around 1,400 patients in New York City, concluded that administering hydroxychloroquine was not associated with greatly lower risk of mortality. Smaller studies in France and China reached similar conclusions. Reporter: \u201cThe F.D.A. has said hydroxychloroquine should not be used outside of a hospital setting or outside of a research study.\u201d Mr. Trump: \u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I was told. No.\u201d\n\n\u2014 in the cabinet meeting False. The F.D.A.\u2019s warning, issued in late April, specifically states that it \u201ccautions against use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for Covid-19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
