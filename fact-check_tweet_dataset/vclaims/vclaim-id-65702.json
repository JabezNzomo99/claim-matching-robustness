After reports came pouring in that the animal died a slow death after explosives went off in her mouth, numerous social media users claimed that the persons arrested for the crime are Amzath Ali and Thamim Shaikh. Amar Prasad Reddy, media advisor to the Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, was one of the earliest to tweet. He later took it down but not before it garnered thousands of likes and retweets (archive). He subsequently tweeted a clarification.\n\nLive Hindustan wrote an article on the purported arrests where Amar Prasad Reddy\u2019s tweet was featured (archive).\n\nNews Nation anchor Deepak Chaurasia made the same claim in Hindi (archive) \u2014 \u201c\u0939\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u092e\u093e\u092e\u0932\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0905\u092e\u091c\u0926 \u0905\u0932\u0940 \u0914\u0930 \u0924\u092e\u0940\u092e \u0936\u0947\u0916 \u0915\u0940 \u0917\u093f\u0930\u092b\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0939\u0941\u0908 \u0939\u0948\u0964\u201d\n\nSudarshan News penned an article on the claim (archive). Last year, Alt News had compiled a list of dangerous communal misinformation promoted by Sudarshan News.\n\nAlt News contacted Palakkad Superintendent of Police G Siva Vikram who termed the social media claims \u201cfake\u201d and informed that a man named P Wilson has been arrested in the matter. This was also reported by DD News Malayalam and Hindustan Times.\n\nThiruvazhamkunnu Forest Station, Deputy Range Officer, M Sasikumar confirmed the arrest to The News Minute. Wilson works as a rubber tapper in a plantation in the district. \u201cThe Forest Department identified three people suspected to be involved in the case, but let off two persons after interrogation,\u201d the report further states. SP Vikram told Alt News that the two people who were let off were not named Amzath Ali and Thamim Shaikh.\n\nMalayalam news outlets Mathrubhumi and Janmabhumi reported that the owners of the rubber plantation where Wilson works are also suspects in the case. Their names are Abdul Kareem and his son Riyazuddin. This was also confirmed to Alt News by SP Vikram who said that the duo is currently absconding.\n\nPrashant Patel Umrao, whose trysts with misinformation have been documented here, also made the same claim (archive).\n\nOthers who pushed the anti-Muslim narrative were author Ravi Rai (archive), BJP leader Varun Gandhi\u2019s secretary Ishita Yadav (archive), VHP member Abishek Mishra (archive), BJP UP member Richa Rajpoot (archive), OpIndia sub-editor Anupam Singh (archive), columnist Rakesh Krishnan Simha (archive), Twitter user BALA @erbmjha (archive) and Twitter account of Hindu nationalist party in Kerala Indu Makkal Katchi (archive).\n\nIn an earlier report, Alt News debunked media reports which claimed that the incident took place in Malappuram. The district\u2019s Muslim majority population led to communal misinformation on social media. The case pertains to Palakkad.\n\n[Update: The names of rubber plantation owners Abdul Kareem and his son Riyazauddin who are suspects in the case were added to the article after the same was reported by the police. This is a developing story. Updates will be included as and when they come to light.]", "lang": "en"}
