At least 60 people were feared dead. Soon after, videos of the disaster shot by several eyewitnesses were picked up by news organisations, including Asian News International (ANI). Subsequently, ANI also put out an eyewitness\u2019 statement that blamed the Congress for the incident. This tweet was posted at 8:39 PM on October 19.\n\nAt 11:49 PM, it was pointed out that the \u2018eyewitness\u2019 quoted by ANI was a spokesperson of BJP Punjab and former president of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM). At 12:36 AM, ANI tweeted a \u2018correction\u2019, clarifying that the \u2018eyewitness\u2019 was BJP leader Rajesh Honey.\n\nWhat\u2019s noteworthy is that after 14 hours of ANI\u2019s clarification, only 463 users retweeted it and 769 people liked it. Contrastingly, its earlier tweet drew over 5,000 likes and retweets. The damage was already done.\n\n\u2018Eyewitness\u2019 himself claims to have reached the spot after 20 minutes\n\nAfter ANI\u2019s eariler tweet received backlash on social media, its News Editor Smita Prakash stood by the outlet\u2019s reportage, saying that Rajesh Honey, even though a BJP leader, was present at the spot and this makes him an \u2018eyewitness\u2019.\n\nIncidentally, Honey himself tweeted that he reached the spot 20 minutes after the incident occurred. Therefore, he could not have been a witness to the accident.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t an isolated instance when ANI\u2019s reportage missed essential facts.\n\n1. Another politician named as \u2018eyewitness\u2019 to the Amritsar train accident\n\nOne more \u2018eyewitness\u2019 account taken by ANI, which also was picked up by other media outlets, was by an independent politician from Punjab Mandeep Singh Manna.\n\nWithin hours of the tragedy, the incident was politicised with the ruling and opposition parties placing the blame on each other. In such a situation, tweeting statements by members of political parties as \u2018eyewitness\u2019 accounts was unfortunate.\n\nMultiple times in the past, ANI has made similar slights.\n\nIn May 2015, ANI had tweeted a statement from a purported Bangalore resident praising Prime Minister Modi\u2019s radio program \u2018Mann ki Baat\u2019. However, after it was pointed out that the person quoted was not just a \u2018resident\u2019 but a BJP Karnataka MLA, ANI deleted its earlier tweet and put out a fresh tweet with the politician\u2019s name.\n\nIn April this year, ANI tweeted a \u2018Mangalore resident\u2019 saying that former Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has created a divide between Hindus and Muslims in the city. As it turned out, the \u2018local from Mangalore\u2019 was Fazal, a member of BJP minority cell, Mangalore. ANI tweeted a correction and deleted the earlier tweet which missed the fact.\n\n4. Quoted its own correspondent as an individual praising a tea stall\n\nA \u2018tea stall customer\u2019 was quoted by ANI as commending the shop for enabling online payments post cash shortage after demonetisation. The customer turned out to be a correspondent with ANI. The news agency later deleted the tweet without a clarification.\n\nOn March 23, 2017, ANI tweeted a video of vandalism, claiming that \u201cbus passengers beat toll booth employees and cause damage in Firozabad, UP.\u201d\n\nHowever, ABP News reported on the same day that the people involved in the vandalism were BJP workers. According to the report, \u201c\u0906\u0930\u094b\u092a \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u093f \u092e\u093e\u0930\u092a\u0940\u091f \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u092c\u0940\u091c\u0947\u092a\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0915\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093e \u0925\u0947 \u0914\u0930 \u092c\u0940\u091c\u0947\u092a\u0940 \u0928\u0947\u0924\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0936\u0935 \u0915\u094b \u0932\u0947\u0915\u0930 \u091f\u094b\u0932 \u0938\u0947 \u0939\u094b\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0941\u090f \u092a\u093e\u0938 \u0915\u0947 \u0917\u093e\u0902\u0935 \u0909\u0938\u093e\u092f\u0928\u0940 \u091c\u093e \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0925\u0947. \u091f\u094b\u0932 \u092a\u0930 \u0915\u093f\u0938\u0940 \u0924\u0930\u0939 \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u0939\u093e\u0938\u0941\u0928\u0940 \u0939\u0941\u0908, \u091c\u093f\u0938\u0915\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0926 \u0936\u0935 \u0915\u094b \u0917\u093e\u0902\u0935 \u092a\u0939\u0941\u0902\u091a\u093e \u0915\u0930 \u0915\u0941\u091b \u0932\u094b\u0917 \u0932\u093e\u0920\u0940 \u0921\u0902\u0921\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0935\u093e\u092a\u0938 \u0906\u090f \u0914\u0930 \u091f\u094b\u0932 \u092a\u0930 \u092e\u093e\u0930\u092a\u0940\u091f \u0915\u0940. (The accusation is that the ones thrashing (the toll booth) were BJP workers who were taking the dead body of a BJP leader to Usaini. Due to some altercation at the toll, some people returned with sticks after delivering the body and started thrashing the toll. )\u201d\n\n6. The reappearance of \u201cMuslim women from Varanasi\u201d\n\nOn multiple occasions in the past, ANI has tweeted about \u201cMuslim women from Varanasi\u201d either celebrating Hindu rituals or praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nA layperson scrolling through these tweets would either infer that many women belonging to Varanasi\u2019s Muslim community were promoting Hindu festivals and/or PM Modi, or that a Muslim organisation was doing the same. However, ANI failed to mention that these women are members of an organisation founded by a staunch BJP supporter.\n\nIn the first tweet (of the collage above), ANI quoted a \u2018member\u2019 of Muslim Mahila Foundation (MMF) as saying that she prays that PM Modi contends from Varanasi. This tweet is from 2014. The woman in the photograph isn\u2019t a member but the founder of MMF, Nazneen Ansari. She has reappeared in several other tweets by ANI.\n\nAnsari is a vocal BJP supporter. In 2014, she, along with another supporter of the BJP, floated the Bharatiya Awam Party (BAP) and declared unconditional support to Narendra Modi. BAP has also shared the stage with RSS. Last year, Nasari accepted soil from Ayodhya as her (and her foundation\u2019s) support toward building Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. According to a Times of Indiareport, \u201can office-bearer of Muslim Rashtriya Manch, Purnendu Upadhya said the \u201csacred\u201d soil will be put at different places for public view.\u201d Muslim Rashtriya Manch is affiliated to the RSS.\n\nWhile ANI\u2019s reportage about these \u201cwomen from Varanasi\u201d is not misinformation, it is incomplete and misleading.\n\n7. Misreported RSS-affiliated Muslim organisation as \u201cpeople in Lucknow\u201d celebrating Bakrid by cutting cake\n\nOn August 21, 2018, ANI tweeted that \u201cpeople in Lucknow\u201d were cutting a cake this Bakrid instead of sacrificing goats. The media outlet also quoted a man from the Muslim community who said, \u201cthe custom of sacrificing an animal on Bakrid is not right.\u201d\n\nHowever, they weren\u2019t just \u201cpeople from Lucknow\u201d but members of RSS-affiliated Muslim Rashtriya Manch celebrating bakrid by cutting a cake. The man in the photograph is a member of the organisation. Alt News had earlier reported this instance here.\n\nIn 2017, ANI tweeted that Gangan Dhawan, a former Congress MLA was arrested by the ED for involvement in a Rs 5,000 crore scam. The news agency later deleted this tweet and put out a clarification saying that Dhawan is a businessman and not a former MLA of the INC.\n\nWith an explosion of information from every corner of the country and a race among media outlets to be the first to break the news, inadvertent slights are bound to happen. Even though subsequent corrections are issued, the initial errors are always a matter of concern as incorrect information gets much wider circulation. We have seen in most cases that the corrected versions do not reach the audience who have been affected by the earlier misinformation. Such misinformation not only misleads the citizens but has the potential to add fuel to existing political biases and favour certain parties.", "lang": "en"}
