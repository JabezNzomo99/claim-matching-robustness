Times Now anchor, after stating that the BJP protested against the incident, questioned a channel correspondent, \u201cYes, Vivek, could you give us details about what really happened because we can see the visuals of a massive Pakistani flag being raised.\u201d The correspondent\u2019s answer was a reiteration of the anchor\u2019s claim.\n\nTimes of India, Deccan Chronicle, MyNation, OpIndia and Dainik Jagranwere other media outlets that carried similar reports claiming that the Muslim Student Front (MSF) raised the purported flag of Pakistan inside the college campus. It is noteworthy that the word \u201callegedly\u201d found no mention in the title of any of these stories. A few used the word inside the articles.\n\nThe alleged incident was also picked by Pakistani media. Many citizens of the nation shared Times Now\u2019s broadcast of the alleged event, including Major General Asif Ghafoor.\n\nOne of the firsts to tweet about the alleged incident before it was widely picked up on social media was ABP News journalist Pinky Rajpurohit.\n\nNot the Pakistani flag, but MSF flag\n\nThe police reportedly booked 30 students belonging to the MSF, a student body associated with the United Democratic Front, under Sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 153 (intent to cause riot) and 149 (offence committed under unlawful assembly) of the IPC. The before-mentioned media outlets reported the police action without a basic fact-checking which reveals that the flag raised by the students was not the Pakistani flag but the flag of MSF.\n\nA Malayam portal azhimukham.com quoted MSF State Secretary Nishad K Salim as stating that the students had a minimum budget for campaigning for the polls set to be held on September 5. They got the flag stitched by a tailor who did not know the exact green-white ratio to be used. The MSF first hoisted the large flag with a mast which later broke, added Salim.\n\nA different video of the event shows the flag with the mast intact. This video was uploaded by Facebook user Abdul Jaleel Ct who wrote, \u201cThis video will show the truth\u201d.\n\nAlt News found another video of the event uploaded on Twitter. Both these videos establish that the flag raised in Silver Arts and Science College was not Pakistan\u2019s flag. The difference between the Pakistani flag and the MSF flag is distinct.\n\u2022 Pakistani flag has white on the left while the MSF flag has the colour at the bottom.\n\u2022 The crescent moon on the Pakistani flag is in the middle while on the MSF flag it\u2019s on the top left corner.\n\nA juxtaposition of the Pakistani flag and the MSF flag puts the distinction in perspective.\n\nIn the video viral on social media, the students can be seen holding the flag from all four corners in a horizontal position as the mast is absent. When we turn the flag upside-down, it looks the same as the one in the collage above \u2013 with the white at the bottom and the crescent moon on the top left corner.\n\nA controversy was created as the MSF flag raised in the college did not have the perfect green-white ratio which should\u2019ve been half and half. Speaking to Alt News, MSF General Secretary Navas informed, \u201cThe news is incorrect. It isn\u2019t the Pakistani flag which has white on the left. In the MSF flag, the white is at the bottom. If you see a photo of the upright flag, you can clearly see that the white is at the bottom. Moreover, in the MSF flag the crescent moon is on the left corner. A problem arose because we didn\u2019t ourselves make the flag because of its large size. The tailor who made it didn\u2019t know that the green-white ratio should\u2019ve been 1:1 and he made a flag with a 3:1 ratio.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time that an imperfect flag was waved by students. Images of the flag raised in Silver Arts College, Perambra in 2016 also show an imperfect colour ratio.\n\nFurthermore, while the official flag has an \u2018MSF\u2019 imprint on the bottom right, the student body has used flags without the imprint in past events as well.\n\nWhile an investigation is underway, there\u2019s little doubt that the flag raised was not the Pakistani flag but the flag of Muslim Student Front (MSF). Media outlets failed to highlight this fact in their report thus, giving credence to false claims. This wasn\u2019t an isolated incident when the flag of a Muslim body was mistaken to be that of Pakistan. The same misconception often arises in case of IUML flags and Islamic flags.\n\n[This article was updated on September 3, 2019, to include the video where students raised the flag without the \u2018MSF\u2019 imprint in a past event. Furthermore, India Today and ANI were erroneously included in the article. The same has been corrected.]", "lang": "en"}
