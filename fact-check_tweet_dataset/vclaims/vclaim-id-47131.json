There is no record to date of the bust being burned during recent protests.\n\nNumerous statues across the country have been vandalized amid protests against racial injustice and police brutality following the May 25 death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, in Minneapolis police custody, according to The Hill.\n\nFacebook users recently shared photos showing a burnt bust of Lincoln along with the claim that the damage happened during the first week of June in Chicago. One such post credits \u201canarchists\u201d with wrapping it in tar paper and setting it on fire.\n\nHowever, the incident pictured in the photos took place in 2017, roughly three years before the current protests started. Local NBC affiliate WMAQ included similar photos of damage in its report about the bust being vandalized in Chicago\u2019s Englewood neighborhood in August 2017. Chicago Ald. Raymond Lopez also posted a picture of the damage on Facebook at the time, calling it \u201can absolute disgraceful act.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that the bust has been torched during recent protests to date. Had it happened, local media outlets would have reported on it, yet they don\u2019t appear to have done so.
