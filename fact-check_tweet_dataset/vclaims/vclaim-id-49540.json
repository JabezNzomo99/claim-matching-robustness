They call the phones and, after a few seconds of ringing, the kernels suddenly start to pop \u2013 to the loud cheers of the disbelieving group.\n\nThis may seem like a handy hack for movie evenings, but the video has been debunked as a hoax many times.\n\nLouis Bloomfield, a physics professor at the University of Virginia, told technology news site\n\nA microwave oven heats the moisture inside a kernel, causing it to pop. Bloomfield said if mobile phones emitted that much energy, the water inside people\u2019s fingers would heat up. It\u2019s clearly false.\n\nWhere does the popcorn video come from?\n\nwas the mastermind behind the popcorn video, produced in 2008.\n\nthat the video was part of a viral marketing campaign to create brand awareness and engage users in a \u201cfun\u201d way. It reached more than 18 million people on YouTube in less than five weeks.\n\nIn the interview he reassures people that it can\u2019t really happen: you would need \u201c11 million units to accomplish that\u201d.\n\nBut how did they do it? Snopes\n\nthat popped popcorn was dropped onto the table from above the camera, and the kernels removed with digital editing.\n\nCould your phone fry your brain?\n\nSnopes debunked the video and a similar hoax claiming that phones\n\nBoth the egg and the popcorn hoax play on a common misbelief that microwave radiation burns your brain.\n\nThe scary question is, if a cell phone could modify the proteins in an egg, what could it do to the proteins in our brains?\n\nCharlie Ivermee, founder of the site that created the egg hoax,\n\n: \u201cThere was a lot of concern about people\u2019s brains getting fried and being from a radio/electronics background I found it all rather silly. So I thought I\u2019d add to the silliness.\u201d\n\nWhile the video is fun to watch, it remains just that: silliness. A cell phone can\u2019t pop popcorn or boil an egg \u2013 and it can\u2019t fry your brain.\n\nCell phones have now successfully replaced older technologies like the telegram, the camera, the scanner and the voice recorder. The one technology they are yet to replace is the microwave oven.", "lang": "en"}
