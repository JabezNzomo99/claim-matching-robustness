During White House Protests?", "subtitle": "The origin of the rumor \u2014 that internet and cell service went dark during police brutality protests near the White House \u2014 can be traced to a single Twitter account.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2020-06-02T21:05:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-45509", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/washington-dc-blackout/", "vclaim": "Internet and cell service for people protesting police brutality in Washington, D.C., turned off for a temporary \"blackout\" on June 1.\n\nOn June 1, 2020, during overnight protests against racism and police brutality in dozens of U.S. cities, Twitter became ground zero for this rumor that quickly rose to the top of the platform\u2019s trending topics: that authorities had blocked internet and cellphone service in Washington, D.C., as part of an allegedly nefarious scheme to control what protesters were doing.\n\nThe hashtag #dcblackout had almost a half-million tweets within a few hours, following a night of chaotic protests in American cities triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who was pinned to the ground by a white Minneapolis police officer on May 25, 2020, while he pleaded, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nThe posts, which also came under question on Reddit, claimed an unknown entity had somehow temporarily blocked hundreds of protesters from communicating with their cellphones in order for law-enforcement to crack down on fires and property damage near the White House and hide the destruction from public view.\n\nThe tweets included alarming text, some of which accurately pointed out that Secret Service agents had escorted U.S. President Donald Trump to an underground bunker for his safety during the protests. Others included photos or unedited videos of clashes between police officers and protesters, though it was not exactly clear from what city the media was recorded.\n\nHere\u2019s how the misinformation campaign began: According to BBC misinformation specialists, the idea of a network blackout in Washington, D.C., during the protests seemingly first appeared on a Facebook group titled Trump 2020, which had tens of thousands of subscribers and had later deleted the below-displayed post.\n\nThen, 30 minutes later, the hashtag appeared to have surfaced on Twitter from an account that, as of this writing, has five followers (including this Snopes reporter). The tweet read:\n\nAfter that, a second account tweeted what\u2019s below, and numerous accounts wrote posts with similar claims and included the #dcblackout hashtag.\n\nWithin a few hours, the claim had spread across tens of thousands of feeds and people nationwide were chiming in on the alleged controversy. No evidence suggests that accounts with the highest engagement were based in the D.C. area, according to Shayan Sardarizadeh of the BBC.\n\nHowever, no evidence suggests that a blackout occurred.\n\nAccording to NetBlocks.org, an organization that tracks internet disruptions and shutdowns globally, there was \u201cno indication of a mass-scale internet disruption\u201d on May 31, 2020, or on the morning of June 1, 2020.\n\nAdditionally, news reporters who were covering the protests reported uninterrupted service during the hours in question, between roughly 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. EST.\n\nD.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham, who did not respond to Snopes\u2019 request for comment, told reporters on June 1, 2020, according to the Washington Post: \u201cThere was no communications loss that I saw in any shape or form.\u201d\n\nThen, as those refutes surfaced online, a second wave of posts began circulating in what appeared to be a part of a coordinated network to challenge the truth behind the original rumor, yet through a spam message:\n\nDarius Kazemi, a former fellow at the Mozilla Foundation and social media and bots researcher, told Mother Jones that while he was still in the process of investigating the situation, both accounts that spread the #dcblackout and refuted the claim were engaged in what appeared to be one massive, coordinated effort. He elaborated on Twitter: \u201cWhether it\u2019s bots (meaning automated software) or trolls (individuals or groups of individuals organizing to create chaos), I can\u2019t tell because the situation is rapidly evolving. \u2026Also it\u2019s very hard to tell what \u2018side\u2019 these accounts are on, as floating around I\u2019ve seen claims, counterclaims, counter-counterclaims, and even counter-counter-counterclaims.\u201d He said some accounts involved could have been hacked because they either quickly deleted the copy-paste spam posts or authored follow-up messages saying that they didn\u2019t mean to write about the alleged blackout.\n\nAsked about the misinformation campaign, Brandon Borrman, a spokesman for Twitter, told the Post:\n\nAdditionally, when we asked the district\u2019s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency confirmed about the rumor, Director Christopher Rodriguez said in emailed statement the agency had identified \u201csome instances\u201d of a disinformation campaign, and his office has passed evidence to the local police department and federal authorities, including the F.B.I and U.S. Department of Homeland Security, for further investigation.\n\nIn sum, given no evidence exists of an internet or cell service blackout in Washington, D.C., during the in-question time period, as well as protest organizers and city authorities refuting the claim and analysis by misinformation experts that had dubbed the rumor part of a coordinated communications effort, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
