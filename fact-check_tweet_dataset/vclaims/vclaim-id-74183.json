In 1919, the NAACP dubbed the song as the Black national anthem. It gained contemporary significance when sung during the Black Lives Matter protests that swept across the U.S. in the spring of 2020.\n\nThe move by the NFL was viewed as an empty gesture by some. Writing for Deadspin, journalist Carron J. Phillips criticized the league for including the song while failing to reinstate former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick.\n\nIn 2016, Kaepernick began kneeling during the country\u2019s traditional national anthem before games in protest against police violence against the Black community. The protest caught on with other players, but drew heat from right-wing media commentators, President Donald Trump, and his supporters. Kaepernick\u2019s contract with the team wasn\u2019t renewed, and Kaepernick has been a free agent since 2016.\n\n\u201c\u2026 instead of addressing issues that it could easily fix the NFL has decided that the best way to stand against injustice is to \u2026 play a song,\u201d Phillips wrote.\n\nIt\u2019s true that news reports indicate the NFL is planning to play the song \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing\u201d before Week 1 games of the 2020 season, which starts in September, before playing the national anthem, \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d However, this is only being discussed for Week 1, not the entire season. Additionally, we were unable to independently confirm with the NFL that official plans were in place to play the song. Therefore, we rate this claim as a \u201cMixture.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
