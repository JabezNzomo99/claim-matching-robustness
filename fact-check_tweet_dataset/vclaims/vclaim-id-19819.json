No, that's not true: the story was made up by a \"fauxtire\" website and it internally contradicts itself. The entire thing is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by 8Shit on August 6, 2018 titled \"Florida Man Stabs His Best Friend For \"Liking\" His Memes Instead Of Reacting With \"Haha\"\" (archived here) which opened:\n\n19-year old Martin Buggs was arrested yesterday after allegedly killing his best friend, Jacob Cockburn, after a 3-hour argument. The incident happened in Miami, when Martin and Jacob were arguing about Facebook reactions. According to Martin himself, Jacob \"refused to use the 'haha' react for good memes\", because he thought that the like button was more than enough. Martin shares memes every day on Facebook and he also tags his friends. He expects a \"haha\" react if the meme made them laugh, but Jacob refused to give him what he wanted. After a 3-hour argument, things heated up and Martin stabbed his so-called \"best friend\" 3 times in the chest. A neighbor called the police because they were making too much noise and he (the neighbor) was playing Fortnite. The police came to the scene and arrested Martin. Jacob was rushed to hospital and is slowly getting better.\n\nSo after being arrested after \"allegedly killing\" his friend, the friend was rushed to hospital where he is \"slowly getting better\". Medical technology is incredible these days... if the story were true.\n\nBut the mugshot being used to illustrate the story actually depicts Christopher Moore, who was accused of being in a fatal hit-and-run in 2016:\n\nFurthermore, 8shit.net carries a disclaimer on its about page that reads:\n\nAnd an additional disclaimer in the footer of every page:\n\n8Shit is a satire news and humor website.
