In theory, the bills are drafted in committees, but the reality is that hard work is often done behind the scenes, where lawmakers haggle over details and cut deals. Sometimes secrecy is essential, because if some details become public too soon, opponents have more time to build opposition.\n\nWe asked Mulvaney\u2019s staff for evidence of his statement. We did not receive anything specific. Instead, we were told \u201cthe director was contrasting a process where Nancy Pelosi told us that you \u2018had to pass the bill so you can find out what\u2019s in it\u2019 with the current one which is trying to clean up the resulting mess.\u201d The suggestion was that Mulvaney was talking about the chaotic end game that led to passage of the Affordable Care Act in both Houses of Congress.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve heard about the controversies within the bill, the process about the bill, one or the other. But I don\u2019t know if you have heard that it is legislation for the future, not just about health care for America, but about a healthier America, where preventive care is not something that you have to pay a deductible for or out of pocket. Prevention, prevention, prevention \u2014 it\u2019s about diet, not diabetes. It\u2019s going to be very, very exciting. But we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it, away from the fog of the controversy.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic process began in March 2009, when three committee chairmen (Education and Labor, Energy and Commerce, and Ways and Means) agreed to work together to try to avoid competing bills. After holding more than a dozen hearings between March and May, the committee chairmen released a \u201cdiscussion draft\u201d proposal on June 19, 2009. Each of the committees then held additional hearings in June, with the House Energy and Commerce Committee even holding a three-day session. (The full list of hearings is available on pages 61-67 of this 2009 House report.)\n\nCannan noted that the votes in two of the committees amounted to \u201chousekeeping rather than robust debate,\u201d though the version that emerged from Energy and Commerce (with a more conservative makeup) was scaled back after hard bargaining between various lawmakers. The three bills were not reported to the floor until Oct. 14, a delay in part because the House was waiting for the Senate to move forward as well. Moreover, House leaders worked behind the scenes to come up with a compromise that would win enough votes for passage.\n\n\u201cMuch of the legislation that\u2019s being announced today has been available for review and comment for over three months online so that every American could read it and give us their input,\u201d said House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) when the bill was introduced. \u201cWe will keep our promise and commitment to the integrity of this process by making the bill\u2019s full text, which will be online, as the speaker said, as we speak, and the manager\u2019s amendment, to make sure we have this exactly right, publicly available for 72 hours before the members are asked to vote, and by ensuring a full floor debate.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s pause here a moment and see what we have. We have about 20 hearings, many aired on C-SPAN. That\u2019s 18 more than the current replacement bill. On top of that, the bills were available to read for many days (though, frankly, legislative language is rather dense for most laypeople). So Mulvaney\u2019s comments are clearly wrong.\n\nThe Senate process was even more transparent, with many days of hearings and lengthy markups. The drafting of the bill in the Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee took from June 17 to July 14, during which 500 amendments were made. In the Finance Committee, which drafted its version between Sept. 22 and Oct. 2, there were 564 proposed amendments. Senate Majority leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) then announced a merged version of the two bills on Nov. 18. After a lengthy debate on the Senate floor \u2014 at one point a Republican lawmaker demanded the entire 767-page bill be read by a Senate clerk \u2014 an amended version was passed Dec. 24.\n\nThe two houses never had an official conference committee to merge the two versions because on Jan. 19, 2010, the Democrats lost their filibuster-proof majority with the election of a Republican to replace the late senator Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.). That left 59 Democrats in the Senate. Lawmakers then relied on a parliamentary procedure in the Senate known as reconciliation to allow passage of the law with a simple majority.\n\nUnder that process, the House passed the Senate bill and then both Houses passed a law amending it to deal with concerns in the House. That\u2019s one reason the number of pages \u2014 about 2,700 \u2014 seems so large. It\u2019s actually two bills. (The bills also included elements that had nothing to do with universal health care, such as an overhaul of student loans and long-term care legislation.) A consolidated version of the law, done by Michael Cannon of the Cato Institute, clocks in at 907 pages. (Correction: Cannon says he did not consolidate the law, he merely supplied it.)", "lang": "en"}
