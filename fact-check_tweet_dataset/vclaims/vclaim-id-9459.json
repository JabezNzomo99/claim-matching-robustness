(See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Was the definition of EJKs changed under the Duterte administration?)\n\nThere is no law defining EJKs in the Philippines, but jurisprudence and international conventions outline what these are.\n\nThe Supreme Court in a 2007 ruling defined \u201cextralegal\u201d killings, the internationally accepted term for EJKs, as \u201ckillings committed without due process of law.\u201d\n\nThe Minnesota Protocol, formally adopted by the United Nations in 1991, guides investigations of human rights violations around the world.\n\nAccording to the Center for International Law, the Minnesota Protocol covers deaths from police operations, where these deaths happened under conditions of excessive use of force.\n\nThe Aquino AO cited by Dela Rosa was purposely limited in its definition of EJKs.\n\n\u201cWhen the (Aquino administration) defined EJK, in a very limited way, that was because their mandate was only for those who were killed because they were journalists or because of political leaning,\u201d human rights lawyer Jose Manuel Diokno said in an earlier interview with VERA Files.\n\nThe definition was taken \u201cout of context\u201d by incumbent government officials, Diokno said.\n\nInter-Agency Committee (IAC) on Extra-Legal Kilings, Enforced Disappearance Meet to Adopt Guidelines on Investigation and Prosecution\n\nOfficial Annotations to the Rule on the Privilege of the Writ of Amparo\n\n(Guided by the code of principles of the International Fact-Checking Network at Poynter, VERA Files tracks the false claims, flip-flops, misleading statements of public officials and figures, and debunks them with factual evidence.
