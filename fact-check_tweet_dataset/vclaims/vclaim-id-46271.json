The reports state that Dr. Tiwari suffered a brain hemorrhage on the night of March 31, while she was on duty.\n\nVandana was a pharmacist and the caretaker of a girls hostel at Shivpuri Medical College in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nAlso, in the picture of the female cop, we noted the insignia on her uniform, is of the Uttar Pradesh Police.\n\nIn the above collage, it can be clearly seen that the injured female cop, is from UP police. However, NewsMobile could not independently identify the origin of this picture.\n\nWe found the second image in an article by Bhopal Samachar on Dr. Vandana Tiwari.\n\nThe above information proves that even though the news of the death of Dr. Vandana Tiwari is correct, the other claims attached to the post are FALSE.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
