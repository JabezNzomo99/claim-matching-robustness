We were able to establish that the image has been doctored through a simple reverse image search on Google, which led to the original picture.\n\nAlt News traced the image back to December 2017, when Amit Shah and PM Modi were seen sharing a dais at the swearing-in ceremony of Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur.\n\nAmit Shah\u2019s attire in the original image can be matched with the other photographs, featuring him, from the same event.\n\nIn the image posted below, the photoshopped image has been juxtaposed with the original picture.\n\nA digitally manipulated image was circulated on social media to bolster a \u2018tsunami\u2019 of people supporting Prime Minister Narendra Modi.", "lang": "en"}
