[1]\n\nAAP FactCheck investigated Mr Morrison\u2019s claim there is no change for wage earners paying the top tax rate of 45 per cent.\n\nThe Morrison government outlined its seven-year tax plan in the 2019-2020 budget. [2]\n\nThe budget papers show that the current highest tax bracket of 45 per cent is paid by people earning above $180,000. This is set to change in 2024-25 when the highest rate of 45 per cent will be paid by those earning above $200,000.\n\nThe budget papers show this will change the number of people in the top tax rate of 45 per cent. They show that without the changes that come into effect in 2024/25 those on the top tax rate would make up 8.0 per cent of the workforce. Under the new changes, those on the top tax rate would fall to 6.0 per cent of the workforce. [2]\n\nFrom July 1, 2024, Australians earning between $45,000 and $200,000 will also face a new marginal tax rate of 30 per cent. [2]\n\nIt means those paying the top tax rate will benefit financially from the government\u2019s planned changes that come into effect in 2024/25 because all taxpayers earning more than $45,000 will be taxed at 30 per cent, instead of 37 per cent on the amount they earn up to $200,000. [2]\n\nThose in the top tax bracket will also pay a lesser percentage of tax on their income that falls into the newly merged middle bracket. [3]\n\nThe government\u2019s own tax relief estimator shows those earning $180,000 will save $8,640 per year, and those earning $200,000 will pocket $11,640. [2] [4]\n\nThe Australia Institute, an independent think-tank that researches economic, social, transparency and environmental issues, analysed the impact of the government\u2019s tax changes.\n\nThe Institute found taxpayers earning more than $180,000 per year, that is those now in the highest tax bracket, will get at least $77 billion worth of tax cuts over 10 years from 2024-25 when the Morrison government's tax cuts are fully implemented. It also found the majority of that money - $64 billion - will go to those earning more than $200,000. [5]\n\nBased on this evidence, AAP FactCheck found Mr Morrison\u2019s claim he hasn\u2019t \u201cchanged anything for those earning on the top tax rate\u201d to be somewhat false. Based on the Government\u2019s planned changes, the top tax rate remains at 45 per cent but the number of people in that bracket will change and the amount of tax they pay will change.", "lang": "en"}
