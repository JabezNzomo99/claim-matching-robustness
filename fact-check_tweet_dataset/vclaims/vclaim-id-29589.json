Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be found here.\n\nClaim: The New Smart Passport -Concept of the future is here. The All-in-One Identity Solution for every Indian Citizen very soon. Fact: The images posted are just concept arts. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen images posted on Facebook are run through a Google Reverse Image search, a link to a \u2018Medium\u2019 article published two years back can be found in the search results. When looked at the article, it can found that the images were designed by a concept artist to showcase his skills and propose an alternative to the existing passport. In the article, a link to his blog can also be found, where the concept arts of Aadhaar can also be found.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s just a concept art; not the new look of the Indian Passport.", "lang": "en"}
