Elizabeth Warren said, \u201cWe are right now at \u2026 25,000 new infections a day and 2,000 deaths a day.\u201d\n\nLater in the day, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany called out Warren for using what she called \u201csome funny numbers.\u201d\n\n\u201cElizabeth Warren erroneously said there were 25,000 new cases today,\u201d McEnany said at a press conference. \u201cIn fact, there were less than 20,000. Sen. Warren said there were 2,000 deaths. In fact, there have been less than 1,000.\u201d\n\nMcEnany said she had discussed the statistics with Deborah Birx, the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force response coordinator, \u201cand she helped me to correct those numbers, which I\u2019d like to correct here. Because I think it\u2019s unfair to the American people to give inflated case numbers and mortality numbers, because it leads to those same Americans making the decision to not get a mammogram, to not have the cancer screenings they need.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s office declined to comment on the issue.\n\nThe disparity is largely a matter of semantics. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said \u201cnew infections a day,\u201d suggesting totals over a period of time. She used that phrase several times at the hearing. McEnany said \u201ctoday,\u201d which is much more limited, and \u201ctoday,\u201d of course, was far from over when Warren was questioning Fauci in the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing.\n\nThe argument comes as President Donald Trump has encouraged governors to reopen their states and some Democrats have questioned whether it\u2019s too soon to do so. In fact, Warren cited the numbers as she pressed Fauci on whether or not the novel coronavirus had been \u201ccontained\u201d and whether the U.S. had enough \u201crobust countermeasures\u201d in place.\n\nAs for the daily number of new cases, the rolling three-day average on May 11, the day before Warren asked her question, was 24,276, according to Our World in Data. That\u2019s pretty close to 25,000. On May 10, it was 26,979. In fact, the rolling three-day average was over 25,000 throughout the earlier part of the month except for May 6 and 7, when it was above 23,000. The total was above 30,000 on May 2 and 3.\n\nAccording to the COVID Tracking Project, there were 17,605 new cases on May 11. But the number of new cases was above 25,000 from May 7 through 9 and from April 28 through May 3, twice surpassing 30,000.\n\nThe three-day rolling average for the daily death toll was 1,286 on May 11, according to Our World in Data. But as recently as May 9, just three days before the hearing, that average was above 2,000 \u2014 2,034 \u2014 and on May 8 it was 2,245. It was as low as 1,289 on May 5, but it was above 2,000 from April 30 through May 2.\n\nAccording to the COVID Tracking Project, there were 837 deaths on May 11. There also were fewer than a thousand the day before that. The numbers fluctuated earlier in the month, twice surpassing 2,500, nearing 2,000 on another occasion and falling to 912 on May 3.\n\nSo, the numbers vary by day, making any figures about \u201ctoday\u201d \u2014 McEnany\u2019s word, not Warren\u2019s \u2014 different from a broader look at a period of time.", "lang": "en"}
