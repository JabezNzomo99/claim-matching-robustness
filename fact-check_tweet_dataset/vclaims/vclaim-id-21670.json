{"title": "Analysis | Please, can someone brief the president on the unemployment rate?", "subtitle": "The president clearly has no idea how the unemployment rate is calculated.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2017-04-04T19:11:50Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-21670", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/04/04/please-can-someone-brief-the-president-on-the-unemployment-rate/?utm_term=.342af77d35c9", "vclaim": "The data that makes up the unemployment rate comes from a monthly sample of 60,000 households, or about 110,000 people, from 800 geographic areas across the country. Each household is interviewed for four months, so each month about one-quarter of the households are changed. Census Bureau employees interview the households to determine whether people ages 16 and over have jobs, are seeking jobs or are out of the labor force.\n\u2022 People who are jobless, looking for a job and available for work are unemployed.\n\u2022 The labor force is made up of the employed and the unemployed.\n\u2022 People who are neither employed nor unemployed are not in the labor force.\n\nIn other words, a person working some period during the week is considered employed. A person who was laid off and is seeking a new job is unemployed. And a person who is a stay-at-home parent or retired is not in the labor force.\n\nTrump thus has it entirely backward. If you can\u2019t find a job and have given up looking for work, you are considered not in the labor force. You are not considered \u201cstatistically employed.\u201d However, within the \u201cnot in labor force\u201d category, you would be listed as wanting a job but either discouraged or marginally attached to the workforce. In the most common unemployment rate, known as the U-3, you are considered unemployed only if you are actively looking for a job. (There is an alternative rate, the U-4, which includes discouraged workers; the rate for February 2017 increases from 4.7 percent to 5 percent in the U-4.)\n\nSpeaking to the chief executives, Trump also repeated his Four-Pinocchio claim that \u201c100 million people\u201d are seeking jobs. \u201cA lot of those people came out and voted for me.\u201d Trump said. \u201cI call them the forgotten man, the forgotten woman. But a lot of those people \u2014 a good percentage of them \u2014 would like to have jobs, and they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTrump uses an exaggerated number for the people not in the labor force. But as we have explained repeatedly, most of those people \u2014 93 percent \u2014 do not want jobs. That\u2019s because they are people who are retired, students, stay-at-home parents or disabled.\n\nWe can only imagine the confusion among the corporate chieftains as they heard the president utter gibberish about the unemployment rate. Let\u2019s hope this briefing finds its way to the president and he speaks with more authority in the future.", "lang": "en"}
