We could have 600 million people pour into our country. Think of it. Once you have open borders like that, you don\u2019t have a country anymore,\" Trump said in Greeley, Colo., on Oct. 30, according to CBS News.\n\nBy the time Trump spoke in Albuquerque, the number had jumped to 650 million people. And Trump said it would happen \"in one week.\"\n\n\"She wants to let people just pour in. You could have 650 million people pour in, and we do nothing about it. Think of it. That\u2019s what could happen. You triple the size of our country in one week,\" Trump said.\n\nBoth claims are ridiculous and should be discarded immediately.\n\nThe worldwide population is about 7.3 billion people, and the United States is home to about 324 million.\n\nThe U.S. immigrant population in 2014 was more than 42.4 million, or 13.3 percent of the nation\u2019s total population, according to Migration Policy Institute estimates using Census Bureau data. That represents millions of people who have migrated to the United States over decades.\n\nThere are about 1 million daily legal crossings between the United States and Mexico -- that\u2019s a count of people going back and forth into each country.\n\nMexicans represent the single largest share of the U.S. total migrant population, about 27 percent in 2015, according to Migration Policy Institute. Yet, more Mexicans have left the United States than have come in since the end of the Great Recession, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nTo get close to Trump's 650 million migration, every single person from South America, Central America and Canada would have to move to the United States (about 633 million people), the Washington Post noted.\n\nTo do it, as Trump said, in one week, 3.87 million people would have to enter the country every hour for 168 straight hours. That's equivalent to the entire population of the city of Los Angeles entering the country every hour for a full week.\n\nWhile Trump's claim is logistically impossible, it's also in no way what Clinton proposes.\n\nWe asked Trump\u2019s campaign where the candidate was drawing his information from and they circled back to their claim that Clinton is for open borders, something we've rated False or Mostly False depending on the particulars of what Trump said.\n\nThe Clinton campaign said she did not support allowing 650 million people into the country. \"This is just demonstrably false,\" said Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nSo what is Clinton\u2019s policy?\n\nAt campaign events, presidential debates, press conferences and on the immigration reform page on Clinton\u2019s campaign website, there has been no mention of Clinton wanting millions of people to pour into the United States, much less in a week. She has not called for open borders.\n\nIn September 2015, Clinton said in a CBS\u2019 Face the Nation interview the United States should accept 65,000 Syrian refugees afflicted by that country\u2019s civil war.\n\n\"We're facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II and I think the United States has to do more,\" Clinton said. She has stressed a need for thorough refugee vetting.\n\nBased on Clinton\u2019s September 2015 comment, Trump recently made the False assertion that Clinton would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term.\n\nClinton has not said that, and Trump\u2019s statement was based on assumptions.\n\nClinton does support increasing immigration for high-skilled workers and entrepreneurs. But there's been no reference to millions of people migrating to the United States.\n\nFinally, the Democratic presidential nominee has widely spoken about offering a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally and to introduce comprehensive immigration reform within her first 100 days in office.\n\nClinton has said she would focus on deporting those who pose a violent threat to public safety.\n\nIn 2013, Clinton supported legislation (which never passed) that included a path to citizenship, billions for border security, fencing along the Mexican border and adding 20,000 border agents.\n\nTrump said Clinton \"wants to let people just pour in. You could have 650 million people pour in, and we do nothing about it. Think of it. That\u2019s what could happen. You triple the size of our country in one week.\"\n\nClinton has never said that, nor is this a realistic possibility. Clinton has spoken in favor of bring in 65,000 Syrian refugees, but that\u2019s nowhere near hundreds of millions of people, and not in a week.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.
