Why? McConnell: In the last 100 years, three presidents suffered big defeats in Congress in their first term and then won reelection: Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, and the most recent example, Bill Clinton. I read a lot of history anyway, but I am trying to apply those lessons to current situations in hopes of not making the same mistakes. NJ: What have you learned? McConnell: After 1994, the public had the impression we Republicans overpromised and underdelivered. We suffered from some degree of hubris and acted as if the president was irrelevant and we would roll over him. By the summer of 1995, he was already on the way to being reelected, and we were hanging on for our lives. NJ: What does this mean now? McConnell: We need to be honest with the public. This election is about them, not us. And we need to treat this election as the first step in retaking the government. We need to say to everyone on Election Day, \u201cThose of you who helped make this a good day, you need to go out and help us finish the job.\u201d McConnell: The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president. NJ: Does that mean endless, or at least frequent, confrontation with the president? McConnell: If President Obama does a Clintonian backflip, if he\u2019s willing to meet us halfway on some of the biggest issues, it\u2019s not inappropriate for us to do business with him. NJ: What are the big issues? McConnell: It is possible the president\u2019s advisers will tell him he has to do something to get right with the public on his levels of spending and [on] lowering the national debt. If he were to heed that advice, he would, I imagine, find more support among our conference than he would among some in the Senate in his own party. I don\u2019t want the president to fail; I want him to change. So, we\u2019ll see. The next move is going to be up to him.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s start with the big picture. Over the past week, some have said it was indelicate of me to suggest that our top political priority over the next two years should be to deny President Obama a second term in office. But the fact is, if our primary legislative goals are to repeal and replace the health spending bill; to end the bailouts; cut spending; and shrink the size and scope of government, the only way to do all these things it is to put someone in the White House who won\u2019t veto any of these things.\u201d\n\nPelosi did not di\u00adrect\u00adly an\u00adswer but in\u00adstead harked back to this 2010 inter\u00adview. But nowhere in McConnell\u2019s com\u00adments can we find a line like: \u201cThe most im\u00adport\u00adant thing we can do is to make sure he does not suc\u00adceed.\u201d Drew Hammill, a Pelosi spokesman, said it was a par\u00ada\u00adphrase of this line: \u201cThe sin\u00adgle most im\u00adport\u00adant thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\u201d\n\nWe ob\u00advi\u00adous\u00adly don\u2019t fact-check o\u00adpin\u00adion. But clear\u00adly Pelosi\u2019s par\u00ada\u00adphrase bears little re\u00adla\u00adtion\u00adship to what McConnell ac\u00adtu\u00adal\u00adly said in 2010 \u2014 he even said he did not want Obama to fail \u2014 and we are flum\u00admoxed how this an\u00ado\u00addyne po\u00adlit\u00adi\u00adcal state\u00adment then is twist\u00aded into be\u00ading an allegedly rac\u00adist state\u00adment. McConnell was a tough cus\u00adtom\u00ader for Obama, his po\u00adlit\u00adi\u00adcal op\u00adpos\u00adite, but they did cooperate when their in\u00adter\u00adests were in sync.", "lang": "en"}
