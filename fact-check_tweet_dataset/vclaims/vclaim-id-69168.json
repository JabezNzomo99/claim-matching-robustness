He said it felt completely orchestrated.\"\n\nTo prove his point, Marlow played the following clip from the Nov. 12 edition of NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.\n\n\"Charlie Cook, is Mitch McConnell, the way he's been-- this clearly felt almost orchestrated, Todd said. \"The minute, within an hour, this came out, many of the McConnell allies came out and said, 'He's got to go.' Sounds like Mitch McConnell has decided it's worse if Roy Moore wins.\"\n\nMarlow said that clip was \"all you need to hear,\" and Bannon agreed, saying \"You\u2019ve got to play that 20 times now til the end of the show.\"\n\nBut Todd wasn\u2019t referring to the report about Moore's alleged actions when he said \"it felt completely orchestrated.\" In fact, he never questioned the allegations.\n\nInstead, Todd was asking pundit Charlie Cook about the implications for the Republican Party.\n\nThe \"orchestrated\" comment was in reference to the Senate Majority Leader\u2019s condemnation of Moore a little over an hour after the report went live.\n\n\"If these allegations are true, he must step aside,\" McConnell said to reporters on Nov. 9.\n\nOther Republican senators echoed McConnell\u2019s sentiments that day, including Richard Shelby, Tim Scott, Rob Portman, John Cornyn, Cory Gardner, Susan Collins, Steve Daines, Mike Lee, Lisa Murkowski, David Perdue, Ben Sasse and John McCain.\n\n\"I think Mitch McConnell thinks that this is just so horrible that it's not under his control, so he's got to live with whatever happens,\" Cook said. \"I think if the voters of Alabama, if they choose to vote for Roy Moore, I think the Senate's obliged to seat him.\"\n\nBannon said Chuck Todd said the Roy Moore story \"felt completely orchestrated.\"\n\nBut the Meet the Press clip Bannon cited showed Todd was talking about the Republican response to the Washington Post report on sexual assault allegations against Moore, not the report itself. Todd never questioned the report\u2019s validity.", "lang": "en"}
