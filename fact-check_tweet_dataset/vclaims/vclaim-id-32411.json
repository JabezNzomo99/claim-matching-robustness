Do you love your Family!? (sic) Get one for them.\"\n\nIt was first posted on February 17, 2020, and had gotten 33,000 views, 164 reactions, 70 comments, and 62 shares as of Monday, February 24.\n\nFurther, the video claims that the mask has a built-in air filter that can filter the air by blocking viruses and bacteria, reducing the risk of infection.\n\nThe post describes the mask as one that is reusable, washable, and \"10 times better and safer\" than ordinary masks. It adds that limited stocks of the mask remain, coupled with the link for where to purchase the mask.\n\nThe facts: The mask for sale is the Monata reusable dust pollution mask, which is used for woodworking, house cleaning, gardening, and other outdoor activities.\n\nThere were also no reports of the release of an \"official\" mask meant to combat the novel coronavirus. The World Health Organization (WHO) made no such announcement either.\n\nUsing reverse image search, Rappler found that the product displayed on the BioEstics page is the Monata reusable dust pollution mask that is being sold on Amazon and Walmart.\n\nThe BioEstics page used the same photos as the ones displayed on the Amazon and Walmart pages for the Monata mask.", "lang": "en"}
