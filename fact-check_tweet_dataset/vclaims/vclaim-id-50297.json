No, that's not true: The claim that nearly 200,000 cases of an unnamed \"virus\" and \"10,000 confirmed deaths\" is a hoax. The CDC counted 25 deaths and 647 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States as of March 10, 2020.

The tweet specifically targeted people aged 55 and older - who, according to studies, are more prone to vote than other populations.", "lang": "en"}
