O'Brien said that Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman was being removed from the NSC.\n\nHowever, O'Brien did not state that Vindman had been \"fired\" or \"removed\" from the NSC, nor did he offer a timeline for when Vindman would be rotated back to his department.\n\nO'Brien said during an interview that Vindman, like other NSC staff at the White House, would eventually be rotated back to his own department.\n\nOn Oct. 29, 2019, U.S. Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who oversaw Ukraine policy at the White House in his role as Director for European Affairs for the United States National Security Council (NSC), famously testified to House impeachment investigators that he believed President Trump had undermined national security by appealing to Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his (i.e., Trump\u2019s) political rivals:\n\nVindman told the committees he \u201cdid not think it was proper\u201d for the president to insist that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky open investigations into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, as well as Burisma, the energy company that employed Hunter Biden. He said he reported his concerns to the lead counsel at the NSC. \u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained,\u201d Vindman said. \u201cThis would all undermine U.S. national security.\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 10, U.S. National Security Advisor Robert C. O\u2019Brien was interviewed by host Margaret Brennan on the CBS Sunday morning news program \u201cFace the Nation\u201d and answered a question about Vindman\u2019s status in a way some people interpreted to mean that Vindman had been, or was about to be, \u201cfired\u201d from the NSC:\n\nFace the Nation\u2019s own Twitter feed helped stoke those rumors with a tweet declaring that Vindman would be \u201cremoved\u201d from the NSC:\n\nIn fact, what O\u2019Brien said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d was more detailed and nuanced than simply declaring that Vindman would be \u201cfired\u201d or \u201cremoved\u201d from the NSC imminently. As he explicated, personnel are temporarily detailed from other government departments and agencies to the White House to serve on the NSC, and eventually they are sent back to their own agencies and replaced by new detailees. Moreover, he stated, the current administration felt the NSC was \u201cbloated\u201d and wanted to reduce its headcount by about 50%. Therefore, Vindman \u2014 like everyone else detailed to the NSC \u2014 would at some indeterminate time in the future be rotated back to his department:\n\nQ: Lt. Col Vindman, who has testified under oath, is serving on the National Security Council currently. Will he continue to work for you despite testifying against the President? A: One of the things I talked about is that we\u2019re streamlining the National Security Council; it got bloated to like 236 people from up from 100 in the Bush administration under President Obama. We\u2019re streamlining the National Security Council. There are people that are detailed from different departments and agencies. My understanding is that Col. Vindman is detailed from the Department of Defense. So everyone who\u2019s detailed at the NSC, people are going to start going back to their own departments and we\u2019ll bring in new folks. But we\u2019re going to get that number down to around 100 people, that\u2019s what it was under Condoleezza Rice; she came and met with me, I met with a number of my successors [sic?]. We don\u2019t need to recreate the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, over at the White House. We\u2019ve got great diplomats and soldiers and folks that do that work for us in their departments. Q: Just to button that up, though, you\u2019re saying Lt. Col. Vindman is scheduled to rotate out. You are not suggesting in any way that there will be retaliation against him? A: I never retaliated against anyone, so \u2026 Q: But his time is coming to an end? A: There\u2019ll be a point for everybody who\u2019s detailed there that their detail will come to an end and they\u2019ll go back to their agency, and what we want them to do is take the experience and skills they learned at the White House, take it back to their departments and agencies, and do an even better job there. And so we\u2019re grateful that we can have these detailees come in, and they\u2019ll come spend a year, maybe a little bit more, at the White House, and they\u2019ll go back to their agency, and they\u2019ll do a better job at their agency.\n\nLater that day, CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta tweeted that Vindman was \u201cstill at National Security Council\u201d for the time being:\n\nCBS News correspondent Paula Reid also reported that Vindman\u2019s attorney stated he was not aware of any changes in his client\u2019s status, that Vindman \u201cstill has a job,\u201d and that Vindman\u2019s detail was not scheduled to end until July 2020:\n\nHow much longer Lt. Col. Vindman\u2019s tenure at the NSC lasts remains to be seen.\n\nA new chapter unfolded in this story on Feb. 7, 2020, when news first broke that Lt. Col. Vindman was \u201cousted\u201d from his job and escorted from the White House.\n\nDavid Pressman, an attorney for Vindman, said in a statement, \u201cThe truth has cost Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman his job, his career, and his privacy.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
