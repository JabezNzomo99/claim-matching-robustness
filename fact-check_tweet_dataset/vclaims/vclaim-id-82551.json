BOOM has busted Pradhan several times in the past for sharing misinformation.\n\nHowever, Banerjee also mentioned people of other faiths and not just Muslims. The image was also debunked by India Today.\n\nThe line has been carefully used from Banerjee\u2019s speech from the Brigade ground rally.\n\nBelow is the LIVE video that Banerjee has shared on her official Facebook page.\n\nClose to the end of her speech at 3:55:24 Banerjee can be seen as saying in Hindi, \u201cTyaag ka naam hai Hindu, Imaan ka naam hai Musalmaan, pyar ka naam hai isai, sikho ka naam hai balidaan, ye hai hamara pyara Hindustaan.\u201d (Sacrifice is a synonym for Hindu, faith is a synonym for Muslims, love is a synonym for Christians, martyrdom is synonym for Sikhs. This is our beloved India.\u201d\n\nThe screen grab is originally from NDTV Khabar's live telecast of the India United Rally. Below is the link of the coverage.\n\nYou can stream to 20.52 for the moment when Mamata Banerjee's reference to the religions has been made into a text graphic.", "lang": "en"}
