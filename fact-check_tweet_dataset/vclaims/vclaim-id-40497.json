I Love You,\u201d a book of sayings compiled by author H. Jackson Brown Jr. Published in 1990, the full expression encourages readers to \u201cthrow off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.\u201d\n\nAlthough Brown credited his mother with the saying, it was only a matter of years before others erroneously attributed the quote to Twain, author of American classics like \u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\u201d and \u201cLife on the Mississippi.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller reached out to several experts, none of whom thought the quote was authentic. It appears nowhere in his collected works.\n\n\u201cThough he\u2019s not the source of this aphorism, Twain did frequently endorse the benefit of taking risks and trying new things, particularly exploring unfamiliar places and cultures,\u201d Matthew Seybold, assistant professor of American literature at Elmira College and editor-in-chief of MarkTwainStudies.org, told The Daily Caller in an email.\n\nSeybold pointed to Twain\u2019s 1869 work \u201cThe Innocents Abroad\u201d as one example.\n\n\u201cTravel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts,\u201d Twain wrote. \u201cBroad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things can not be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one\u2019s lifetime.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
