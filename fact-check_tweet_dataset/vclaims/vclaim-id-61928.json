While in one picture he can be seen reading a newspaper, in the other he can be seen clicking pictures of ducks moving around.\n\nThe same picture was also shared by the Congress party.\n\nNewsMobile fact checked the posts and found that the picture in circulation is old.\n\nThe first thing we noticed was how different PM Modi looked in the viral picture as compared to his recent pictures.\n\nWe then put the picture through Reverse Image Search and found links to few posts on Yandex from 2015 featuring the same image under \u2018Never Seen Pics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019 header.\n\nUpon further investigation, we found the second picture in a blog post dated 2012. It should also be noted that PM Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat at that time.\n\nWe also noted that PM Modi was wearing the same clothes in both the picture.\n\nWe also found some more of his pics from the same location and setting.\n\nHence, the above fact check proves that the posts are misleading as the pictures in circulation are old.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
