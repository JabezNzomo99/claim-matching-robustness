The vaccine pictured, ScourGuard 4K, is a vaccine for \u201cpregnant cows and heifers\u201d to help prevent diarrhea in their calves caused by bovine coronavirus and other microbes. As its name suggests, bovine coronavirus is a virus that infects cattle.\n\u2022 The novel coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, was first publicly reported in late 2019. The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and has since spread internationally \u2014 infecting more than 90,000 people to date. More than 3,000 people have died.\n\u2022 Many credible news outlets, citing experts, have actually suggested face masks are not a certain preventative measure for the general public to protect itself from the virus. U.S. government officials have requested Americans not purchase such masks and instead leave them available for health care workers.\n\nChristina Lood, a spokeswoman for Zoetis, the manufacturer for the vaccine in question, told us in an email that \u201cScourGuard 4KC is licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for the vaccination of as an aid in preventing diarrhea in their calves caused in part by bovine coronavirus.\u201d (Emphasis Lood\u2019s.)\n\nLood noted that the bovine coronavirus and the 2019 novel coronavirus, both of which are betacoronaviruses, are from different lineages \u2014 and said that \u201cvery little cross protection has been demonstrated between\u201d the two subgroups of betacoronavirus.\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s little evidence to suggest the vaccine used to protect cattle from the bovine coronavirus would be effective in vaccinating against the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe posts could also leave the wrong, and harmful, impression that the cattle vaccine can be used by humans.\n\n\u201cUnder no circumstance should people vaccinate themselves with any animal vaccine,\u201d Jeremy Schefers, an assistant professor in the department of veterinary population medicine at the University of Minnesota, said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous and likely won\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve previously explained, there is not yet a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has said a vaccine won\u2019t be ready for \u201ca year to a year-and-a-half,\u201d at best.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also has said it \u201cdoes not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.\u201d It instead suggests masks be worn by people \u201cwho show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).\u201d\n\nThe CDC has outlined other preventative measures, such as avoiding close contact with those who are sick; avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth; and washing hands and surfaces regularly.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can\u2019t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!\u201d Twitter. 29 Feb 2020.", "lang": "en"}
