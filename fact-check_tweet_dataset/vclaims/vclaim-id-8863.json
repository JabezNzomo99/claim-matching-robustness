(Gingrich did not respond to us.)\n\nTo measure the accuracy of Gingrich\u2019s comment, we isolated the largest 50 U.S. cities using . We then calculated the percentage of people in each city who are living below the federal poverty line, thanks to this that relied on Census Bureau data.\n\nFrom there, we created a list of the 20 biggest U.S. cities with the largest percentage of people living below the federal poverty level (about $11,500 for one person).\n\nAnd finally, we researched the political party of the mayor in each city.\n\nComparing poverty rates and political affiliation in large U.S. cities\n\nAs you can see, out of the top 5 poorest major cities, two are led by Republicans -- Miami and Fresno, Calif. When we expand that to the top 20, we find three Republican mayors. For the record, New York -- which prompted the discussion -- ranked 25th out of the top 50 cities. Current New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has served as both a Republican and an independent.\n\nUniversity of Michigan population studies professor Sheldon Danziger suggested analyzing state poverty levels and matching those with governors\u2019 political ties would be more accurate than honing in on cities.\n\nLike we said at the outset, we\u2019re staying away from drawing conclusions about poverty in U.S. cities and the political affiliation of their elected leader. We\u2019re simply analyzing the statistics behind Gingrich\u2019s comment.\n\nGingrich emphasized that every major, poor U.S. city is run by Democrats. We found two cities in the top 5 poorest, and three in the top 20, that have Republicans at the helm. Yes, most cities on the list are led by Democrats, but Gingrich said \"every.\" As such, we rate his statement Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
