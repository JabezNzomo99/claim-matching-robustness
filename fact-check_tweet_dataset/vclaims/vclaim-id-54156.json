For weeks in January, February and half of March, Trump played down the threat of the new virus, insisting it would disappear on its own.\n\nOn Jan. 20, Fauci told CNN: \u201cIt really is an evolving situation, and we have to be prepared for the worst. I mean, I don\u2019t think there is cause for panic on anyone\u2019s part, but we certainly need to be following it and watching this very carefully.\u201d A month later, on Feb. 22, he also told CNN, \u201cIf this evolves into a pandemic, there\u2019s no way we in the United States are going to escape having more infections in this country.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 29, on the \u201cToday\u201d show, Fauci was asked whether daily routines should be changed. \u201cRight now, at this moment, there\u2019s no need to change anything that you\u2019re doing on a day-by-day basis. Right now the risk is still low, but this could change,\u201d he responded. \u201cWhen you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread.\u201d\n\nIn May, as Trump pressed states to reopen faster, Fauci warned of \u201cneedless suffering and death\u201d if states failed to stick to federal guidelines. \u201cIf we skip over the checkpoints in the guidelines \u2026 then we risk the danger of multiple outbreaks throughout the country,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cThis will not only result in needless suffering and death but would actually set us back on our quest to return to normal.\u201d\n\n\u2018Dr. Fauci told me not to ban China\u2019\n\nOn Jan. 31, Trump announced that, effective Feb. 2, non-U.S. citizens were barred from traveling from China, but there were 11 exceptions. Meanwhile, U.S. citizens and permanent residents could still travel from China but were subject to screening and a possible 14-day quarantine. Trump\u2019s action did not take place in a vacuum. Many airlines were canceling flights, and by our count, at least 38 countries took similar action before or at the same time the U.S. restrictions were put in place.\n\nThe New York Times reported that officials at the National Security Council and the Department of Homeland Security initially pressed for travel restrictions. Once the public health officials, including Fauci, agreed to the idea on Jan. 30, the plan was brought to Trump in an Oval Office meeting: \u201cTrump was skeptical, though he would later claim that everyone around him had been against the idea. The two countries were in delicate trade negotiations. Was this the time to provoke China? he asked. And what about the consequences on the economy?\u201d\n\nThe New York Times calculated that at least 430,000 people arrived in the United States on direct flights from China since Jan. 1, including nearly 40,000 in the two months after Trump imposed restrictions. Screening was haphazard and inconsistent, according to the Associated Press: \u201cWhen U.S. residents flying from mainland China arrived at U.S. airports, the system meant to flag and monitor them for the development of symptoms lost track of at least 1,600 people in just the first few days the ban went into effect, according to an internal state government email obtained by the AP.\u201d\n\nFauci did say this, as did other health experts in the U.S. government. He says he was motivated by early fears that N95 masks needed by hospital workers would quickly run out of stock. Once science indicated that the virus was spread by people who were asymptomatic, the guidance was updated, because even fabric masks can help halt the spread if everyone wears them.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t regret anything I said then because in the context of the time in which I said it, it was correct. We were told in our task force meetings that we have a serious problem with the lack of PPEs [personal protective equipment] and masks for the health providers who are putting themselves in harm\u2019s way every day to take care of sick people,\u201d he said in an interview with InStyle magazine.\n\n\u201cWhen it became clear that the infection could be spread by asymptomatic carriers who don\u2019t know they\u2019re infected, that made it very clear that we had to strongly recommend masks,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the context of when we were not strongly recommending it, it was the correct thing. But our knowledge changed and our realization of the state of the outbreak changed.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its guidance on wearing masks on April 3. At the time of the announcement, Trump announced he would not be wearing a mask, stressing that the guidance was voluntary. For weeks, Trump suggested that people who wore masks were making a political statement against him. The Trump campaign even ran Facebook ads mocking former vice president Joe Biden for wearing a mask, complete with an image of a Chinese flag behind him. Trump at one point dismissed a reporter as being \u201cpolitically correct\u201d for wearing a mask.", "lang": "en"}
