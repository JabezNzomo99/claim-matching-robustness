And as with all other Democrat victories, it's looking like the Mayor cheated. At 5:47 P.M. Eastern, Fox News projected New York state Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis as the clear winner with a 19-point lead. But when the polls closed, de Blasio had cruised ahead to 65% compared to Malliotakis' 29.1%. This was shocking to many, but to none as much as New Yorkers who voted for Malliotakis only to see de Blasio's name on the printout. \"I don't know what happened. I voted for Nicole, but this thing says I voted for Bill,\" New York City resident Trebianca Jenkins told the New York Times.\n\nAll quotes in the article are fake and the links to 'official' news websites like the New York Times or The Blaze supposedly about the fraud just go to general pages, not to individual articles. The only real thing in the story is the link to the article with the election results which do show a 66.5% victory for de Blasio.\n\nSeveral other fake news sites have already copied the article but with one important omission:\n\nReagan Was Right carries a satire disclaimer at the bottom of the page which reads:\n\nAlso, the category the article was posted under was labeled \"Can You Fix My Computer\" if you needed more hints that the story was satirical in nature.\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites such as ourlandofthefree.com and thelastlineofdefense.online (formerly thelastlineofdefense.org). Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". He has at least one accomplice who writes under the pen names \"Freedom\", \"Captain Jellypants\", \"Butch Mannington\" or \"Captain Buck Atlantis\".\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.", "lang": "en"}
