Well why then every year are you cutting police budgets?\u201d \u201cOver the last few years we have had to make some really difficult decisions around public sector spending \u2026 In the budget last year we protected police spending and we've also increased the spending on this area: counter-terrorism, is going up 30%.\u201d \u201cYou have cut spending by 25% over five years\u201d\n\nEveryone has a point. Police funding in England and Wales has fallen over the last five years, and it\u2019s expected to stay flat over the next five. The government itself won\u2019t be putting in all the money to achieve that\u2014it will only be flat if local forces choose to raise additional money themselves.\n\nThe government also plans to increase counter-terrorism funding by 30% over this parliament.\n\nPolice funding is devolved in Scotland and there are separate arrangements for Northern Ireland.\n\nThat\u2019s according to estimates compiled by the National Audit Office. Overall funding fell by 18%, taking inflation into account. That compares to a 31% increase in funding between 2000/01 and 2010/11.\n\nThat 18% isn\u2019t what the government itself has cut from the budget. Direct government funding has fallen by 25% over the same period, which is what David Dimbleby is referring to. Most of the police budget comes from central government, but forces can also raise money locally via council taxes and this pot increased slightly over the period. That\u2019s why, overall, it\u2019s an 18% loss of funding.\n\nThis varies a lot locally. That 18% average ranges from a 12% fall in Surrey police force to a 23% fall in Northumbria. This is mainly because some forces, like Northumbria, rely more heavily on government grants and don\u2019t raise as much locally. Surrey, by contrast, was the only police force last year to raise more money locally than it got from the government.\n\nGovernment funding to the police will fall this parliament, but local forces can raise the difference themselves\n\nThe 2015 Spending Review promised to \u201cprotect overall police spending in real terms over the Spending Review period\u201d\u2014up to 2019/20, and that\u2019s reflected in more detailed estimates the government has published.\n\nThe central government part of that is actually expected to fall in real terms. It only stays flat overall if local Police and Crime Commissioners raise the maximum they\u2019re allowed to.\n\nThe government plans to spend 30% more on counter-terrorism by the end of the decade\n\nA small part of government police funding is ring-fenced for counter-terrorism, but the allocations to local areas aren\u2019t published for security reasons.\n\nIn the 2015 Spending Review, the government committed to \u201cspend 30% more overall in real terms on key counter-terrorism capabilities over the Parliament\u201d. This was reiterated by Theresa May in response to this week\u2019s terror attacks in London.\n\nIn 2017/18, \u00a3675 million has been set aside for counter-terrorism from government resource funding of about \u00a39.2 billion.", "lang": "en"}
