A constitutional lawyer, Mohamed is also a former legislator.\n\nKenya would save more money if it trimmed spending by the executive \u2013 the arm of government responsible for the daily management of a country.\n\n\u201cWhat is relevant is that the majority, 95%, of [budget] resources go to the executive,\u201d Mohamed\n\nthe three main arms of the state as:\n\u2022 None Parliament and the legislatures in 47 county governments\n\u2022 None The national executive and the executive structures in the counties \n\n \n\n\n\nIs almost all of Kenya\u2019s budget gobbled up by its executive arm of government?\n\nThe only beneficiaries of the budget are the executive, judiciary and parliament, Mohamed told Africa Check. In this context the executive was, of the three, the biggest drain on the country\u2019s coffers.\n\nBut is his estimate true for the whole budget, which not only funds the three arms of government but also covers obligations such as salaries and debt repayments?\n\nEven when \u201clooking at the global figure\u2026 the whole budget\u201d, the executive took the lion\u2019s share, Mohamed said.\n\nIn its most recent\n\n, Kenya\u2019s treasury said the country spent KSh2.11 trillion in the 2017/18 financial year. The three arms of the government accounted for more than half (KSh1.14 trillion) of this:\n\nIn this table, the executive\u2019s share of the budget for the three arms of government is 96.5%.\n\nMoney first set aside for compulsory payments\n\nThe national government\u2019s income is collected into what is known as the\n\n. The fund first provides for payments it is obliged to make, such as debt repayments, salaries for some state officers and pensions. Only then are the government\u2019s three arms given their spending budgets.\n\nThis is according to John Kinuthia, lead research analyst at the\n\nKenya. The organisation works to provide information on budget spending to ordinary citizens.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, we take off the things that are like statutory payments that we have to do as a first charge on the consolidated fund, and completely get them out of the shareable revenue,\u201d Kinuthia told Africa Check.\n\nThese initial payments are known as\n\n. What remains is then shared between the national government and the 47 counties, Kinuthia said.\n\nExecutive spending in the 2017/18 financial year\n\nKenya\u2019s budget spending for 2017/18 was KSh2.11 trillion. The executive\u2019s share of this was 52%. Counties took KSh306.2 billion (14.5%) while KSh395.8 billion (18.7%) was used to\n\nprovide the executive with 46% of the total spend, or KSh1.411 trillion.\n\nThe estimates set aside KSh962.5 billion for\n\n, with the bulk of it, KSh870.6 billion, marked as public debt.\n\nConclusion: Kenya\u2019s executive takes largest share of budget, but not 95%\n\nFormer presidential adviser Abdikadir Mohamed claimed Kenya spent 95% of its money on the government\u2019s executive arm. This left little over for the other two arms, the judiciary and the legislature.\n\nIn 2017/18 the executive received 96.5% of the funds set aside for the three arms of the government. But the national budget is bigger than this, paying for other obligations such as salaries, pensions and debt.\n\nMohamed is right that the executive takes the lion\u2019s share of resources, but that share is not as high as 95%. In the 2017/18 financial year the executive received 52% of the total budget, while in 2018/19 it will get a lower amount of 46%.", "lang": "en"}
