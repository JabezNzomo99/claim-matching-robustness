President Jacob Zuma delivered the party\u2019s\n\nIn this report, we fact-check claims Zuma made about job creation, load-shedding, housing, the matric pass rate, university funding and life expectancy.\n\nAt the time of publishing this report, we had not received a response from the ANC to questions asking for the source of Zuma\u2019s statistics. (\n\nSouth African employment data is typically reported through two sets of statistics collected by\n\nThe Quarterly Labour Force Survey is based on household surveys conducted by Stats SA in which data is collected on the work activities of people between 15 and 64 years. The Quarterly Employment Survey complements the Quarterly Labour Force Survey but in this case, businesses are surveyed to get data on formal sector jobs.\n\nWhile 67,000 jobs were created during the second quarter of 2016, the quarterly labour force data showed that in the first six months of last year, the country recorded net losses of 26,000 manufacturing jobs.\n\nBetween January and October 2016 a net of 55,000 manufacturing jobs was lost.\n\nData from Stats SA\u2019s Quarterly Employment Survey doesn\u2019t support Zuma\u2019s claim either. It\n\n, with overall manufacturing job losses of 19,000 in that time. In the first six months of 2016, South Africa recorded net job losses amounting to 26,000 manufacturing jobs.\n\nTherefore neither the Stats SA datasets backs up Zuma\u2019s claim. But why is there a discrepancy between the two?\n\nthat they are dependent on the data businesses supply. Improving the collection of such data, through better administrative systems in business, will help the agency reduce the wide differences between the two datasets. -\n\nThe phrasing of Zuma\u2019s claim suggests that there has been no load-shedding - planned electricity blackouts by South Africa\u2019s power utility Eskom to manage supply and demand - since August 2016. It appears to be an\n\nrecycled from Zuma\u2019s 2016 State of the Nation address.\n\nAt the time, it was incorrect because load-shedding last occurred on 14 September 2015,\n\n. It\u2019s still incorrect and due for an update from Zuma\u2019s speech writers.\n\nZuma\u2019s claim is correct if \u201cprogressed\u201d pupils are excluded from the calculation of the matric pass rate.\n\nnationally who failed grade 11 were allowed to move onto grade 12. Of these, 67,510 pupils went on to write their exams and 29,384 passed (43.5%).\n\nWhen progressed learners are included in the calculation, the Free State\u2019s pass rate\n\nStats SA publishes life expectancy data annually as part of its mid-year population estimates.\n\nLife expectancy for men and women rose from 59.9 years in 2012 to 61.6 in 2014,\n\n. The figure for 2016 is 62.4 years.\n\nStats SA is not the only organisation that produces life expectancy estimates for South Africa, however. Given that they are estimates, the figures all differ slightly, Dr Leigh Johnson from the University of Cape Town\u2019s school of public health and family medicine told Africa Check.\n\n- estimates that life expectancy increased from 60.7 years in 2012 to 62 in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe important point is that most of the agencies\u2019 estimates show that life expectancy has been increasing steadily,\u201d Johnson added.\n\nIf Zuma\u2019s numbers add up, it would mean that\n\nof South Africans live in housing provided by government.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s department of human settlements told Africa Check that the most recent available figures were from March 2016. The department\u2019s spokesman Ndivhuwo Mabaya directed us to a press release from April 2016 which stated that\n\nwhich had resulted in more than \u201c20 million people\u201d being \u201choused\u201d.\n\nMabaya said that the figure was calculated by multiplying the number of housing opportunities delivered by the average South African household size, which he said was 5 people according to Statistics South Africa.\n\nData provided by Statistics South Africa doesn\u2019t show this, however.\n\nshowed that on average a South African household was made up of 3.3 people. Based on Mabaya\u2019s explanation of the calculation, this would result in 14.2 million people being housed - not over 20 million.\n\nThere are other problems with the calculation.\n\nPrevious government estimates don\u2019t seem to align with the most recent measure.\n\n\u201cAt the very least, that they are using an inconsistent figure for household size,\u201d director of research and advocacy at the\n\nIn 2011/12, the department estimated that \u201cbetween 1994 and June 2011, the government built over three million homes for South Africans,\n\n. This would mean that there were on average\n\nclaimed that \"since 1994, the democratic government has delivered approximately 3.7 million subsidised housing opportunities for the very poor, giving a home to approximately 12.5 million people\". This works out to an average of\n\nIf Zuma and the department\u2019s most recent claim is true then it would mean that an additional 7 million people have been housed through a mere 600,000 housing opportunities since 2014. This would imply that on average 11.7 people live in each house that was delivered.\n\nHowever, not all \u201chousing opportunities\u201d are houses. The term refers to a number of different housing solutions.\n\nIt can refer to a house or subsidised rental accommodation. However, it can also refer to the provision of a \u201cserviced site\u201d. This is not a house. It is a piece of land, which should be supplied with water, electricity and sanitation, on which a recipient can build their own house.\n\nIn this case, a person can not be said to be \u201choused\u201d by the government. - Kate Wilkinson\n\nTo evaluate the claim, we need two main numbers: first, the latest available figure for how many students are enrolled across the higher education sector and secondly, the latest available figure for the number of students NSFAS covers. With this in hand, we can work out the percentage of students NSFAS supports.\n\nBut these figures are difficult to track down. We first contacted NSFAS and the department of higher education and training a week ago but they are yet to provide us with updated figures.\n\nThe latest available audited figures of the number of students enrolled in higher education are for 2014. A\n\nshows that 1,671,538 students studied at public universities as well as technical and vocational education and training (TVET) colleges in that year.\n\nreceived bursaries and loans from NSFAS in 2014, making up 24.8% of the total student enrollment at public institutions.\n\nWe managed to locate various preliminary figures for 2015, showing a\n\n, for a total of 1,730,725. The\n\nof NSFAS shows that 419,949 students were assisted in that year, a share of 24.2%.\n\nNSFAS expected to support 405,000 students in 2017, spokesman Kagisho Mamabolo told Africa Check. Given that this figure is in line with the numbers of 2014 and 2015, it is hard to see how Zuma\u2019s claim could be correct.\n\n4.33.4This claim is tricky because applications for NSFAS funding are still open . By \u201ccurrently\u201d, Zuma may therefore well be referring to how many students NSFAS expects to cover.https://africacheck.org/reports/did-zuma-keep-his-word-tracking-six-state-of-the-nation-address-promises/https://africacheck.org/reports/did-zuma-get-his-sona2016-facts-straight/", "lang": "en"}
