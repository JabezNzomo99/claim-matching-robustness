In her retelling, she was sent to places that her husband, President Bill Clinton, could not go because they were \u201ctoo dangerous.\u201d When her account was challenged by one of her traveling companions, the comedian Sinbad, she upped the ante and injected even more drama into the story. In a speech earlier this week, she talked about \u201clanding under sniper fire\u201d and running for safety with \u201cour heads down.\u201d\n\nHad Hillary Clinton\u2019s plane come \u201cunder sniper fire\u201d in March 1996, we would certainly have heard about it long before now. Numerous reporters, including The Washington Post\u2019s John Pomfret, covered her trip. A review of nearly 100 news accounts of her visit shows that not a single newspaper or television station reported any security threat to the first lady. \u201cAs a former AP wire service hack, I can safely say that it would have been in my lead had anything like that happened,\u201d said Pomfret.\n\nAmong the U.S. officials on hand to greet Clinton at the airport was Maj. Gen. William Nash, commander of U.S. troops in Bosnia. Nash told me that he was unaware of any security threat to Clinton during her eight-hour stay in Tuzla. He said, however, that Clinton had a \u201cbusy schedule\u201d and may have got the impression that she was being hurried on her way. (See clarification below.)\n\nAccording to Sinbad, who provided entertainment on the trip along with the singer Sheryl Crow, the \u201cscariest\u201d part was deciding where to eat. As he told Mary Ann Akers of The Post, \u201cI think the only \u2018red-phone\u2019 moment was: \u2018Do we eat here or at the next place.'\u201d Sinbad questioned the premise behind the Clinton version of events. \u201cWhat kind of president would say \u2018Hey man, I can\u2019t go \u2019cause I might get shot so I\u2019m going to send my wife. Oh, and take a guitar player and a comedian with you.\u201d\n\nI was on the plane with then First Lady Hillary Clinton for the trip from Germany into Bosnia in 1996. We were put on a C-17 \u2014 a plane capable of steep ascents and descents \u2014 precisely because we were flying into what was considered a combat zone. We were issued flak jackets for the final leg because of possible sniper fire near Tuzla. As an additional precaution, the First Lady and Chelsea were moved to the armored cockpit for the descent into Tuzla. We were told that a welcoming ceremony on the tarmac might be canceled because of sniper fire in the hills surrounding the air strip. From Tuzla, Hillary flew to two outposts in Bosnia with gunships escorting her helicopter.\n\nGen. Nash says that I misquoted him in saying he was unaware of any \u201csecurity threat\u201d to the first lady. While he was unaware of any \u201csniper threat,\u201d he now tells me there were a couple of \u201csecurity concerns\u201d that day, which he found out about after returning to his headquarters after greeting Clinton at the airport. There was a \u201cnon-specific report\u201d of a possible truck bomb in the area. The military also had information that \u201csome of the communications associated with the First Lady\u2019s visit were being monitored.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow let me tell you what I can remember, OK \u2014 because what I was told was that we had to land a certain way and move quickly because of the threat of sniper fire. So I misspoke \u2014 I didn\u2019t say that in my book or other times but if I said something that made it seem as though there was actual fire \u2014 that\u2019s not what I was told. I was told we had to land a certain way, we had to have our bulletproof stuff on because of the threat of sniper fire. I was also told that the greeting ceremony had been moved away from the tarmac but that there was this 8-year-old girl and, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t rush by her, I\u2019ve got to at least greet her \u2014 so I greeted her, I took her stuff and then I left, now that\u2019s my memory of it.\u201d\n\nI explained I was not going to contradict the briefer, but, whispering, I told him I seriously doubted we would encounter any such threat. For heaven\u2019s sake, I explained, it was a U.S. military base with thousands of troops, where there had not been a single such incident in the three months they had set up camp. He was relieved, but those more attentively listening to the briefer were not, as they contemplated that soon they could be running for their lives across an open tarmac a la \u201csniper alley\u201d in Sarajevo.\n\nThere were of course no snipers, and as the nervous passengers exited from the rear of the aircraft off an enormous steel ramp that could handle tanks and other tactical vehicles, we were greeted by a group of Bosnian children in colorful native dress. Hope none of them is a sniper, I thought. They presented Mrs. Clinton with bright bouquets of spring flowers that were quickly gathered up by aides while the first lady patted the children on the head \u2026 The visit seemed over before it began by the time we made our way back to the airstrip and boarded the C-17 for the flight to Germany. But the threat of snipers seemed to be all most people could remember.", "lang": "en"}
