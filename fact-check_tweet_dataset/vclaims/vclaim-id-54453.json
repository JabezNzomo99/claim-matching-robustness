Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe proposals were contained in a 110-page document called the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force Recommendations released July 8. They are just that \u2014 recommendations. Trump refers to the document as Biden\u2019s \u201cunity platform,\u201d but the Democratic Party has not released its platform for the fall campaign.\n\n\u201cThe Biden-Sanders agenda is \u2014 agenda is the most extreme platform of any major party nominee, by far, in American history,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think it\u2019s worse than, actually, Bernie\u2019s platform; it\u2019s gone so far right. And he\u2019s doing that because he\u2019s begging for their vote.\u201d\n\nAmong the things the president got wrong or distorted:\n\u2022 Trump falsely said the task force wanted to end the practice of detaining immigrants who enter the country illegally. The task force recommends closing for-profit detention centers, and Biden has called for ending \u201cprolonged detention,\u201d not all detentions.\n\u2022 He falsely said it would grant asylum to \u201call new illegal aliens.\u201d The task force said it would \u201cend Trump Administration policies that deny protected entry to asylum seekers,\u201d and \u201cexpand the existing asylum system.\u201d It doesn\u2019t say for everyone.\n\u2022 Trump falsely said it wanted an end to prosecutions of those who cross the border illegally. It calls for scrapping the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy and focusing on prosecuting \u201chuman traffickers, smugglers\u201d and other serious criminals.\n\u2022 He said \u201cthey want to take down the wall\u201d that his administration is building along the U.S.-Mexico border. Biden has said he would end funding for the project, but hasn\u2019t said he would tear down what has been built.\n\u2022 None He misleadingly said Biden wants \u201cfederal student aid,\u201d \u201cfree community college,\u201d \u201cwelfare\u201d and \u201cgovernment health care for illegal aliens.\u201d Biden has called for providing financial assistance to so-called Dreamers \u2014 those who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children by their parents.\n\u2022 Biden has called for a 100-day halt to deportations and deporting only felons after that, but Trump distorts that position by claiming Biden would \u201cstop all deportations.\u201d\n\u2022 Trump claimed, without evidence, that the \u201cwall has stopped\u201d human trafficking \u201cso much\u201d and that Biden wanted to \u201clet that continue.\u201d\n\nTrump falsely said the Biden-Sanders task force calls for abolishing the practice of detaining those who come into the country illegally.\n\nThe task force recommendations say that detention should be used as a \u201clast resort, not the default.\u201d\n\nThe immigration plan on Biden\u2019s campaign website says that Biden would end \u201cprolonged detention.\u201d That plan says \u201cproven alternatives to detention and non-profit case management programs, which support migrants as they navigate their legal obligations, are the best way to ensure that they attend all required immigration appointments.\u201d\n\nBiden caused some confusion on this issue during the Democratic primary when he was asked how to improve conditions at migrant detention centers. Biden replied: \u201cClose them down. \u2026 By the way, we don\u2019t need them!\u201d\n\nA Biden spokesman later told Fox News that the former vice president had been referring only to \u201cfor-profit detention centers.\u201d Biden\u2019s immigration plan calls for an end to for-profit detention centers.\n\nSo while Biden would take a far more liberal approach to detention than Trump, he does not favor abolishing it.\n\nTrump also said falsely that the unity plan would bring the prosecution of people who cross the border illegally to a halt.\n\nAgain, the document calls for greatly reducing the number of prosecutions, not eliminating all of them. It calls for scrapping the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy and focusing on prosecuting \u201chuman traffickers, smugglers\u201d and other serious criminals.\n\nAt a debate on CNN in Detroit during the Democratic primary, Biden made clear that he believes illegally crossing the border is indeed a crime.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt Biden would take a very different approach to prosecuting illegal border crossers than the Trump administration. But that doesn\u2019t mean he would \u201cend\u201d prosecutions.\n\nTrump also said falsely that the plan would grant asylum to \u201call new illegal aliens.\u201d\n\nBiden certainly favors being much more generous when it comes to asylum. But he doesn\u2019t call for asylum for everyone who crosses the border illegally.\n\nHere is some of what the unity plan says about asylum:\n\nSo Biden\u2019s asylum policy would be far more liberal than Trump\u2019s. But that doesn\u2019t mean asylum for \u201call new illegal aliens.\u201d\n\nBiden has said he would halt deportations of those already in the country for the first 100 days of his presidency, deporting only those who had committed felonies thereafter. But Trump twists that in claiming Biden would \u201cstop all deportations\u201d including the removal of MS-13 gang members.\n\nThe Trump campaign points to Biden\u2019s comments in the March 15 Democratic debate, when he said: \u201c[I]n the first 100 days of my administration, no one, no one will be deported at all. From that point on, the only deportations that will take place are commissions of felonies in the United States of America.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Biden-Sanders task force recommendations call for a 100-day halt to deportations of those in the country while \u201ca full-scale study on current practices\u201d is conducted \u201cto develop recommendations for transforming enforcement policies and practices at\u201d Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign website says that \u201cthe Obama-Biden administration took steps to prioritize enforcement resources on removing threats to national security and public safety, not families\u201d \u2014 and that he \u201cwill enforce our laws without targeting communities, violating due process, or tearing apart families.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Trump has used MS-13 in false and misleading claims.\n\nIn a continuation of his misleading claims about human trafficking, Trump claimed, without offering any evidence, that the \u201cwall has stopped it so much\u201d and that Biden wanted to \u201clet that continue.\u201d In fact, experts say the vast majority of human trafficking occurs through legal ports of entry.\n\nWe looked into similar claims by the president last year. There\u2019s no data on how many are smuggled illegally across the border with Mexico for human trafficking, experts told us. But, they said, legal ports are the typical mode of entry in the bulk of the cases they deal with concerning foreign nationals.\n\n\u201cYes, in some cases it does happen,\u201d Brandon Bouchard, director of media relations for Polaris, which operates the National Human Trafficking Hotline, told us of people being smuggled across the border. However, \u201cwe believe the vast majority of people are coming through legal ports of entry.\u201d And the statistics the group has, which come from the calls it receives through the hotline, show that labor trafficking is the largest trafficking issue for foreign nationals.\n\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s labor trafficking, people are recruited in their home country under false pretenses,\u201d Bouchard told us. \u201cThey think they\u2019re coming into the U.S. for a job.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the United Nations\u2019 International Organization on Migration has found that \u201cnearly 80% of international human trafficking journeys cross through official border control points, such as airports and land border control points,\u201d based on 10 years\u2019 worth of cases on which the IOM has assisted.\n\nEvangeline M. Chan, director of the Immigration Law Project at Safe Horizon, a group that assists trafficking survivors in New York City, told us that the type of coercion used is \u201ca lot more subtle\u201d than a kidnapping-type scenario. Typically she sees victims who are \u201clured into the country with promises of a better life.\u201d They\u2019re \u201cvery often brought to the country legally through ports of entry and using visas and legal documents.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign pointed to a different view. In a newspaper column, Tim Ballard, the head of an anti-trafficking organization called Operation Underground Railroad, said he and federal government officials \u201cagree that the building, expansion and strengthening of the border wall has been one of many effective tools, and will continue to be an effective tool, in the rescuing of trafficked children.\u201d\n\nBallard had worked as an investigator for the Department of Homeland Security, including, he writes, \u201ca tour combating sex trafficking on the southern border.\u201d\n\nAs for Biden\u2019s stance, the Biden-Sanders task force recommendations include some concerning human trafficking, including expanding \u201cthe annual visa cap for victims of sexual trafficking, violence against women and children, and other heinous crimes\u201d and \u201cprioritiz[ing] the criminal prosecution of human traffickers, smugglers, and others engaged in serious crimes.\u201d\n\nTrump said, without evidence, that his political rivals would \u201ctake down the wall\u201d on the Mexican border that his administration is building.\n\nIt is true that both the Biden position paper and the unity agreement call for getting rid of the \u201cnational emergency\u201d designation that allows the use of Defense Department funds for the fencing that the administration is erecting. But neither document says anything about tearing down what has been built.\n\nThat\u2019s misleading. Biden hasn\u2019t proposed federal student aid and free community college for everyone who came, or comes, to the U.S. illegally.\n\nBiden\u2019s education plan specifically says he would make so-called Dreamers eligible for federal financial aid if they otherwise meet the requirements. Dreamers are a specific group of individuals who are already in the country and were brought here illegally as children by their parents.\n\nBiden\u2019s plan also says Dreamers would be eligible to \u201cgo to community college for up to two years without having to pay tuition,\u201d and it says Biden will provide $18 billion in grants to four-year historically black colleges and universities, tribal colleges and universities, and minority serving institutions. That funding is \u201cequivalent to up to two years of tuition per low-income and middle class student, including DREAMers and students who transfer to a four-year HBCU, TCU, or MSI from a tuition-free community college,\u201d the plan states.\n\nThe unity task force similarly recommends ensuring \u201cDreamers are eligible for federal student aid and included in proposals to access community colleges without debt, including those who transfer to a four-year HBCU, TCU, or MSI from a tuition free community college.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign website claims: \u201cBiden pledged to give free, taxpayer-funded health care to illegal immigrants.\u201d But it links to a December 2019 video of Biden saying, under his plan, they would be able to \u201cbuy into the system.\u201d\n\nIn the clip, Telemundo\u2019s Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz-Balart asks Biden, \u201cUnder your plan \u2026 would the 11, 12 million undocumented immigrants that live in the United States, that have been here, many of them for generations, would they have access to health insurance?\u201d Biden responds, \u201cYes. If they can buy into the system like everyone else.\u201d He later says, again, \u201cthey will be able to buy in\u201d under the Affordable Care Act, which D\u00edaz-Balart noted is currently not allowed under the health care law.\n\nThe task force also \u201crecommends extending Affordable Care Act coverage to DACA recipients, [and] allowing undocumented immigrants to purchase unsubsidized coverage in the ACA marketplaces.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not the same as providing \u201cgovernment health care for all illegal aliens.\u201d\n\nBiden is not offering blanket \u201cwelfare\u201d to immigrants in, or coming to, the U.S. legally or illegally.\n\nThe task force proposes \u201cworking with Congress to lift the five-year waiting period for low-income lawfully present immigrants for Medicaid and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program eligibility.\u201d\n\nSo it applies to assistance from those federal-state health insurance programs, specifically, and it excludes individuals not in the U.S. lawfully.\n\nQualified U.S. citizens are already eligible for the Medicaid and CHIP programs, which combined cover more than 70 million individuals.\n\nBiden also has proposed reversing the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cpublic charge rule.\u201d It allows the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to deny admission or adjustment of status to immigrants who are \u201clikely at any time to become a public charge\u201d \u2014 that is, someone who receives public assistance.\n\nBiden\u2019s plan on \u201csecuring our values as a nation of immigrants,\u201d says: \u201cAllowing immigration officials to make an individual\u2019s ability to receive a visa or gain permanent residency contingent on their use of government services such as SNAP benefits or Medicaid, their household income, and other discriminatory criteria undermines America\u2019s character as land of opportunity that is open and welcoming to all, not just the wealthy.\u201d\n\nThat still doesn\u2019t amount to immediately signing up immigrants for welfare.\n\nThe president correctly said Biden would \u201cincrease refugee admissions by 700%,\u201d but that eye-popping figure lacks context. Trump sharply limited the number of refugee admissions, making Biden\u2019s proposed increase appear much larger than it historically would be.\n\n\u201cA refugee is a person fleeing his or her country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,\u201d as the Congressional Research Service explained in a 2018 report on refugees.\n\nEvery administration sets a limit on the number of refugee admissions that the U.S. will accept in a fiscal year. In a break from past administrations, the Trump administration reduced that number to just 18,000 in fiscal year 2020, which began on Oct. 1, 2019. That was the lowest amount in Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nBiden says on his campaign website that he will \u201cset the annual global refugee admissions cap to 125,000.\u201d And Trump is right that 125,000 would be a 700% increase from 18,000.\n\nBut Biden\u2019s proposed 125,000 cap is 56% higher than President George W. Bush\u2018s last fiscal year, when the cap was set at 80,000, and 14% higher than President Barack Obama\u2018s final fiscal year, when he set it at 110,000.\n\nOn his website, Biden says his 125,000 figure will restore \u201crefugee admissions in line with our historic practice under both Democratic and Republican Administrations,\u201d but that\u2019s not accurate. Prior to Trump, the annual average over 16 years during Democratic and Republican administrations was 76,313. Biden\u2019s proposed 125,000 cap is 64% higher than the 16-year, pre-Trump average \u2014 high, but not quite 700%.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
