One picture showed Trump holding a bible in front of St. John\u2019s Church. The other supposedly showed Hitler holding a bible in a crowd:\n\nThe image of Trump is real. As stated above, this photograph was taken on June 1, 2020. ABC News described the events that preceded this photograph, writing:\n\nPolice reinforced by National Guard troops forcefully pushed back protesters outside the White House Monday evening to clear a way for President Donald Trump to visit a church, just minutes after he said he wanted a military show of force against violent protests gripping the country. As television cameras showed live images of Trump\u2019s quick stop at the historic St. John\u2019s Church, where a small fire caused damage to its basement during protests the night before, the president posed with a Bible and with senior members of administration. Moments before, police had cleared largely peaceful demonstrators from the area, using tear gas and beating some with batons and shields, including at least one news photographer.\n\nA video from The Independent also shows Trump standing in front of St. John\u2019s Church with a bible:\n\nThe image of Hitler, however, is a fake.\n\nA genuine photograph of Hitler standing in a crowd of people delivering the \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d salute was manipulated to appear as if he was holding a book. The original image is available via Getty with the following caption:\n\nA version on Alamy Images states that this photograph was taken in front of the Berghof, Hitler\u2019s home in the Bavarian Alps in Germany, in 1935. Here\u2019s a look at the original photograph (left) and the doctored version (right):\n\nA second image supposedly showing Hitler holding a bible was also circulate online. This image, too, was fake. The second fake image of Hitler holding a bible was created by manipulating a genuine image of the Nazi leader delivering a speech in 1937.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the real photograph (left) and the doctored image (right):\n\nThe full, uncropped version of the genuine Hitler photograph can be viewed on The Associated Press\u2019 website.", "lang": "en"}
