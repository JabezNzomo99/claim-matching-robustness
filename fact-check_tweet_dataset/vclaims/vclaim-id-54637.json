Ghislaine Maxwell is in prison, and so a lot of people want to know if she\u2019s going to turn in powerful people. And I know you\u2019ve talked in the past about Prince Andrew, and you\u2019ve criticized Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior. I\u2019m wondering, do you feel that she\u2019s going to turn in powerful men? How do you see that working out? THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t really been following it too much. I just wish her well, frankly. I\u2019ve met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach and I guess they lived in Palm Beach. But I wish her well, whatever it is. I don\u2019t know the situation with Prince Andrew. I just don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not aware of it.\n\nThe remarks took place on July 21, toward the end of the press conference when the forum was opened up to reporter questions. It can be seen in the below C-SPAN video around the 20-minute mark:\n\nPresident Trump has been photographed with Maxwell in the past, Snopes previously reported.\n\nMaxwell was arrested on July 2 for her alleged involvement in sex trafficking crimes of which former boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein was accused. She is charged with procuring and \u201cgrooming\u201d at least three underage sex partners \u2014 one as young as 14 \u2014 between 1994 and 1997. Maxwell has denied the accusations and contends her innocence, reported Reuters.", "lang": "en"}
