{"title": "MISLEADING: P800,000 Yolanda vs P200,000 Marawi shelters", "subtitle": "The temporary shelters for typhoon Yolanda victims are divided into 12 units making it cheaper than the shelter for the displaced Marawi residents", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Nov 22, 2018 9:53 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-13428", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/misleading-yolanda-vs-marawi-shelters", "vclaim": "The state-run People\u2019s Television Network (PTV) made the claim in their October 20, 2017 report comparing the two housing projects as reported by Erwin Tulfo. It had at least 32,000 views on YouTube.\n\nThe total cost of each Yolanda bunkhouse is P836,017.00. Since each bunkhouse has 12 units, this places per unit cost at approximately P69,668. The total cost comes from a Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) report dated January 27, 2014.\n\nErwin Tulfo did not mention which type of housing unit he was referring to in the PTV report but said that each unit costs P160,000.\n\nMeanwhile, in the title of their video, the page Thinking Minds also said the cost of a single unit for Marawi residents is P200,000, or P40,000 higher than what Erwin Tulfo said in the video.**\n\nEditor\u2019s Note:\n\n*An earlier version of this fact check failed to say there are two types of Marawi temporary shelters, with different dimensions and prices. \n\n**We also incorrectly said that the price per unit cost cited by ThinkingMinds is P70,000 higher than the amount cited by Mr Tulfo. The corrections have been made.", "lang": "en"}
