Meanwhile, the driver of the car calmly gets back into the car and drives over the mangled bike once again as he vanishes into the traffic. This video seems to have been first posted on Facebook on a page called SIN.\n\nThe license plate of the car is \u201cUP 16 BL 2333\u201d. We looked up the license number in the RTO Vehicle Information application available on Android which gathers vehicle information from Government records. The app suggests that the car belongs to Lalit Singh Chauhan and the registration date of the car is 1st February 2017.\n\nWe cross checked the information on Government\u2019s vahan.nic.in and it shows the same Chassis number as returned by the Android app thus indicating that the information provided by the app in all probabilities is genuine.\n\nWe also looked up the license plate of the victim\u2019s bike (DL 11 SE 3593) in the same Android application. According to the app, the vehicle belongs to Home Core Lifestyle and has been registered on 14th March 2013. The storage space on the back of the bike suggests that the victim could be a person who does home deliveries and the bike belonged to some company.\n\nWe cross-checked this information on vahan.nic.in and the Chassis number again matches with the information provided by the Android app.\n\nConsidering that the registration date of the Tata Safari Storme is 1st February 2017, this video can\u2019t be very old since the car itself is brand new. On the back of the car is a label which suggests that the owner of the car is the General Secretary of the Noida Chapter of Hindu Yuva Manch.\n\nHere\u2019s a close-up of the label on the back of the car.\n\nIn the latter part of the video, the crowd that is gathered indicated again that the location where the video of the car was being shot is several metres beyond the site of the actual accident where the biker is purportedly lying. One can also see how power drunk the person driving the car is by the way he deliberately drives over the mangled bike once again while driving away from the scene of crime.\n\nModiji had said that Yogi Adityanath will make UP into Uttam Pradesh. How is it ever going to be \u2018Uttam\u2019 with a cadre like this?", "lang": "en"}
