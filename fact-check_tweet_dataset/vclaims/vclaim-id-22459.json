Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) says the indictment against him is \"pure politics,\" but it's not just Democrats alleging he misused more than $250,000 in campaign funds.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-08-28T07:00:54.889Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-22459", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/08/28/gop-congressman-claims-democratic-prosecutors-are-out-get-him/", "vclaim": "\u201cThis is pure politics, and the prosecutors can make an indictment read like a scandalous novel if they want to. \u2026 My prosecutor and the acting U.S. attorney that issued the court orders to search my house and my office, they just attended a Hillary Clinton fundraiser with another U.S. attorney out of here in San Diego. So, you have three \u2014 you have three U.S. attorneys.\u201d\n\nAllen, an assistant U.S. attorney, is one of the prosecutors working on the Hunter case, according to the indictment. Before being replaced by Braverman in November, Robinson was the top prosecutor in Hunter\u2019s district in the San Diego area, including when federal agents searched his home and office and other locations.\n\nOn Fox News, Hunter referred to \u201cthree U.S. attorneys.\u201d The third is Matthew J. Sutton, another assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of California. It\u2019s not clear why he\u2019s in the crossfire. Sutton attended the Clinton fundraiser, but \u201che has not been involved in the investigation of Congressman Hunter,\u201d said Gregory A. Vega, the congressman\u2019s attorney.\n\nThrough his lawyers, Hunter requested that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of California recuse itself from his case because Allen and Robinson attended a fundraiser for Clinton on Aug. 7, 2015, at the home of Qualcomm co-founder Irwin Jacobs in San Diego. Tickets ran from $1,000 to $2,700, but neither Allen nor Robinson paid to attend the event. Both had their pictures taken with Clinton.\n\n\u201cCongressman Hunter was the first sitting member of Congress to endorse President Trump in February 2016, and he has been an outspoken supporter of the President ever since,\u201d Vega wrote to Justice Department officials Aug. 6. \u201cThe only way these two Assistant US Attorneys were able to attend was by use of their official positions as Department of Justice employees. The overt political leanings of two individuals intimately involved in the investigation, combined with, among other things, the Southern District\u2019s sudden, inexplicable rush to indict my client before the general election without affording him sufficient due process, create an actual and/or apparent conflict that cannot be ignored.\u201d\n\nHow did Allen and Robinson wind up at the Clinton fundraiser without paying for tickets? At the request of the Secret Service, apparently. The agency says it asked the local U.S. attorney\u2019s office to send some lawyers in case they might be needed at this Clinton fundraiser.\n\nThe Union-Tribune reported that \u201cattorneys not involved in the Hunter investigation said having prosecutors on site in an official capacity opens them up to the possibility of being a witness ... which would then preclude the prosecutor from being involved in any future legal case that would arise.\u201d\n\nThe congressman\u2019s claim \u2014 that the investigation was tainted because Allen and Robinson attended a Clinton fundraiser in 2015 \u2014 is unconvincing. It would be one thing had Allen and Robinson shown up on their own initiative, but the Secret Service says it asked for federal prosecutors to be present at this fundraiser. Unusual as that arrangement may sound, Hunter is blowing it up to huge proportions and arguing that no federal prosecutor in the San Diego area can touch him as a result.", "lang": "en"}
