He said it was \u201cnot fair\u201d to Pemberton that his supposed good conduct time allowance (GCTA) under Philippine law was not computed properly:\n\nDuterte\u2019s pronouncement runs counter to what Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said in his press briefing on Sept. 3 when he gave the Palace\u2019s take on the decision of the Olongapo City Regional Trial Court Branch 74 to grant Pemberton\u2019s motion for early release two days earlier.\n\nRoque, who previously served as counsel for the Laude family, said:\n\nIn late August, Pemberton\u2019s camp petitioned the Olongapo court for an early release on the basis of supposed time allowances earned for good behavior, which the court then granted on Sept. 1.\n\nGCTA is a sentence reduction provision afforded persons deprived of liberty who show good behavior as mandated by Republic Act 10592. (See VERA FILES FACT SHEET: Understanding good conduct time allowance for prisoners: 4 things you should know)\n\nSec. 5 of the law states that allowances for good conduct may be granted only by:\n\u2022 the director of the Bureau of Corrections;\n\u2022 the chief of the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology; or,\n\u2022 the warden of a provincial, district, municipal or city jail.\n\nNot all prisoners may avail of the GCTA. Recidivists, or those who have been previously convicted twice or more times of any crime, habitual delinquents, escapees, and those charged with heinous crimes are not covered.\n\nPemberton was found guilty of homicide by the same Olongapo court in 2015 for the brutal killing of Laude, and was sentenced to six to 10 years of imprisonment. His move to reverse the verdict was junked by the Court of Appeals in 2017. In June 2020, he withdrew his final appeal before the Supreme Court.\n\nSince Pemberton was covered under the Visiting Forces Agreement between the Philippines and the U.S., he was allowed to serve his sentence at a facility of the Armed Forces of the Philippines agreed upon by both countries. (See VERA FILES FACT SHEET: The Visiting Forces Agreement, explained)\n\nThe lawyers of the Laude family have initially filed a motion for reconsideration on the Olongapo court\u2019s recent decision, saying, among others, that the GCTA law \u201cdoes not even apply to Pemberton\u201d in the first place since the objective of the law was to decongest the country\u2019s prison cells.\n\n\u201c[The] release of Pemberton will not at all help decongest our prison cells. Remember he is very much privileged [and was put] in a very privileged facility,\u201d lawyer Virginia Suarez said in an interview on ANC on Sept. 2.\n\nExpounding on the president\u2019s decision, Roque told reporters that Pemberton can now be freed, adding:\n\nTeodoro Locsin Jr. official Twitter account, \u201cCutting matters short over what constitutes time served\u2026,\u201d Sept. 7, 2020\n\nPresidential Communications Operations Office, Talk to the People of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19 (sic), Sept. 7, 2020\n\nRappler, Pemberton\u2019s bid for early freedom through GCTA now underway, Aug. 25, 2020\n\nANC 24/7, Laude camp files motion for reconsideration over early release of Scott Pemberton | ANC, Sept. 2, 2020\n\nCNN Philippines, Court affirms Pemberton's conviction but reduces sentence to up to 10 years , April 3, 2016\n\n\n\nRappler, CA upholds 10-year jail time for U.S. marine who killed Jennifer Laude, Aug. 20, 2017\n\nOfficial Gazette, Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Government of the United States of America Regarding the Treatment of United States Armed Forces Visiting the Philippines, February 10, 1998, Feb. 10, 1998\n\nOnewNews, Be Fair: Duterte Grants Absolute Pardon To US Serviceman Convicted Of Killing Transgender Jennifer Laude, Sept. 8, 2020", "lang": "en"}
