It has been circulating in various forms since at least 2009. A \u201cCongressional Reform Act of 2017\u201d has never been introduced in Congress.\n\nA viral image alleges in a post that Trump is \u201casking everyone to forward this email\u201d that contains seven \u201cTRUMP Rules\u201d that appear to fall under an alleged \u201cCongressional Reform Act of 2017.\u201d It has been shared more than 10,000 times.\n\n\u201c1. No Tenure/No Pension. A Congressman/woman collects a salary while in office and receives no pay when they\u2019re out of office,\u201d the post continues. \u201cAnd, no more perks go with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe TRUMP Rules\u201d include requiring members of Congress to participate in Social Security, pay for their own retirement plans, use the same health care system as their constituents and abide by the same laws applied to American citizens. Another rule listed in the post prohibits them from voting for congressional salary increases.\n\nA number of points in \u201cThe TRUMP Rules\u201d have been previously debunked by FactCheck.org in 2011 and, more recently, in October of this year. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show A \u201928th Amendment\u2019 That \u2018Hasn\u2019t Been Upheld In Years\u2019)\n\nThere is no evidence that Trump has encouraged people to forward this message. The Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any instances of him tweeting about a \u201cCongressional Reform Act\u201d in the Trump Twitter Archive. An internet search didn\u2019t turn up any credible media outlets reporting on \u201cThe TRUMP Rules\u201d either.\n\nA search of all legislation introduced in Congress since 2017 revealed that the \u201cCongressional Reform Act of 2017\u201d has never been proposed. Republican Wisconsin Rep. Mike Gallagher did introduce the Congressional Pension Reform Act in 2017, but that bill only dealt with the pension system.\n\nAccording to PolitiFact, iterations of the \u201cCongressional Reform Act\u201d have been circulating online since at least 2009, when a chain email first credited billionaire investor Warren Buffett with asking people to forward a proposed constitutional amendment that contained similar language.", "lang": "en"}
