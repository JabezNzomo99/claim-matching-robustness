Social media posts shared by thousands of people claimed the August 4 fire was started by foreign nationals, reflecting long-standing tensions over immigration in South Africa. But Johannesburg emergency medical services have dismissed this rumour, saying the fire was sparked by a stove that exploded inside the building and that it had \u201cnothing to do with foreign nationals\u201d.\n\n\u201cGrand Station Hotel in Jeppestown burnt down by rampaging foreign Nationals. Built in 1912. It was declared a national monument. Uncontrolled violence and not a single arrest,\u201d reads the caption on an August 3 Facebook post, which has been shared more than 1,300 times. We\u2019ve archived the post here.\n\nSeveral more posts on social media similarly claimed the fire was started by \u201crampaging foreign nationals\u201d, including here and here.\n\nBut Nana Radebe, spokeswoman for emergency medical services (EMS) in Johannesburg, said there was no truth to this rumour. This was not arson, and initial investigations suggest the blaze was sparked by a faulty stove.\n\n\u201cThe fire was caused by stove elements,'' Radebe told AFP by telephone, adding that the appliance had exploded.\n\nPreliminary investigations suggest the fire had \"nothing to do with foreign nationals\u201d, she said.\n\n\u201cOur preliminary investigations, which are done by the City of Joburg EMS, said that it's the stove.\"\n\nLocal reports here and here say the Grand Station Hotel housed numerous shops and nearly 40 residential rooms.\n\nThe central business district of Johannesburg has been experiencing unrest since last week when protesters, reported to be foreign nationals, attacked the police during an operation against hawkers selling counterfeit goods and people illegally occupying some buildings -- see these tweets from David Makhura, premier of Gauteng province, and Johannesburg police chief David Tembe.\n\nSouth Africa has suffered years of social tensions over immigration, with foreigners from other African countries finding themselves a repeated target of anger over unemployment, accused of taking up scarce jobs.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked various false social media posts which touch on these tensions, including here and here.\n\nThe \u2018foreign nationals\u2019 claim isn\u2019t the only inaccuracy in the post\n\nThe accusation that foreign nationals were responsible for the fire isn\u2019t the only incorrect claim in the Facebook post.\n\nThe post says the hotel was built in 1912. In fact, it was completed 16 years earlier in 1896 \u201cto serve miners from the nearby Wolhunter mine\u201d, according to the Heritage Register and this Johannesburg history blog.\n\nThe Facebook post also says the site was declared a national monument, which is also not true. However, the building is protected by Section 34 of the National Heritage Resources Act. This states that \"no person may alter or demolish any structure or part of a structure which is older than 60 years without a permit issued by the relevant provincial heritage resources authority\".", "lang": "en"}
