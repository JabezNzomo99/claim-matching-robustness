This is false; the CDC says it has not cut its statistics on fatalities from the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and that its websites include two sets of figures -- one lower than the other -- based on different sources.\n\n\u201cThe CDC has officially almost HALVED the number of COVID-19 deaths listed on their website. This is HUGE,\u201d a May 2, 2020 Facebook post says alongside images of two sets of CDC statistics.\n\n\u201cThis means that the data is no longer trustworthy. Shocker,\u201d the post says.\n\nBut the statistics do not represent a reduction in the CDC\u2019s toll: one number is based on data from death certificates while the other relies on information from US states, including confirmed and probable deaths due to the disease.\n\nThe claim about the CDC's death toll has also been made on Facebook here, here and here, on Twitter here, here and here, and on Instagram here.\n\nIt comes during an intense debate over measures taken to curb the novel coronavirus pandemic and how public health precautions should be adapted to allow a reopening of the US economy.\n\nThe virus has killed more than 282,000 people worldwide since it emerged in China in late 2019, but decisions by officials in the United States to shutter non-essential businesses -- to limit its spread -- and the wearing of face masks are under growing scrutiny.\n\nSocial media users have used the alleged reduction in the death toll to claim that the CDC\u2019s statistics are unreliable and that the threat posed by COVID-19 has been exaggerated.\n\nThe CDC has, however, not cut its figures, a spokesperson told AFP.\n\n\u201cThere has been no decrease or revision down in deaths,\u201d the spokesperson said by email. \u201cThere are two sets of death data on CDC\u2019s websites -- (1) from our National Center for Health Statistics, that includes provisional data from death certificates that have COVID-19 listed as a cause of death and (2) from reporting done by states to CDC.\u201d\n\nThe National Center for Health Statistics numbers are lower than the figures from the states.\n\nThe \u201clatter data collection includes deaths that are confirmed and probable,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 430 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus crisis.
