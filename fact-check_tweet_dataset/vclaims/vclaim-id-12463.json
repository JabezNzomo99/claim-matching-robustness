The claim had already been proven false and is being rehashed.", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Feb 27, 2019 2:08 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-12463", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/false-alejano-says-ofws-sold-souls-duterte", "vclaim": "The lawmaker reiterated to Rappler that the claim is \"not true\" and is just \"propaganda.\" He said in his Facebook post previously: \"people who use negative propaganda to get even to political opponents are the ones making politics dirty.\"\n\nThis is not the first time that Rappler spotted fabricated statements attributed to Alejano. On October 16, 2018, a Facebook page, Mga Balitang Pinas, posted a claim of the lawmaker\u2019s supposed quote comparing himself to Bong Go.\n\nAlejano allegedly claimed that he is \"obviously better\" than former special assistant to the President and now PDP-Laban Senate bet Bong Go. (READ: HOAX: Alejano\u2019s \u2018quotes\u2019 on Bong Go)\n\nEmbedded in the article was also the quote on OFWs supposedly coming from the lawmaker. The quote is an old one and is being revived today by another pro-Duterte OFW page. There is no definite reason why the quote has resurfaced.\n\nAnother invented quote of the lawmaker was also confirmed as false. In a Philippine Star article, Alejano cleared himself of the false claim which he supposedly made \u2013 that OFWs are burdens to be revisited as they have nothing to give in return.\n\nThe supposed quote went viral a week after Alejano criticized President Rodrigo Duterte for his Hongkong \"junket\" on April 13, 2018. The photo used in this false claim was the same as the rehashed one.\n\nLike Mga Balitang Pinas, the OFWs Journey Around The World did not provide any proof that the lawmaker said what was falsely attributed to him. Some commenters figured out that the claim could not be true and demanded the administrator of the page to give proof that Alejano indeed made the statement.\n\nThe Rappler fact-check team asked the OFWs Journey Around The World for the source of the quote they used in their post. A chatbot, however, replied that the page admin was on vacation. \u2013 Glenda Marie Castro/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
