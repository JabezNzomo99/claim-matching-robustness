Trump\u2019s inaugural address clocked in at about 16 minutes, whereas Obama\u2019s farewell address was more than 50 minutes long, making it unsurprising that Obama used more words (and more references to himself) during his speech.\n\nIn addition to the different lengths, a farewell address and an inaugural address are fundamentally different speeches. However, it is easy to take a closer look at the claim presented in this meme. Transcripts of both Obama\u2019s farewell address and Trump\u2019s inaugural address are available online. We searched both transcripts for the words \u201cI\u201d and \u201cme,\u201d as well as the contractions \u201cI\u2019ve\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m,\u201d and here is what we found.\n\nObama used the word \u201cI\u201d 40 times, \u201cme\u201d 13 times, \u201cI\u2019ve\u201d 12 times, and \u201cI\u2019m\u201d twice, adding up to a total of 67 self-references. While this is lower than the number of claimed self-references, the difference is negligible.\n\nClaim: Trump referred to himself 3 times and \u201cwe, the American people,\u201d 45 times.\n\nTrump used the word \u201cI\u201d 3 times and never used the terms \u201cme,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m.\u201d However, Trump never said \u201cWe, the American people,\u201d either. It\u2019s possible that the meme was only referring to the word \u201cwe.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, Trump did use the word \u201cwe\u201d 46 times.\n\nWhile this meme is mostly accurate as it is presented (although the numbers are slightly off), the difference in references to oneself is not nearly as stark when comparing Obama and Trump\u2019s inaugural addresses.\n\nIn 2009, Obama used the word \u201cI\u201d 3 times during his speech, and never used \u201cme,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m.\u201d In 2013, Obama used the word \u201cI\u201d twice, and never used \u201cme,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m.\u201d His \u201cwe\u201d count in both speeches was more than sixty.\n\nA comparison of the inaugural addresses delivered by both Obama and Trump shows the number of self-references was nearly identical.\n\nThe claim expressed here, while technically accurate, compares two fundamentally different speeches: an inaugural address is generally a formal speech delivered by incoming presidents expressing common hopes, expectations, and dreams for the country, while a farewell address is a more personal and informal talk given by outgoing presidents about their view of the world scene, their time in office, and their departure from the national stage. The latter thus naturally tends to be more personal and self-referential in nature.", "lang": "en"}
