They limit how far member states can reduce employment protections in their own countries, and in some cases set new standards which they must meet. They also extend far beyond the five points mentioned in the post.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that in some of the examples mentioned, the UK has introduced or changed its minimum standards as a result of EU regulations. Under the terms of Boris Johnson\u2019s new withdrawal agreement, the UK wouldn\u2019t necessarily have to keep up with future standards set by the EU.\n\nIt\u2019s correct that those in the UK can get statutory sick pay if they\u2019re too ill to work for up to 28 weeks. (The rules are slightly different for some agricultural workers.)\n\nThe EU does not set a minimum sick leave or sick pay legislation for its member states.\n\nAlmost all workers in the UK are entitled to 5.6 weeks of paid holiday per year, which is equivalent to 28 days if you work a five day week. Employers can choose to include bank holidays as part of those 28 days of annual leave.\n\nThe EU does enforce a minimum of four weeks\u2019 paid holiday leave, which it introduced in 1993. Those four weeks were put into UK law in 1998, before which there had been no general regulations on entitlement to paid leave (although it was in some workers\u2019 contracts).\n\nPaid leave was increased to 5.6 weeks in Great Britain in 2009, as some employers were including bank holidays in this paid leave, meaning the number of paid days that could be taken out of choice by the employee was less than four weeks. Workers in Northern Ireland also get 5.6 weeks of paid leave now too.\n\nSo UK legislation effectively guarantees workers the EU minimum of four weeks of paid annual leave, which they can take at their own discretion, plus eight bank holidays (as there are in England and Wales) as paid leave.\n\nThe tweets and Facebook posts get it on wrong maternity pay. In the UK, you can get maternity pay for up to 39 weeks, not 52 as the post claims (it is probably referring to maternity leave, which can be up to 52 weeks in the UK).\n\nYou get 90% of your average weekly earnings (before tax) for the first six weeks, and \u00a3148.68 or 90% of your average weekly earnings (whichever is lower) for the next 33 weeks. Maternity pay is taxed.\n\nThere are certain conditions that come with this. For example, you must have worked for the employer for at least 26 weeks and be earning at least \u00a3118 a week. Those who don\u2019t qualify may be eligible for maternity allowance.\n\nCurrently, EU legislation means workers are entitled to paid maternity leave for a minimum of 14 weeks. It is mandatory to take at least the first two weeks. This was introduced in 1992. This leave must be paid at \u201can adequate allowance subject to national legislation\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s correct that minimum wage is \u00a38.21 for those aged 25 and over in the UK, as of April 2019 (these rates change every April). We saw one version of these claims that said the minimum wage was \u00a37.05\u2014that\u2019s not the minimum wage for any age group.\n\nThe posts say it is \u201csoon to be\u201d \u00a310.50. At the 2019 Conservative Party Conference, the Chancellor Sajid Javid pledged that the living wage would increase to \u00a310.50 an hour for those over the age of 23 by 2021, and those over 21 by 2024. This has not yet been put into law.\n\nThere is no EU-wide legislation for a minimum wage for member states, and as of January 2019, 22 of the 28 countries had one.", "lang": "en"}
