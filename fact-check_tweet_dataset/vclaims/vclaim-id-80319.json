The image in the post purporting to show the temple is manipulated from an original of a cave in China that is famous for Buddhist art.\n\nThe post, shared on a Facebook page titled \u2018Resurging Dharma\u2019, purports to show the temple in the southern Indian state of Karnataka that it says was discovered after a mosque was demolished to make way for a road.\n\nThe photo, posted on November 13, 2018, has a caption that reads: \u201cWhen a mosque was demolished in Raichur in Karnataka for widening road they have found this Hindu temple. We need to demolish all mosques.\u201d\n\nThe photograph has been edited from an image of the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Longmen Grottoes, or Longmen Caves, in China\u2019s Henan province.\n\nIn the Longmen Caves, the statues of Buddha and his disciples are carved out of stone.\n\nIn the false Facebook post, the Buddhist statues have been replaced with a Hindu goddess.\n\nBelow is the misleading photo (left) and one of the Longmen Caves (right) sourced from WikiMedia commons that was published in 2016. AFP has circled three features in both images that are the same.\n\nMany other photos of the Longmen Caves are available online showing the same features, including on UNESCO's website.\n\nAn analysis of the photo in the misleading post also reveals it to be manipulated. A man marked as \u2018D\u2019 in the photo below has one leg missing and is standing without any support on the stairs.\n\nThere is also a logo in the bottom right hand corner of the photograph that reads: \u2018Chandra Colourist\u2019.\n\nThere is a Facebook page with an identity of Chandra Colourist that posted the manipulated image in 2016 with a comment stating it was a digital creation.", "lang": "en"}
