To date, there is no evidence to prove that the controversial tonic produced in the island country has any impact on the virus.\n\n\u201cOf all big countries of the world, God decided to use Madagascar, a small Island to put a stop to global pandemic covid 19. They discovered Covid-Organics, a herb that cures corona virus (sic),\u201d reads a Facebook post published on April 28, 2020, and shared more than 4,700 times.\n\nThe viral post also appears on Facebook here and here alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe posts emerged days after Madagascan President Andry Rajoelina unveiled Covid-Organics, a herbal tea derived from artemisia -- a plant with proven anti-malarial properties -- and other indigenous herbs that he claimed could prevent as well as cure COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe tonic was developed by Madagascar\u2019s state-run Malagasy Institute of Applied Research and also exported to other African countries, including Ghana and Nigeria.\n\nBut despite the drinks' widespread domestic distribution, Madagascar recorded at least 10,104 confirmed cases and 93 coronavirus-related deaths as of July 28, 2020.\n\nIn fact, health workers in the capital Antananarivo have struggled to cope with a rush of coronavirus patients, as reported by AFP.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has repeatedly warned that there have been no published scientific studies to validate claims that the infusion is effective against COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe would caution and advise countries against adopting a product that has not been taken through tests to see its efficacy,\u201d said the WHO\u2019s Africa Director Matshidiso Moeti in a press briefing on May 7.\n\nDr Mary Stephen of WHO Africa told AFP Fact Check that no cure had yet been found for the highly infectious disease, but clinical trials were ongoing.\n\nThe Nigerian government tested Covid-Organics and said the results had failed to show that the concoction was efficient against COVID-19.\n\nThe country\u2019s drug control agency found the drink \u201cdid not show any evidence that it has real curative properties against COVID-19,\u201d Health Minister Osagie Ehanire said on July 23, 2020, in a widely reported announcement.\n\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention -- a technical institution of the African Union -- said scientists from the continent were in talks with Madagascar to test the claims made about Covid-Organics.\n\n\u201cWith respect to the Madagascar situation, we have formally reviewed what the government of Madagascar submitted,\u201d Africa CDC Director John Nkengasong said on July 23, 2020. \u201cWe\u2019ve followed through with a note prepared to encourage that we agree on how to move forward with that, and we will be hopefully moving forward once the government of Madagascar reaches back to us.\u201d\n\nMisinformation has followed Rajoelina\u2019s launch of the herbal drink.\n\nAFP Fact Check recently debunked allegations that he had accused the WHO of offering a $20 million bribe to poison the infusion, and that US President Donald Trump had approved a $2.5 million fund for Madagascar to mass-produce the herbal remedy.", "lang": "en"}
