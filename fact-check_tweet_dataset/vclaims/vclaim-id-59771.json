Their tweets were retweeted over 400 times each. Similarly, several Facebook users also shared the viral image.\n\nAlt News performed a keyword search on Google and found that the official government website of Postage Stamps carries the same image of 11-set stamps.\n\nAccording to the website, \u201cIndia Post issued a set of 11 commemorative postage stamps on \u201cRAMAYANA\u201d on 22.09.2017- 10 stamps are of denominations Rs 5 and 1 stamp is of denomination Rs 15\u2033.\n\nOn September 22 2017, NDTV reported that Prime Minister Narendra Modi released postage stamps depicting different aspects of Hindu deity Ram\u2019s life at Tulsi Manas Mandir in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. BJP had also tweeted about this ceremony.\n\nThus the social media claim Prime Minister Modi recently released Ramayana stamps is false. They were released three years ago.", "lang": "en"}
