The Covid-19 pandemic, along with forest fires, floods and earthquakes in different parts of the globe, have led to innumerable suffering. And now, netizens have raised alarm over another \u201ccatastrophe\u201d at the end of the year this time it\u2019s celestial.\n\nSeveral Facebook and Twitter users have pushed the panic button, claiming an asteroid will hit the Earth on November 2, just a day before the United States Presidential Election, thus, ending the year \u201cwith a bang\u201d.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that a small asteroid will indeed approach the Earth on November 2, but it will remain more than 2,60,000 miles away from the Earth, with little chance (0.41%) of entering the atmosphere.\n\nThe archived versions of the posts are saved here, here and here.\n\nAccording to NASA, the said asteroid, 2018 VP1, is only about 6.5 feet long. If it does enter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, it will disintegrate and burn up because of its small size, the space agency said.\n\nThe asteroid was discovered in 2018 by the Zwicky Transient Facility at Palomar Observatory near San Diego.\n\nWhile scientists call the event a close approach, as per the website \u201cSpace.com\u201d , it \u201c will remain quite far away from Earth: more than 260,000 miles (4,20,000 km) away. That\u2019s about the same distance at which the much larger moon orbits Earth.\u201d\n\nAs per NASA, asteroids that pose a serious threat to the planet are classified as Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs). They need to be at least 500 feet in diameter to fall under that category.\n\nRather, the asteroid 2018 VP1 has been cataloged in the NASA\u2019s \u201cSmall-Body Database Browser\u201d. Therefore, we can say that the claim of an asteroid hitting the Earth later this year has been exaggerated by netizens. There is no threat to the Earth.\n\nAlso read: Attention Earthlings, travelling really-really fast, this asteroid is coming our way\n\nAlso read: Small asteroid becomes closest ever seen passing Earth: Nasa", "lang": "en"}
