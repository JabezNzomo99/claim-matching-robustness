This claim is misleading; the president said in a televised interview that voting may have to be repeated in some polling stations that experienced problems during the April 17 elections.\n\nThe image was shared to Facebook in this post dated April 23, 2019 \u2013 six days after Indonesia held its elections \u2013 which has been shared more than 19,000 times since.\n\nThe president, popularly known as Jokowi, ran in Indonesia's presidential election on April 17, 2019, against his sole challenger, Prabowo Subianto. Here is an AFP report about the polls.\n\nThe post\u2019s lengthy caption says in part: \u201cWhy are we going to have an election rerun?? We do not need a rerun, provided that all votes recapitulations from polling stations, districts, regencies, provinces and national levels are done honestly and openly.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe logo of Indonesian broadcaster iNews TV can be seen on the top left-hand side of the image. The logo of iNews\u2019 evening news programme \u201ciNews Malam\u201d also appears in the photo next to a blue banner with Indonesian-language text that translates to English as: \u201cIF NEEDED, THE ELECTIONS CAN BE RE-RUN\u201d.\n\nIn a playlist called \u201ciNews Malam\u201d on iNews\u2019 official YouTube channel, AFP found this video which shows Jokowi wearing the same blue shirt giving an interview to the broadcaster regarding the latest elections:\n\nThe image used in the misleading post matches the original YouTube video at the timestamp 1:08.\n\nBelow is a picture comparing the Facebook image with a screenshot of the YouTube video:\n\nThe original YouTube video is headlined: \u201cIn response to the false data input, Jokowi: voting can be redone in problematic polling stations - iNews Malam 23/04\u201d, a reference to the date the clip was posted on YouTube April 23, 2019.\n\nIn the original video, the president does not propose or agree to re-do the entire election if needed, but says the vote needs to be re-done only in some polling stations where irregularities have been discovered.\n\nAt 1:03, Jokowi says: \u201c Let us go back to the existing mechanism. If in one polling station needs a repeat, just repeat. There is a mechanism. There is the regulation.\u201d\n\niNews editor-in-chief Yadi Hendriana told AFP on April 26, 2019, the image in the misleading Facebook post is \u201cnot contextual and is false.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
