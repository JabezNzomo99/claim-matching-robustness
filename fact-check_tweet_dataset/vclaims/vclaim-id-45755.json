However, the footage has nothing to do with anti-racism protests currently sweeping the US, which have seen outbreaks of looting. The man in the video is a comedian pulling a prank in March 2019.\n\n\u201cProtester attempts to steal an ATM then use public transportation to escape,\u201d reads the caption on a Facebook post by US talk show host Sean Hannity, shared more than 13,000 times since June 1, 2020.\n\nThe accompanying video shows a man hauling a cash machine along the street towards a parked bus. He attempts to climb on board with the bulky item, but the driver promptly shuts the doors and leaves him.\n\n\u201cWe could have made money together!\u201d the man shouts as the bus pulls away.\n\nSimilar posts, which we\u2019ve archived here and here, claim the footage shows a \u201clooter\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe United States is just too funny right now...The guy steals a cash machine and tries to take the bus with it,\u201d reads a post (in French) viewed more than 68,000 times since May 31, 2020.\n\nA video of a white Minneapolis police officer pressing his knee on the neck of 46-year-old black man George Floyd until he died has sparked the most sweeping US protests for racial justice since the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThe demonstrations have prompted a wave of misinformation, including a video falsely purporting to show protesters storming the White House and posts even claiming that Floyd\u2019s death was staged.\n\nAFP Fact Check ran a reverse image search on the footage circulating online using the Invid-WeVerify verification tool.\n\nWe traced the video to a report from March 26, 2019, on British news site Mail Online. The article describes the incident as a \u201cpractical joke\u201d.\n\n\u201cA New Jersey bus almost became a getaway vehicle during a practical joke which made it seem as though a man was trying to board with a stolen ATM,\u201d it reads.\n\n\u201cComedian Darius Kinney, who has almost 3,000 followers on his 'funny skits' Twitter account, asked his friend to record him as he pretended to steal an ATM and try and board a bus with it.\u201d\n\nAFP Fact Check traced the original video to a tweet posted by Darius Kinney on March 19, 2019.\n\nContacted by AFP Fact Check, Kinney said he is the man in the video carrying the cash machine, which he says he found abandoned outside a barbershop.\n\n\u201cI pulled up to the barbershop and saw an ATM. Then I saw the bus stop. After, I just put it together in my head and made a prank video,\u201d he said via Twitter Direct Message.\n\nKinney has posted similar gags with cash machines (here and here) on Instagram.\n\n\u201cWhen I do my pranks, nobody ever knows what\u2019s going on. Just me and my cameraman. That\u2019s why they end up so real.\u201d\n\nThe comedian reposted the footage on his Facebook account on June 1 alongside the caption, \u201cMe at the riots when the cops not looking #Reposter\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
