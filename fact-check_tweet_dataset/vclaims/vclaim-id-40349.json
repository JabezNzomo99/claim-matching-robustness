The clip, which was viewed more than 8 million times in a few days, showed a child named \u201cJohn-John\u201d counting to 10 with a muppet in 1971, and then showed John-John\u2019s return to \u201cSesame Street\u201d about 20 years later:\n\nWhile many viewers were delighted that John-John appeared to have grown into an upstanding citizen and member of the U.S. Air Force, others claimed there was a bit more to the story: Many Twitter users pointed to a 2015 article published on I Love Old School Music as evidence that he\u2019d been in trouble with the law. Here\u2019s an excerpt from that article, as well as a mugshot of a man named \u201cJohn Bernard Williams\u201d:\n\n\u2026 John ended up getting convicted of Aggravated Sexual Assault Of A Child in the state of Texas\u2026 \u2026 Texas Department Of Public Safety Sex Offender Registry Records reveal that John sexually assaulted a 4 year old female child and that he was sentenced to 5 years in prison, was released on parole and is now under a lifetime mandatory supervision by the state of Texas.\n\nA man named John Bernard Williams truly is on the Texas Public Sex Offender registry. We also found that much of the known biographical information for \u201cJohn-John\u201d matched with the information of this offender from the Texas Department of Public Safety.\n\nFor instance, a profile on \u201cAirman John-John\u201d published by the Air Force Service Information and News Center in 1989 identified him as \u201cJohn Bernard Williams.\u201d That article also identified his mother by the first name of \u201cTrina.\u201d This is also the name of convicted sex offender John Bernard Williams\u2019 mother, according to a 2000 opinion on Williams\u2019 court case.\n\nWe also know that John-John was born in 1969 because many news outlets reported that the viral \u201cSesame Street\u201d counting clip was filmed in 1971 when he was just 2 years old. The Muppet Fandom Wiki provides a more specific date of birth for John-John (Sept. 24, 1969), but we have been unable to verify this information. If this information is accurate, though, John-John and John Bernard Williams share the exact same birth date. If it\u2019s inaccurate, we still know that they were born in the same year.\n\nLastly, in 1998, The New York Times caught up with John-John for the 30th anniversary of \u201cSesame Street.\u201d That article noted that John-John was living in San Antonio, Texas. A year later, charges would be filed against a man named John Bernard Williams in Bexar County, where San Antonio is located, for the sexual assault of a child.\n\nThe information we\u2019ve gathered seems to show that John-John, the 2-year-old child who made multiple appearances on \u201cSesame Street,\u201d may be the same person who ended up on the offender list in Texas. However, it is possible that this is just a coincidence. Given the nature of the rumor, and the fact that we have been unable to definitively tie these two identities together (via family statements, social security numbers, fingerprints, etc.) we are rating this claim \u201cUnproven.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to the Texas Department Of Public Safety and will update this article if more information becomes available.", "lang": "en"}
