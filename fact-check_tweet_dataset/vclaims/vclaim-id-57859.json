The account had Banerjee's official Massachusetts Institute of Technology email address in the Twitter bio, and had added photos of him with his wife, Nobel laureate Esther Duflo.\n\n\n\nThe account became active on May 5, around the same time as Banerjee's conversation with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi about reviving the economy after the pandemic was over. During this time, Google saw a sharp rise in searches with the keywords \"abhijit banerjee\", as people attempted to look for the video of the conversation.\n\nThe account had also posted a tweet stating, \"A bit late but finally on twitter today.\" This led many users to the imposter account, who had claimed that it was Banerjee's \"official handle\" on the Twitter bio.\n\nTrinamool Congress Member of Parliament Mahua Moitra also posted about the imposter, and added that there was one more going by the handle @AbhijitBanrjee.", "lang": "en"}
