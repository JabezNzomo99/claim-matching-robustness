Multiple articles reveal that the Palm Beach resort and its surrounding area had been evacuated days before Irma reached Florida.\n\nFreedumjunkshun is a self-avowed fake news website that hopes to dupe conservative readers into mistaking its dim-witted satire for truth.\n\n\"Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate,\" its disclaimer reads. \"Reality is often in the eye of the beholder. You won\u2019t find any of it here.\"\n\nOther elements of the story are also plainly absurd. The article claims President Trump\u2019s son, Eric Trump, designed Mar-a-Lago himself, and constructed the building to be able to \"withstand bunker-busting bombs,\" but not water damage.\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
