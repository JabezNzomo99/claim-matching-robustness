This is false.\n\nExamples of the claim are visible here and here .\n\nThe Confederate flag was flown by the breakaway southern states, which defended slavery, in the 1861-65 American Civil War. Controversy over the modern use of the flag has intensified since protests erupted across the United States over the death of George Floyd last month ( here ).\n\nThe posts say: \u201cThe red represents the blood of Christ. The white border represents the protection of God. The blue \u2018X\u2019 represents the Christian cross of Saint Andrew, the first disciple of Christ Jesus and patron Saint of Scotland. The 13 stars represent the 13 Southern states of succession.\u201d\n\nTed Kaye, a vexillologist (flag expert) with the Portland Flag Association and Secretary of the North American Vexillological Association, told Reuters this description was \u201cmostly inaccurate\u201d.\n\nTo the flag\u2019s creator William Porcher Miles, the significance of red, white, and blue was that they were \u201cthe true republican colors,\u201d emblematic in heraldry of valor, purity and truth ( bit.ly/3hItbVc ).\n\nKaye pointed to a letter from Miles to General P.G.T. Beauregard from August 27, 1861 where he explained his design of the flag, quoted by Philip Katcher in the book \u201cFlags of the Civil War\u201d: \u201cThe Stars ought always to be White \u2026 because they are blazoned \u2018Proper\u2019 (or natural color)\u2026 The white edge\u2026is necessary\u2026 It would not do to but a blue cross\u2026on a red field; [it] adds also much to the brilliancy of the colors\u2026\u201d\n\nThe claim states the blue cross represents the Christian cross of Saint Andrew. In reality, the flag\u2019s design explicitly sought to avoid ecclesiastical meaning, according to Kaye. In the book \u201cThe Confederate Battle Flag\u201d, historian John M. Coski explains that the cross was turned diagonally with the explicit intention of not being a Christian symbol. As Coski points out, the creator of the flag said he wanted it to be \"more Heraldric [sic] than Ecclesiastical\" ( here ). Coski further documents how according to Miles the diagonal cross was preferable because \u201cit avoided the religious objection about the cross (from the Jews and many Protestant sects)\u201d ( here ).\n\nThe claim states the 13 stars represent the 13 Southern states of secession. Kaye confirmed this claim to be true. These were the 11 Confederate states plus the contested states of Kentucky and Missouri, which the Confederacy claimed as part of its union ( here and here ).\n\nMore background on the history of the flag can be found here and here .\n\nPartly false. The colors of the Confederate battle flag do not have religious significance, nor does the cross. The stars do represent the 13 Southern states of secession.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
