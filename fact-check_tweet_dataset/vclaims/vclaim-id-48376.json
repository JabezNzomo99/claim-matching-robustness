Western Media Discovers That Greta Thunberg Is a Secret Kremlin Agent!\u201d\n\nThe video, an extract from 60 Minutes, a political talk show broadcast on the Rossiya-1 state television channel, was devoted to a letter from J\u00f6rg Meuthen, a member of the European Parliament from Germany\u2019s Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party. He wrote asking the European Commission if it could rule out that Fridays for Future (FFF) and other environmental campaigns are \u201chybrid threats\u201d possibly \u201cbeing financed and steered by Russia\u201d.\n\nDespite the Russian media focus, that letter does not mention the 16-year old environmental activist by name.\n\nFFF was inspired by Thunberg\u2019s decision to begin skipping class on Fridays to protest climate change outside of the Swedish parliament.\n\nHowever, FFF is a grass roots movement and not a legal entity.\n\n\u201cThere is no elected body that can be held liable for its actions, nor does it have a board or statutes. The movement is comprised of like-minded individuals who are connected digitally,\u201d Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel reported.\n\nA Swedish media contact from FFF told Polygraph.info that Thunberg has no official role in the movement.\n\n\u201cGreta inspired [FFF] and named it with the first people to strike with her, [but] Greta has no official roles in Fridays For Future. It is a people's movement. We are all volunteers. Nobody is paid,\u201d the media contact said.\n\nDespite its grassroots nature, FFF had 300,000 euros in its main bank account and 60,000 euros in a special legal aid account as of August, funds collected from donations.\n\nThe FFF media contact said financial decisions regarding these donations are made on the local level.\n\n\u201cWe are a global people\u2019s movement, with climate strikers in over 170 countries. Decisions about how best to use local funds to achieve our goal are taken locally,\u201d the media contact said.\n\nMeuthen\u2019s letter also mentions We Don\u2019t Have Time, an environmentally-focused social network and tech startup financed by Swedish businessman Ingmar Rentzhog.\n\nRussian media has regularly disseminated the conspiracy theory that Rentzhog \u201ccontrols\u201d Greata Thunberg.\n\nIn February 2019, Thunberg acknowledged that she had served briefly as a youth advisor on the board of We Don\u2019t Have Time. However, she said that relationship had ended.\n\n\u201cIt turns out they used my name as part of another branch of their organization that is a start up business,\u201d Thunberg wrote on Facebook. \u201cThey have admitted clearly that they did so without the knowledge of me or my family. I no longer have any connection to \u2018We Don\u2019t Have Time\u2019. Nor does anyone in my family. They have deeply apologized for what has happened and I have accepted their apology.\u201d\n\nThunberg also addressed claims she is being \u201cpaid\u201d or \u201cused\u201d by others, writing:\n\n\u201cI am not part of any organization. I sometimes support and cooperate with several NGOs that work with the climate and environment. But I am absolutely independent and I only represent myself. And I do what I do completely for free, I have not received any money or any promise of future payments in any form at all. And nor has anyone linked to me or my family done so.\u201d\n\nDespite the absence of Greta\u2019s official connections to these groups, 60 Minutes co-host Yevgeny Popov claimed \u201cthe European Parliament is practically launching an investigation into the fact that Greta Thunberg, this environmental activist, is being sponsored by none other than our beloved motherland Russia.\u201d\n\nMaria Shteinman, a professor at the Russian Higher School of Economics, told the 60 Minutes panel that \u201cthe respected member of the European parliament seems to be gripped by fear of Russia.\u201d\n\nShteinman added that Thungburg is \u201cbeing used against her will,\u201d repeating the false claim that she is a \u201cPR project\u201d created by Rentzhog.\n\nAnother 60 Minutes guest, Alexey Martynov, director of the Moscow-based International Institute of Newly-Established States, repeated the smear that Thunburg is \u201ca sick child\u201d and, echoing other Russian media outlets, said that Meuthen was \u201ctrolling\u201d the European Commission.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gibe based on the anti-Russian discourse that prevails in the European media, on the internet and so on,\u201d he said, adding that Thunburg is \u201cbeing used.\u201d\n\nRussian state broadcaster RT and news agency TASS both make explicit the likelihood Meuthen is likely \u201ctrolling\u201d in his request to investigate possible Russian ties to the environmental campaigns.\n\nRussian media have gone to great lengths to smear the climate activist, going so far as to compare her to ISIS and Hitler.\n\nRT, for its part, regularly puts out reports attacking the young climate activist. Oil and gas form a substantial part of Russia\u2019s budget revenue and exports.\n\nThe media reports appear to synchronize with the Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s opinion on Greta Thunberg.\n\n\"It's deplorable when someone is using children and teenagers in their interests,\" Putin said, while commenting on Thunberg\u2019s activism at an energy forum in Moscow on October 3.\n\nMeanwhile, Meuthen\u2019s own right-wing Alternative for Germany party has been accused of being backed by the Kremlin.\n\nIn April, the German daily Der Spiegel obtained a strategy paper sent from the Russia\u2019s State Duma to the \u201cthe highest levels of leadership in the [Russian] presidential administration.\u201d\n\nThat document describes Meuthen\u2019s AfD colleague as being the Kremlin\u2019s \u201cown absolutely controlled MP in the Bundestag.\"\n\nA document obtained from the BBC, dated April 2017, apparently called on Russian media to help Frohnmaier's campaign for the German federal election held in September of that year.\n\n\"For the election campaign we urgently would need some support,\" the letter read. \"Besides material support, we would need media support as well... any type of interviews, reports and opportunities to appear in the Russian media is helpful for us.\"\n\nThe BBC noted there was no evidence the Kremlin actually provided \"material support\" to Frohnmaier's campaign.\n\nAnother AfD candidate for the state parliament from Stuttgart asked for a campaign donation from the Russians, adding \"every donation is welcome,\" Spiegel reported.\n\nTime magazine reported that the AfD estimates a third of its constituency comes from Germany\u2019s Russian-speaking population, which may account for 5% of the country\u2019s population and which the party targets with its campaign materials.\n\n\u201cAmong the AfD\u2019s core pledges on foreign policy is to lift German sanctions on Russia and seek warmer relations with President Vladimir Putin,\u201d Time wrote.\n\nA number of AfD members have had contacts with Russian oligarchs and political leaders. Three AfD members received a sponsored flight to Moscow during the 2017 campaign, which prompted the chairman of the German parliament's foreign affairs committee, Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, to ask rhetorically: \"For which state or federal parliamentary deputy would a Russian sponsor charter a private plane and pay \u20ac25,000 ($29,000)?\"\n\nAn AfD co-leader at the time, Frauke Petry, reportedly met with Vyacheslav Volodin, former first deputy chief of staff to Russian President Vladimir Putin and State Duma speaker, on that trip.\n\nDespite these and other questionable ties, RT editorialized in an unbylined news report \u201cthat Russia is regularly pinned as the nefarious culprit behind various political figures and movements in the Western world without any evidence to back up such assertions.\u201d\n\nAs for the latest accusations leveled at Thunberg, the verdict is clear.\n\nBased on all of the available evidence, Polygraph.info finds Popov\u2019s claim, that the European Parliament \u201cis practically launching an investigation\u201d into Thunberg\u2019s alleged Russian sponsorship, to be false.", "lang": "en"}
