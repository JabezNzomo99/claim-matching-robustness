Bernie Sanders would have beaten Donald Trump in the 2016 election if Sanders had been the Democratic nominee.\n\nIn February 2020, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was waging a campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination against several other candidates, among whom U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders from Vermont appeared to be the front-runner.\n\nAbout that time a quote meme surfaced on social media representing that Bloomberg had once declared Sanders would have \u201cwalked away\u201d with the 2016 presidential election and beaten Donald Trump if Sanders, rather than Hillary Clinton, had been the Democratic nominee that year:\n\nThat statement is correctly attributed to Bloomberg. On Nov. 17, 2016, a few weeks after Trump won the presidential election, Bloomberg was the featured guest at a Distinguished Speaker Seminar held by the Sa\u00efd Business School at the University of Oxford.\n\nSpeaking on subjects such as leadership, equality in the workplace, and Donald Trump, Bloomberg stated at the tail end of his talk, \u201cI\u2019ll leave you with a thought \u2014 there was a guy, Bernie Sanders, who would\u2019ve beaten Donald Trump. The polls show he would have walked away with it, but Hillary Clinton got the nomination, for a variety of reasons.\u201d\n\nHowever, Bloomberg\u2019s point was not that Sanders was the superior candidate; rather, Bloomberg was illustrating his viewpoint that Sanders pulled in many younger followers who were attracted by the label of \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d without understanding what it meant.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, young people supported Sanders merely because they thought that \u201cdemocratic\u201d sounded good and believed \u201csocialism\u201d was related to social media \u2014 a phenomenon, Bloomberg opined, that came about because \u201cour kids no longer learn civics in school [and] they no longer read western history.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
