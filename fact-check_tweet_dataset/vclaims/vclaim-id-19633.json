Britain has the highest rate of cocaine use among young adults in Europe, their consumption being almost double that of other nations on the continent... \u201cFor every gram of coke they put up their nose, four square kilometres of rainforest are destroyed.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s correct that cocaine use among 16 to 24 years olds in England and Wales is at its highest level for around a decade. In 2017/18 6% said they had used at least once in the previous year.\n\nThe claim referred to Britain, but used data covering only England & Wales. We\u2019re focusing on England & Wales as data for Scotland and Wales are not available for the most recent year.\n\nCocaine use fell by about half among young people between 2008/09 and 2012/13 and has since risen again to just shy of the 2008/09 peak.\n\nAs for class A drugs generally, 8.4% of 16-24 year olds said they had used a class A drug in the past year.\n\nThe data comes from a survey so there is a margin of error with the results. This survey covers households in England and Wales and so does not cover groups (such as those living in student halls of residence), who have \u201cpotentially high proportions of drug use\u201d, meaning the true figure could be higher.\n\nWe can\u2019t be certain, but it\u2019s plausible England & Wales has the highest youth cocaine use in Europe\n\nComparing England & Wales to other countries in Europe is difficult because not all countries have up to date data.\n\nThe EU collates drug use data from 26 European countries and based on the latest data from each country, England & Wales has the highest cocaine use among 16-24 year olds.\n\nAlthough though some countries\u2019 drug data is old, cocaine use among 16-24 year olds in England and Wales has always been above all the other 25 countries for their latest data year. For example Finland\u2019s latest data is from 2014, when 0.6% of 15\u201324 year olds had taken cocaine in the past year. In 2014/15 the figure for England & Wales was 4.8%.\n\nHowever there are other countries in Europe with similar cocaine use to England and Wales. In 2017 4.4% of Danish 15\u201324 year olds had taken cocaine in the past year.\n\nThe claim about rainforest destruction is out by a factor of a million\n\nThe claim that each gram of cocaine is the result of the destruction of 4 square kilometres of rainforest appears to come from a 2008 statement by the then vice-president of Colombia.\n\nHe actually said 4 square metres, not kilometres are destroyed for each gram of cocaine. The Times has since corrected their piece.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure these figures are still true, even if they may have been at the time. Colombia produced an estimated 866 tons of pure cocaine in 2016. Using the 4 square metre to gram conversion, that would suggest around 350,000 hectares of rainforest should have been lost in Colombia purely from cocaine production.\n\nIn fact, in 2016 Colombian newspapers reported that 180,000 hectares of rainforest were lost that year (according to official statistics). So around half the area as would be expected from the \u201c4 square metre per gram\u201d claim, and that assumes that cocaine consumed in the UK is of 100% purity and that all Colombian deforestation is due to cocaine production.", "lang": "en"}
