Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of COVID-19 dead bodies in Mexico being thrown into the sea. Fact: The video was found to exist on the internet at least since July 2018. But the first COVID-19 case was reported in the world in China in December 2019. So the video is old and the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were subjected to reverse image search technique, the same video was found in the \u2018imgur.com\u2019 website. The video had the title \u2018Skydiving out of the largest helicopter in use today, the Mi-26\u2019 and had the date of upload as \u201825 July 2018\u2019. Many search results were about \u2018Paratroopers being released from Mi 26 helicopter\u2019. Those results can be seen here, here and here. But FACTLY was unable to ascertain the exact context of the video. The first COVID-19 case was reported in the world in China in December 2019. So, as the video is found to exist prior to the reporting of the first COVID-19 case in the world, it can be concluded that the video has nothing to do with COVID-19 and the claim is false.\n\nTo sum it up, an old video is being shared as \u2018COVID-19 dead bodies in Mexico are being thrown into the sea\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
