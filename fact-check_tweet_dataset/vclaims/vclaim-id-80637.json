After all, Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory; 3.5 million of the island\u2019s residents are U.S. citizens.\n\nAnd now the word bailout is being thrown around.\n\nRyan does back a bill for Puerto Rico that is sponsored by a fellow Wisconsin Republican, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy.\n\nBut the bill is not what is commonly understood to be a bailout. That is, unlike American banks and automakers that got bailed out, Puerto Rico would not get any U.S. tax dollars.\n\nAt the same time, the ad is careful to say the \"bailout\" would hurt \"savers and seniors,\" not taxpayers.\n\nAnd Duffy\u2019s bill, experts tell us, almost certainly would mean lower returns for perhaps hundreds of thousands of Americans who invested in what long had been regarded as safe Puerto Rican bonds.\n\nThe sponsor of the nationally televised ad is the Center for Individual Freedom, a conservative non-profit based outside of Washington, D.C. that does not disclose its donors. The center says its mission is to \"protect and defend individual freedoms and individual rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.\"\n\nHere\u2019s a full description of the 30-second, narrated ad, which was unveiled April 13, 2016:\n\nThe Center for Individual Freedom didn\u2019t respond to our call and emails asking for evidence to back its claim. But a news release from the group makes it clear the center is calling Duffy\u2019s bill a bailout.\n\nThe bill would establish a federal Oversight Board to assist Puerto Rico in managing its public finances. Ultimately, a judge would have the power to reduce the $72 billion in debt, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe experts we consulted agreed with Ryan, who has said the bill is not a taxpayer bailout of Puerto Rico, given that it would not commit any U.S. funds to the island.\n\nBut the experts also agreed with U.S. Rep. John Fleming, R-La., a critic who has said the bill would function like a bailout because Congress would be \"changing the rules\" to benefit Puerto Rico.\n\nThe rules would change under the bill in that Puerto Rico could restructure its debt, similar to what is done in a so-called Chapter 9 bankruptcy, and pay less to some creditors than the creditors are owed.\n\nIn terms of the impact on American investors, many bond funds have already sold their Puerto Rican debt, and the debt is now mostly owned by hedge funds, according to the Associated Press. But Oppenheimer Funds and Franklin Templeton still own part of the debts.\n\nSo, a restructuring almost certainly would mean that Americans who, through brokers or choices they made in their retirement accounts, put some of their savings into Puerto Rican bonds almost certainly will get a lower return on their money, the experts told us.\n\nBut there is one more consideration, said Simon Johnson, a professor of global economics at the MIT Sloan School of Management:\n\nAmericans who invested in Puerto Rican bonds thinking they were safe overestimated how safe they are, as the island\u2019s debt crisis shows.\n\nWith an Oversight Board managing a debt restructuring, savers likely will get a lower return than they expected. But without such a board, creditors would be fighting in court and the returns for individuals investors would likely be lower still.\n\nThe Center for Individual Freedom, a Super PAC, says in a TV ad that Ryan backs a proposal that would be a \"bailout\" of Puerto Rico.\n\nThe ad is misleading in its repeated use of the word bailout, in that legislation supported by Ryan -- unlike past bailout bills -- would not direct any U.S. tax dollars to the debt-ridden island.\n\nBut the ad was careful to say the \"bailout\" would hurt \"savers and seniors.\" And experts told us the bill almost certainly would result in lower returns for Americans who invested money in Puerto Rican bonds.\n\nFor a statement that is partially accurate but takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.", "lang": "en"}
