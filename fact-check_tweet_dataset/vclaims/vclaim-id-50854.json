But Sen. Chuck Schumer went too far when he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know of any other Democrat who agrees with Beto O\u2019Rourke.\u201d\n\nThere are at least two Democratic senators running for president who agree with O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal. And in polls, a strong majority of Democratic voters support it.\n\nO\u2019Rourke made headlines with this proclamation during the third Democratic debate: \u201c[H]ell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d\n\nDebate moderator David Muir, Sept. 12: You\u2019ve said, quote, \u201cAmericans who own AR-15s and AK-47s will have to sell them to the government, all of them.\u201d You know that critics call this confiscation. Are you proposing taking away their guns? And how would this work? O\u2019Rourke: I am, if it\u2019s a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield, if the high impact, high velocity round, when it hits your body, shreds everything inside of your body, because it was designed to do that, so that you would bleed to death on a battlefield and not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers. When we see that being used against children, and in Odessa, I met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15, and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa and Midland, there weren\u2019t enough ambulances to get to them in time, hell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. We\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.\n\nO\u2019Rourke got pushback from both outside and inside his own party.\n\nWest Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, told reporters, \u201cI can tell you one thing: Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s not taking my guns away from me. You tell Beto that OK?\u201d\n\nSen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, said the comment was not a \u201cwise policy or political move\u201d and Coons predicted \u201cthat clip will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying that Democrats are coming for your guns.\u201d\n\nRepublican Sen. Pat Toomey agreed, tweeting on Sept. 13 that mandatory buybacks of certain semi-automatic weapons \u201cis an awful and extreme idea\u201d that does not have nearly enough support in Congress to pass.\n\nToomey, who co-sponsored a bill with Coons to strengthen federal background checks, warned that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comment \u201cundermines and hurts bipartisan efforts to actually make progress on commonsense gun safety efforts, like expanding background checks.\u201d\n\nPicking up on that theme, President Donald Trump tweeted that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comment \u201c[c]onvinced many that Dems just want to take your guns away\u201d and that his comment \u201cmade it much harder to make a deal\u201d on new gun laws.\n\nSchumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, said that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments were not representative of Democrats. In a Sept. 18 conference call with upstate New York reporters, Schumer said, \u201cI don\u2019t know of any other Democrat who agrees with Beto O\u2019Rourke, but it\u2019s no excuse not to go forward.\u201d\n\nAll of the leading Democratic presidential candidates support a ban on the sale of certain semi-automatic weapons, which were banned from 1994 to 2004 as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. And most of the candidates have expressed a preference for either a mandatory or voluntary buyback of such weapons currently owned by Americans.\n\nAside from O\u2019Rourke, at least two other Democratic candidates for president also support mandatory buybacks of the powerful rifles, and both currently serve in the Senate.\n\nA week before the Democratic debate, Sen. Kamala Harris told reporters in New Hampshire on Sept. 6 that she supports a mandatory buyback program.\n\n\u201cWe have to work out the details \u2014 there are a lot of details \u2014 but I do\u201d support a forced buyback, Harris said. \u201cWe have to take those guns off the streets.\u201d\n\nSen. Cory Booker also supports such a proposal. According to Bloomberg, Booker \u201cnoted that other countries have been able to take military-style semiautomatic weapons \u2018off the streets\u2019 and that the U.S. can\u2019t let the National Rifle Association \u2018tell us what\u2019s possible.\u2019\u201d\n\nOne other candidate, Julian Castro, said he \u201cat least\u201d supports a voluntary buyback program, but \u201cI\u2019m willing to hear the arguments on mandatory.\u201d\n\nNew York Mayor Bill deBlasio, who dropped out of the presidential race on Sept. 20, told Politico that he supports a mandatory buyback program. Two other Democrats in Congress who also dropped out of the presidential race have expressed support for mandatory buybacks.\n\nIn August, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand told CNN that she wants to \u201cdo a buyback program across the country so that those who own them can be \u2026 compensated for their money that they spent.\u201d Asked whether the buybacks should be mandatory, Gillibrand responded, \u201cYou don\u2019t want people to retain them because if you make them illegal, you don\u2019t want to grandfather in all the assault weapons that are all across America. You would like people to sell them back to the government so that you can make sure people who shouldn\u2019t have access to these weapons couldn\u2019t have them.\u201d\n\nIn an op-ed for USA Today in May, Rep. Eric Swalwell \u2014 who, like Gillibrand, has since dropped out of the presidential race \u2014 wrote that \u201cwe should ban possession of military-style semiautomatic assault weapons, we should buy back such weapons from all who choose to abide by the law, and we should criminally prosecute any who choose to defy it by keeping their weapons.\u201d Swalwell said such buybacks could cost the federal government as much as $15 billion.\n\n\u201cConsider this an investment in averting carnage and heartache and loss,\u201d Swalwell wrote.\n\nNobody knows exactly how many so-called assault weapons are in circulation, but the NRA says the AR-15 is \u201cAmerica\u2019s most popular rifle.\u201d That rifle was used in several mass shootings, including at schools in Newtown, Connecticut, and Parkland, Florida. A 2012 report from the Congressional Research Service said \u201cdata are not available on the number of \u2018assault weapons\u2019 in private possession or available for sale,\u201d but the report cited a 2004 study that estimated about 1.5 million \u201cassault weapons\u201d were privately owned in 1994. The estimates now range from 3.3 million to 16 million.\n\nThe three candidates currently leading in the polls \u2014 former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2014 all support a voluntary buyback program.\n\nIn the Sept. 13 Democratic debate, Sen. Amy Klobuchar said, \u201cI personally think we should start with a voluntary buyback program.\u201d\n\nA provision in S. 66, the Assault Weapons Ban of 2019, introduced by Sen. Dianne Feinstein in January, allows state or local governments to use federal grant money for a voluntary buyback of grandfathered weapons. The bill, which has stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate, has 34 co-sponsors, including Sens. Klobuchar, Warren, Booker, Harris and Sanders.\n\nOn CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sept. 15, host Jake Tapper asked Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg if O\u2019Rourke\u2019s debate comment about mandatory buybacks is \u201cplaying into the hands of Republicans.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Buttigieg replied. \u201cLook, right now, we have an amazing moment on our hands. We have agreement among the American people for not just universal background checks, but we have a majority in favor of red flag laws, [banning] high-capacity magazines, banning the new sale of assault weapons. This is a golden moment to finally do something, because we have been arguing about this for as long as I have been alive. When even this president and even Mitch McConnell are at least pretending to be open to reforms, we know that we have a moment on our hands. Let\u2019s make the most of it and get these things done.\u201d\n\nWhat About the Public?\n\nAccording to a Quinnipiac poll released in late August, voters were split when asked if they \u201csupport or oppose a mandatory buyback of assault weapons\u201d \u2014 46% of voters support the concept, while 49% oppose it. But among Democrats, the idea was quite popular: 71% said they support the idea, while just 18% of Republicans and 47% of independents said that.\n\nAn NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll conducted between Sept. 5 and 8 found similar results: 46% said Congress should pass legislation to \u201ccreate a mandatory buyback program of assault guns.\u201d Again, the poll found strong support \u2014 70% \u2014 among Democrats. Support was 23% among Republicans and 40% among independents.\n\nWhen Schumer said, \u201cI don\u2019t know of any other Democrat who agrees with Beto O\u2019Rourke,\u201d he was likely talking about members of Congress. (We reached out to Schumer\u2019s office about his comment, but we did not hear back.) O\u2019Rourke\u2019s plan may not have much support in Congress, and there\u2019s no proposed legislation that would require Americans to sell their semi-automatic rifles to the government. But O\u2019Rourke is not alone among Democrats in holding that position.\n\nSeveral current and former presidential candidates now serving in Congress also support a mandatory buyback program. And the two polls we cited above suggest a healthy majority of Democratic voters also support O\u2019Rourke\u2019s plan.", "lang": "en"}
