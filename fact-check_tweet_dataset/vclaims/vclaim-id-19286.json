His top economic adviser later said \u201cwe do have such authority, but it is not going to be exercised presently.\u201d\n\nUnder what authority can a president order U.S. businesses to leave China? The president cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, which \u201cgrants sweeping powers to the President to control economic transactions\u201d during a national emergency, according to a March 20 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s tweet suggests invoking the law in a way that it has never been used, experts say. The CRS report said \u201cno President has used IEEPA to enact a policy that was primarily domestic in effect,\u201d and experts aren\u2019t certain how far the president could go in exerting his authority.\n\nHere we take a look at the 1977 law, its intended purpose and how it has been used.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, congressional investigations \u201cdiscovered that the United States had been in a state of emergency for more than 40 years\u201d \u2014 prompting Congress to take steps to repeal some national emergencies, restrict the powers of the president and provide more congressional oversight during national emergencies.\n\nCongress amended the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 \u201cso that it was, as originally intended, only applicable \u2018during a time of war,'\u201d CRS says in its report. It also enacted the National Emergencies Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to cover new states of emergencies.\n\n\u201cHouse and Senate committee reports [in 1977] expressed the view that past Presidents had abused the authority to regulate economic transactions in a national emergency conferred by TWEA by using it in circumstances far removed from those that originally gave rise to the declaration of national emergency,\u201d the CRS report said.\n\nThe IEEPA empowers a president to prohibit \u201cany transactions in foreign exchange\u201d in times of a declared national emergency. The law is intended \u201cto deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States,\u201d according to the CRS report.\n\nDespite the original congressional intent, the IEEPA has been used frequently and much in the same way as the TWEA, CRS said. \u201cAs of March 1, 2019, Presidents had declared 54 national emergencies invoking IEEPA, 29 of which are still ongoing,\u201d the CRS report said.\n\nIn most cases, presidents have used IEEPA to impose sanctions on foreign countries. It was first used by President Jimmy Carter to freeze Iranian government assets. President Ronald Reagan used it to ban exports from Nicaragua and prohibit certain transactions involving the South African government. It was later used to target foreign groups or people, as President Bill Clinton did when he targeted Colombian drug traffickers. President George W. Bush was the first, the CRS report said, to use it to sanction any individual, regardless of nationality, when he issued executive order 13219 to target \u201cpersons who threaten international stabilization efforts in the Western Balkans.\u201d\n\nIn a September 2016 essay, Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, wrote that the IEEPA could give \u201cTrump a free hand,\u201d if elected, to implement his protectionist trade agenda.\n\n\u201cThis act is supposed to be exercised only during an \u2018unusual and extraordinary threat,'\u201d Hufbauer wrote of the IEEPA. \u201cBut the courts have never questioned presidential declarations of a \u2018national emergency,\u2019 so precedent seemingly gives President Trump a free hand.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 23, after China announced tariffs on $75 billion worth of U.S. goods, the president tweeted: \u201cOur great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China, including bringing \u2026 \u2026.your companies HOME and making your products in the USA.\u201d He later told reporters he had the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to order U.S. companies not to do business in China, citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nTwo days later, Trump said he has \u201cno plan right now\u201d to invoke a national emergency, and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow downplayed Trump\u2019s remarks in appearances on the Sunday talks shows. \u201cUltimately, we do have such authority, but it is not going to be exercised presently,\u201d Kudlow said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an emergency economic power authority,\u201d Kudlow said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cSo in theory that law exists, but that\u2019s not what the president said. He is asking American companies to take a look, take a fresh look at frankly moving out of China.\u201d (In his tweets, Trump wasn\u2019t \u201casking\u201d U.S. companies to look at leaving China; Trump said he \u201chereby ordered\u201d them to look at leaving China.\u201d)\n\nExperts say that Trump would likely face court challenges, although they disagreed on the potential outcome.\n\n\u201cTrump would face vigorous court challenges by adversely affected US firms and possibly some states, arguing that the president had exercised powers and invoked statutes in ways that the Constitution or Congress never intended,\u201d Hufbauer wrote in his 2016 essay, which was written in the context of using the IEEPA and the TWEA to impose higher tariffs.\n\nIn an email to us, Hufbauer said the IEEPA \u201cgives the president power over investment as well as trade,\u201d and he \u201cwould very likely prevail\u201d in any court case.\n\nWilliam Alan Reinsch, an international business expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, isn\u2019t so sure.\n\nIn an interview, Reinsch told us the IEEPA was \u201cintended [by Congress] to be used against another country \u2014 freezing assets, blocking imports and exports \u2026 things like that.\u201d He said the law probably gives Trump the power to prohibit U.S. companies from making future investments in China, but \u201ctelling U.S. companies that they have to leave I think probably goes too far.\u201d\n\nHufbauer agreed that the president had the power to prohibit \u201cfuture investment, for sure.\u201d But he also added, \u201cI think the president can force US companies to disinvest as well.\u201d\n\nReinsch said there is no \u201cclear answer\u201d to the question of the scope of Trump\u2019s power under the IEEPA. \u201cThe real answer is anything he does would be litigated,\u201d he said.", "lang": "en"}
