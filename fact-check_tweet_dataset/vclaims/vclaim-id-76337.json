Two days later, Trump disavowed Duke in a news conference.\n\nBut Trump, who claims to have the \"world\u2019s greatest memory,\" seemed to have forgotten this by Feb. 28. When CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper asked him about Duke, Trump claimed ignorance four times:\n\n\"Well, just so you understand, I don't know anything about David Duke. okay? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don't know.\n\n\"I don't know, did he endorse me or what's going on, because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. And so you're asking me a question that I'm supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing about. \u2026\n\n\"I don't know any -- honestly, I don't know David Duke. I don't believe I have ever met him. I'm pretty sure I didn't meet him. And I just don't know anything about him.\"\n\nLater that day, Trump tweeted a video of his earlier disavowal of Duke, and blamed his failure to do it again on CNN on \"a very bad earpiece.\"\n\nAs fellow fact-checkers at the Washington Post and Factcheck.org have pointed out, Trump knew enough about Duke to denounce him several times over the past two decades.\n\nTrump, as we previously noted and as he acknowledged himself, renounced Duke just two days before he told Tapper he knew nothing about the white nationalist.\n\nWhen a reporter asked about Duke\u2019s support on Feb. 26 (without identifying Duke as a former Klansman), Trump said, \"I didn\u2019t even know he endorsed me. David Duke endorsed me? Okay, all right, I disavow, okay?\"\n\nAnd a few months ago, in August 2015, Trump \"repudiated\" an earlier expression of support from Duke in a Bloomberg interview:\n\nJohn Heilemann: \"We\u2019ve heard this week that David Duke \u2014 former Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan \u2014 has come out and said he\u2019s in support of your candidacy. So my first question is why do people like that like Donald Trump? And second, how do you feel about the David Duke quasi-endorsement?\"\n\nTrump: \"I don\u2019t know the answer to the first. Who knows why? But I don\u2019t need his endorsement. I certainly wouldn\u2019t want his endorsement. I don\u2019t need anybody\u2019s endorsement. I\u2019m not looking for\u2026\"\n\nTrump: \"Sure, I would do that if it made you feel better. I would certainly repudiate. I don\u2019t know anything about him. Somebody told me yesterday, whoever he is, he did endorse me. And actually I don\u2019t think it was an endorsement. He said I was absolutely the best of all the candidates. But I wouldn\u2019t want him \u2026\"\n\nFifteen years ago, when Trump was flirting with a White House bid as a Reform Party candidate, he named Duke as a cause of concern at least three times.\n\nIn 2000, former wrestler and then-Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura broke with the Reform Party because he didn\u2019t want to be associated with the Reform Party\u2019s presidential candidate Pat Buchanan, whom Duke supported.\n\n\"Buchanan is an anti-abortion extremist and an unrealistic isolationist,\" Ventura told the New York Daily News on Feb. 12, 2000. \"The latest I hear is that he's now getting support from David Duke. I can't be a part of that and I won't be part of that.\"\n\nBefore he called it quits, Ventura said he consulted with Trump. After Ventura left the party, Trump also named Duke as one of the Reform's \"biggest problems\" on NBC\u2019s Today Show.\n\n\"Well, you've got David Duke just joined \u2014 a big racist, a problem. I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party,\" Trump said on Feb. 14, 2000.\n\nHe announced that day that he wouldn\u2019t seek the nomination of the Reform Party, naming Duke as one of his reasons.\n\n\"Now I understand that David Duke has decided to join the Reform Party to support the candidacy of Pat Buchanan,\" Trump wrote in a statement. \"So the Reform Party now includes a Klansman, Mr. Duke, a Neo-Nazi, Mr. Buchanan, and a Communist, Ms. Fulani. This is not company I wish to keep.\"\n\nA few days later, Trump himself quit the party and repeated his earlier statement.\n\n\"Although I am totally comfortable with the people in the New York Independence Party, I leave the Reform Party to David Duke, Pat Buchanan and Lenora Fulani. That is not company I wish to keep,\" Trump wrote in a Feb. 19, 2000, New York Times op-ed.\n\nEven earlier, Trump appeared on CNN on Nov. 19, 1991, and discussed Duke\u2019s defeat in the Louisiana governor\u2019s race and his possibly running against then-President George H.W. Bush. (Duke declared his candidacy as a Republican about a month after Trump\u2019s interview.)\n\nLarry King: \"Did the David Duke thing bother you? Fifty-five percent of the whites in Louisiana voted for him. Four hundred New Yorkers contributed.\"\n\nTrump: \"I hate seeing what it represents, but I guess it just shows there's a lot of hostility in this country. There's a tremendous amount of hostility in the United States.\"\n\nTrump: \"It's anger. I mean, that's an anger vote. People are angry about what's happened. People are angry about the jobs. If you look at Louisiana, they're really in deep trouble. When you talk about the East Coast \u2014 it's not the East Coast. It's the East Coast, the middle coast, the West Coast.\"\n\nKing: \"If he runs and Pat Buchanan runs, might you see a really divided vote?\"\n\nTrump: \"Well, I think if they run, or even if David Duke \u2014 I mean, George (H.W.) Bush was very, very strong against David Duke. I think if he had it to do again, he might not have gotten involved in that campaign because I think David Duke now, if he runs, takes away almost exclusively Bush votes and then a guy like (Mario) Cuomo runs. I think Cuomo can win the election.\"\n\nKing: \"But Bush morally had to come out against him.\"\n\nTrump: \"I think Bush had to come out against him. I think Bush \u2014 if David Duke runs, David Duke is going to get a lot of votes. Whether that be good or bad, David Duke is going to get a lot of votes.\"\n\nTrump said, \"I don't know anything about David Duke.\"\n\nTrump seems to have forgotten that he knew enough about Duke to denounce him twice this election cycle. In 2000, he knew enough to criticize Duke\u2019s racism. And in 1991, he knew enough to say he hated what votes for Duke represented.", "lang": "en"}
