His teachings and tactics, particularly his use of nonviolent resistance, inspired other social activists, including American civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and former South African President Nelson Mandela.\n\nYet, while Gandhi is highly quotable, the Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that the quote originated with him. A search of the Gandhi Heritage Portal\u2019s archive, which contains 100 volumes of original documents related to Gandhi, turned up no results.\n\n\u201cThe quotation is not from Gandhi, but it is an attempt to sort of put Gandhi\u2019s thinking into words,\u201d said Johannes Bakker, a retired University of Guelph professor and editor of \u201cGandhi and the Gita,\u201d which explores Gandhi\u2019s relationship with the ancient Hindu text, in an email to the DCNF.\n\nNicholas Klein, an American labor union activist, made a similar statement in a 1914 speech, according to Bakker.\n\nIndeed, the website Quote Investigator found the earliest \u201csubstantive\u201d match in a speech Klein delivered at an Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America conference that year.\n\n\u201cAnd, my friends, in this story you have a history of this entire movement,\u201d Klein said during the address. \u201cFirst they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. And then they attack you and want to burn you. And then they build monuments to you.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have all shared the falsely attributed quote on social media in recent years.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
