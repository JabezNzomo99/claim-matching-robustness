There are an estimated 725,000 17 year-olds in the UK. Also the election is all but certain to be on 12 December, not in November as the post claims.\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how many of these people will turn 18 before election day. You can register to vote in the UK if you are over 16 (or over 14 in Scotland), but you have to be 18 or over on polling day to be able to vote (assuming you are British, Irish or a qualifying Commonwealth citizen and are resident at an address in the UK).\n\nThese claims seem to originate from the US, as there were around four million births eighteen years ago in 2001. US federal elections are also held in early November.", "lang": "en"}
