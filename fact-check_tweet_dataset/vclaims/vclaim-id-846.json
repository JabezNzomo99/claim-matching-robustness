We've checked the claims in the campaigns' arguments.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-846", "url": "https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-referendum-voting-guide-vote-leave-our-eu-membership-fee/", "vclaim": "The claim that the UK sends \u00a3350 million per week to the EU is wrong.\n\nThis figure does not include a rebate, or discount, on what the UK has to pay. In 2014 the UK would have paid \u00a318.8 billion without the rebate but ended up paying \u00a314.4 billion.\n\nThe estimate for 2015 is \u00a312.9 billion. This is \u00a3248 million per week, or \u00a335 million per day.\n\n How much does the UK receive back?\n\nThe UK then gets money back in grants and payments from the EU. Some flow through the public sector, and mainly go to support farmers and poorer areas of the country. In 2015 this was estimated at \u00a34.4 billion, or \u00a385 million per week. More money, such as research grants, goes directly from the EU to the private sector.\n\nEven so, the UK does get back less than half of the money it pays to the EU in most years.\n\nWhat can be done with the money?\n\nNeither the money that goes back to public sector nor the private sector is fully within the government\u2019s control. If we left the EU we might choose to spend it all differently, or spend the same amount ourselves on farmers, poorer regions and the rest\u2014leaving less to spend on building hospitals.\n\nAssuming that every penny available is spent on hospital building, then anything from half a hospital to three hospitals a week might be built.\n\nIf instead you spent every penny currently sent to the EU hiring hospital nurses, you could get anywhere between 400,000 (Band 2 nurses outside London) and 80,000 (Band 8a nurses based in London). There are currently 285,000 nurses in the English NHS.", "lang": "en"}
