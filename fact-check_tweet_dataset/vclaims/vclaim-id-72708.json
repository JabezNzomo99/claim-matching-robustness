(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe article, from a conservative website called TopTopic, was published on Jan. 27. We found the same story published a day earlier by the satire site WeAretheLlod.com\n\nThis is not a genuine news story. WeAretheLlod.com is a satire blog known for peddling made-up stories. The tag line for the website is: \"Information you probably shouldn\u2019t trust.\"\n\nWe found no evidence that Pelosi spent nearly $500 million on office renovations during the 35-day government shutdown. There have been no reported stories to this effect. When we looked at expenditure reports for the U.S. House, we found the most recent report only goes through Sept. 30, 2018 \u2013 months before Pelosi became the speaker on Jan. 3.\n\nPelosi spokesperson Drew Hammill said the claim is false: \"There were no renovations,\" he said.\n\nStill people seem to be sharing the rumor as fact \u2013 with each story\u2019s version already racking up over 1,900 shares on Facebook as of Jan. 29.\n\nThe story even attempts to break down the items Pelosi supposedly bought for the office. We contacted the original writer on whether she based the numbers on any evidence.\n\n\"I based my numbers on nothing,\" she told us.\n\nIn the article, it references an \"investigative report\" from The Gateway Pundit, a conservative news and opinion website, that revealed that Pelosi \"paid contractors almost $500 million to renovate her office.\" We could not find any related report on The Gateway Pundit\u2019s website.\n\nA story claims that Pelosi spent almost $500 million on office renovations during the shutdown is making the rounds on social media.\n\nWe traced the article\u2019s original source to a satire website that is known for publishing false stories and there are no credible sources to back up this claim. We rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
