The claim originated on a satire website.\n\nThe post alleges that, during a joint interview with her husband, former President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama described country music as \u201cmusic for morons.\u201d Her comments purportedly came after the interviewer, Joe Barron, asked the couple what concerts they hoped to attend after the coronavirus pandemic ends.\n\n\u201cWhen the shocked interviewer asked why, she went into a long diatribe of how much she disliked the true American form of music, much of it shrouded in patriotic themes and Americana,\u201d the post reads. \u201cShe said, \u2018There\u2019s never been an art form so intellectually devoid.'\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no record of such an interview taking place. An internet search turned up no instances of Michelle Obama using the phrases to describe country music. Nor is there any evidence Barack Obama said that he is \u201cnot really a fan\u201d of country music in such an interview.\n\nIn fact, the Obamas hosted at least two country music concerts during their tenure in the White House.
