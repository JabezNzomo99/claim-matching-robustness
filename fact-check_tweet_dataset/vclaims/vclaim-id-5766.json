But paddle your dingy (sic) from France and we\u2019ll welcome you, with a home and benefit?\u201d, the post reads ( here ).\n\nOn July 25, Britain abruptly imposed a two-week quarantine on all travellers arriving from Spain after a surge of coronavirus cases ( here ).\n\nThese rules, however, do not prevent British holidaymakers in Spain from returning to the UK. They state that those returning must provide their journey and contact details and self-isolate for 14 days on arrival ( here ).\n\nThe post also makes an apparent reference to migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats from France, suggesting such people will be welcomed and receive welfare benefits.\n\nA previous Reuters fact check debunked the claim that illegal immigrants - those who have entered the country illegally and do not have the right to stay - are entitled to benefits from the UK\u2019s welfare system ( here ).\n\nRefugees - that is, asylum-seekers whose asylum application has been successful - can claim benefits in Britain. A person entering the UK can register an asylum claim at the border, which if successful will allow them to stay in the country ( here ).\n\nTo be classified as a refugee, a person must be unable to live safely in their own country because of fear of persecution, for example on grounds of race, religion, political opinion or sexual orientation ( here ).\n\nFalse. British holidaymakers can return from Spain. Illegal immigrants cannot receive benefits, although successful asylum-seekers can.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
