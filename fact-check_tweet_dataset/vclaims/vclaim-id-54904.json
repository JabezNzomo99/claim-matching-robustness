According to him, he was cured of COVID-19 after he mixed a teaspoon of salt in a glass of hot water and drank it in 3 gulps. He added that he drank another glass of warm water after 15 minutes, this time without salt, to wash the virus away and release it via urine.\n\nThe facts: In another video Castelo posted on April 23, he said he had not yet been tested for the coronavirus. There is also no registered cure for COVID-19 to date, and the World Health Organization (WHO) warns against self-medication.\n\nCastelo said he will be tested for the coronavirus in an American hospital in two days. Although he claims to have been relieved by drinking salt water, the illness he was suffering from was not confirmed to be COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIniischedule po ang pagtingin dito. 'Pag wala po kasing request ng doctor ko, hindi ako titingnan ng COVID. Dalawang araw na lang po (Testing for COVID-19 is scheduled here in America. If there is no request from a doctor, I would not be tested for COVID-19. I will be tested in two days),\u201d Castelo said, adding that he will share his test results on Friday, April 24.\n\nIn its frequently asked questions page, WHO says: \u201cWhile some western, traditional, or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19.\u201d\n\nA related claim already debunked by Rappler said that gargling saline can cure COVID-19. The DOH has said that although it is used as a home remedy for symptoms of sore throat, \u201cthere is no medical evidence\u201d that saline can kill the virus that causes COVID-19. (READ: FALSE: Gargling salt water \u2018eliminates\u2019 coronavirus)\n\nAnother related claim already debunked by Rappler was that coronavirus can be flushed out of the body by drinking hot liquids. Dr Norberto Francisco, chief of clinical trials and research at the Lung Center of the Philippines, said \u201cthere is no basis for that claim.\u201d (READ: FALSE: Drinking water 'washes' coronavirus, prevents it from entering lungs)\n\nAlthough there is still no registered cure for COVID-19, scientists all over the world are racing to develop different types of vaccine and medicine for the virus. Several clinical trials are also being conducted all over the world. (READ: What you need to know: Coronavirus cures, vaccines being tested)", "lang": "en"}
