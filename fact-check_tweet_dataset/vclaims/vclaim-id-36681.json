The caption claims that the video shows BJP MPs requesting defence minister Rajnath Singh to revoke the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). A tweet shared along with the video reads, \u201cNo media is ready to show this, 88 MP from BJP has met Rajnath Singh and requested to take back NRC and CAB.\u201d\n\nIt has also been shared with a Hindi caption \u2013 \u201c88 \u0938\u093e\u0902\u0938\u0926\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0926\u0932 \u0928\u0947 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0928\u093e\u0925 \u091c\u0940 \u0938\u0947 \u0939\u093e\u0925 \u091c\u094b\u0921\u093c\u0915\u0930 \u090f\u0928\u0906\u0930\u0938\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u0932\u093e\u0917\u0942 \u0928 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u0906\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0939 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0932\u0947\u0915\u093f\u0928 \u0915\u094b\u0908 \u092d\u0940 \u0928\u094d\u092f\u0942\u201d \u2013 that alleges the same.\n\nAlt News found the same video uploaded on August 11, 2018, with the claim that it shows BJP MLA Rajendra Singh giving his resignation to Rajnath Singh, then union home minister. According to the post, this was in protest against the SC/ST Act. MLA Singh tells the union minister, \u201cThe 78% will continue to oppress the 22%. I know you very well, we have slept on the same bed together and now I am begging in front of you for that 22%.\u201d\n\nWe found several other posts on Facebook and YouTube form 2018 which also said that the clip shows BJP MLA Rajendra Singh resigning from his post over the SC/ST Act. In March 2018, a Supreme Court judgement watered-down provisions of the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act that provided for the mandatory arrest of an accused named under the law. The verdict was met with massive protests across the country. As the viral video has existed on the internet since 2018, it cannot be representative of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act. The claim that it shows 88 BJP MPs requesting Rajnath Singh to roll back CAA and NRC is false. [Update: The title of this report erroneously said \u2018MLAs\u2019 instead of \u2018MPs\u2019. The same was rectified on January 14, 2020.]", "lang": "en"}
