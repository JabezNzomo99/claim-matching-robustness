No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to educate gullible Trump supporters and Republicans about the need to actually click and read links before sharing or liking them in order to avoid being embarrassed by fans of the site later. All the events described in the article are not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by America's Last Line of Defense on February 3, 2019 titled \"BREAKING : Kaepernick Arrested By Superbowl Security\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nIn what appears to have been some kind of attempted protest, Nike spokesman and unemployed thug Colin Kaepernick was seized and arrested by Superbowl security at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The stadium being used for Superbowl LIII was named in honor of actress Mercedes Ruehl, who played Tom Hanks' mother in \"Big\", and was also in \"The Warriors.\" According to sources currently within the stadium, Kaepernick entered through a side door, possibly with inside aid. He made his way upwards to the main promenade section where food and beverage retailers line the concourse, and knelt down in an entry gate, blocking it completely. Patrons moving towards their seats asked the kneeling crybaby to move, and were shown obscene gestures, and called insulting names. One man attempted to push Kaepernick out of the way, and a fracas ensued. A security team responded within seconds, pepper-spraying, beating, and then finally tasering the San Francisco menace into a puddle of liberal tears and whimpers.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nBut the site had a disclaimer in the header that read \"Information you probably shouldn't trust\" and the story was posted in the category \"and the NFL, Satire\". And the Mercedes-Benz stadium is named after the German car maker of course, not the actress. And Kaepernick was still retweeting things less than two hours ago while the story had been posted at least three hours back, for example this tweet by rapper and actor Common:\n\nThe site also comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes trumpbetrayed.us as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
