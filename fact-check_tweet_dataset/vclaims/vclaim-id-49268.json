Epstein died of an apparent suicide in August 2019 while awaiting trial for federal sex-trafficking charges, according to The New York Times.\n\nBut the woman pictured is not Maxwell. The Daily Caller News Foundation conducted a reverse image search of the photo and found several news sources identifying the young woman as Mostyn-Owen, who became Johnson\u2019s first wife. Photographer Dafydd Jones took the picture in March 1986 in Oxford.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson and Allegra Mostyn-Owen, sultans Ball, Oxford Town Hall, 10 March 1986,\u201d reads the caption of the photo on Jones\u2019 website. (RELATED: Did Doctors Describe Boris Johnson\u2019s Coronavirus Symptoms As \u2018Contrived\u2019?)\n\nSome iterations of the claim also include a screen grab of a tweet, purportedly from Johnson, that reads, \u201cRIP to my dear friend Ghislaine Maxwell who was found dead next week.\u201d However, that tweet is fake. The DCNF found no record of it on Johnson\u2019s verified Twitter account nor in Politwoops\u2019 archive of his deleted tweets.\n\nMaxwell was arrested in New Hampshire last week by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Post reported. She faces charges that include conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, and perjury, according to the indictment.\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s Office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
