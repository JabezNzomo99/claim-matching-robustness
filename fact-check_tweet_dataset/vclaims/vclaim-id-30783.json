But they\u2019re not.\n\nWe already debunked this video posted on YouTube. Now, a different clip calls itself \"Real Kobe Bryant helicopter crash footage Calabasas.\"\n\nThis post, which has been viewed more than 774,000 times, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe footage shows what looks like a yellow, white and blue helicopter slowly descending before catching on something on the ground and spinning into a ball of flames.\n\nBut, as we\u2019ve previously reported, Bryant\u2019s private helicopter, which he, his daughter and others were flying in when it crashed in California, was black \u2014 not yellow, white and blue.\n\nThe video posted on YouTube doesn\u2019t look like the images of the crash scene that have been posted by credible sources.\n\nIt was also foggy when the aircraft crashed, and this helicopter is clearly visible.\n\nThe Washington Post reported the helicopter went down in a remote hillside. Fog was dense enough that the Los Angeles Police Department grounded its helicopters, according to the paper. The YouTube video, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t show fog.\n\nJerry Kocharian told the Los Angeles Times that he was drinking coffee outside when he heard a helicopter struggling overhead.\n\n\"It [didn\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out, as it was so foggy,\" he said. According to the Times, the helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and there was a boom.\n\nWe rate this video Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
