{"title": "Limits on immigration detention", "subtitle": "It's true that the UK is the only country in the EU without a specific time limit on how long someone can be held for immigration offences.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-2714", "url": "https://fullfact.org/law/limits-immigration-detention/", "vclaim": "It\u2019s correct that there\u2019s no time limit in the UK on how long someone can be detained under immigration rules, unlike in any other EU country.\n\nMost EU countries have to follow the so-called Return Directive, which says immigration detention cannot normally last longer than six months. That doesn\u2019t apply in the UK and Ireland. In many countries, including Ireland, the usual limit is lower anyway.\n\nBut while there\u2019s no explicit limit, this doesn\u2019t mean people can be held indefinitely. Ever since a court ruling in 1983, there\u2019s been an assumption that the state has limited powers to detain anyway. For example, detention can\u2019t last more than what\u2019s \u201creasonable\u201d given the circumstances. The contents of this ruling have come to be used and known as the \u2018Hardial Singh\u2019 principles (after the name of the case).\n\nThat said, independent inspectors found a few years ago the application of \u2018a reasonable period\u2019 of time was inconsistent, and a group of MPs found similar cases when it gathered evidence on the practice.\n\nThe government says the protections already in place, and the fact that Parliament recently rejected a longer limit, mean a change to the rules on limits isn\u2019t necessary, and has confirmed recently it isn\u2019t seeking any change to the law.\n\nHow does all this play out in reality? Almost two thirds of people leaving detention in the past year were detained for less than 29 days. 3% were detained for over six months. As of 30 June, one person had been detained for over three years.", "lang": "en"}
