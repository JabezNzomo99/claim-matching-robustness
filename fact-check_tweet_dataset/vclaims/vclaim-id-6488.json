The Home Office announced on 8 February that 350 is the limit under the so-called \u2018Dubs Amendment\u2019 scheme.\n\n\u201cJust to clarify, there was never a number made. What the government committed to was to make sure every child that came, who might have been through the most horrific situation, would be given as much support as they could possibly have through the local councils, and the local councils have come back and said \u2018this is the number we feel we can support.\u2019\u201d\n\nWell, so far as we\u2019re aware, the government never officially said that the number of children resettled under the Dubs Amendment would be 3,000, although there may have been unofficial indications to that effect.\n\n3,000 was the number that campaigners and opposition MPs were pushing for in the spring of 2016. Alfred Dubs, a member of the House of Lords, proposed this number on 21 March in a suggested amendment to the Immigration Bill.\n\nIn the lead-up to the vote on the amendment, David Cameron\u2019s government did say that it would resettle 3,000 children and their families\u2014but from the Middle East and North Africa rather than from Europe.\n\nThat was on 21 April. On 24 April, MPs rejected the 3,000 target for children already in Europe. The Lords then suggested the following instead:\n\n\u201cThe Secretary of State must, as soon as possible after the passing of this Act, make arrangements to relocate to the United Kingdom and support a specified number of unaccompanied refugee children from other countries in Europe.\u201d\n\nThe government accepted that version on 4 May, precisely because it didn\u2019t contain a fixed target. Lord Dubs said that the revised version \u201cdrops the specific number, because the Government were resistant to that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been widely reported that, in a meeting the same day, immigration minister James Brokenshire gave backbench MPs the impression that the number would be in the thousands. The Archbishop of Canterbury says that he and other supporters of the scheme \u201cbelieved that the Government was committed to welcoming up to 3,000 children under this scheme\u201d.\n\nBut Ms Perry is correct that until this week, there was never a \u201cspecified number\u201d of refugee children officially announced.\n\nThe Dubs Amendment also says that \u201cthe number of children to be resettled\u2026 shall be determined by the Government in consultation with local authorities\u201d. Councils said that they can handle 400 unaccompanied children, and 50 of those places would be needed for children arriving from Calais under a separate scheme, according to the Home Office\u2019s statement.", "lang": "en"}
