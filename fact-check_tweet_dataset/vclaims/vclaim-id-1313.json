They will not be asked to decide whether the referendum vote is valid or not.\n\nMs Greer\u2019s description of the scope of the case is almost textbook. It\u2019s about whether Parliament has to authorise the triggering of Article 50 by passing a law or resolution. If not, the Prime Minister\u2014or perhaps the whole Cabinet\u2014could take the decision without consulting Parliament.\n\nBut, if the judges decide that the government can\u2019t take the decision alone, that means that starting the process of leaving the EU could be blocked by MPs or Lords. The government is committed to following the referendum result, whereas those in Parliament have differing attitudes to leaving the EU.\n\nThe referendum had no legal effect in itself.", "lang": "en"}
