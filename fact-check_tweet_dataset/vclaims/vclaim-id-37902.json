The claim is false; the woman in the picture is actually US socialite Kim Kardashian.\n\nThis photo has been shared more than 270 times since posted on Twitter on October 10, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Indonesian-language caption translates to English as: \u201cThe daughter of King Salman is very beautiful without a hijab. It is sinful to see it but it is unfortunate to ignore it. Where are the comments from the FPI 212? I guarantee your eyes will not blink with this vitamin!\u201d\n\n\u201cKing Salman\u201d refers to King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia. His profile can be read here in the website of Saudi state media Saudi Press Agency.\n\n\u201cFPI\u201d refers to the Islamic Defenders Front, an Indonesian Islamist organization which organised a mass rally against the then non-Muslim Jakarta governor on December 2, 2016, known as the \u201c212 Rally\u201d.\n\nThe photo was also shared with a similar claim on Facebook here and in a blog post here.\n\nIt was also shared in English on Pinterest here and here with a claim that the woman is Princess Reem Alwaleed bin Talal, another member of the Saudi royal family who is not the daughter of King Salman.\n\nThe claim is false; a Google reverse image search found that the photo was published here on Alamy.com and shows Kardashian attending an event in Los Angeles, California on March 4, 2008. The photo is credited to the entertainment news agency WENN.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Alamy photo:\n\nThe photo caption reads: \u201cKim Kardashian Along with the cast of \u2018Entourage\u2019 film a commercial for American Eagle on Melrose Ave.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading post (L) and the Alamy photo of Kim Kardashian (R):\n\nKing Salman does have one daughter named Princess Hassa bint Salman, the Associated Press reported here on September 12, 2019. However, there are hardly any photos of her.\n\nSome media reports have published a close-up photo of a woman and identified her as Princess Hassa, for example here by The Australian and here by Moroccan news outlet Le 360.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report published by The Australian:\n\nPrincess Reem, who is mentioned in the misleading English claims, is the daughter of Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a Saudi billionaire and the nephew of King Salman.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the AFP photo of Princess Reem dated July 1, 2015:", "lang": "en"}
