All characters appearing in the articles in this website\u2014even those based on real people\u2014are entirely fictional.\u201d\n\nIn short, this claim about President Obama\u2019s ambitions in Kenyan politics is not true; it was invented as a joke. Even so, several commenters on Facebook, and underneath the article itself, seem to be taking it as real.\n\nThe false claim that President Obama was born in Kenya, not the US, has been popular for many years. People who believe and spread the idea are often called \u201cbirthers\u201d. This new satirical article is one of several that attempt to make a joke out of the phenomenon by exaggerating President Obama\u2019s links to Kenya. The irony may have been too deeply buried in this case.", "lang": "en"}
