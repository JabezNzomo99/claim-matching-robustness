He and American researcher James Allison received it \u201cfor their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation,\u201d per the Nobel Prize website.\n\nThe Facebook post cites Honjo as allegedly saying the new coronavirus was engineered in a laboratory in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the virus first emerged in late 2019.\n\n\u201cI know the Chinese labs where the virus was perfected,\u201d Honjo is quoted as saying. \u201cNatural viruses are temperature and climate-sensitive. Corona had affected every nation, irrespective of geography, climate and temperature. Had it been natural, it\u2019s spreading would have been limited to Wuhan like places and climate.\u201d\n\nHe also allegedly added that \u201cif it\u2019s not proven even after my death, take away my Nobel prize,\u201d according to the post.

There is, however, no truth to it.\n\nHonjo denied making the comments in a statement through Kyoto University on April 27, saying, \u201cIn the wake of the pain, economic loss, and unprecedented global suffering caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, I am greatly saddened that my name and that of Kyoto University have been used to spread false accusations and misinformation.\u201d\n\nThe claim, debunked by Snopes in April, appears to have stemmed from the Twitter account @TasukuHonjo, which is not affiliated with the Kyoto professor and has been deleted.\n\nAlthough the exact origins of the new coronavirus remain unknown, experts believe it likely came from bats, CNN reported. Its genetic sequence shares similarities with the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which spread from bats to humans through an intermediary species, according to Nature.\n\nRichard Ebright, a professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, told the Washington Post that \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d in the genetic sequence indicates the virus was engineered.", "lang": "en"}
