Ms Powell isn\u2019t saying that only one in every 1,000 grammar school pupils is on free school meals. She\u2019s saying that for every pupil who\u2019s both on free school meals and in a grammar school, there are 999 who aren\u2019t.\n\nThere are around 3.2 million children at state secondary schools in England as of January 2016, according to official statistics.\n\nAround 170,000\u2014or 50 in every 1,000\u2014is a grammar school pupil. The government says that 2.5% of these children are entitled to free school meals.\n\nThat\u2019s around 4,000 children out of 3.2 million, or 0.001%.\n\nThe government says that it wants to look also at \u201cthe wider impact of selective education of those on low incomes or who just about manage\u201d\u2014not just the very poorest children. So it\u2019s not only interested in students entitled to free school meals.\n\nWe\u2019ve covered the evidence on grammar schools and free school meals pupils in more detail here.", "lang": "en"}
