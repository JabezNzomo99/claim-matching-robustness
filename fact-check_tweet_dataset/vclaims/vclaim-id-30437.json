That\u2019s a decrease of just under two thirds. This year it is forecast to be 2.6%.\n\n\u2018Public sector net borrowing\u2019 is the headline measure of the government\u2019s budget deficit. It\u2019s the difference between the government\u2019s income (mainly taxes) and everything it spends on public services, investment, and debt interest.\n\nBorrowing as a proportion of GDP decreased because the amount the government borrowed over this time fell from \u00a3166 billion to \u00a372 billion (in 2015/16 prices). At the same time the UK\u2019s GDP also increased.\n\nBut the deficit didn\u2019t fall as far as planned, as Mr Corbyn pointed out.\n\nMr Corbyn\u2019s underlying point is correct: the government set deficit targets in 2010 (which it didn\u2019t meet) and in 2015 (which it abandoned).\n\nBut when the government said it would balance the deficit by 2015 and create a budget surplus by 2020 it wasn\u2019t referring to the same measure each time.\n\nIn 2010 the government promised to eliminate the \u201ccyclically-adjusted current balance\u201d by 2015/16.\n\nThis measure of the deficit ignores investment spending. It\u2019s also adjusted to take into account whether the economy is in a \u2018boom\u2019 or \u2018bust\u2019 period.\n\nThe government is now forecast to achieve that in 2018/19, three years later than the original target.\n\nIn 2015 the government updated its plans and aimed to have a surplus on public sector net borrowing by 2019/20. This is the wider headline measure we discussed above, which unlike the 2010 measure includes investment spending and isn\u2019t cyclically-adjusted. This means that the government would have to reduce spending by more than under the previous target.\n\nThe government isn\u2019t forecast to achieve this within the next five years, and new targets were set by the Chancellor last autumn.", "lang": "en"}
