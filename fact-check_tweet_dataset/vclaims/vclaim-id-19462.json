At the 34 second mark of the video, a signboard of the Gardanibagh Police Station can be seen.\n\nBOOM then ran a keyword search with \u201cMuslims beaten in Gardanibagh\u201d and was directed to a news report by the Times of India.\n\nThe incident happened in August, 2015, when supporters of the All India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat (AIMMM) and madrassa teachers held protests to improve working conditions of over 2400 madrassas in the state.\n\nThe protesters were holding a fast unto death at the Gardanibagh stadium. According to the report they were lathicharged as soon as a group of protesters came out of the stadium. However, police allege the protesters were trying to storm the chief minister's residence.\n\nThe same was reported by India TV, where similar visuals can be seen.", "lang": "en"}
