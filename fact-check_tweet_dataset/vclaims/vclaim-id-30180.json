In the video, both the women are beaten and pushed around by the men. \u201cA Hindu woman is being picked up by a Muslim in Pakistan in the front of his mother and child. And foolish Hindus are proud of the NRC opposition. There are 55 Islamic countries for 150 million Muslims, there are 69 Christian countries for 250 million Christians. And there is no country for 150 crore Hindus,\u201d tweeted Roy.\n\nThe clip was earlier shared by Renee Lynn, the author of \u2018India Stripped: Voice of India\u2019, on January 7, 2019. Lynn claimed, \u201cThis video is horrifying what\u2019s happening in Pakistan today. These Muslims beat the hell out of this young Hindu girl & her mother & was forcefully taken away.\u201d It has amassed over 4,600 retweets so far.\n\nSwarajya columnist Shefali Vaidya quote-tweeted Lynn and opined , \u201cSkin crawling. And privileged Indian elite like @BDUTT @FarOutAkhtar and @Ram_Guha oppose #CAA coz they want Hindu women from Pakistan to continue to suffer in silence because they are Hindu, poor and lack a voice.\u201d\n\nA few more individuals on Facebook shared the video with the same narrative.\n\nAlt News had earlier debunked the same video in December 2019 when it was shared with the claim that poor women were lifted in public eye and raped by men in Rajasthan. The video is at least two years old and is from Rajasthan\u2019s Jodhpur district.\n\nOne of the men in the video is the husband of the girl they try to abduct. The elderly woman is the mother of the girl. According to a September 27, 2017 report in Dainik Bhaskar, the husband\u2019s name is Shaukat who was married to Nemat and Aamad Khan\u2019s daughter. \u201cAs per the police, Aamad Khan, a resident of Kalu Khan ki Dhani village, had married his daughter to Shaukat at a very young age several years back. Shaukat had asked his in-laws several times to send his wife. However, Shaukat\u2019s mother-in-law Nemat insisted on doing the \u2018Gauna\u2019 when her daughter turns 18. -translated)\u201d, states the report. Shaukat, along with an accomplice Ilyas, came with a tractor and forcefully took his minor wife after beating his resistant mother-in-law.\n\nChild marriage in India is illegal yet prevalent in various parts of the country. Some communities marry their girls at a very young age however the bride stays at her father\u2019s house till the time she attains adulthood. The girl starts living with her husband after a post-marriage ceremony called \u201cGauna\u201d.\n\nAccording to the local police, these men were arrested and charged with \u201cseveral sections of kidnapping, wrongful restraint and using criminal force on a woman with an intent to outrage her modesty\u201d. However, they were later released on bail while the minor girl was living in the same village with her mother.\n\nA two-year-old video from Rajasthan of a man beating his mother-in-law for not allowing him to take his minor wife home is being shared with the false narrative that a Hindu girl and her mother was beaten-up by Muslim men in Pakistan. Despite the truth pointed out, Meghalaya governor Tathagata Roy has refused to take down the misinformation.\n\n[Update: Meghalaya governor Tathagata Roy\u2019s tweet was added to this report on January 16, 2020.]", "lang": "en"}
