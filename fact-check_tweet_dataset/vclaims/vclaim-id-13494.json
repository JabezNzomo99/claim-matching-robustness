But with an attack on Ukrainian military boats it moved to a new stage of aggression. No one will say now: \u2018They are not there\u2019. No one camouflages into green humanoids or militiamen. This is a bold and frank participation of the regular units of the Russian Federation, their demonstrative attack on the detachment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. This is a qualitatively different situation, a qualitatively different threat,\u201d he said.\n\nPoroshenko said the latest incident in the Sea of Azov was likely not the \u201cculmination\u201d of hostilities there.\n\nReacting to the evolving situation, Bogdan Bespalko, a member of the Russian Presidential Council for Inter-ethnic Relations, said that martial law could be used as a pretext to \u201cstrengthen Ukraine\u2019s isolation from Russia.\u201d\n\nHe also said it could \u201centail a series of possible infringements of the rights and freedoms of citizens and restrictions, the possibility of the seizure of property, vehicles and fund for the state and army.\u201d\n\nHis overall claim that radical changes are possible is correct.\n\nAs noted in the Kyiv Post, the Ukrainian parliament or the Verkhovna Rada passed a bill \u201cOn the Legal Regime of Martial Law\u201d in 2015.\n\nUnder that law, potential measures cover everything from a wholesale ban on elections, to referendums and constitutional changes; a prohibition against peaceful protest, gatherings and other mass events; a halt to political activity deemed \u201cdetrimental to state security;\u201d curfews; forced evacuations; a ban on selling alcohol; a requirement for civilians to provide quarters to military personnel or displaced individuals; forced internment or relocation of foreign citizens who pose a threat; and additional measures to safeguard state secrecy.\n\nThe decree also allows for mobilizing reserve forces, organizing the air defense around vital state facilities and ramping up cyber security defenses.\n\nWhile Poroshenko reportedly said, \u201cRussia is preparing a ground attack against Ukraine,\u201d necessitating martial law, he is not characterizing it as a \u201cdeclaration of war or mobilization.\u201d\n\n\u200bAlso on Monday, Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, Oleksandr Turchynov, said that martial law \u201cmay be lifted at any time if the situation normalizes.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kyiv-based RFE/RL correspondent Christopher Miller, \"martial law will not cover Ukraine entirely, but regions subject to 'Russian aggression,' including Vinnytsia, Luhansk, Mykolayiv, Odesa, Sumy, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Kherson, Sea of Azov.\"\n\nSome within the Radical Party and The All-Ukrainian Union \"Fatherland\" or Batkivshchyna party had reportedly sought to block the introduction of martial law, with observers in Ukraine noting they could be the biggest losers if Presidential and parliamentary polls, scheduled in four months, are pushed back.\n\nWriting for Hromadske news site in August, special correspondent for international coverage, Maksym Kamenev said that Poroshenko\u2019s support rate \u201cfluctuates between 5% and 8%, while Batkivshchyna party head and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko \u201cleads the polls with 10-13% of the votes.\u201d\n\nThe Russian state outlet, RT, has suggested that invoking martial law should be beneficial for Poroshenko, since \u201cthe president\u2019s rating is falling as he struggles to campaign for re-election in March.\u201d\n\nBut the final vote on martial law saw 276 for and 30 votes against (with 23 not voting and 1 abstaining).\n\nPoroshenko said martial law will not \u201coverlap with the beginning of the election campaign by a single day.\u201d\n\n\u201cMartial law will last 30 days and will end in mid-December. It is in December, in early December, that I will submit a draft resolution to the Parliament on the date of the presidential elections to be held in accordance with the Constitution on March 31, 2019. Period. As Supreme Commander-in-Chief, I will make every effort to stay within this short term and squeeze out the maximum opportunities from this month to increase our readiness to repel a possible full-scale offensive of the aggressor country \u2013 Russia,\u201d he said.\n\nFor now, while Polygraph.info finds that Russian council member\u2019s proclamations on the potential of martial law in Ukraine are consistent with the context of the country\u2019s basic law, the extent to which it will be used and its implications appear to be limited and so the final effects are unclear.", "lang": "en"}
