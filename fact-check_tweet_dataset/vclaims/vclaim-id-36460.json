The latter was an unauthorized account that has since been suspended.\n\u2022 If Snapchat were obligated to hand over material posted via their service to authorities for use as evidence in legal cases, their users would not be able to exclude themselves from that process on a blanket basis. And even if users could opt out, that procedure would be handled more formally than simply instructing everyone to post a given message or tag \u201con your snap story.\u201d\n\nSnapchat\u2019s own Law Enforcement Guide notes that if any user\u2019s content or other information is being sought via a legal process, and that user seeks to prevent such disclosure, that user must \u201cchallenge the legal process in court\u201d within seven days and provide a copy of the challenge to Snapchat:\n\nOur policy is to notify affected Snapchat users when we receive legal process seeking their records, information, and content. Before we respond to the legal process, we allow affected users seven days to challenge the legal process in court and to provide us a file-stamped copy of the challenge. However, we do not provide such user notice when: (1) providing notice is prohibited by a court order issued under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2705(b) or by other legal authority; or (2) we believe an exceptional circumstance exists, such as cases involving child exploitation or the threat of imminent death or bodily injury.", "lang": "en"}
