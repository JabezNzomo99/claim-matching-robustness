Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of that claim.\n\n\n\nFact: The image is from Iran and it shows a young man tortured in prison after being detained from a protest. It has nothing to do with Kashmir. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image in the post is subjected to reverse image search, many search results were obtained. A tweet among those search results had the same image, and it had the following message with it- \u2018A young man in #Iran was tortured and flogged in prison after his arrest during #IranProtests. His mother posted this picture\u2018. \n\n\n\nMany other search results obtained also corroborated that the image is that of an Iranian man tortured in prison after being arrested in protests in 2018 and these search results can be seen here, here, here and here. \n\n\n\nTo conclude, the image from Iran is falsely shared as that of a Kashmir man brutally beaten by Police. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
