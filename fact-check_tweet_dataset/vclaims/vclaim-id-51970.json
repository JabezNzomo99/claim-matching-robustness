The outbreak has become a global pandemic.\n\nAs of April 9, 2020, Spain has recorded more than 140,000 cases of COVID-19 and nearly 14,000 deaths, according to World Health Organization (WHO) data here.\n\nAzan, or adhan, is the Islamic call to prayers.\n\nThe same video, along with a similar claim, has been viewed more than 23,000 times after it was posted here, here, here and here on Facebook; here and here on YouTube; and here on Twitter.\n\nThe clip has also been shared in English with a similar claim here and here; and in Malaysian here and here.\n\nThe claim is false; the video was taken in Azerbaijan before the virus was first detected; there has been no ban on adhan in Spain in recent times.\n\nA Google reverse image search using a keyframe of the video generated with InVID-WeVerify, a video verification tool, and subsequent keyword searches found the same video first published here on Instagram on November 20, 2019.

Balakan!\u201d the Azerbaijani-language caption reads according to a translation from an AFP journalist in Turkey.\n\nBalakan, or Belokany, is a city in the northwestern part of Azerbaijan.\n\nThe owner of the Instagram account wrote in the post\u2019s comment on April 3, 2020, that he shot the video in November 2019 in the city of Balakan and that it \u201chas nothing to do with Spain\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is not Spain,\u201d he said, adding that the person seen standing inside the minaret in the beginning of the video is himself.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of his comment:\n\nAfter his footage went viral, Musaev posted this clip on Instagram from a Turkish television channel that had used his video out of context. He clarified that the footage was taken in Azerbaijan, not Spain.\n\nThe Azerbaijani-language caption of the video reads in part as: \u201cAzerbaijan or Spain? Actually, we shot this (video) with my friend @hikmet_askerov for the love of God. I wanted to shoot the minaret of Balakan for a long time... When brotherly Turkey's ATV aired it saying it was not in Azerbaijan but in Spain, I was surprised but not sad.\u201d\n\nThe location of the mosque in the video can be seen here on Google Maps.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of a photo taken near the mosque found on Google Maps:\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison between the video in the misleading posts (L) and the mosque on Google Maps (R).
