The claim is false; the video actually shows a waterfall in Switzerland.\n\nThe 26-second video was published here on Facebook on June 22, 2020. It has been shared more than 23,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Malay-language caption translates to English as: \u201cThe beauty of baling mountain\u201d.\n\nMount Baling is located in Kedah, a state in the northwest of peninsular Malaysia.\n\nThe video was viewed more than 560,000 times after it was shared in Facebook posts here and here with a similar claim. It was also posted here and here, with a claim that it shows Mount Keriang or Mount Setong, both in Malaysia.\n\nThe waterfall is not located in Malaysia. A reverse image search and a keyword search on Google found the video was posted on Instagram here by Sylvia Michel, a photographer based in Switzerland, on April 29, 2020.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cTHE RIGHT DIRECTION . / ? @michelphotography_ch . / Who is saying aww ? with you? / .\n\n @ilovebrienz / . MUSIC: Syml - Take me apart\u201d.\n\nThe post is tagged to Berner Oberland, or Bernese Oberland, a region in central Switzerland.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading Facebook post (L) and the Instagram video (R). The same cloud formations can be seen in the background, as well as a herd of cows next to a road in the foreground:\n\nThe waterfall in the video is Oltschibachfall, near the town of Meiringen, in the Bernese Oberland region.\n\nThis Google Maps image of Oltschibachfall corresponds with the scenery seen in the video.", "lang": "en"}
