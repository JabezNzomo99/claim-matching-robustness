PANOORIN (Vice President Bongbong Marcos wins vs Leni Robredo! Watch)\" does not reflect its content, a 16-minute video of \"Maharlika,\" a California-based Duterte supporter, who discussed Robredo's 2016 win but did not mention Marcos winning in the recount.\n\nThe story was published a day after Robredo asked the Supreme Court, sitting as Presidential Electoral Tribunal, to reverse an earlier ruling applying a 25 percent threshold for votes to be considered valid in the recount.\n\nMarcos filed an electoral protest in June 2016, following a narrow loss to Robredo in the VP race.\n\nThe story's biggest traffic generators on social media are Pinoy Republic, Pres. Rody Duterte News Global and Pilipinas Trending. Along with Maharlika's video uploaded to Youtube channel PagBabago Ng Pinas, the story could have reached more than 327,000 people.", "lang": "en"}
