No, that's not true: there have been demonstrations and riots according to international media but the story about the president stepping down was made up by a website that simply copied and modified an old article about a different president in another country stepping down in 2012. Al-Bashir has not stepped down according to any credible news sources.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by African Daily Voice on December 29, 2018 titled \"Breaking: Sudanese President Steps Down Amid Unrest | The African Daily\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nKhartoum-Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir has resigned after weeks of demonstrations and a mutiny by some police officers. Vice-President Bakri Hassan Saleh has been sworn in vowing to uphold the \"rule of law\". Hassan has been sworn in in presence of heavy security. Mr Bashir is being held against his will by security forces at the presidential palace in the capital, his brother told the African-post\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title and thumbnail:\n\nThe funny thing is the BBC published almost the exact same story with the exact same words in 2012 but about the president of the Maledives resigning:\n\nMaldives President Mohamed Nasheed has resigned after weeks of demonstrations and a mutiny by some police officers. Vice-President Waheed Hassan was sworn in vowing to uphold the \"rule of law\". Mr Nasheed is being held against his will by security forces at the presidential palace in the capital, his brother told the BBC.\n\nEven the spokesperson is the same in the BBC story:\n\nNo trustworthy sources have confirmed the news about al-Bashir stepping down so it is safe to view this article as just clickbait created to make some scammers a bit of cash via the ads on the page. The African Daily website was only registered about a month ago by someone in Kenya according to WHOIS data:", "lang": "en"}
