The \u201cObamacare\u201d law had not been fully implemented yet, but we reviewed nearly 10 reports from states across the country on the potential impact of the law and concluded the law\u2019s provisions \u201cwill almost certainly increase premiums, though tax subsidies will help mitigate the impact for a little over half of the people in the exchanges.\u201d\n\nAs we noted then, you can\u2019t get something for nothing. The law mandated an \u201cessential health benefits\u201d package, more extensive than what most individuals and small businesses already purchase. The law also implemented an age band so that the amount an older individual pays will be no more than three times what a younger individual pays \u2014 and also mandated that insurers selling policies through the health exchanges will no longer be able to charge different premiums based on a person\u2019s health status when coverage is first purchased.\n\nThe ACA mandated some broad changes to the health-care market, including cost savings in Medicare. But, according to the Congressional Budget Office, most Americans (155 million) get their insurance through their employer and thus far would have noticed little if any change, except that their benefit package may have gotten better. Premiums in those plans have increased year after year, as they always have, but at a slower rate than in the 10-year period before 2010. (It\u2019s debatable whether the health-care law is responsible for the slowdown in health-care costs, but the White House makes that case.)\n\nThe Obamacare market is under pressure because the mix of people signing up for health care under plans offered on the exchanges has been unhealthier than expected. The feared individual mandate has not had the expected result of convincing people to buy insurance, with younger and healthier Americans apparently more willing to pay a $695-per-person fine than sign up for health care they think is too costly. So the mix of people in the insurance pools have tended to be people who have chronic illnesses and thus require more care and frequent doctor or hospital visits. The risk pools are also why insurance companies have sought higher premiums and the biggest deductibles.\n\nA stable insurance market requires the premiums of low-risk people to help defray the cost of high-risk individuals. No one makes money selling insurance only to sick people; imagine if an auto insurance company only sold insurance to drunk drivers. So in a blow to the exchanges, some major insurance companies have pulled out of the market because they say they are losing too much money. That has reduced competition, in some cases just leaving one insurance company in the market.\n\nEmployers generally subsidize a large part of the monthly premium for their workers. Obamacare was designed to replicate that system for poorer workers, with the government footing the bill, to encourage more people to seek health insurance. (Medicaid, the health program for the poor, was also expanded but 19 states refused to adopt it.) You need to buy a policy through the exchanges in order to qualify for a subsidy \u2014 and most of the people on the exchanges get some sort of subsidy.\n\nIn theory, people who qualify for tax credits are not affected by the premium increases. Remember the planned increase in Phoenix from $207 a month to $507? An analysis by the Henry J. Kaiser Foundation found that a 40-year-old adult making $30,000 per year in Phoenix would have paid $207 in 2016 for a \u201csilver plan\u201d policy \u2014 and would pay the exact same amount, after tax credits, in 2017. In other words, the draconian 145 percent increase would be borne by the government, not the person buying the policy.\n\nA 2016 Commonwealth Fund study found that for people with low and moderate incomes, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s tax credits have made premium costs roughly comparable to those paid by people with employment-based health insurance. About half of the adults in the marketplace said their premiums were affordable \u2014 and four out of five people who joined the marketplace or Medicaid after the law was implemented said they were satisfied with their health insurance. (About half of the adults said that before they signed up, they had been without health insurance for more than two years.)\n\nSo who is affected by the premium increase?\n\nA Health and Human Services report released in October said that about 2.5 million people who do not buy insurance on the exchanges \u2014 either because they think they do not qualify for tax credits or for philosophical reasons \u2014 have income that could qualify them for tax credits. About half of this population even have incomes below 250 percent FPL, meaning they might also qualify for help with their deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nAll told, that means nearly 12 million people in the individual market potentially qualify for tax credits. But it also means that, no matter what, 6 million people have to pay full rates for insurance and are being hit by the premium increases. [Update: Here\u2019s a good first-person account.] (Some of these people actually have incomes low enough to qualify for Medicaid, although they may live in a state that refuse to accept the Obamacare expansion of the health-care program for the poor.)", "lang": "en"}
