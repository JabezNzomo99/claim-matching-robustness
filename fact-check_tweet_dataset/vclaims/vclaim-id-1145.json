The logic behind this assertion is false.\n\nThe posts make the claim that \u201cOvid\u201d means sheep in Latin, the \u201cC\u201d means \u201cto see\u201d in an unspecified \u201cancient language\u201d and that 19 was the so-called \u201cnumber of surrender\u201d in \u201cancient times\u201d. Some examples of the claim are visible here , here and here .\n\nThe word for \u201csheep\u201d in Latin in is \u201covis\u201d, not \u201covid\u201d ( here ). In the English-speaking world, Ovid often refers to Publius Ovidius Naso, a Roman poet who lived in the 1st century BCE ( here ).\n\nIt is possible that the name Ovidius is derived from the Latin word ovis ( en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Ovidius ).\n\nThe stand-alone letter \u201cC\u201d does not refer to the verb \u201cto see\u201d in an \u201cancient language\u201d, which one original poster clarifies as \u201cLatin and Roman (sic)\u201d in a comment ( here ).\n\n\u201cCf\u201d is an abbreviation for the Latin word confer, often used in endnotes or footnotes to point the reader to works that offer an argument which contradicts or is otherwise different from the author\u2019s argument, according to the Writing Center at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill ( here ). It is unclear what exactly is meant by the post.\n\nAccording to the Encyclopedia Britannica\u2019s entry on number symbology, the number 19 was considered unlucky for ancient Babylonians, while in Islamic numerology, the number could be considered \u201can important name for God\u201d ( here ).\n\nNo search results that point to the number\u2019s significance cite historical evidence to demonstrate that it was indeed considered the \u201cnumber of surrender\u201d by any ancient civilization ( here ).\n\n19 is used as a mystical number by Stephen King, making appearances in multiple books in his Dark Tower series ( stephenking.fandom.com/wiki/19 ).\n\nThe International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) gives viruses their names according to their genetic structure and for the benefit of scientific research. It named the virus responsible for COVID-19 as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) on February 11, 2020, due to its genetic relation to SARS.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explains on its website: \u201cThe new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, \u2018CO\u2019 stands for \u2018corona,\u2019 \u2018VI\u2019 for \u2018virus,\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019 for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as \u201c2019 novel coronavirus\u201d or \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d.\u201d ( here )\n\nFalse. COVID-19 does not mean \u201csee a sheep surrender\u201d, it stands for \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
