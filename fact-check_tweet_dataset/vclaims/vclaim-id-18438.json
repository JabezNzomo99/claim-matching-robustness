Let us scrutinise these pictures one-by-one.\n\nAlt News reverse-searched the above image on Google and came across an article byIndia Today which stated that this photograph is actually from a \u2018kirpan\u2019 factory in Patiala, Punjab. According to the article, the photo is from the \u2018Khalsa Kirpan\u2019 factory in the city. Alt News contacted \u2018Khalsa Kirpan\u2019 factory and confirmed that the picture is indeed from the factory at Patiala.\n\nThe above photo is indeed from Rajkot, but these swords were recovered not from a madrasa but from a hotel on the Ahmedabad-Rajkot highway. This picture had been shared earlier as well with the same narrative. Alt News\u2019 fact-check on this may be read here.\n\nAlt News reverse-searched the above photograph and found it on Tumblr. The photo was posted in March 2019. It was earlier shared with the claim that weapons were recovered from a madrasa in Sherkot, UP.\n\nThe above photograph is recent. It pertains to a raid on a madrasa in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh in which weapons were recovered. According to Bijnor police, the weapons seized were part of an illegal arms racket. Six people have been arrested in this case which is of July 2019.\n\nIn conclusion, it may be stated that the claim about a large stash of weapons recovered from a madrasa in Rajkot, Gujarat is false.
