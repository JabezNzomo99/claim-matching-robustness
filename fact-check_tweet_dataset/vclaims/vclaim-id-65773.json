Obama at all cost, this fool\u2019s obsession is scary,\u201d reads the caption.\n\nThere is no record of Trump ever tweeting the statement.\n\nThe Facebook post features a screen grabbed tweet, purportedly from Trump, that criticizes Obama for leaving the White House bunker in \u201cbad shape.\u201d Trump spent nearly an hour in the bunker on May 29, as hundreds of George Floyd protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, according to The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cThanks to the crowds of \u2018protestors\u2019 VP Pence and myself have been escorted to the White House bunker located in the basement,\u201d reads the purported tweet. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendously huge and powerful structure that can withstand anything! Sadly it was kept in very bad shape by OBAMA, who left it extremely dirty and with no food/supplies. Terrible planning!\u201d\n\nThe alleged tweet comes as protests and riots erupted in Washington, D.C., and other major U.S. cities following the death of Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after an officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes, according to video of the incident. Derek Chauvin, the officer videotaped kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck, has since been charged with second-degree murder, and the three other officers involved have been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder, CNN reported.\n\nHowever, there is no record of Trump tweeting the comment. Searching the president\u2019s Twitter accounts \u2013@realDonaldTrump and @POTUS \u2013 and ProPublica\u2019s archive of his deleted tweets turned up no matches. The Internet Archive also doesn\u2019t show any such tweet in screen captures of his Twitter timeline from that weekend.\n\nTrump disputed reports that Secret Service agents rushed him to the bunker for safety in a June 3 interview with \u201cFox and Friends\u201d co-host Brian Kilmeade on his Fox News radio show.
