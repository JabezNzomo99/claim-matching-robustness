Ted Cruz wants Congress to refuse to fund Obamacare. The law\u2019s such a mess, says the Texas Republican, that the president let lawmakers themselves off the hook.\n\n\"Look, the wheels are coming off this,\" he told at the conservative Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa, on Aug. 10, 2013. \"The Teamsters are abandoning it. President Obama just granted all of Congress an exception. And he did it because Harry Reid and the Senate Democrats who passed this thing came begging and said, \u2018Please, please, please let us out of Obamacare.\u2019 This thing ain't working.\"\n\nThe audience let out a long \"Boooo\" at the mention of President Barack Obama\u2019s action on behalf of Congress.\n\nBut did he just grant lawmakers an exception to Obamacare?\n\n\u2018Congress should get the same coverage\u2019\n\nFor many years, Congress chose from a variety of insurance plans offered by the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, which serves more than 8 million federal and retired workers and their dependents.\n\nThat stops in January, when lawmakers and some staff will be required instead to pick from plans on the health care law\u2019s new exchanges \u2014 now known as marketplaces.\n\nThat\u2019s because Congress faces a specific Obamacare provision forcing lawmakers from their current plans into new marketplaces \u2014 something that doesn\u2019t apply to other Americans.\n\nBack in 2009, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley that \"members of Congress should get the same coverage that we are coming up with for everyone else.\" He offered that required lawmakers to get their health care through the created by the bill. It was accepted by the Senate Finance Committee .\n\nMembers of Congress and their staff would have to use the hefty employer contribution they used for federal plans to buy marketplace plans, instead, his amendment said.\n\n\"My interest in having members of Congress participate in the exchange is consistent with my long-held view that Congress should live under the same laws it passes for the rest of the country,\" . \"The more that Congress experiences the laws it passes, the better.\"\n\nA version of the amendment made it into the law passed by Democrats, but it lacked the clarity of Grassley\u2019s language, raising a question: Would the government\u2019s contribution to lawmakers\u2019 health insurance premiums follow them?\n\nMass confusion ensued \u2014 that the law\u2019s ambiguity meant lawmakers and their staffers would lose an employer contribution worth thousands toward their health care plans. They for clarification.\n\nOn Aug. 7, 2013, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management did clear things up, that lawmakers\u2019 purchase of health coverage from the exchanges \u2014 now called marketplaces \u2014 would indeed be eligible for an employer contribution. (It answered some of those other questions, too.)\n\nWhen Obamacare\u2019s health care marketplaces launch in January 2014, members of Congress will use them right alongside the uninsured.\n\nDid the administration's decision constitute an \"exception\" to Obamacare?\n\nHere's what the law said:\n\n\"Notwithstanding any other provision of law \u2026 the only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and congressional staff with respect to their service as a Member of Congress or congressional staff shall be health plans that are \u2014 (I) created under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act); or (II) offered through an Exchange established under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act).\"\n\nAll it did was require lawmakers to use new marketplaces. They're doing that.\n\nBeyond that, the wording of the law left lots of questions. Or, as the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service described it, several \" .\" To implement it, administrators had to make choices about what it meant.\n\nAs a report noted last year, \"In writing the legislation, members of Congress apparently assumed that the federal contribution to their premiums would continue, but the law is silent on the question.\"\n\nGrassley himself that the provision made \"no changes to the employer contribution to federal employee health care coverage.\"\n\nA Congressional Research Service analysis found some room in the law for . Timothy Jost, an expert in health care law who supports the Affordable Care Act, told PolitiFact the government clearly acted . A report from the conservative Heritage Foundation, which Cruz\u2019s office pointed to, argues .\n\nHeritage, whose lobbying arm Heritage Action has launched a \"Defund Obamacare Town Hall Tour,\" says that the administration disregarded the law to give a \" .\"\n\nThe special deal: letting lawmakers keep the employer contribution toward health plans on new Obamacare marketplaces that Grassley assumed they would keep.\n\nCruz, reeling off signs Obamacare\u2019s \"wheels are coming off,\" said the president \"just granted all of Congress an exception.\"\n\nThat sounds like lawmakers get to opt out of health care under the law. Quite the opposite \u2014 they'll use new marketplaces alongside the uninsured and small businesses, just as it required. And it's not even accurate to say they were excepted from some provision of the law: the law itself wasn't clear.\n\nInstead, they got a clarification about the law\u2019s effect on contributions toward their health insurance \u2014 which they will purchase on Obamacare\u2019s marketplaces.
