Here\u2019s why two of the tweets -\n\nThe lemon idea is a myth, the\n\n, who is a registered dietitian, said the human body is well-equipped with organs that maintain its pH levels. (pH refers to the scale on which acid\n\n\u201cOur bodies are highly skilled at maintaining a constant pH hence rendering the concept of needing to eat certain foods to alkalise our bodies both unnecessary and scientifically unfounded,\u201d Bruk told us in an email.\n\nFaith Kariuki Biongo, who writes a weekly column in Kenya\u2019s print media, told Africa Check that it \u201cis vital for health and survival that the pH of the blood remains constant. Fluctuation in the pH of blood can make body cells stop working properly which can lead to death. Diet doesn\u2019t affect the blood\u2019s pH.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no diet, food or drink that can automatically cleanse or detoxify the body or any body organ,\u201d she added. \u201cThe body and its organs have natural systems of removing waste: the liver, skin, urinary system and gastrointestinal tract are continuously helping cleanse the body through sweat, urine and faeces.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe liver removes waste and toxins from the blood. Any waste the liver cannot use is converted and carried out by bile into the small intestines or by blood to the kidneys where the kidney eliminates them through urine,\u201d Biongo said.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s a bad idea to drink water with a slice of lemon. Taking in enough water daily is essential\n\nBruk told us that adding lemon may make the water \u201cmore palatable and thus may make it easier to drink enough water\u201d.\n\nThis \u201chealthy living\u201d advice has been circulating on the internet for at least 7 years and has been debunked by various organisations, including the\n\u2022 None The claim that water after waking up \u201chelps activate internal organs\u201d : our \u201cinternal organs\u201d are constantly active in order to keep the body alive,\n\u2022 None \u201cOne glass before a meal\u201d would have minimal effect, as the body is already efficient in producing fluids for digestion. At most, water can make swallowing food easier, a director at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Dr Braden Kuo,\n\u2022 None Drinking \u201ca glass before a shower\u201d is not cited by the\n\u2022 None The claim that water before bed \u201chelps prevent strokes and heart attacks\u201d . Staying hydrated is generally good for the heart and the entire body, but a glass before sleep might at most force you to get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. \n\n\n\nA senior lecturer in the division of human nutrition at the University of Cape Town, Marjanne Senekal, told Africa Check \u201cthere is no scientific evidence to support these claims\u201d shared by the City of Joburg.\n\nShe reminded us that it is important to keep your body hydrated by drinking between 7 and 11 glasses of water throughout the day.\n\nDistributing misleading medical advice can be dangerous. A dietitian at the\n\nat the University of Stellenbosch, Irene Labuschagne, warned against spreading such false hope.\n\n\u201cA patient suffering from hypertension may be at risk if it is believed that one simple intervention such as a glass of water before a shower may improve the dangerous health concern,\u201d Labuschagne told Africa Check, adding that drinking lots of water \u201cwill not cure all sorts of diseases\u201d.\n\nand alkaline levels are measured. When acidity increases, pH levels fall. An increase in alkaline causes pH levels to rise.) and", "lang": "en"}
