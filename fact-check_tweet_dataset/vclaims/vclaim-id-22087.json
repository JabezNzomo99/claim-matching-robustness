FIFA\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, appeared in a promotional video, saying he is expecting a \u201cgreat atmosphere\u201d for games in Russia \u2013 where, he said, \u201ceverything is done for the fans.\u201d\n\nIn December, President Vladimir Putin welcomed world soccer stars to the Kremlin for the 2018 World Cup final draw ceremony. \u201cOur country intends to hold it at the highest level,\u201d Putin said.\n\nThere are, however, issues overshadowing the idyllic picture drawn by Infantino and Putin. Even as Russian preparations for the 2018 World Cup in Russia continue, the \"great atmosphere\u201d is tarnished by ongoing and new scandal.\n\nWith new allegations reported publicly this week, the United States Justice Department last month issued new grand jury subpoenas in an investigation of FIFA, the International Olympic Committee and the U.S. Olympic Commitee. The newest probe touches Russia's involvement in the Olympics. Among the specific sports marketing companies that prosecutors are scrutinizing is Helios Partners, a firm that has lobbied global sports officials to award high-profile events to particular cities and countries. Helios helped Russia secure the 2014 Winter Olympics and the coming 2018 World Cup, before its acquisition in 2012 by the Amaury Group, a French media company.\n\nAccording to the Russian opposition party Yabloko, Russia has spent 212.5 billion rubles ($ 3.5 billion) on the construction or reconstruction of the eleven main arenas for the World Cup -- \u201calmost 100 billion rubles [$1.6 billion] greater\u201d than what other governments would have spent to do the same thing.\n\nThe Russian government has not released a list of the general contractors for these jobs, but it certainly consists \u201calmost entirely of the friends and comrades in arms of Putin,\u201d said Yabloko leader Sergey Mitrokhin. The difference between what the construction should have cost and what it did cost, he added, \u201calmost certainly has ended up corruptly in their pockets.\u201d\n\nAccusations of Russia\u2019s involvement in large-scale corruption surrounding soccer have been piling up since the U.S. indicted 14 top FIFA officials \u201cwho had corrupted the sport through two decades of shadowy dealing and $150 million in bribes.\u201d\n\nFollowing the U.S. indictments, the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland opened a criminal investigation into how Russia was selected to host the 2018 World Cup. The investigation also includes the selection of Qatar for the 2022 competition.\n\nThe 2018 World Cup in Russia, as well as the next three competitions, is itself the target of yet another ongoing criminal probe \u2013 into an alleged a corruption scheme involving the allocation of media rights.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee investigated mass doping schemes in Russian sports. As a result of that probe, Russia\u2019s team was banned from participating in next month\u2019s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchan, South Korea; 43 Russian athletes were disqualified from participating in Olympic events, while 13 were stripped of their Sochi Olympics\u2019 medals [Russia, 2014]; and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, the country\u2019s former sports minister, was banned from the Olympics for life.\n\nMutko headed the 2018 World Cup organizing committee until stepping down last month due to the international pressure against FIFA.\n\nHowever, Mutko\u2019s \u201cretirement\u201d from soccer seems a mere formality: on January 24, a month after his \u201cresignation\u201d from the 2018 World Cup organizing committee, he announced that the World Cup infrastructure \u201cmust be ready\u201d by April 1.\n\nThursday, the Louisiana based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) -- Sport's highest tribunal, overturned the IOC ruling and reinstated the Sochi Olympics results for 28 Russian athletes, saying it had found insufficient evidence they were guilty of anti-doping violations in Sochi. Eleven others were confirmed by CAS to have committed doping violations.\n\nHowever, CAS said its mandate was \"not to determine generally whether there was an organized scheme allowing the manipulation of doping control samples \u2026 but was strictly limited to dealing with 39 individual cases and to assess the evidence applicable to each athlete on an individual basis.\"\n\nIn preparation for the World Cup, the Russian government has dedicated millions to \u201celiminating the public health threat\u201d of stray animals.\n\nAccording to the Facebook group @BloodyFIFA2018, stray dogs are being brutally killed in all 11 of the Russian cities set to host World Cup games.\n\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reports that 6,000-8,000 rubles (roughly $107-$142) are being paid for each dog corpse is and dog extermination service companies are winning lucrative government contracts.\n\nThe situation is not without precedent: Thousands of stray animals were killed as part of the preparations for the 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi.\n\nIn 2015, Marzuki Darusman, the United Nations human rights investigator for North Korea, launched a probe into the \u201cslave-like\u201d conditions for thousands of North Koreans working abroad, \u201cmainly in China, Russia and the Middle East.\u201d\n\nThe investigation found that North Korean workers were building stadiums in Russia for the 2018 World Cup. The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson called these allegations \u201cfake,\u201d and a Western plot aimed at \u201cscaring off\u201d foreign football fans.\n\nThe European soccer authority, UEFA, suspended Russia\u2019s soccer team from Euro 2016 championships after Russian hooligans fought rival fans in the streets of host cities in France.\n\nVladimir Putin used the slang verb \u201cotmetelit,\u201d \u2013 roughly translated as \u201cbeat the hell out of\u201d -- in commenting on the violence in France. \"I don't know how 200 Russian fans could beat the hell out of a few thousands Brits,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite Russia\u2019s pledge to ensure the country\u2019s millions of soccer fans will behave, many believe football hooliganism remains a major safety concern for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.", "lang": "en"}
