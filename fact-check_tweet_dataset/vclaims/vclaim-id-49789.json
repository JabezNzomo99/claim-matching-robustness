The tweet below has over 14,000 likes.\n\nThe story, as it turns out, is fictional. It was shared by Facebook user from Bangladesh Syed Mohammad Fahim on June 30. At the end of his post, Fahim has stated, \u201cI write this fictional story in solidarity to all teachers who are victims of Zoom bombing by shameless students. \u201d\n\nThe story was picked up two weeks later by media outlets after it was shared by the Instagram page tedthestoner on July 16. The page took out the word \u2018fictional\u2019 from the story and added a picture of the \u2018teacher\u2019. This picture was also used in news reports.\n\nWhere is the image from?\n\nA reverse-image search revealed that the photograph of the teacher is a screengrab of a video of an online class held in Bangladesh. A subsequent keyword search on Facebook led us to a post by Bangladesh user Hafiz R Rahman who had shared the video on June 29. In the video, students can be heard conversing in Bengali with a Bangladeshi dialect. They are disrupting the class by mocking the teacher.\n\nRahman wrote that the teacher\u2019s name is Mohiuddin and the incident occurred while he was taking a class for students of Milestone College, Dhaka. Rahman referred to himself as an ex-student of the college and claimed that he knows the teacher.\n\nIn another video, he said that he has informed the college authorities of the incident in hopes that the unruly students would face consequences. He claimed to have shared the details of one of the boys with the college administration. Several people have asked Rahman to take down the teacher\u2019s video however, he says that he will take it down only after the college takes action against the student whose detailed he shared.\n\nA fictional story about a 55-year-old teacher bullied and abused while taking an online class via Zoom was inspired by an actual case that took place in Bangladesh. The person who shared the story clarified that it was fictional. But media outlets did not attempt to locate the original source Syed Mohammad Fahim and cited Instagram page tedthestoner, an account that posts memes and jokes, as the source. It is noteworthy that tedthestoner had named Fahim in its post, yet none of the outlets cross-verified the story. One of the media organisations India Today also has a dedicated fact-checking desk and is recognised by the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN).", "lang": "en"}
