So in a sense, your homelessness is a gift from heaven.\u201d\n\nThere is no record of Carson making such a statement.\n\nDuring his 2016 presidential campaign, and now his tenure as a cabinet secretary, critics of Carson have pointed to controversial comments he has made; he once compared Obamacare to slavery, for example. But this image, which claims that Carson called homelessness a \u201cgift from heaven,\u201d is false. (RELATED: Did Ben Carson Say, \u2018Before Obama, People Barely Noticed Skin Color\u2019?)\n\nThe Daily Caller found no evidence of Carson making such a statement on the campaign trail, while at the Department of Housing and Urban Development or at any other time. The media has not reported on any such statement.\n\nThe photo of Carson shown in the meme comes from a May 2015 town hall he had in Baltimore, Maryland, yet no reporting about that visit contains the quote in question.\n\nCarson has been previously criticized for calling poverty a \u201cstate of mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think poverty to a large extent is also a state of mind,\u201d he said in 2017. \u201cYou take somebody who has the right mindset, you can take everything from them and put them on the street and I guarantee you in a little while they\u2019ll be right back up there. And you take somebody with the wrong mindset, you can give them everything in the world, they\u2019ll work their way right back down to the bottom.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
