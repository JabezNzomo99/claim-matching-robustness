There is no evidence that either motorcycle club went to Seattle to fight antifa activists.\n\nProtesters cordoned off several blocks in Seattle\u2019s Capitol Hill neighborhood after the city\u2019s police department abandoned their precinct in the area on June 9, referring to the area as the \u201cCapitol Hill Autonomous Zone\u201d (CHAZ), USA Today reported. Some media outlets have reported that antifa, short for anti-fascist, activists are involved in the occupation of CHAZ. But a spokesperson for Seattle\u2019s mayor told CNN on June 10 that city officials hadn\u2019t interacted with any \u201carmed Antifa militants\u201d on the site.\n\nThe video, which features a screen grabbed June 12 tweet, purportedly shows footage and a picture of two rival motorcycle clubs, the Hells Angels and Mongols, riding to Seattle to confront antifa members together. The screen grabbed tweet features a picture of what appear to be Hells Angels members, while the included footage largely shows motorcyclists driving on roads and in parking lots, except for a clip where several police cars can be seen gathered near them.\n\nHowever, neither the photo nor the footage show members of the two motorcycle clubs traveling to confront antifa activists in Seattle together.

A reverse image search revealed the photo featured in the tweet was taken in August 2018 and shows Hells Angels members arriving in Saint-Charles-sur-Richelieu, Canada, for a national club gathering, according to the photo\u2019s caption in an CTV News article.\n\nThe Daily Caller found no credible reports of Hells Angels and Mongols club members riding to Seattle together to confront antifa activists, just other fact-checkers debunking the claim. Longtime Hells Angels member Sonny Barger denied such rumors in a June 13 Facebook post.\n\n\u201cPeople have asked me about these fake articles involving the Hells Angels and another club going to face antifa,\u201d Barger stated. \u201cStop, It\u2019s untrue and will never happen.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
