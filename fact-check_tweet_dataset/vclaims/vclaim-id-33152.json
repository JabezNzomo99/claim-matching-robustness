We were asked by readers to factcheck this post.\n\nThese claims overstate the cost of PFIs.\n\nPFIs are schemes that allow the public sector to enter into a contract with a private company to build infrastructure, such as schools, hospitals and roads. The private company pays the upfront costs and owns the asset.\n\nThe private company then leases the asset to the public sector organisation, for example the NHS, who make annual repayments that typically last 25 to 30 years. The repayments cover the costs of the services being delivered, plus the costs of interest and repayment of the debt. At the end of the term, the assets are owned by the public sector.\n\nPFIs were first introduced under the Conservative government in 1992. The initiative was then expanded under the Labour government when they came to power in 1997. At the 2018 Budget, it was announced that PFIs would no longer be used for new projects.\n\nPFIs are a controversial topic and we have written about them before.\n\nWhat do PFIs have to do with renting hospital buildings?\n\nThe Facebook image claims that Labour sold the hospitals to private investors and now the NHS pays rent.\n\nUsing the terms \u2018sold\u2019 and \u2018rent\u2019 to describe these payments isn\u2019t quite right.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said, PFIs are a type of procurement and, for a hospital, the private company may design, build and maintain the building. The public sector repayments are for this service and the interest and debt acquired by the private company during this time.\n\nThe post also claims that Labour sold the \u201cmajority\u201d of NHS hospital buildings. This isn\u2019t correct.\n\nNow, because of some strange gap in public data, we don\u2019t actually know exactly how many hospitals there are in the UK. In 2013, the Department for Health and Social Care responded to an FOI showing that there were 850 in England alone.\n\nBut that\u2019s enough to disprove the claim that the \u201cmajority\u201d of hospital buildings were \u201csold off\u201d. There are only 148 PFI current projects relating to hospital and acute health, which includes other healthcare buildings as well as hospitals.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t include projects which have concluded or been bought out already, but the number of these will be relatively few, given that almost all hospital and acute care contracts run over a 25 year time period or even longer (and so should still be current), and there have been very few buy outs.\n\nThe post claims that around \u00a34 billion is spent annually on hospital PFI contracts. This is an overestimate. The latest data from the Treasury shows that \u00a32.3 billion was spent paying hospitals and acute health PFIs across the UK in 2017/18 (the most recent year we have final figures for). The majority of these PFIs are for hospitals, but this figure also includes buildings for mental health services, primary care and other specialist units.\n\nSince 1999, health spending has been devolved so the UK government is only responsible for health spending in England. Looking just at the figures for England around \u00a32 billion was spent in 2017/18 paying hospitals and acute health PFIs.\n\nProjects that began in England under a Labour government (May 1997 to May 2010) contributed \u00a31.4 billion to this figure compared to \u00a30.6 billion under the Conservative and Coalition governments in power since 1992.\n\nThe Treasury estimates that around \u00a379 billion in total will be paid into hospital and acute health PFIs in total across the UK. Of this figure, an estimated \u00a357 billion will be paid for projects that began under a Labour government and the remaining \u00a321 billion on projects started under Conservative or Coalition governments.\n\nThis only factors in PFI contracts that are still operational. In addition there will be costs from a small number of PFI contracts that have already concluded or been bought out.\n\nOne proposed method to end future PFI payments is to buy out the contracts by paying the PFI owners a one-off termination fee. Compensation would differ by each contract, meaning it is hard to know how much it would cost.\n\nBut the figure given in the Facebook post of \u00a31 trillion is far too high.\n\nThink tank, the Centre for Health and the Public Interest say, of buy outs: \u201cThe compensation to the PFI operator needs to leave them in roughly the same financial position as if they had continued the contract until the end.\u201d\n\nAnalysing eight hospital PFI contracts, it found the costs of buying out the contracts was slightly higher than the cost of continuing to repay the debt.\n\nGiven that the current payments are due to be in the region of \u00a380 billion (not including the few contracts which have already been bought out or concluded), this means that it\u2019s implausible to suggest the value of buying out the contracts will be \u00a31 trillion\u2014over ten times higher.", "lang": "en"}
