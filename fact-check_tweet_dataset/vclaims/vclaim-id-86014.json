Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) says the president achieved a 2009 pledge in \"four years and three months.\u201d", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-01T14:45:12Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-86014", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2013/09/24/has-obama-cut-the-budget-deficit-in-half/", "vclaim": "Now, it\u2019s important to get some terminology straight. The deficit refers to an annual number \u2014 how much outlays exceed revenues in a given year. The national debt refers to the total amount a nation has borrowed, over time, to finance these deficits. So reducing the deficit still means the debt increases year after year, as does the cost of paying interest on that debt.\n\nMaking things even more confusing, the federal government runs on a fiscal year that ends on Sept. 30. (This is why we have the shutdown crisis this week.) So when Obama said he inherited a deficit, he is referring to the 2009 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2009. His pledge to cut the deficit in half by the end of his term in theory referred to Jan. 20, 2013, but the only fiscal year number we have is for the year that ended Sept. 30, 2012.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, the actual deficit in fiscal year 2009 was a little higher than Obama anticipated: $1.41 trillion. The deficit in fiscal year 2012 was $1.09 trillion. So Obama did not meet his pledge, even though his advisers had probably told him it was a safe bet at the time, as a more rapid recovery from the recession was expected. (Indeed, as Obama was taking office in 2009, CBO predicted the deficit would be $264 billion in fiscal year 2012, which shows why Obama\u2019s pledge was actually relatively modest.)\n\nFor the 2013 fiscal year, CBO in May projected that the deficit would shrink to $642 billion, which is obviously a huge drop. That means Obama would meet his pledge four years and eight months after he took office, or essentially a year later than he had promised.\n\nDrew Hammill, her spokesman, said that Pelosi was not focused on the raw deficit numbers, but rather she measured the deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product, which is the broadest measure of the economy. This is actually the best way to measure the size of a deficit, especially if you are looking across a period of many years.\n\nUsing Pelosi\u2019s method, the CBO said the deficit was 10.1 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2009, and it was 7 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2012. In February 2013, CBO projected that the fiscal year 2013 deficit would be 5.3 percent, which is still not quite one-half of 10.1 percent. Then in May 2013, it revised the projection for fiscal 2013 to 4 percent of GDP.\n\n\u201cSo four years and three months after the president\u2019s projection, we have a CBO projection at less than half,\u201d he said. He noted that in May, the fiscal year was nearing completion, and so there was no doubt the deficit was going to be less than half the level from when Obama took office.\n\nA projection of a deficit is not the same thing as achieving the deficit itself. Pelosi\u2019s broad point is correct \u2014 as of the end of this week, the deficit likely will have been cut in half since Obama took office. (We will update this column if Obama falls short in the official number.) It is also admirable that she was thinking in terms of a percentage of GDP.\n\nWe might also quibble with the notion that Obama \u201cdid it.\u201d As we noted last week, Republicans in Congress also played a role \u2014 and CBO\u2019s long-term projections indicate that both sides are cutting the wrong kind of spending.", "lang": "en"}
