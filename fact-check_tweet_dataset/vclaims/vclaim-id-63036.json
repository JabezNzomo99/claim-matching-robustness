Thunberg\u2019s team has confirmed she has never made such a statement.\n\nThunberg, who addressed world leaders at a United Nations climate summit in New York City in 2019, first gained global attention for skipping school to protest against inaction on climate change outside the Swedish parliament. She took all of 2019 off from school to continue her campaign, including attending key climate conferences and joining student protests around the world, BBC News reported.\n\nThe post alleges Thunberg asked the Chinese government to \u201cstop using their traditional chopsticks\u201d to save trees. It further claims that, in response, the Chinese government \u201cadvised Greta Thunberg to return to school, where she will learn that the sticks are made of bamboo, and that bamboo is a plant, not a tree.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence in an internet search that Thunberg ever called on the Chinese government to stop using chopsticks, only other fact-checkers debunking the claim. The DCNF also searched Thunberg\u2019s verified Twitter account but did not find comments to this effect. Her team confirmed to Reuters that she made no such statement.\n\nIt is unclear from where exactly the fake story originated, but Reuters traced an early iteration of the claim to a Jan. 14 tweet.

Cuz it is a symbol of environmental destruction,\u201d reads the tweet. \u201c#GretaThunberg you acclaim panda to stop biting bamboo. I think you should shut up. Cuz you waste oxygen and made smelly CO2 emission.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Bo Guangxin, the head of a major Chinese forestry group, estimated that China used 20 million trees to produce roughly 80 billion chopsticks each year, according to The Washington Post.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
