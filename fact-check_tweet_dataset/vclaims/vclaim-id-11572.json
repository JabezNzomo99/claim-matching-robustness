Sayoc registered as a Republican in Florida on March 4, 2016, and voted early in the 2016 primary, the 2016 general election and the 2018 primary, according to the Florida Department of State. A spokeswoman told us the department has no record of a change in his party affiliation.\n\nThe photo circulating online does show Sayoc, but it has been accompanied by false information like this: \u201cHere with Cesar Sayok is Izzy Hernandez, a Billionaire Democrat donor. Now why would a Trump supporter living out of his van, be at a democratic rally, hanging out with a billionaire democrat who gives millions of dollars to Democrats and their agenda?\u201d\n\nAnother popular version of the photo includes this text: \u201cPIPE BOMBER SUSPECT pictured last year with Izzy Hernandez. Sayok does not appear destitute. In addition, why would a Trump enthusiast attend a banquet and have a photo OP with a Democrat Donor/Supporter? Facebook keeps trying to take down this photo,,,pls share this ASAP!\u201d\n\nThere are a few problems with those statements. First and foremost, Israel \u201cIzzy\u201d Hernandez is not \u201ca Billionaire Democrat donor.\u201d He is a retired high school soccer coach in North Carolina who played on the Brevard College soccer team with Sayoc in the early 1980s \u2014 the two are pictured next to each other in the school\u2019s 1981 and 1982 yearbooks.\n\nHernandez is not registered with a political party, according to records from the North Carolina State Board of Elections, although he did vote in the Republican primary in 2016. And, according to records from the Federal Election Commission, he has not given contributions to any party or candidate, let alone \u201cmillions\u201d to Democrats.\n\nAlso, the photo wasn\u2019t taken at a \u201cdemocratic rally\u201d or \u201clast year.\u201d It was likely taken at Brevard College\u2019s distinguished alumni awards in 2015, when Sayoc\u2019s and Hernandez\u2019s former coach, Don Scarborough, was inducted into the school\u2019s athletic hall of fame. The event was held in Brevard\u2019s Porter Center for Performing Arts and photos posted by the school show Sayoc and Hernandez with Scarborough.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nUnited States v.
