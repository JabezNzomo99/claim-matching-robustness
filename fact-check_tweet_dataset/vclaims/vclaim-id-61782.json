It's the kind of claim that could, in our current energy climate, be dismissed as rewritten history. Campaigning against gas-guzzling cars in the '50s? Really?\n\nAnd yet, this is not a case of inflated exuberance. George Romney took the helm at American Motors in 1954 and helped rescue the company from near financial ruin.\n\nHe succeeded in large part on the sales of the Rambler, the first American compact car. In doing so, he had to sell the concept and value of a compact car. In 1958, he traveled 700,000 miles in his crusade against what he called \"gas-guzzling dinosaurs,\" a reference to the large cars produced by Detroit's Big Three automakers.\n\n\"Who wants to have a gas-guzzling dinosaur in his garage?\" he told Time magazine in 1959, for a cover article that labeled George Romney \"The Dinosaur Hunter.\"\n\nHe is credited with coining the term, even though other automakers cast doubts on just how economical the Rambler really was. Still, the nickname, and the George Romney legend, took hold. It appeared in prominent obituaries after his death July 26, 1995.\n\nHis youngest son, Mitt, gets it right.", "lang": "en"}
