We are paid equal for the same job, and it is illegal if this discrimination occurs,\u201d offered another.\n\nIs this statistic based on sound research? We set out to investigate.\n\nStatistic not global but \u2018very much South African\u2019\n\nThe statistic was a \u201cglobal average\u201d from the 2017 Pulse of the People report run by market research firm\n\nMari Harris, a director and political analyst at Ipsos, confirmed that the statistic was from their report. Pulse of the People contains a list of questions that the organisation runs every six months as part of a study called Ipsos Khayabus.\n\nThe 2017 analysis was conducted between 23 April and 22 May, but the report is not publicly available.\n\nHowever, the figure was not in fact a global estimate as Hyundai South Africa said, but rather \u201cvery much South African\u201d, Harris told Africa Check.\n\n\u2018Women earn about 73% of what men earn\u2019\n\nIpsos South Africa interviewed 3,598 employed people nationally across various occupations and in both urban and rural areas.\n\n\u201cWe conduct face-to-face in-home interviews in the homes and home languages of randomly chosen South Africans,\u201d Harris told Africa Check.\n\nPeople who did not share information about their incomes were excluded the analysis. Some 37.6% of respondents declined to answer questions about their income - possibly because they feared the tax authorities, Harris said.\n\nThe results were then weighted and projected to a total of 38.3 million South Africans aged 15 years and older.\n\nTheir analysis found that the average personal income for men was R9,222.16 per month, while that for women was R6,688.80 per month.\n\n\u201cWomen earn about 73% of what men earn (on average),\u201d Harris explained. From this, Ipsos concluded that women earn 27% less than men.\n\nHow does this compare to other studies of earning differences between men and women?\n\nThe executive manager for labour statistics at Statistics South Africa (Stats SA), Peter Buwembo, told Africa Check that the latest figures on earnings could be found in the bureau\u2019s\n\n. This survey uses data from Quarterly Labour Force Surveys, during which 30,000 households across the country are interviewed.\n\nthat men earned a median income of R3,500 per month while women earned R2,700 per month in 2015. The \u201cmedian income\u201d is the value where half of people\u2019s income falls above it and the other half falls below.\n\nBased on this data, women earned 23% less than men.\n\nWhile the disparity in earnings provided by Stats SA and Ipsos data (23% versus 27%) are relatively similar, the differences in earnings reported for men and women differ significantly.\n\nThis could be due to the difference between average and median incomes, Martin Wittenberg, a professor in the\n\n\u201cAverages tend to be considerably higher than medians because high earners earn so much more than everyone else, meaning just a few individuals raise the average wage appreciably,\u201d he said.\n\nalso showed both a median and average income disparity, Wittenberg said, calculating 25% for the former. The study,\n\nthe department of planning, monitoring and evaluation, tracks changes in the lives of individual South Africans over time.\n\nThere are a number of different factors which lead to men and women in South Africa earning at different levels, experts told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cPart of the difference in earnings between men and women arises because men and women have different productive characteristics,\u201d Colette Muller, a senior lecturer at the\n\n\u201c[Men and women] typically work in different occupations and different industries associated with different rates of pay and benefits.\u201d\n\nAs an example, Muller pointed to South Africa women dominating the informal sector, part-time employment and domestic work.\n\n\u201cThis type of work is typically associated with low pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cDiscrimination against women, where they are underpaid despite being equally qualified to men\u201d also contributes to income disparity, associate professor at the University of the\n\nBut Muller noted that teasing out \u201chow much of the gender pay gap in South Africa is as a result of discrimination as opposed to other factors is quite difficult to do\u201d.\n\nA South African car dealership recently claimed that women earn 27% less than men.\n\nThe figure was based on 2017 data from a South African market research firm. The study found that men earned an average income of R9,222.16 per month compared to the R6,88.80 earned by women.\n\nData from South Africa\u2019s statistics bureau also found a gender pay gap of 23% in 2015, but this was for median income.\n\nWhile the actual size of the gap differs based on individual study characteristics, research consistently shows a notable difference in what women and men take home.\n\nGiven this, we rate Hyundai\u2019s claim mostly correct.", "lang": "en"}
