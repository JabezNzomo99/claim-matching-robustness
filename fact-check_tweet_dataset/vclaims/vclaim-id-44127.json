Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nWhen the image is subjected to reverse image search technique, a Facebook post with the same image is found. In the post, the user wrote that the two women in the photo are Jayalalitha and Tamil writer Sivasankari. Also, the Tamil news website \u2018Vikatan\u2019 published the same photo in an article about Jayalalitha\u2019s friends and in the article, the name of Sivasankari can be found. When you go through the old images of Sivasankari and Nirmala Sitharaman, it can be confirmed that the women on the right in the image is Tamil writer Sivasankari and not Nirmala Sitharaman as is being claimed.\n\nTo sum it up, the woman seen along with Jayalalitha in the photo is not Nirmala Sitharaman; she is Tamil writer Sivasankari.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
