Giuliani: There\u2019s an argument to be made for that, but there\u2019s also an argument to be made for equal justice under the law, which is how do you not prosecute some of these and then go ahead and prosecute Martha Stewart for one count of lying to the FBI?\n\nAs a reminder: Stewart sold all 3,928 shares that she owned of ImClone stock on Dec. 27, 2001, a day before the company announced that the Federal Drug Administration rejected the company\u2019s application for a key cancer drug, according to a federal indictment. The next trading day the stock tumbled, and Stewart avoided a loss of about $51,000.\n\nStewart was initially charged on five counts, including securities fraud. But U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum dismissed the count of securities fraud \u2014 the most serious charge \u2014 in a Feb. 27, 2004, decision.\n\nOn March 5, 2004, Stewart was convicted on the remaining four counts: two counts of knowingly making false statements to federal investigators on Feb. 4, 2002, and April 10, 2002; one count of obstruction of justice; and one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice, as described in the charging document.\n\nStewart was sentenced to five months in jail and five months under house arrest.\n\nShe appealed, but lost. In a decision issued Jan. 6, 2006, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declared that \u201cwe affirm the judgments of the District Court and remand the case solely for consideration of whether to modify [Peter] Bacanovic\u2019s sentence.\u201d Bacanovic was Stewart\u2019s broker.\n\nGiuliani has cited Stewart before when pressing the case for prosecuting Clinton. The Trump campaign issued a Sept. 4 statement from Giuliani after the FBI released notes on its investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state. In that statement, Giuliani suggested that Clinton lied to FBI investigators when she said that she did not know that a small \u201cC\u201d notation in the body of three emails signified that those emails were classified.\n\n\u201cEither she was the dumbest Secretary of State in American history or a bald-faced liar,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s the former, there is a serious question she may get the nuclear codes confused if she were ever President. If it\u2019s the latter she should be prosecuted for the same crime as Martha Stewart by making a false statement to the FBI in violation of 18 U.S. Code section 1001.\u201d\n\nStewart was prosecuted on two counts of violating Section 1001, and one count of obstruction of justice and conspiracy of obstruction of justice (in violation of Section 1505 of Title 18, United States Code).\n\nThe FBI investigation into Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information resulted in no criminal charges. \u201cAlthough there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,\u201d FBI Director James Comey said on July 5.", "lang": "en"}
