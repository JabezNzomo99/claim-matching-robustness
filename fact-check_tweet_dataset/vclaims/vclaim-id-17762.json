No, that's not true, the political struggle over the budget is still going on. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to educate gullible Trump supporters and Republicans about the need to actually click and read links before sharing or liking them in order to avoid being embarrassed by fans of the site later. No agreement on border wall funding has been reached yet.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by America's Last Line of Defense on December 21, 2018 titled \"BREAKING: Democrats CAVE, Authorize Full Funding Of Wall To Avoid Shutdown\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nDemocrats love their precious government so much they'll do anything to keep it running. In a last-minute deal to avert the shutdown, Democrats agreed to $20 billion to pay for the \"construction of a robust border wall over a period of two years.\" The wall will span the entirety of the southern United States, including the beaches of Florida to stop those pesky raft Cubans. In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said: \"The border wall will, unfortunately, cut off much of the southern United States' beach access -- particularly in retirement communities around Miami -- but sacrifices must be made to ensure that we are protected from rapists and drug dealers coming from Mexico and Santa Recto.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so it would have looked like a news article from a conservative source to many:\n\nHowever there is no country named \"Santa Recto\", no budget deal (with or without wall funding) has been reached yet and the article was posted under the category \"BREAKING SATIRE\". Two links in the story don't actually go to the Department of Homeland Security or an article about rapists and drug dealers as promised but to a petition and an article about the past of Brian Kolfage, the man currently running a GoFundMe campaign to have citizens fund the border wall which has collected over ten million dollars in pledges so far in four days:\n\nThe hoax story isn't the only outlet questioning Kolfage's past:\n\nThe site that posted the hoax article comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes wearethellod.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
