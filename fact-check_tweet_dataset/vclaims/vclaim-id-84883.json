A representative said \u201cit is impossible to imagine that Hillary Clinton was unaware of the Bill Cosby scandal, which had [been] playing out on the news for months, on exactly the same topic as her tweet, when she tweeted out \u2018women had a right to be believed.\u2019 It is fair to assume she understood her tweet would read in that context of the larger story about sexual assault not just a specific instance of campus rape.\u201d\n\nMany Twitter users responded to Clinton\u2019s tweet at the time by pointing to the women who made sexual allegations against Bill Clinton. If the super PAC wants to make the argument that Clinton tweeted this during a time when there was public interest in the Cosby case, that needs to be made clear in a way that doesn\u2019t mislead viewers to believe that the tweet was in reference to the Cosby lawsuits.\n\nLess than two weeks after the tweet, Clinton was asked during an event about the women who made sexual allegations against Bill Clinton, and whether she holds the same view that sexual assault victims deserve to be believed: \u201cYou say that all rape victims should be believed, but would you say that about Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey and/or Paula Jones? Should we believe them as well?\u201d\n\nA reading of the full Jan. 27, 1998, interview on \u201cThe Today Show\u201d makes it less clear that Clinton is referring to the women when she talks about \u201csome folks.\u201d This interview was conducted a week after the president was accused of having an affair with Lewinsky, but Lewinsky denied it at the time through an affidavit from her lawyer. (For more details on the timeline, see our earlier fact-check on this issue.)\n\nThis interview certainly was pivotal to saving Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, as his wife forcefully backed him. While this interview often is referred to as a political attack on Lewinsky and Jones, by Hillary Clinton\u2019s account at the time her husband had not yet admitted the Lewinsky affair to her. The full context of her answer (claim used in the ad is in bold):\n\nMatt Lauer: \u201cLet me take you and your husband out of this for a second. Bill and Hillary Clinton aren\u2019t involved in this story. If an American president had an adulterous liaison in the White House and lied to cover it up, should the American people ask for his resignation?\u201d Clinton: \u201cWell, they should certainly be concerned about it.\u201d Lauer: \u201cShould they ask for his resignation?\u201d Clinton: \u201cWell, I think that \u2014 if all that were proven true, I think that would be a very serious offense. That is not going to be proven true. I think we\u2019re going to find some other things. And I think that when all of this is put into context, and we really look at the people involved here, look at their motivations and look at their backgrounds, look at their past behavior, some folks are going to have a lot to answer for.\u201d\n\nWe wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios. As regular readers know, editing jobs in political ads that risk misleading the public almost automatically qualify for Two Pinocchios under our standards. The group says it\u2019s \u201cfair to assume\u201d that Clinton would have known that her tweet would read as a commentary on the larger issue of sexual assault, and that it\u2019s \u201cfair to interpret\u201d that her claim in the Today Show interview was a \u201cthreat that she was going to exploit\u201d the women. We find that a stretch, and admakers deliberately made assumptions and interpretations to arrange audio, text and video in a way that misleads viewers. That tips it to Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
