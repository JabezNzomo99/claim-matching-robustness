However, this is false; the substance is special foam sprayed by Lagos firefighters to prevent a fire following an oil spill.\n\n\u201cWe have snow in Nigeria now God started with Maryland first. Before 2050, it will get to Ikorodu and Ikotun,\u201d reads a tweet by popular Nigerian social media influencer Adegoke Emmanuel, also known as Pamilerin. It features a 26-second clip showing vehicles driving through a white substance.\n\nMaryland, Ikorodu and Ikotun are major districts in Lagos.\n\nPamilerin\u2019s tweet has racked up nearly a thousand likes since its publication on July 8, 2020. The comments suggest many Twitter users believed the claim that it snowed in Lagos, despite its tropical climate.\n\nThe viral video merged with four more clips of the same scene was also published on Instagram by popular Nigerian broadcaster Ifedayo Olarinde. More than 22,000 people saw this video. The caption reads, in part, \u201cFairly used snow?\u201d\n\nFootage of the substance also appears in several Facebook and Instagram posts that describe it as snow. A voice saying \u201cSnow in Lagos\u201d is heard in this video that has been viewed by more than 10,000 people. We\u2019ve archived similar posts here, here and here.\n\nAFP Fact Check found that the videos show the Anthony-Maryland axis of Lagos. This Google Street View map shows the location.\n\nHowever, the videos have been shared in a misleading context. They actually depict firefighting foam sprayed on the highway by the Lagos state fire service to avert a possible fire outbreak.\n\nThe effort followed an accident involving an articulated truck that was carrying oil and spilled its contents onto the road, according to a statement tweeted by the Lagos state information commissioner, Gboyega Akosile.\n\n\u201cBlanketing of the entire scene of incident was carried out by the Lagos State Fire service as a result of the content leakage from the container (Black oil) to prevent any secondary incident (sic),\u201d reads the statement by the Director-General of Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu.\n\n\u201cThe reaction from this blanketing is what has led to the appearance of 'snow/foam' in the aforementioned area.\u201d\n\nLagos governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu\u2019s assistant Jubril Gawat has also dismissed the claim. \u201cA Tanker fell overnight and our Emergency Agencies poured the foam material to prevent combustion,\u201d Gawat tweeted.\n\nA close look at the viral video shows that the white substance is foamy and does not behave like snow -- it is piled high on some parts of the ground, while nearby areas remain entirely dry.", "lang": "en"}
