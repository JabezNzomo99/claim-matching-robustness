To make sure your account is safe on Facebook, type BFF in a comment. If it appears green, your account is protected. If it does not appear green, change your password immediately because it will be hacked.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nYeah, no. There is no relationship between one's account security and what happens when one types in the word, \"BFF.\" Mark Zuckerberg also did not invent the abbreviation, it was around long before Facebook. (Cue your middle school BFF necklaces.)\n\nThe hoax originated in response to the animated feature that Facebook introduced in 2017. A list of words and abbreviations, such as \"xoxo,\" \"congratulations,\" and \"BFF,\" that when included in a status update or comment trigger animations such as color changes, balloons or hearts.\n\nWe reached out to Facebook for a response to the claim but did not hear back before publication.\n\nThe rumor appeared to pop up in the spring of 2018 \u2013 right around the time Zuckerberg appeared in Congressional hearings to answer questions on Facebook\u2019s data privacy practices after more than 50 million users\u2019 private information was shared without their permission.\n\nAnd although this BFF claim has been labeled a hoax by several outlets, it re-surfaces on the social media website every so often.\n\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
