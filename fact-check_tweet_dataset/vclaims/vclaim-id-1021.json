The flyer includes the logo for the Open Society Foundations, beside the text \u201cFunded by George Soros\u201d and lists Thurston County Democrats (TDC) as contacts. This flyer and the claim are false.\n\nExamples can be seen ( here and here ).\n\nThe flyer in the photographs reads: \u201cGet paid to be a\u2026 Professional Anarchist! Get paid up to $200/Direct Action! Remember, Direct Action Gets The Goods. Contact your local Open Society Foundation Branch\u201d.\n\nThe chair of the Thurston County Democrats, Victor Minjares, explained in a Facebook post: \u201cFalse and forged images are being spread nationwide that say, \u201cGet paid to be a professional anarchist.\u201d This disinformation displays TCD's phone number and an incorrect TCD email/web address. THESE IMAGES ARE FAKED TO DISCREDIT DEMOCRATS. But some people believe them. TCD has received telephone calls from the gullible asking for \"George Soros\" and other Trumpian conspiratorial nonsense. IF YOU SEE IT, DO NOT SHARE IT. DO NOT COMMENT ON PAGES THAT SHARE IT. If you do either, you increase its visibility on Facebook (or Twitter, Tik Tok, etc.) and are inadvertently helping to spread false right-wing propaganda of an anti-democratic, anti-Semitic nature. You may be endangering fellow Democrats.\u201d ( here )\n\nMinjares advises people to flag the posts as false through Facebook.\n\nOpen Society Foundations also commented on the debunked claim on Twitter, stating: \u201cWe do not pay protesters. Neither does our founder George Soros.\u201d ( here )\n\nGeorge Soros is the founder and chair of the Open Society Foundations. Conspiracy theories about Soros funding protests and paying protestors have circulated online for years. (Read some examples here and here )\n\nFalse claim. This flyer was fabricated. Open Society Foundations and Thurston County Democrats are not involved in any such scheme and confirmed it is false.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
