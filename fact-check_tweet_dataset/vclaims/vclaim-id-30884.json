The vaccine in the clinical trial linked to in the post is for a coronavirus called Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).\n\nThe most recent virus, currently known simply as \u201c2019 novel coronavirus\u201d (2019-nCoV), is a different virus. Multiple efforts to develop a vaccine for 2019-nCoV are currently underway, but none are at trial stage yet.\n\nSecondly, the vaccine in the trial referenced to was replication-deficient, meaning it was engineered by scientists to be unable to spread through the body and infect the host.\n\nAdditionally, the location of the vaccine trial is listed as Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which is 4,000 miles away from Wuhan, where the first 2019-nCoV outbreak was identified. And (as the name suggests) the 2019-nCoV outbreak was first observed at the end of 2019, before the date the MERS vaccine trial was due to start.", "lang": "en"}
