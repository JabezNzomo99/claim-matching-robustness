But some social media users are sharing doctored photos that steer the narrative even further off course.\n\nTeens from the all-boys school in Kentucky were attending the March for Life in Washington, D.C., when they were captured on video Jan. 18 wearing \"Make America Great Again Hats\" while surrounding Nathan Phillips. The encounter led publications to publish video footage with headlines like \"Kentucky teens wearing \u2018MAGA\u2019 hats taunt Indigenous Peoples March participants.\" Videos that emerged later showed the encounter happened after black protesters shouted slurs at the students.\n\nThat same day, a purported screengrab of the Twitter account of a mother of one of the boys appeared online. The account appeared to belong to Julie Sandmann. The bio reads: \"Proud mother of Nick Sandmann of Covington Catholic. Not here to apologize or grovel. #faith\"\n\nA photo of Nick Sandmann \u2014 the youth who the viral video showed staring directly into Phillips\u2019 face while Phillips drummed and sang the American Indian Movement song \u2014 blocks how many tweets the account has sent, but two appear in the photo.\n\n\"After what I\u2019ve been through in the past 36 hours, I only wish the pioneers had brought more blankets with smallpox,\" one says. The other: \"This man has been proved a LIAR! \u2018Never trust an Indian\u2019 maybe there\u2019s a reason people say that have you ever thought of that?\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe account no longer exists, but if you search for the account\u2019s handle, @GauchoGuacamole, the first Google result shows it belongs to someone other than Julie Sandmann. Rather, the account is attributed to \"Soccer Dad.\" The bio says: \"Proud father of #2 ranked U12 soccer player in Southern New Hampshire youth soccer conference.\"\n\nGoogle still shows snippets of some of the account\u2019s earlier tweets, such as \"I hope Pence goes to prison\u2026\" in Nov. 11, 2018, and \"Everything Donald Trump touches dies.\"\n\nOne Twitter user caught on before @gauchoguacamole disappeared from the platform. \"Everyone is posting a tweet by Julie Sandmann, but look at the Twitter handle,\" the person tweeted. @gauchoguacamole is just trying to add fuel to the fire.\"\n\nThis claim is bogus.
