That led to long-running shows such as \u201cCops\u201d and \u201cLive PD\u201d getting canceled, and spurred a number of people who worked on TV shows about law enforcement to donate to causes related to the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nAs protests nationwide gained momentum, some social media users posted tongue-in-cheek messages calling for the cancellation of the animated children\u2019s show. This led to a think piece published in The New York Times that stated \u201cit was only a matter of time before the protests came for \u201cPaw Patrol.\u201d\n\nThe excerpt from the Times story:\n\n\u201cPaw Patrol\u201d is a children\u2019s cartoon about a squad of canine helpers. It is basically a pretense for placing household pets in a variety of cool trucks. The team includes Marshall, a firefighting Dalmatian; Rubble, a bulldog construction worker; and Chase, a German shepherd who is also a cop. In the world of \u201cPaw Patrol,\u201d Chase is drawn to be a very good boy who barks stuff like \u201cChase is on the case!\u201d and \u201cAll in a police pup\u2019s day!\u201d as he rescues kittens in his tricked-out S.U.V. But last week, when the show\u2019s official Twitter account put out a bland call for \u201cBlack voices to be heard,\u201d commenters came after Chase. \u201cEuthanize the police dog,\u201d they said. \u201cDefund the paw patrol.\u201d \u201cAll dogs go to heaven, except the class traitors in the Paw Patrol.\u201d It\u2019s a joke, but it\u2019s also not. As the protests against racist police violence enter their third week, the charges are mounting against fictional cops, too. Even big-hearted cartoon police dogs \u2014 or maybe especially big-hearted cartoon police dogs \u2014 are on notice. The effort to publicize police brutality also means banishing the good-cop archetype, which reigns on both television and in viral videos of the protests themselves. \u201cPaw Patrol\u201d seems harmless enough, and that\u2019s the point: The movement rests on understanding that cops do plenty of harm.\n\nShortly after the Times story was published, conservative figures such as U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s son Eric and Dana Loesch, sometime spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association, said that the \u201crage mob\u201d was making an effort to cancel the show.\n\nAs far as we can tell, earnest calls to have \u201cPaw Patrol\u201d canceled due to its portrayal of police officers have been few and far between. While the vast majority of the posts calling for the cancellation of \u201cPaw Patrol\u201d were made in jest, they were prompted by a genuine conversation concerning the impact of how police officers are portrayed in television and movies.\n\nAn old article from the satirical news publication The Onion may have contributed to some confusion over whether or not \u201cPaw Patrol\u201d got canceled. In 2018, The Onion published an article claiming that a \u201cPaw Patrol\u201d writer was defending an episode in which a German shepherd shot a black Lab 18 times in the back.\n\nMeanwhile, Nickelodeon, the network that airs \u201cPaw Patrol,\u201d has also released messages in support of the protests. It should also be noted that on June 7, 2020, the show went silent on social media in solidarity, muting its content:", "lang": "en"}
