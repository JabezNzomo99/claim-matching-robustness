As news outlets quickly fielded reports about the terrorist leader\u2019s death, the Washington Post published an obituary that labeled al-Baghdadi an \u201caustere religious scholar.\u201d\n\nScreenshots of this obituary headline were widely shared on social media along with criticism of the news outlet. Former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, for instance, posted the following message on Twitter:\n\nThis is a genuine headline that briefly appeared on Washingtonpost.com. An archived version of the article can be found here.\n\nThe headline appeared on the Washington Post\u2019s website for about two hours. The story was published at 8:31 a.m. CDT, according to the article\u2019s timestamp. This headline was changed to \u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, extremist leader of Islamic State, dies at 48\u201d at about 10:35 a.m., according to archived links from the Internet Wayback Machine.\n\nKristine Coratti Kelly, the vice president and communications general manager of Washington Post Live, posted a message on Twitter saying that the headline \u201cshould never have read that way.\u201d\n\nThe qualms over the Washington Post\u2019s headline likely served as the inspiration of a meme targeting another \u201cmainstream media\u201d outlet, CNN. Some social media users started to share an image that supposedly showed a screenshot from a CNN broadcast about al-Baghdadi\u2019s death featuring the chyron \u201cTrump Kills Unarmed Father of Three\u201d:\n\nFor the record, while the Washington Post briefly published a headline for al-Baghdadi\u2019s obituary labeling him a religious scholar, the above-displayed chryon is a digital manipulation featuring a years-old image of Don Lemon that never aired on CNN.", "lang": "en"}
