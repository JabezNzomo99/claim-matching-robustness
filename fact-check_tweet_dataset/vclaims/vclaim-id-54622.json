This is false; the selection process for the WTO\u2019s top job is still on and no winning candidate has been announced yet.\n\nMohamed is one of eight candidates seeking to succeed current WTO head Roberto Azev\u00eado. As reported by AFP, the Brazilian career diplomat announced in May that he was stepping down a year before the end of his tenure for \u201cpersonal\u201d reasons.\n\nBut Mohamed is said to have already clinched the WTO top post in numerous social media posts in Nigeria, including this one published on Facebook on July 16, 2020. The Facebook page, called Foluke Daramola, has more than 280,000 followers.\n\n\u201cAmina Mohamed of Kenya is the new WTO D-G, congratulations to her and to our own Ngozi Okonjo weala thanks for the robust campaign (sic),\u201d the post partly reads.\n\nMohamed and Nigeria\u2019s two-time former finance minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala are the two female candidates from Africa lobbying for the WTO position.\n\nThe other challengers are Egypt\u2019s former trade negotiator Abdel-Hamid Mamdouh, Mexico\u2019s ex-WTO deputy director-general Jes\u00fas Seade Kuri, former Moldovan foreign minister Tudor Ulianovschi, South Korean Trade Minister Yoo Myung-hee, former Saudi economy minister Mohammad Maziad Al-Tuwaijri, and former international trade secretary Liam Fox.\n\nUsing the online monitoring tool CrowdTangle, AFP Fact Check found that the post started circulating after popular Nigerian journalist Dele Momodu tweeted about Mohamed\u2019s alleged victory on July 16, 2020.\n\n\u201cBREAKING NEWS: KENYA\u2019S AMINA MOHAMED BEATS NIGERIA\u2019S NGOZI OKONJO-IWEALA FOR THE W.T.O\u2019S TOP JOB\u2026,\u201d the now-deleted tweet read.\n\nThe tweet surfaced a few days after Kenya nominated Mohamed for the WTO chief position.\n\nSince then, Momodu\u2019s posts on social media have sparked a wave of misinformation across Nigeria about the WTO race.\n\nA Facebook page called NG News Reporters -- whose posts have been debunked by AFP Fact Check here and here -- is one of the accounts that published the claim. Local online site City News also shared an article alongside a similar claim.\n\nBut Mohamed has not been appointed as WTO\u2019s director-general. She\u2019s still in the race with other contenders.\n\nAFP Fact Check found that the WTO was in the second phase of the appointment process for its next leader after a month-long nomination stage. Candidates have until September 7, 2020, to \u201cmake themselves known to members\u201d, according to the global trade organisation.\n\nConsultations with WTO members to narrow the field to one candidate are the last step before the new director-general is finally named. \u201cThe third phase will last no more than two months,\u201d the WTO stated.\n\nMomodu issued a correction to his tweet on the same day and apologised for spreading false claims. \u201cJust received news that AMINA MOHAMED has not been confirmed for the W.T.O job but nominated by KENYA,\u201d Momodu said on Twitter. \u201cThe interviews are still ongoing.\u201d\n\n\n\n The WTO leadership race comes amid prolonged trade tensions between the United States and China, creating an uphill task for an organisation whose goal is to foster free and predictable global trade.", "lang": "en"}
