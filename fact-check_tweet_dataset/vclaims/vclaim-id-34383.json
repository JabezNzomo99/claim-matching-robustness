(READ: 6 new railways to look out for)\n\nSome of the Facebook pages which have re-posted the claim are Filipino News Central and Duterte Community News. According to their About sections, they are purported \u201cmedia\u201d or \u201cnews and media website.\"\n\nThe facts: There were earlier news reports about the procurement of two types of trains for the PNR from Indonesia. When the Department of Transportation (DOTr) announced the arrival of 6 rail cars in November 2019, Pilipino Star Ngayon and Inquirer.net reported about it.\n\nAccording to the DOTr post dated November 27, the two diesel multiple units (DMU), which are composed of 3 rail cars each, were ready to depart from the Surabaya Port in Indonesia.\n\nOn November 30, the two DMUs were already loaded and shipped by vessel MV Zea Challenger, as announced by PNR on its official Facebook page. The DMUs are expected to arrive in the Port of Manila on December 9.\n\nBelow is the post of the DOTr announcing the arrival of the new sets of train. It is also noteworthy that Facebook page JP Fajura posted the claim at 4:48 PM, 7 minutes after the DOTr posted its announcement. The claim was only added to the original post of DOTr, which several Duterte Facebook fan pages have re-posted and shared.\n\nSince May 2018, media have been aggressive in reporting about the purchase of new sets of trains. In January 2018, GMA News reported about the contract signing between Indonesia and the Philippines for the purchase of two P485.3-million DMU train sets. In May 2018, Inquirer.net and Business World reported about the additional purchase of the 4 DMUs and 3 diesel-hydraulic locomotives (DHL) amounting to P2.37 billion.\n\nThe PNR acquired DMUs and DHLs from Indonesian state-owned company PT Industri Kereta Api (PT INKA) in 2018. In total, the Philippines has ordered 37 rail cars which will complete the 7 sets of new trains with 4-car and 5-car configurations. \u2013 Glenda Marie Castro/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
