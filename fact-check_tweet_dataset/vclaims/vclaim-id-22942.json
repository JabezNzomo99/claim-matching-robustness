Let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of the claim made in the post\n\nClaim: Rajamma is 62 years old now. So, she was just 13 years old when Rahul Gandhi was born.\n\nFact: All the major newspapers reported the current age of Rajamma as 72 years, not 62 years. So, she was 23 years old, not 13 years old, when Rahul Gandhi was born. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched on Google with the keywords \u2018Rajamma Rahul Gandhi\u2019, newspaper articles on Rahul Gandhi meeting Rajamma can be found in the search results. According to various newspaper articles (The Hindu, India Today, Times of India), the current age of Rajamma is 72 years, not 62 years. Even the news agency PTI reported the same. Rahul Gandhi was born in 1970. So if her current age is 72 years, then she was 23 years old in 1970. The age of Rajamma was reduced by 10 years in the post to falsely claim that she was just 13 years old in 1970.\n\nTo sum it up, Rajamma is 72 years old, not 62 years old, as per the newspaper reports.\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
