For all offices in Wisconsin, the number of signatures required for nomination petitions is too high,\" Andy Craig wrote in the letter, which was released publicly. \"These levels are set such that incumbents and candidates with party backing can meet them with ease, but upstart challengers are often scared off from even attempting it.\"\n\nThe result, Craig contends, is that nearly half of the candidates elected to the Wisconsin Assembly in November 2014 were alone on the general-election ballot.\n\nBy contrast, he continued, \"just 9 out of 134 Representatives ran unopposed in Minnesota. In Michigan all 110 State Representative elections were contested by both major parties.\"\n\n\"It is hard to believe that people in Wisconsin are that much more disinterested in deciding who their legislators are,\" Craig wrote.\n\nCan our legislative races be so uncompetitive -- and is it due to unusually high hurdles to candidacy?\n\nWhen we asked Craig, a 2014 Libertarian candidate for secretary of state, to back up his claim, he pointed to the Ballotpedia and Ballot Access News websites. The websites include tallies of contested races and state-by-state comparisons of candidacy requirements.\n\nRegarding the contention that lower ballot access hurdles result in more candidates and fewer uncontested elections, Craig told us, \"that seems self-evident, primarily in the comparison to other states that make it easier.\"\n\nHe also cited his experiences recruiting and assisting candidate, some of whom missed making the ballot because they couldn't get enough signatures in time.\n\nWe checked with election experts and compiled our own tallies of contested races from state election websites.\n\nMichigan and Minnesota did have at least two candidates facing off in the 2014 general elections in virtually all cases cited. And Wisconsin\u2019s Assembly candidates were unopposed in nearly half the races.\n\nThat gap between those states is longstanding, according to research by the National Institute on Money in State Politics. And mirroring a national trend, Wisconsin has seen the number of uncontested Assembly races double since the mid-1970s, Ballotpedia reported.\n\nWhy is there a gap?\n\nNow to the \"why\" part.\n\nCraig points out, correctly, that Michigan and Minnesota allow candidates to pay $100 filing fees to secure a ballot spot if they don\u2019t want to collect signatures from residents. Wisconsin does not allow the filing fee option.\n\nElsewhere in the Midwest, two others states with a lot of uncontested 2014 races -- neighboring Illinois and Iowa -- similarly have no option to forgo signature collection.\n\nRichard Winger, editor of Ballot Access News, said he thinks relatively more difficult ballot access rules explain the differences in those states.\n\n\"Asking strangers for signatures is somewhat like hitch-hiking,\" Winger said. \"It is psychologically difficult for most people to ask for favors from strangers.\"\n\nWinger is a widely quoted expert on ballot access laws and advocates for fairness in allowing minor party candidates on ballots.\n\nWe heard a more skeptical view from Barry Burden, an expert in election administration at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nAs parties, the Democrats and Republicans quality for ballot lines pretty easily in all three states, and there is little doubt that any of them would lose their status as major parties, Burden said. He added that it can be harder for minor party candidates to get on ballots.\n\nBut the claim rests on what individuals have to do to get on ballots.\n\nThe fee option might attract more candidates, Burden said, because it is low and, since it can be paid at the last moment, requires little organization or planning.\n\nBut the signature requirements are also low, he said. That requirement is lower in Wisconsin (200 for Assembly candidates) than Minnesota (500) for major party candidates. In Michigan, the rule is 200 for major party candidates and 600 for independents.\n\n\"Any candidate who has at least a skeletal organization or a little free time should be able to scoop up a couple hundred signatures without much trouble,\" Burden said.\n\nBurden and others suggest that other factors are at play.\n\nFor the last two election cycles in Wisconsin, the redrawing of legislative district lines has helped to squelch competition, Burden said.\n\nAs the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s Craig Gilbert reported in \"Dividing Lines\", that redistricting and the ultra-polarized geography of southeastern Wisconsin mean that \"there are practically no competitive seats in the most populous part of this competitive swing state.\"\n\nBurden said party strategy differences can determine whether parties field candidates in \"lost causes\" areas.\n\nIn Minnesota, Burden noted, public funding of elections there is more likely to enhance competition by luring in candidates who might otherwise believe they would be unable to compete financially.\n\nIn Michigan, some have suggested that the state\u2019s term limits enhance competition. Burden disagreed, saying that by creating automatic openings every six to eight years, term limits actually reduce competition in other years. Strong candidates, he said, typically wait to run until the incumbent is forced from office.\n\nAndy Craig of Competitive Elections Wisconsin claimed: \"Thanks to restrictive and anticompetitive ballot laws,\" candidates in November 2014 ran unopposed in nearly half of Wisconsin\u2019s state legislative races but in Michigan and Minnesota were challenged in nearly all races.\n\nThere\u2019s no dispute that Wisconsin dramatically lags those states in competitive races, and ballot access rule differences are one possible factor in that gap. But it\u2019s clear that other factors are at play as well.", "lang": "en"}
