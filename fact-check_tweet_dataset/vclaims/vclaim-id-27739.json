However, NNPC would still be in charge of exploration activities and most probably product transportation.\n\nThat being said, another candidate, Professor Kingsley Moghalu also details his plans. His BIG vision hinges on four standing pillars namely; foundation, nation-building, economy and foreign affairs.\n\nIn his explanation on implementation of the plans, Moghalu made mention of the privatisation of NNPC. In his words \u2013\n\n\u201cEstablish a concrete economic diversification plan with a concrete path to a post-oil future for Nigeria, based on emerging global trends. This plan, akin to the Saudi Arabian government\u2019s economic diversification plan, should include a clear strategy with interlinked policies \u2013 trade, industrial, fiscal \u2013 and far-reaching structural and governance reforms of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that could include partial privatization (with share listed on the stock exchange for purchase by ordinary Nigerians and not by government-related cronies). In doing so, the interests of local communities in oil-producing regions must be protected \u2013 for example, by ensuring a set-aside in private ownership of the NNPC by members of the communities in the oil-producing regions).\u201d\n\nHe also reinstated his plans in an interview with Channels Television Business Morning Programme. He said \u2013\n\n\u201cThe NNPC needs to be partially privatised between 41% to 51% whether private sector or government. This will turn the NNPC into a much more transparent organisation that is run consistently profitably.\n\n\u201cIn privatising the NNPC partially, we should make sure that the oil producing communities have 10% ownership stake and we will sell those shares on Nigerian Stock Exchange in a carefully and transparently managed process.\u201d\n\nOther candidates have also expressed their plans for the infamous Nigerian petroleum industry. For instance, Omoyele Sowore of \u2018Take It Back Movement\u2019 plans to implement changes to petroleum products and to expand the transmission of electricity in the country. In the 10-point agenda of Fela Durotoye, he plans to sell off some petroleum assets\u2019 while the revolutionary ideas of Tope Fasua includes the formalising of the mini refineries in the Niger Delta on community basis. Nevertheless, none of them mentioned privatisation.\n\nThe incumbent president seeking re-election, Muhammadu Buhari, does not have privatisation of NNPC plans (at least his manifesto doesn\u2019t mention such); although some of his ministers advocated for the sale of national assets to fund the 2018 budget and there are indications that the 2019 budget will be funded significantly with sales of national assets as claimed by the Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed.\n\nCONCLUSION: As voters would be out under the sun or rain at the polls on Saturday 16 February 2019 to choose who will be the next president, it is very pertinent for Nigerians to read beneath the headlines and be wary of claims that align with our personal interests and make a particular candidate to seem way better than others!", "lang": "en"}
