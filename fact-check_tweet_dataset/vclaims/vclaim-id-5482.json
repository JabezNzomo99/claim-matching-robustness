Ron Johnson, the Republican chairman of the homeland security committee, said \u201cyou have to assume that our enemies and our adversaries had access to every email that ever went over her private server.\u201d But there\u2019s no evidence so far that any attempts to hack into Clinton\u2019s server were successful.\n\u2022 Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff said former Secretary of State Colin Powell, a Republican, \u201cdid not respond \u2026 to the IG\u201d when asked \u201cto provide whatever emails he retained or to work with the private provider of those emails to provide them.\u201d Schiff gets his facts wrong. The IG made no such request, and the IG report noted that Powell told the State Department in 2015 that he did not retain any emails.\n\nJohnson, whose committee has been investigating the security of Clinton\u2019s email system, and Schiff, who is a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, appeared on the Sunday talk shows three days after the IG report was publicly released on May 26.\n\nThat report was critical of Clinton\u2019s \u201cexclusive reliance on a personal email account to conduct Department business,\u201d saying it had been department policy since 2005 that \u201cnormal day-to-day operations\u201d must be conducted on government servers. Clinton was secretary of state from January 2009 to February 2013.\n\nOn CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Johnson \u2014 a Wisconsin Republican who heads the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \u2014 called Clinton\u2019s email arrangement \u201creckless and dangerous.\u201d\n\nThe State Department has said that many of her emails contained classified information \u2014 including some emails that were higher than \u201ctop secret\u201d \u2014 although none was marked classified at the time the emails were sent and received. Some personal emails sent to Powell and aides to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also contained information that retroactively has been classified as \u201cconfidential\u201d or \u201csecret.\u201d\n\nThe IG report discussed the potential security risk of Clinton\u2019s server, but it did not report any security breaches and neither has any other investigative body so far \u2014 contrary to Johnson\u2019s assumption.\n\nThe senator\u2019s office told us he did not say Clinton\u2019s emails were hacked. Fair enough. But what evidence is there that Clinton\u2019s server may have been successfully hacked and that \u201cevery email that ever went over her private server\u201d has been stolen?\n\nThe IG report said hackers attempted to access Clinton\u2019s server on Jan. 9, 2011, but Clinton\u2019s technical support adviser shut down the server to deny access. The report also said that Clinton received two phishing email messages on May 13, 2011, that contained suspicious links. The campaign has said the phishing attempts were unsuccessful.\n\nIn the past, Johnson has expressed concerns that hackers may have accessed Clinton\u2019s emails.\n\nJohnson sent a letter dated Oct. 5, 2015, to SECNAP Network Security Corp., which Johnson said provided a \u201cthreat-monitoring\u201d device for Clinton\u2019s network. In that letter, Johnson said that there were attempts to hack into Clinton\u2019s server \u201coriginating in countries such as China, the Republic of Korea, and Germany,\u201d based on emails that the committee obtained as part of its examination of Clinton\u2019s email arrangement.\n\nJohnson wrote about an example of a cyberattack on Clinton\u2019s server that originated from China, but he said it was \u201cdetected and prevented.\u201d\n\nIn citing that incident, Johnson asked the security company for more information because \u201cquestions remain about whether the private server was vulnerable to cyberattacks\u201d prior to installation of the device. Questions still remain; Johnson\u2019s office told us that SECNAP said it could not respond to the senator\u2019s questions because it has a nondisclosure agreement with its client, presumably the Clintons.\n\nHowever, the New York Times in March reported that security logs from Clinton\u2019s email server were turned over to the FBI, and they showed no evidence of foreign hacking.\n\nWe may not know whether Clinton\u2019s server was compromised until the FBI investigation is completed. In April, FBI Director Jim Comey declined to say when the investigation would be completed, but said he would not set an arbitrary deadline, such as completing it by the July nominating convention.\n\nUpdate, July 6: Comey announced on July 5 that he would not recommend charges against Clinton or her staff. At a press conference, Comey said the FBI \u201cdid not find direct evidence that Secretary Clinton\u2019s personal email domain \u2026 was successfully hacked. But, given the nature of the system and of the actors potentially involved, we assess that we would be unlikely to see such direct evidence.\u201d\n\nComey added that \u201cit is possible that hostile actors gained access\u201d to Clinton\u2019s email account, because, among other factors, she sent and received \u201cwork-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff defended Clinton\u2019s decision to set up a private email system, repeatedly trying to draw comparisons to former Secretary of State Colin Powell, a Republican who served under President George W. Bush.\n\nClinton and Powell were the only two secretaries of state who used personal email accounts \u201con an exclusive basis for day-to-day operations,\u201d according to the IG report. Unlike Clinton, Powell didn\u2019t use a private server. As the report notes, Powell said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sept. 6, 2015, that he used a commercial email account. He didn\u2019t say which provider, but Powell was a board member of America Online, or AOL, prior to becoming secretary of state.\n\nHost Chris Wallace several times sought to prevent Schiff from discussing Powell. At one point, Schiff criticized Wallace after the host noted that Powell agreed to be interviewed by the IG, but Clinton did not. Schiff accused Wallace of failing to mention that Powell \u201cstill has not responded to the IG\u201d on some key matters.\n\nSchiff twists the facts. First, the IG made no such request. The IG report, however, said that Powell\u2019s representative told the State Department in 2015 that he did not retain any work-related emails. So Powell was \u201casked to provide whatever e-mails he retained,\u201d and he responded.\n\nThe IG report cited an April 2, 2015, letter written by State Department Deputy Assistant Secretary for Global Information Services Margaret Grafeld that said, \u201cIn March 2015, former Secretary Powell\u2019s representative advised that while former Secretary Powell used a personal email account during his tenure as Secretary of State, he did not retain those emails or make printed copies.\u201d\n\nSchiff is right that Powell was asked \u201cto work with the private provider of those emails to provide them,\u201d but not by the inspector general.\n\nSchiff is actually referring to an Oct. 21, 2015, letter sent by Patrick Kennedy, the State Department\u2019s under secretary for management, to Powell\u2019s principal assistant, Peggy Cifrino, as noted in the IG report. The Office of Inspector General is an independent office within the State Department, and Kennedy is not under the IG\u2019s authority.\n\nIn Kennedy\u2019s letter, the State Department encouraged Cifrino to contact the email provider Powell used as secretary of state to see if any work-related emails could be recovered. Powell was secretary of state from 2001 to 2005, and the email account had been closed for years. The State Department did not specifically direct Powell\u2019s office to respond, saying only to forward work-related emails to the department \u201cif you do recover any such emails.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou previously advised, with respect to official emails sent on Secretary Powell\u2019s private account during his time in office, that the account he used has been closed for a number of years,\u201d Kennedy wrote to Cifrino. \u201cBased on advice we have received from the National Archives and Records Administration, the Department would nevertheless encourage you \u2014 if you have not already done so \u2014 to check with the internet service or email provider for the former account to see if it is still possible to retrieve any official emails from Secretary Powell\u2019s tenure at the Department. If you do recover any such emails, we would appreciate your forwarding them to the Department.\u201d\n\nThe IG report noted that Powell\u2019s office as of May had not responded to the State Department\u2019s request \u2014 not that Powell \u201cstill has not responded to the IG,\u201d as Schiff said.\n\nClinton and her allies frequently compare Clinton\u2019s use of personal email to Powell\u2019s use. But the IG report was pointed in drawing key differences between Clinton and past secretaries. It said the rules governing personal email and the use of nongovernment systems were \u201cconsiderably more detailed and more sophisticated\u201d during Clinton\u2019s time in office.\n\n\u201cSecretary Clinton\u2019s cybersecurity practices accordingly must be evaluated in light of these more comprehensive directives,\u201d the report said.", "lang": "en"}
