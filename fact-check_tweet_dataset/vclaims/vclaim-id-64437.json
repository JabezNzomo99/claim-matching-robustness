A short story regarding his achievements can be also seen in the post. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nWhen searched about his appointment as a scientist in DRDO, a video message by Prathap was found on YouTube. In the video, Prathap has himself clarified he has not been appointed as a scientist in DRDO by PM Modi. The same has also been confirmed by him in conversation with \u2018Boom Live\u2019. On the DRDO website, it can be found that, for a post of Scientist \u2018B\u2019, the required qualification is \u2018At least First Class Master\u2019s degree in Science Subjects, Mathematics or Psychology or First Class Degree in Engineering or Technology or Metallurgy from a recognized University or Equivalent.\u2019\n\nWhen searched about other things mentioned in the post regarding Pratap, it was found that there is no concrete evidence to most of his achievements being shared on social media. But he was interviewed previously by various Kannada channels including \u2018DD Chandana\u2019 (video is not available now) for his achievements. Also, in one such video by \u2018Dighvijay 24X7 News\u2019, it can be seen that B. S. Yediyurappa, H. D. Kumaraswamy (then CM of Karnataka) and other celebrities have wished Pratap on his achievements. He has also received an award from \u2018TV9 Kannada\u2019 for his achievement in Multi-Drone Research. Many other photos of Pratap with various political leaders and celebrities can be seen on an Instagram profile with the name \u2018droneprathap\u2019 (FACTLY could not confirm the authenticity of the profile and photos).\n\nWhile it is being claimed that he has built over 600 drones, there is no picture or video on the internet of a drone built by him. There are some photos of him standing next to some drones, but they are built by reputed drone companies, not by him. In the photo given in the post, Pratap can be seen standing next to a drone which belongs to \u2018ACSL\u2019 (Autonomous Control Systems Laboratory Ltd) company. A Reddit user has posted an email response from \u2018ACSL\u2019 when they were asked about Pratap\u2019s connection with the drone. From the email response, it is clear that Pratap has no connection with the company or drone.\n\nAlso, the remote of the drone used by Prathap during the Karnataka floods looks similar to \u2018YUNEEC Typhoon H+\u2019 drone remote.\n\nIn the post, it is mentioned that he won the first prize at an expo in Tokyo. A certificate related to that prize can be found on multiple news blog websites. On the certificate, it is written that the award was won at the \u2018iREX 2017\u2019 exhibition. But, \u2018iREX 2017\u2019 is a trade expo where various companies exhibit their robots. There is no official record of any such competition and Pratap winning the competition at the expo. The organizers of the expo released a \u2018Post Show Report\u2019 after the 2017 event but there is no mention of the competition in the report. Also, there is no mention of the \u2018Airbus Defence and Space\u2019 company, whose name can be found on the Pratap\u2019s certificate.\n\nThere is no evidence to the claim that he won \u2018Albert Einstein Innovation Medal\u2019 at \u2018CeBIT Drone Expo 2018\u2019 in Germany. When searched about that award, only articles related to Pratap can be found in the search results. On the certificate, it can be seen that it is written as \u2018Albert Einstein Innovation Medal\u2019 on the top whereas it is written as \u2018Albert Einstein Innovation Award\u2019 below. Also, on the certificate, the name of \u2018Deutsche Messe\u2019 company CEO is given as \u2018Wolfram von Fritsch\u2019. But, Wolfram von Fritsch has handed over his leadership role to Dr. Jochen K\u00f6ckler back in 2017 itself. Still, the certificate awarded to Pratap in 2018 has Wolfram von Fritsch\u2019s name as CEO. Also, responding to \u2018The Better India\u2019, the organizers of the events in Germany have said that they did not host any such award.\n\nIn the post, regarding Pratap\u2019s visit to Tokyo to participate in \u2018iREX 2017\u2019, it is mentioned that \u2018somehow he reached Tokyo after going in his maiden flight to Japan all alone. He had only Rs 1400 when he landed there. He didn\u2019t take the Bullet train since it was very expensive, so he went by normal train by changing trains at 16 different stations with his luggage to reach his last station. He walked another 8 km to reach the ultimate destination with his luggage.\u2019 But, from Google Maps, it can be found that the exhibition\u2019s location (\u2018Tokyo Big Sight\u2019) is just 15 km (from Haneda International Airport) and 65 km (from Narita International Airport) from Tokyo\u2019s two international airports. There is no need to board on a bullet train to reach the exhibition and also, the bullet train is an intercity service. Unless Prathap landed at a different city in Japan and wanted to come to Tokyo, there is no actual need to board a bullet train.\n\nThe \u2019OpIndia\u2019 has previously published an article debunking the claims of Prathap. But, talking to Kannada media, Prathap has said that he has enough evidence to prove that his awards are genuine and he will be holding a press meet in coming days to provide the evidence. FACTLY has also tried to contact Prathap for clarification on the issue but there was no response. This article will be updated upon receiving a response from him.\n\nTo sum it up, \u2018Drone boy\u2019 Prathap has not been appointed as a scientist in DRDO by PM Modi. Also, there is no concrete evidence to most of his achievements being shared on social media.\n\nAs on 16 June 2020, Prathap has not replied to FACTLY but came appeared on \u2018Btv News Kannada\u2019 channel to answer questions raised by one and all over his international achievements. In this program, he just showed his certificates and claimed that they are authentic. He did not provide any additional evidence to prove their authenticity. But, as an answer to a question regarding the absence of his drone photos in the public domain, Prathap showed a drone photo on his mobile, claiming that it was built by him. He said, \u2018Today, I am going to show one of my drones\u2019, showing the photo to the audience. He has also said that he has won the award for this same drone.\n\nBut the same photo is already in the public domain. The photo can be found in an article published by \u2018The Better India\u2019 on Prathap in January 2020.\n\nHowever, just beside the drone, there is a paper with the name \u2013 \u2018BillzEye\u2019. So, when we searched for that name, it was found that the \u2018BillzEye\u2019 is a German company which specializes in multicopter systems.\n\nThe \u2018BillzEye\u2019 has posted a video with similar visuals as seen in Prathap\u2019s photo on their Facebook account. In the description of the video, it can be seen that the visuals are related to \u2018CeBIT\u2019 event at Hanover (Germany). This is the same event where Prathap has claimed that he has won the \u2018Albert Einstein Innovation Medal\u2019 in 2018. So, in the interview, he was referring to \u2018Albert Einstein Innovation Medal\u2019 when he said he won the award for the drone shown in the photo. But, \u2018BillzEye\u2019 has not mentioned Prathap\u2019s name or regarding the award anywhere. Some users have also posted the image of the same drone showcased at \u2018CeBIT2018\u2019. Those posts can be seen here, here and here.\n\nOther pictures of the same red drone and some components placed on the table in Prathap\u2019s photo can be also found on the \u2018BillzEye\u2019 website. The name of the drone is mentioned as \u2018Thermographic copter BETH-001\u2019 on the website. The headset on the table has \u2018FAT SHARK\u2019 name on it. It was found that the \u2018FAT SHARK\u2019 company produces \u2018FPV\u2019 (First-person view) goggles for drone pilots.\n\nOn their website and Facebook page, \u2018BillzEye\u2019 has mentioned that they are official members of \u2018BVCP\u2019 (Bundesverband Copter Piloten e.V.). The same name and logo can be seen on the wall behind Prathap in the photo.\n\nIt is in the \u2018BVCP\u2019 stall at \u2018CeBIT2018\u2019 where \u2018BillzEye\u2019 showcased the drone. On the \u2018BVCP\u2019 website, an article with the heading \u2018Impressions of CEBIT 2018\u2019 (translated by Google from German) can be found. The name of the \u2018BillzEye\u2019 owner, Bill Gutbier, is mentioned along with some other names in the article but Prathap\u2019s name is not mentioned anywhere. Also, nothing was mentioned about the drone in the photo winning an award at the event. Prathap was not found in any of the photos posted in the article.\n\nAssuming Prathap is part of the \u2018BillzEye\u2019 team and really won the (not yet authenticated) \u2018Albert Einstein Innovation Medal\u2019 for the drone, then Prathap\u2019s designation in \u2018BillzEye\u2019 company should have been mentioned on the certificate, not his college name. But it can be seen that his college name is mentioned on Prathap\u2019s certificate and there is no mention of \u2018BillzEye\u2019 at all. FACTLY has tried to contact \u2018BillzEye\u2019 for clarification and this article will be updated when a response is received.\n\nIn reply to multiple requests, \u2018BillzEye\u2019 has issued a statement on the issue. They have clarified that the drone in the photo, which Pratap claimed to be his drone, is the property of \u201cBillzEye \u2013 Multicoptersysteme\u201d and Prathap has nothing to do with the design, development, manufacture or distribution of the drone. They said, \u2018Mr. Prathap had only taken a photo at CEBIT 2018 in Hanover. If He says otherwise, it is a lie!\u2018 (translated by Google from German). So, it has been confirmed that Prathap has lied on television that the drone next to him in the photo is his drone and he won an award for it.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
