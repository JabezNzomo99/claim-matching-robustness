Bill Cassidy (R-La.) makes a confusing attack on an Obamacare \"exemption\" his staff benefits from.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2016-02-02T18:54:59Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-82801", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/07/23/exemptions-for-congressional-staff-in-obamacare-or-hyprocisy/", "vclaim": "This is a complicated issue which we have explored before, but we will try to keep it simple. The health-care law requires members of Congress and at least some staffers to leave the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program (FEHBP) and join the health-care exchanges.\n\nThat was easier said than done, in large part because congressional employees previously had received a stipend to help pay for health-insurance premiums, whereas they generally make too much to qualify for subsidies in the exchanges. The exchanges, after all, were intended for people who previously did not get employer-provided insurance, while lawmakers and their staffs previously had about 70 percent of their insurance premiums underwritten by the federal government through the FEHBP. For lawmakers and their staffs, the loss of employer contributions would have amounted to an unintended pay cut of between $5,000 to $10,000.\n\nThe ad suggests that it is discussing the continued stipend. It flashes a Wall Street Journal headline about \u201cCongress\u2019s ObamaCare Exemption,\u201d which is over an editorial about these payments. Cassidy in September wrote an opinion article for The Hill newspaper titled \u201cNo congressional Obamacare exemptions,\u201d which decried the workaround crafted by the administration. And of course Cassidy in the ad talks about how Congress \u201cexempted staff\u201d from the law.\n\nThe irony\u2014or the possible hypocrisy\u2014is that Cassidy\u2019s staff benefits from these subsidies through the D.C. exchange, though Cassidy says he donates the equivalent of the subsidy to charity. But a spokesman for Cassidy says the ad is not about the subsidy, but instead a different issue\u2014whether committee staff can be designated as remaining in the FEHBP.\n\nThough no names are mentioned, Cassidy\u2019s target appears to be the incumbent Democratic senator, Mary Landrieu (D), who permitted her staff on the Small Business committee to remain in the federal system. (Landrieu purchased her own insurance on the Louisiana exchange, meaning she qualified for no subsidy, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune.)\n\nAs we have written before, this is a complex subject, in part because the law was inartfully worded, and lawmakers themselves have reached different decisions. The administrative guidance from the Office of Personnel Management appeared to have left the decision up to individual lawmakers, but some, including Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who wrote one of the original amendments to put members and staff on the exchanges, say the law is clear and committee and leadership staff should remain in the FEHBP system.\n\nThis is less of a hypocritical ad than one of confusion, given that it appears to be talking about one thing (the subsidies) when in fact Cassidy is addressing the more narrow issue of whether all congressional staff went onto the exchanges.\n\nIn doing so, he tries to claim that members of Congress purposely tried to exclude staff members from Obamacare because they knew the level of care would be poor. But the legislative history of this provision shows the reasons were more prosaic\u2014 poor drafting and confusing language in the original law. But at least Cassidy kept it civil and did not try to make this a direct assault on Landrieu.", "lang": "en"}
