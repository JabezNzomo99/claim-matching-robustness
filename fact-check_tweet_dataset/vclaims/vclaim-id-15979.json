We do not sponsor individual weddings. In weddings, we provide them gifts to start their new life. We are also trying to give them some health insurance, so that when the girl gets married and enters a new home and she falls sick; she should not hear the common taunts that she has brought ill health with her and can take care of her medical expenses. There is a myth that we are fighting against by providing them health insurance and gifts to start a new life, but we do not give any cash or anything else. The girls that we help get married through mass weddings belong to very poor sector of the country. Either they sell themselves or their parents sell them off for money, if they do not get married. For their society, marriage is the only issue and because of this issue, their life is becoming hell day-by-day.\n\nSo far, we have got approximately 1700 beneficiaries married in around 10 mass marriages. Our foundation runs a self-contributed cause and we have not taken a single rupee donation from any donor or any government body.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
