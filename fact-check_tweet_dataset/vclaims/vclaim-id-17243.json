It is a crisis communication system that was - and I think still is - in a way holy. The hotline, or the fictitious \u2018Red Phone,\u2019 was never installed for routine communication.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NBC News report:\n\n\"The so-called \"Red Phone\" system is used to communicate in moments of crisis, such as the September 11, 2001 terror attacks or the U.S. invasion of Iraq. It was never a literal phone, instead beginning as teletype more than 50 years ago, then converting to first fax and then email to link the U.S. and Russia through their Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers.\n\n\"In 2013, relying on the pre-existing links with Russia through the Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers, the Obama administration added a channel intended to send email messages and attachments about cyber incidents. This Cyber CBM channel is one of a series of cyber-related confidence-building measures meant to address the need for secure and reliable lines of communication about cybersecurity issues of national concern.\"\n\nThat system was established in June 1963 for use in emergencies as stated in the Memorandum of Understanding between the United States and the then Soviet Union. The communication method came to existence during the Cuban missile crisis. It was administered by military personnel with top secret clearance.\n\nSince then the system has been modernized several times. A computer to satellite connection that transfers encrypted messages and images digitally was established in 2008.\n\nThe system has been used during time of crisis including during a conflict between India and Pakistan in 1971, the 1973 Yom Kippur war between Israel and Arab countries, the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.\n\nU.S. news reports say that the use of a crisis communication system marked the first time in his presidency that Obama communicated to Putin in this way.\n\nIt underscored the seriousness of Obama's message to Putin, researcher Nanz said.\n\n\u201cIn diplomacy, the choice of a communication medium marks a political statement that is more important than the content of the message,\u201d he said.", "lang": "en"}
