Why is it controversy wanting to know who among us happens to be a citizen and who isn\u2019t? Why is that controversial? It would seem to me that this kind of attention should have been asked when somebody in the Obama regime decided to get rid of it.\u201d \n\n\u2014 Rush Limbaugh, a conservative commentator, on Friday \u201cWhy can\u2019t we just ask the question the way it was asked for 50 years before the Obama administration yanked it out of there?\u201d\n\n\u2014 Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, on Tuesday\n\nPresident Trump on Thursday backed away from efforts to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census after insisting that he would press on despite a Supreme Court ruling that the administration had not provided an adequate reason for including the question. Throughout his fight, a number of prominent conservative voices and members of his staff have amplified an inaccurate talking point that former President Barack Obama had eliminated the question.\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, Mr. Trump\u2019s former press secretary, was among the first to give the claim a wide audience when she said in March 2018 that the question had \u201cbeen included in every census since 1965, with the exception of 2010, when it was removed.\u201d At the time, 12 states had sued the Trump administration for trying to add the question.\n\nAs courts weighed in on the case and after the Supreme Court ruled against Mr. Trump, others began to echo the claim blaming Mr. Obama, including Charlie Kirk, the founder of the pro-Trump group Turning Point USA; Chuck Woolery, the game show host; the Gateway Pundit, a pro-Trump blog; an anchor on One America News, a pro-Trump news network; a spokesman for the Trump campaign; and Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina.\n\nDespite tens thousands of retweets on social media and repetition on Fox News, these claims are inaccurate. A citizenship question has appeared in some form on different census surveys since 1820, and Mr. Obama was not responsible for its omission from the decennial census. Moreover, the Census Bureau has not stopped inquiring about citizenship.", "lang": "en"}
