The NCB is investigating the drug links in Rajput's death. The actor was found dead in his apartment on June 14, 2020 in Mumbai and the case has since been transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation.\n\nNews outlets such as the Times of India, Hindustan Times and ABP News cited tweets from an impostor account pretending to be Indrajit Chakraborty.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Hindustan Times article.\n\nThe impostor account in a series of tweets blamed the judiciary and the media for the treatment meted out to his children post the death of Sushant Singh Rajput.\n\nThe fake account is neither verified nor does it contain a disclaimer in its bio that states it is a fan account.\n\nOne such tweet by the fake account states how Indrajit Chakraborty has been shattered after the arrest and contemplated ending his life. The text of the tweet reads, \"No father can bear injustice on his daughter. I should die #JusticeForRhea.\" (Here is the archive of the tweet).\n\nAnother tweet, where the impostor account is questioning Rhea Chakraborty's trial by media was also cited in the articles. The tweet reads, \"The entire country is determined to send Rhea to the gallows despite no proof.\" (Original text in Hindi: \u092c\u0917\u0948\u0930 \u0915\u093f\u0938\u0940 \u0938\u092c\u0942\u0924 \u0915\u0947 \u092a\u0942\u0930\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0915\u094b \u092b\u093e\u0902\u0938\u0940 \u092a\u0930 \u0932\u091f\u0915\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u094b \u0924\u0941\u0932\u093e \u0939\u0948#JusticeforRhea).\n\nThe ABP news article based on tweets of the fake account is headlined as \"Rhea Chakraborty's Father Indrajit On Her Arrest: 'All This Because Her Now Dead Boyfriend Smoked Weed?\" ABP News published two articles based on the impostor account's tweets.\n\nThe second article is headlined as, \"Rhea Chakraborty's Father Indrajit Says 'I Should Die, No Father Can Bear Injustice On His Daughter\"\n\nOther websites that fell for the fake account include Sakal Times, Hindi daily Amar Ujala and entertainment website Pinkvilla.\n\n\n\nClick here for Sakal Times' archive, here for Hindustan Times archive, here for Times of India archive, here for Amar Ujala's archive, Pinkvilla's archive, here for India TV News' archive and Lokmat English's archive.
