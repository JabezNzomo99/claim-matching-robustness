Text across the top of the footage, which has been shared in multiple countries including Canada and Sri Lanka, claims the video shows Muslims in the English city of Birmingham attacking cars because they want to hold their Ramadan fast-breaking meal, iftar, in the street. The claim is false; the video actually shows football hooligans in Basel, Switzerland in May, 2018.\n\nThe footage shows a group of men, some of whom appear to be wearing Islamic thawbs, on a dark street attacking passing vehicles with sticks.\n\nGreen text across the top of the footage says: \u201cMuslims in Birmingham UK during Ramadan they want the road closed so they can break their fast eating on the road!\u201d.\n\nThe video was posted here on a Sri Lankan Facebook page on June 2, 2019 where it has been viewed more than 16,000 times, and here where it has a Sinhalese caption saying:\n\n\u201cThis is Muslim extremism in Birmingham, England...Is this racism? religionism? Don't forget that in the April 21, 2019 Easter Sunday attacks through the CIA FBI, the main target was the Sinhala community .\u201d\n\nThe caption is referring to suicide bomb attacks in Sri Lanka on April 21, 2019 which left more than 250 people dead. Here is an AFP report on the incident\n\nThe same clip has also been posted here on YouTube and here on Facebook in Canada on June 3, 2019, with a caption saying: \u201cSome Muslims in Birmingham UK wanted roads shut down for the Conclusion of Ramadan.

At least two people were injured.\u201d\n\nBelow is a side by side comparison of the 2018 Tio 20 Minuti video (L) and the same video used in the misleading Facebook post (R):\n\nThe same video was published in multiple media reports about the May 19, 2018 video, for example here, here and here.\n\nThe Basel-Stadt Criminal Commissioner Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office confirmed that there had been a clash between two groups of football fans in Basel on May 19, 2018.\n\nThe public prosecutor issued two German-language press releases about the incident at the time, which can be seen here and here.\n\nAccording to the releases, two German nationals were detained immediately after the incident, and seven other people -- six Swiss nationals and one Syrian -- were arrested in the following days.\n\nThe Chief of Media and Information at the Basel-Stadt Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Peter Gill told AFP by email that an investigation was ongoing.\n\n\u201cSince this is a pending case, we cannot provide any further information, based on the code of criminal procedure.
