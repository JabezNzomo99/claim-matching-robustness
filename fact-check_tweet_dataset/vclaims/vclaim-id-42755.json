Confronted with projections showing that the number of cases and deaths will continue to rise, Mr. Trump has mischaracterized how the models work. With states and many public health experts saying testing remains inadequate, he has countered with false and misleading comparisons to other countries. And when asked to reconcile the gap between his earlier sunny predictions of few deaths and the current situation, he has used false assertions to blame others and continued to rewrite the history of his own response.\n\nHere\u2019s an assessment of some of the president\u2019s recent claims. \u201cWe are helping other countries which are desperate for them. Likewise, after having been left little, we are now doing more testing than all other countries combined, and with superior tests.\u201d\n\n\u2014 on Twitter on Wednesday False. Mr. Trump has embellished a previously misleading talking point to a wholly untrue one. He has regularly heralded the total number of tests conducted in the United States as the highest of any single country in the world. That is technically accurate, though on a per capita basis the United States still lags others. But testing in the United States does not eclipse the rest of the world combined. The United States had conducted more than 7.7 million tests by Wednesday, according to the Covid Tracking Project. In comparison, only three countries combined \u2014 Russia, Germany and Italy \u2014 had conducted more than 9.7 million tests, according to Our World in Data and Worldometers. Combined, the 82 countries monitored by Our World in Data had conducted at least 28.1 million tests while the 183 countries measured by Worldometers performed about 33.7 million tests. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, the cupboard was bare. The other administration, the last administration, left us nothing. We didn\u2019t have ventilators. We didn\u2019t have medical equipment. We didn\u2019t have testing. The tests were broken. You saw that. We had broken tests.\u201d\n\n\u2014 in an interview with ABC News on Tuesday\n\nThe university stressed in a statement that the analyses were \u201cpreliminary\u201d and not finished, and included situations in which social-distancing measures are prematurely relaxed. Some assume the policies are either highly or moderately effective and become \u201chalf as effective going forward as current measures expire,\u201d the epidemiologist who produced the estimates said in an interview with NPR. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington also updated its forecast to estimate nearly 135,000 deaths by August. This model also accounts for social-distancing policies. \u201cOur model now assumes that mandates that are currently still in place and have not been scheduled to be relaxed will stay in place through at least August 4,\u201d the institute wrote. \u201cFor locations where distancing policies have been eased or clear plans have been instituted for their easement, we used those dates for the predictions.\u201d Bret Baier, Fox News host: \u201cYou did talk a lot about hydroxychloroquine for a while.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump: \u201cI do. And I still do.\u201d\n\nMr. Baier: \u201cAnd there were some studies that came out that questioned the cardiac tie, but you stopped talking about it.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump: \u201cOne study. One study. But there was studies that came out that say it\u2019s very good, too.\u201d\n\n\u2014 in a town-hall-style event on Fox News on Sunday This is misleading. Hundreds of studies are in the works on the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, two malaria drugs Mr. Trump has promoted for treatment of the coronavirus, but the current body of research is limited and insufficient. Many of the studies that have shown the drugs might be effective come with heavy caveats, and the Food and Drug Administration has warned that the drugs \u201ccan cause abnormal heart rhythms.\u201d A review published last week of seven completed clinical trials \u2014 five in China and two in France \u2014 found that five showed favorable outcomes for patients using chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, while two showed no change. But the review noted that all seven trials \u201ccarried varying degrees of bias and poor study design.\u201d (For example, sample sizes were too small to be reliable or the randomization of subjects was inadequate.) It concluded that the data was insufficient to support using the two antivirals as treatments. The review did not include two prominent studies, one conducted in Brazil and one performed on Veterans Affairs patients because the first was not completed and the other was not a clinical trial. The Brazilian study was halted because patients developed irregular heart rates.\n\n\u201cI closed our country to China. Nancy Pelosi was, a month later, saying, \u2018It\u2019s going to pass.\u2019 Everybody \u2014 even Tony Fauci was saying, \u2018It\u2019s going to pass, not going to be a big deal.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2014 in the Fox News event False. At the end of January, Mr. Trump barred most foreign citizens from entering the United States if they had recently visited China. A month later, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was repeatedly saying that the scale of the outbreak would depend on mitigation while Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s comments on the coronavirus were largely limited to criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s response, rather than predictions about its spread. In an interview on CBS in mid-February, Dr. Fauci defined a pandemic as transmission from person to person in multiple countries around the world and said \u201cit certainly is on the verge of that happening reasonably soon, unless containment is more successful than it is right now.\u201d Two weeks later, Dr. Fauci appeared on the \u201cToday\u201d show, where he was asked whether Americans needed to change their habits. \u201cNo. Right now, at this moment, there\u2019s no need to change anything that you\u2019re doing on a day-by-day basis. Right now the risk is still low, but this could change,\u201d he responded. \u201cThis could be a major outbreak. I hope not. Or it could be something that\u2019s reasonably well controlled.\u201d Later that day, Dr. Fauci said at a White House briefing that the risk of contracting the virus was \u201clow\u201d across the country, but he added, \u201cWhen we say that, we want to underscore that this is an evolving situation.\u201d Ms. Pelosi addressed the outbreak at a news conference in late February and called the Trump administration\u2019s response \u201copaque and often chaotic.\u201d She also spoke about an earlier visit to San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown and said, \u201cWe want to be fully prepared but not panicking or fearful of what\u2019s happening.\u201d She did not comment on the trajectory of the disease.", "lang": "en"}
