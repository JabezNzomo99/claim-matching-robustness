The only election should be for President,\u201d the bogus statement, shared again on Facebook this week, reads.\n\nOf course, the founders didn\u2019t intend for the president to select \u201cGovernors, Senators and Congressmen.\u201d And there\u2019s no support for the assertion that Trump ever said that.\n\nThe remark attributed to Eric Trump \u2014 executive vice president of the Trump Organization \u2014 further purports that the quotation was made on Fox News on Nov. 5, 2018.\n\nTrump did indeed appear on Fox News Business that day to talk about the 2018 midterm elections and tout his father\u2019s record as president. The following day, he joined the hosts of \u201cFox & Friends\u201d and made another push for Republicans to vote.\n\nBut in neither of those interviews did Trump make the statement attributed to him.\n\nThe meme appears to have been first published by a Facebook group called \u201cStop the World, the Deplorables Want Off.\u201d That page describes itself as \u201ca mixture of political memes & messages\u201d that makes \u201ca lot of parody posts & those are NOT meant to be taken seriously.\u201d\n\nWe previously wrote about a quotation falsely attributed to Eric Trump\u2019s older brother \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. \u2014 that also originated on that page.\n\nWhen that group posted the meme about Eric Trump in November, the image included a watermark with the URL to the group\u2019s Facebook page. But the version of the meme posted June 3 by a different Facebook group does not include the watermark indicating the remark was shared by a page that purports to publish \u201cparody posts.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
