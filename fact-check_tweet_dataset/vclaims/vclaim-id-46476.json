It becomes highly poisonous for even a single night and creates toxic bacteria which may cause adverse stomach infections due to excess bile secretions and even food poisoning.\u201d\n\nhas debunked the claim as \u201cfalse\u201d. In a\n\non its website, it says onions are not poisonous when handled properly and can be stored in the fridge in a sealed container for up to seven days after being cut.\n\n\u201cWhen cut, onions release compounds that do not promote pathogen growth,\u201d it says.\n\n\u201cJuice released from cut onions is known to kill or inhibit the growth of many different types of microorganisms, including some of those capable of causing food poisoning in humans.\u201d\n\nAnd onions are good for you\n\n, the director of the\n\nat McGill University, onions are not especially prone to bacterial contamination. It\u2019s actually the opposite.\n\nCutting an onion releases enzymes, starting a chemical reaction that produces sulphuric acid (the cause of \u201conion tears\u201d). Sulphuric acid slows the growth of bacteria.\n\nThe claim that onions are \"bacterial magnets\" makes little sense because \u201cno food attracts bacteria\u201d, says\n\nut some foods are more likely to support bacteria or viral contamination once they\u2019re infected.\n\nCutting boards and dirty hands are also possible sources of bacteria on onions.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason to suggest that onions are in any way more risky than other foods and avoiding onions is not only unnecessary but unhealthy.\u201d\n\nOnions have several health benefits. They stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria that \u201csuppress the growth of potentially harmful bacteria in the colon\u201d, Schwarcz says.\n\nhas also rated the meme as f\n\nalse. \u201cThe claim that onions are \u2018magnets\u2019 for bacteria has no scientific validity,\u201d it says.\n\nLeftover raw onions are no more unsafe than any other food, if they are correctly handled and stored, according to Hoax-Slayer. \u201cThe claims in the message have no factual basis and passing on this pointless piece of misinformation will not help anyone.\u201d\n\nare \u201cgood to use, especially because they are high in vitamin C\u201d and \u201ca good source of fibre and other important nutrients\u201d.\n\nSafely handled onions are are healthy to eat, even if you cut them the night before. \u2013", "lang": "en"}
