Defense officials said the Pentagon hasn\u2019t received new orders to build a wall. U.S. troops are scheduled to be at ports of entry along the Mexican border in California, Mexico and Arizona until Jan. 31. The president can order troops to build a wall, but where the funding for that would come from is unclear, defense officials said. And lawyers would likely review such an order beforehand, in part, to assess land ownership issues. The Defense Department has paid for materials and troops used during what was dubbed Operation Faithful Patriot.\n\n\u201cA lot of the people that wanted to come into the country \u2014 and really, they wanted to come in, no matter how they wanted to come in \u2014 they were going to come in. ... Many of these people are leaving now, and they\u2019re going back to their countries: Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and other countries. They\u2019re leaving. If you noticed, it\u2019s getting a lot less crowded in Mexico. And a lot of them are going to stay in Mexico, and the Mexican government has been working with us very well. So we appreciate that. But they haven\u2019t been coming into our country.\u201d (Trump remarks)\n\n\u201cWe need border security. People are pouring into our country, including terrorists. We have terrorists. But we caught 10 terrorists. These are over the last very short period of time \u2014 10. These are very serious people. All of our law enforcement have been incredible, but we caught 10 terrorists, these are people that were looking to do harm. We need the wall. We need \u2014 more important than anything, we need border security of which the wall is just a piece, but it\u2019s important.\u201d (Trump remarks)", "lang": "en"}
