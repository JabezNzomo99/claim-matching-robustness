Let\u2019s verify each of these claims. The following claims were made in the infographic;\n\u2022 India is now the third largest aviation market\n\u2022 Passenger traffic growth is in the range of 18-20% over the past three years\n\u2022 More people have travelled in airplanes than in AC trains for the first time\n\nClaim 1: India is now the third largest aviation market\n\n The \u201clargest aviation market\u201d is defined as largest traffic to, from and within a country as per the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the premier trade association of the world\u2019s airlines.\n\nAccording to CAPA \u2013 Centre for Aviation, as of April 2018, the top 5 largest domestic aviation markets are United States, China, India, Japan and Indonesia. Although India is the world\u2019s third largest domestic aviation market, it is not the third largest aviation market. According to IATA, India is projected to be in the top 3 largest aviation markets surpassing UK by 2025.\n\nClaim 2: Passenger traffic growth is in the range of 18-20% over the past three years\n\n As per domestic traffic reports from 2014 to 2018, released by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), a table with the number of passengers carried during that period by domestic airlines has been compiled. The numbers are cumulative and so the value for the month of March is the number of people who have flown domestically between January and March of that year. All figures are in lakhs.\n\nThe annual passenger traffic growth has been calculated by using the domestic passengers\u2019 data for each calendar year. This shows the percentage increase in passenger traffic from one year to the next at the end of the year. We find that for the past three years, passenger air traffic has been growing at an average of 20% and is in the range of 17-23%.\n\nClaim 3: More people have travelled in airplanes than in AC trains for the first time\n\n To verify the claim about the number of people travelling by air being greater than those travelling by AC train, the passenger data provided in the annual reports of the DGCA were compared with data provided in the statistical statements of the Indian Railways. The Indian Railways publishes an annual document titled \u2018Statistical Statements\u2019 that gives a breakup of the number of passengers that were carried in that year by the class in which they travelled. This data was aggregated to find the number of people who travelled by AC class in trains between 2012-13 and 2016-17. Total passenger traffic of the AC class is calculated by including the traffic in AC First Class, AC Sleeper Class, AC 3 Tier & AC Chair Car. Total passenger traffic of Airlines is calculated by including both domestic & international passenger traffic.\n\nClaim 4: Domestic air passengers crossed 100 million in 2017\n\n As noted earlier, the data from DGCA indicates that, in 2017, the number of passengers carried by domestic airlines was 1171.76 lakhs, or over 117 million.\n\nClaim 5: A National Civil Aviation Policy was unveiled in 2016 to transform the sector\n\n In 2016, the National Civil Aviation Policy was unveiled, which aimed to expand the aviation sector and reduce the cost of air travel in order to make it more popular. It outlines specific goals such as to enable 30 crore domestic ticketing by 2022 and 50 crore by 2027. Though the previous UPA government did not have an exclusive civil aviation policy, the civil aviation targets were part of the 12th Five Year plan documents.", "lang": "en"}
