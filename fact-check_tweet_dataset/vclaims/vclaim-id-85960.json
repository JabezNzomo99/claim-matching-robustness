He explained he was having trouble signing up for the Washington exchange, and eventually discovered it would cost an additional $6,000 to add his son to his policy. (Note: as far as we can tell, no individual policy in the DC SHOP exchange, which is used by members of Congress, for someone as young as Paul\u2019s son costs $500 a month, even at Platinum plan rates.)\n\nPaul then said his son could not be signed up online and had to go to the \u201cwelfare office\u201d to present his ID to \u201cprove his existence.\u201d According to Paul, \u201cSo he got there. He didn\u2019t sign up for anything. And two days later, he got his Medicaid card. So he\u2019s got Medicaid.\u201d\n\nInstead, you must fill out income and family information, and then the system will decide whether or not you can purchase a health plan but qualify for a subsidy, or whether you qualify for Medicaid. \u201cNo one is automatically enrolled in Medicaid unless they apply for it,\u201d she said, adding that she could not comment specifically on individual applications.\n\nUpdate, Jan. 10: Here\u2019s the opening screen shot. This is the first thing an applicant sees after creating an account on the exchange; it\u2019s clear that you can purchase a plan without payment assistance if you like. There is no \u201cQHP\u201d button. \u201cWe tried to keep the language very simple and clear throughout,\u201d Bond said. \u201cEverything is written at a sixth grade reading level, if possible.\u201d The full process after this screen is embedded below.\n\n3. There is another wrinkle. As a full-time student, Paul\u2019s son is eligible to get insurance through the University of Kentucky, which has an excellent medical center. UK students already pay a mandatory health fee that covers most university services, but the university recommends insurance for procedures not covered by the fee. UnitedHealth Plan charges about $1,900 for an annual plan, or about $150 a month. So why didn\u2019t Paul\u2019s son take that route?\n\nUpdate, Jan. 10: Kynect provided a series of screen shots that take you through the process. If the option to not seek payment assistance is made on the first screen, then most of the remaining information (especially related to income, etc.) would not be required, because no application would be made to determine eligibility for subsidies or Medicaid. The system is designed to only take applicants through the steps they need to go through based on the initial selection or their answers as they progress through the application.\n\nUpdate, Jan. 16: After waiting almost a week for a response to these screen grabs, The Fact Checker received the following statement from Darling: \u201cRegardless of which option Sen. Paul might have selected on the screenshot in question, individuals should have to affirmatively select a Medicaid plan in order to be enrolled in that plan, which Sen. Paul did not do. The process is very confusing, yet they never selected a Medicaid plan.\u201d\n\nNot to be argumentative, but the screen shots show that a) the applicant can go directly to the exchange if he or she clicks a clearly marked button that a person knows he or she does not qualify for subsidies (that\u2019s the second choice) and b) if Paul wanted to see all of the options (first choice) and if he had correctly filled in his salary, it would have said he was not eligible. So there would have been no option to select Medicaid unless information was incorrectly entered.\n\nIt is certainly a conundrum that what Paul says happened \u2014 automatic enrollment into Medicaid without filling out income information \u2014 is something that Kynect says is not supposed to happen. Obviously, there could be a software glitch \u2014 but at the same time Paul\u2019s son supposedly did not take the key steps needed to enroll, so it\u2019s unclear how the glitch could happen in the first place.\n\nThat may appear to some readers to be a bit generous but apparently Paul\u2019s son did end up with a Medicaid card. (Paul\u2019s office, however, said it could not provide an image of it.) The available evidence suggests this happened because of an error on the part of either Paul or his son, but there are enough uncertainties that a definitive conclusion cannot be reached. Paul earns the Pinocchios because the process he described on television does not match up with the Kynect screen shots.", "lang": "en"}
