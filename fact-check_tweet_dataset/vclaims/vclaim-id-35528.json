In October 2019, the video went viral again when it was shared on Twitter along with the claim: \u201cAround 300 hundred kids found frozen alive for the purposes of selling organs for transplantation.\u201d\n\nVIEWER WARNING: The video at the center of this rumor contains images of a dead child and may not be suitable for all viewers.\n\nThis video (posted below) has also been shared with other claims about this child. When it first went viral in 2017, it was attached to a rumor holding that the boy climbed into the cooler while his parents were packing vegetables in ice. The boy\u2019s parents didn\u2019t notice, closed the lid, and the boy froze to death.\n\nHere\u2019s the video. Again, this may not suitable for all viewers:\n\nThis video does not show one of nearly 300 children who was found frozen alive for the purposes of organ harvesting, nor does it show a child who died climbing into a cooler unbeknownst to his parents.\n\nThe portion of the video showing the child covered in ice was taken in the Guangdong province of China in the summer of 2017. Police looked into this video after it started circulating attached to rumors concerning criminal behavior. They found that the boy had accidentally drowned and that the family packed his body in ice, due to the high temperatures of summer, in order to transport him back home for burial.\n\nA Weibo message posted by the Public Security Bureau of Yiyang City, Hunan province explained (translated via Google and edited for clarity):\n\nThis video shows a family grieving over a little boy who accidentally drowned. It does not show criminal activity related to organ harvesting.\n\nIt should also be noted that the viral video shown above contains a few jarring edits. The first 15 seconds, in fact, which show people gathered near a body of water and then two people on the ground getting beat up, appears to come from an entirely separate incident. Zhejiang Online reported in 2017 that the first portion of this video actually shows an unrelated incident in the town of Shaojiaqiaozhen in the Chinese province Guizhou in which two men were beat up in December 2017 after being accused of attempting to defraud elderly people:\n\nThe fact that this video features footage from at least two different incidents and has been shared with a variety of unfounded rumors should immediately raise some red flags for viewers. The claim that this video shows a child who was frozen alive for the purposes of harvesting organs is unsubstantiated and appears to have been made up out of whole cloth.\n\nThe portion of the video showing a child covered in ice in a small box actually shows a family grieving as they prepared this child for burial after he accidentally drowned.", "lang": "en"}
