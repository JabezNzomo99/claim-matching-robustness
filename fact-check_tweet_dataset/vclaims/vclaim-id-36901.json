There can be several volcanic eruptions around the world on any given day.\n\nAccording to Mariton Bornas, Head of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) Volcano Monitoring and Eruption Prediction Division, posts like these are \"alarmist\" but should not be cause for panic.\n\n\"Yes [it's normal], on any given day, there are several volcanic eruptions around the world. On some days, maybe there are none or there was just unrest that didn't proceed to eruption, but there can be days wherein several volcanoes around the world erupt at the same time, this is not uncommon,\" she said in a mix of English and Filipino.\n\nAlso, Oregon State University's Volcano World website says that there has not been an increase in volcanic activity in the past few decades. It may only seem like there was an increase because of increased populations in once remote areas and improved technology for monitoring and communicating the volcanic activity. \u2013 Vernise L Tantuco/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
