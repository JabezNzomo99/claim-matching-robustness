For example, an altered photograph of former U.S. Senator Robert Byrd wearing a Ku Klux Klan robe has been widely circulated on social media in an attempt to link Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to the white supremacist group. While Byrd did join the KKK in his twenties (and spent much of his later life publicly atoning for his early choices), the altered image shows him wearing the robe much later in his life.", "lang": "en"}
