The book is in fact not a religious book but a work by the US artist Catherine McEver. She explained on her blog in 2014 how she created this particular work by using a cleaning product to grow crystals on a dictionary.\n\nPosts claiming the book was a Bible or Koran found underwater hail the supposed discovery as miraculous.\n\nOne Facebook post, which we\u2019ve archived here, has been shared more than 4,000 times since it was published in November 2018.\n\nAnother post on Group Kenya, a public group that has more than two million members, similarly claimed the book was an \u201cancient bible\u201d found at the bottom of the ocean. Like the first post, it encouraged people to share the image.\n\nOther online posts, like this 2017 tweet which has been shared more than 15,000 times, identified the book as a Koran.\n\nBut a reverse image search on Google shows that the book is neither a Bible nor a Koran -- and nor was it found underwater.\n\nThe search located the photo on Stuff You Can\u2019t Have, a blog run by the US artist Catherine McEver.\n\nIn a post on May 18, 2014 -- before any of the posts identifying the book as a Bible or Koran -- McEver described how she created the work by using the cleaning product Borax to grow crystals onto a book.\n\nAccording to a caption on the blog post, the book is actually a German-English dictionary.\n\nThe post also includes photos of the book from other angles.\n\nMcEver told AFP that she made the crystallised book in 2014 and that the artwork has no religious meaning.\n\n\u201cThe book is not a Bible. It is a used, leather-bound German-English dictionary that I bought at a thrift store. I think it is funny that someone is trying to pass on image of my book off as a Bible or some religious miracle,\u201d she told AFP via email.", "lang": "en"}
