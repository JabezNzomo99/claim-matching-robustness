A recent claim circulating on the Internet says she does.\n\nA reader recently sent us a November that says welfare recipients will be eligible for a free vehicle and receive a monthly $100 gas card beginning Jan. 15 under new legislation proposed by President Barack Obama. The article said:\n\n\"Recently, the White House announced a plan to offer free vehicles to welfare recipients. According to reports, the bill passed in a narrow vote. The program was initiated by President Barack Obama, and in many way mirrors what has become known as \u2018The Obama Phone\u2019, or the program through which welfare recipients can get free cell phone service.\n\n\"John Earnest announced the program launch, stating \u2018The free automobile program gives low-income Americans the opportunity to take ownership of a vehicle at no cost, and will also include a monthly gas card for $100.\u2019\n\n\"Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that this passing will be the downfall of President Obama.\n\n\" \u2018This absurd plan that the democrats have conjured up is beyond belief. I have no idea how or why congress passed this,\u2019 McConnell stated.\"\n\nThe story earned more than 80,000 Facebook likes by Nov. 17, but here\u2019s the deal: It's not accurate. There was no such bill proposed by the Obama administration, and Congress did not pass any such measure. The White House spokesman is Josh Earnest, not John Earnest. (The premise is also kind of amusing -- Congress hasn\u2019t been in the habit of passing Obama initiatives for some time now, whether by a \"narrow\" margin or not.)\n\nRather, the claim originated at an acknowledged fake-news site.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s dispense with the old claim about \"Obama phones.\" This claim is, at best, greatly exaggerated. We\u2019ve checked various versions and found that their accuracy rated from to to .\n\nAs for the idea that the federal government has established a welfare program involving no-cost gas cards and cars for low-income Americans -- well, this is pure fiction.\n\nThe was originally posted on Empire News in August.

Some of the site\u2019s other posts have headlines like \"New Hollywood Trend Has Celebrities Getting Baby Pig Semen Injections To Look Younger\" and \"Kanye West Insists On Nobel Prize, Claims He \u2018Brings Peace\u2019 Everywhere He Goes.\" The fact checkers at busted the claim earlier this fall.\n\nThe article then made its way to American News, a site that received a last week for a that \"death panels\" under the Affordable Care Act had recently executed their first patient.\n\nAmerican News offers a mixture of ads and has no information about the site or who runs it. But it includes many fake, yet often nominally believable, articles ripped from other sources that attract clicks from social media users and, presumably, Web revenue for American News.\n\nFootnote: Although Obama has not proposed a federal program that offers welfare recipients a car and monthly gas cards for free, his 2012 opponent -- former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican -- actually implemented one.
