Several 911 calls directed police to the 800 block of Woodland Avenue on Wednesday morning. Upon arriving at the scene, police knocked on the door to be greeted by a man who seemed \u201cunder the influence of drugs.\u201d Upon further investigation, they found a dozen frozen bodies within 6 freezers in the man\u2019s garage. The bodies had several things in common \u2013 they were all white women in their mid-20s, blonde hair and all had the writings marked on them which read \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cBLM.\u201d Mathis, who was known for his involvement in the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d movement was arrested without incident and booked into the county jail on no bond. They are not releasing the names of the victims until the families are notified. Mathis tested positive for being under the influence of bath salts, which he says caused him to commit these horrible crimes.\n\nNothing about this story was true. It originated solely with Now8News, a fake news site that traffics in fabricated, sensationalized stories and clickbait headlines. On 18 February 2016, this story was copied by Empire Herald, another fake news site, (where the number of putatively discovered bodies was increased from a dozen to 19).\n\nNow8News used old photographs that had nothing to do with their fake story to illustrate their article. Empire Herald also used photographs from older, unrelated news stories in their version.
