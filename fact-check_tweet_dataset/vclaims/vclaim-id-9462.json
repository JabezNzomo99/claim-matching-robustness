It\u2019s a complicated project that will affect 7 million people and there have been many difficulties. It is now five years behind schedule.\n\nCitizens Advice called for a pause in the universal credit roll out in July, and this has since been reiterated.\n\nThe Trussell Trust also called for a pause in September.\n\nJohn Major wrote a piece in the Mail on Sunday on 7th October, suggesting that the Conservative Party review Universal Credit:\n\n\u201cAnd we must demonstrate a clear priority for the interests of the \u2018have-nots\u2019. I hope such a programme will include a review of universal credit, which, although theoretically impeccable, is operationally messy, socially unfair and unforgiving. It is time for the Conservative Party to show its heart again, which is all too often concealed by its financial prudence. We are not living in normal times and must challenge innate Conservative caution.\u201d\n\nConcerns from a dozen Conservative back benchers were raised in a leaked private letter to David Gauke at the end of September, reportedly calling for the rollout to be slowed.\n\nAccording to the Telegraph this was led by Heidi Allen and signed by \u2018around a dozen\u2019 other MPs. The letter has not been made publically available. On the 8th October, the Telegraph reported that that the number of opponents had risen to 25. We have asked Ms Allen\u2019s office to confirm.", "lang": "en"}
