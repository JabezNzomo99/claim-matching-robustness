The black line is the Earth\u2019s recorded temperature since 1880.\n\nThis is not to say natural factors don\u2019t affect the climate. They do. But Perry is wrong to call them the main cause of the earth\u2019s rising temperature.\n\nWhen you look at how natural causes (orbital and solar changes plus volcanic activity) have contributed to climate change, it\u2019s clear the impact is less than that of human factors.\n\nPerry is also wrong to say ocean waters are responsible for the uptick in temperature.\n\nWhile oceans are a vital part of the climate system, and variations in their circulation can affect local climates in important ways, they don\u2019t account for global warming, said Gavin Schmidt, climatologist and director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.\n\n\"We have concluded close to all of the recent trends in global temperature is due to human activity, and CO2 is the dominant factor,\" Schmidt said, referring to carbon dioxide.\n\nPerry misidentified climate change\u2019s main \"control knob,\" but he\u2019s not the first Trump administration department head to fudge the facts on our warming planet.\n\nWe previously issued a False rating to Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt\u2019s claim that carbon dioxide is not \"a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.\"\n\nIn fact, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that collects in the earth\u2019s atmosphere and traps excess heat. It has functioned like a \"primary control knob\" that\u2019s been dialed up dramatically since humans began releasing significantly more amounts of CO2 into the air, mostly by burning fossil fuels, at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.\n\n\"A reasonable analogy can be drawn between the way that atmospheric CO2 controls the global temperature of the Earth, and how your house thermostat controls the temperature of your house,\" said Andrew Lacis, a climatologist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.\n\nThe NASA graph below shows the influence of greenhouse gas emissions, including a 40 percent increase in atmospheric CO2 since 1750 (green line), on the Earth\u2019s temperature (black line).\n\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry said, \"Most likely the primary control knob (for the earth\u2019s temperature) is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.\"\n\nPerry\u2019s claim contradicts settled science. While natural factors certainly affect the climate, human factors are the main contributor to global warming, and carbon dioxide has acted as the \"primary control knob\" governing the earth\u2019s relatively recent uptick in temperature.", "lang": "en"}
