It also appeared on Facebook. Older examples of the false claim on Facebook and YouTube date back to January.\n\nThe unedited footage is available on C-SPAN (2:52:00).\n\nThe Twitter user who shared it this week later posted a video saying he was unaware the Biden video had been altered and said he got the video from the Jimmy Dore Show, an online video series by comedian and political commentator Jimmy Dore.\n\nThe edited version of the video did appear in a July 15 video posted by Dore with the erroneous claim that the singer was wearing \u201cblack face.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe least problematic thing Joe Biden has coming at him is when he hosted a black face affair with a bunch of rich white people,\u201d Dore told his viewers before showing the altered clip.\n\nWe reached out to Dore about but didn\u2019t hear back. Dore\u2019s video had received more than 100,000 views as of July 16; it has since been removed from YouTube.\n\nAs for the actual video, Powell, the singer, told the Washington Examiner in January that Biden\u2019s comment was \u201ca mistake on his side\u201d because he was not inspired by or similar musically to Jackson.\n\nBut the Examiner reported that Powell said \u201che was not offended and did not feel Biden was racially insensitive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a very sensitive person, so my sensitivity would have kicked in when a statement like that was made. It didn\u2019t. I would have commented or responded to it,\u201d Powell told the Examiner.\n\nPowell also said he was a Democrat and that while he was uncommitted ahead of the Democratic presidential primaries, \u201cI guess I would support\u201d Biden.\n\nWe contacted Powell but didn\u2019t receive a response. The Biden campaign declined to comment.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
