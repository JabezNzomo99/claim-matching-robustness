No, that's not true: the story was made up years ago by a site that invents articles about bizarre crimes and sex acts but occasionally also about politically charged topics for entertainment purposes. It is not real and the story did not actually happen.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report somewhere in April 2016 titled \"Texas: Blind man files for divorce after learning his wife is black\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nAustin, Tx | A blind man filed for divorce this morning at the Travis County Courthouse, claiming that his wife hid from him for 32-years, the fact that she was African American. \n\n59-year old John Paul Davis accused his wife, 56-year old Latoyah Johnson, of taking advantage of his handicap to \"dishonestly and fraudulently make him believe that she was Caucasian\". He claims that she knew that he would never have accepted to marry her if he \"had known that she was black\", and consciously hid her origins from him for more than three decades.\n\nOver the years several other sites had copied the story, omitting the disclaimers at the bottom of the page.

The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Black Student Adopted By White Parents Did NOT Quit Harvard To Denounce Own White Privilege\n\u2022 Fake News: RuPaul Did NOT Claim Trump Touched Him Inappropriately In The 1990s\n\u2022 Fake News: Two CIA Agents NOT Arrested by Minutemen while Crossing Mexican Border with 1300 Pounds of Cocaine\n\u2022 Fake News: Retirement Home NOT Raided By The FBI For Running Elderly Fight Club, NO 7 Arrests\n\u2022 Fake News: New Zealand Farmer NOT Arrested For Selling Sheep As Sex Slaves To ISIS", "lang": "en"}
