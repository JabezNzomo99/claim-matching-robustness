Dasia Patterson's husband, Austin Smith, was soon arrested for the killings. Here is how a local television station initially reported it:\n\nThe same report gave details from the police report, in which the suspected killer explained his murderous motives:\n\nSmith later told police he confronted his wife after she arrived home from a local bar. According to the police report, she denied the affair, but Smith shot her anyway \"because he believed God told him to do so.\" The police report states that Smith shot his 5-year-old daughter because she had \"exhibited bad behavior he deemed against God's laws.\" Police say Smith's 7-year-old daughter was crying over what happened, and Smith \"believed you should not weep for the wicked, so he punched her in the face several times with a closed fist\" and then eventually hit her in the head multiple times with a baseball bat.\n\nPhoenix Police Sgt. Tommy Thompson, the lead spokesman on this case, told Lead Stories that detectives did not say what religion Smith followed, but he was told it was not Islam. There is no mention in the police report of \"Allah,\" only \"God.\"\n\nLocal FOX reporter Danielle Miller posted a tweet on April 12, 2019 that a man who claimed to be Smith's cousin told her he was Muslim, but she did not report it on air. Miller told Lead Stories that the man refused to give his name, but she did tell police about his comment. This was not reported publicly and the source is unconfirmed.\n\nNone of the other reporting includes any details suggesting that Smith is Muslim. If he is a Christian, Smith had his Old Testiment teaching backward. Rev. Michael Reeves, with Georgia's Open Range Cowboy Church Ministries and a longtime Bible scholar told Lead Stories that \"We are told in scriptures to weep for the wicked.\" Rev. Reeves referenced Jeremiah 9:1, in which Jeremiah wept over the wicked in Jerusalem.", "lang": "en"}
