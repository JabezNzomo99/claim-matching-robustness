The organisers claimed that 1 million people marched, and that figure was repeated by a number of news outlets. We\u2019ve been asked by readers to check this claim.\n\nThe reality is that it\u2019s hard to precisely measure crowd sizes at non-ticketed events. That said, experts in crowd estimation have said the crowd on Saturday was less than half the size estimated by its organisers.\n\nTalking to Wired magazine, Manchester Metropolitan University\u2019s Professor Keith Still, said \u201cbased on the visuals from the helicopter image, it\u2019s between 312,000 and 400,000 people.\u201d\n\nThis type of crowd estimation, called the Jacobs method, is done by dividing a crowd site area into sections, measuring the size of each section and then multiplying each area by the estimated density of people within that subsection.\n\nHow did the People\u2019s Vote estimate 1 million?\n\nThe People\u2019s Vote said they estimated the size of the crowd using information from staff and volunteers as well as examining aerial pictures from helicopters.\n\nThey said that \u201cpeak crowd densities were estimated at 4.5 people per square metre\u201d. (For context: Professor Still says the average crowd has between two and four people standing per square metre, and anything more than four people per square metre becomes too uncomfortable to move).\n\nBut even if this density of 4.5 people per square metre (visualised below) had been observed across the whole march site of roughly 160,000 square metres, that would only account for 700,000 people. \n\n\n\nHelicopter footage shows there were areas where the crowd was much less dense than 4.5 people per square metre.\n\nWe also wrote about this issue in October last year, regarding a previous People\u2019s Vote march, when we also believed the march organisers had likely overestimated attendance.\n\nIn addition to the organisers\u2019 estimate, there were rumours circulating on social media that claimed the Metropolitan Police had estimated that 2 million people attended the march on Saturday.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police told us: \u201cWe do not confirm crowd figures for marches or protests.\n\n\u201cThis is a matter for the event organisers.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
