The Prime Minister\u2019s twitter handle following an abusive troll? Those who have been around on twitter long enough will know that this is not the first time that this issue is being highlighted. The outrage builds up every few months yet the twitter handle of Mr. Modi continues to follow many serial abusers and rumor-mongers.\n\nAs of date Mr Modi has 33.8 million followers and he follows 1779 people. Of the ones he follows, many are government handles, ministers, Heads of States, senior journalists and other such profiles you would expect the Prime Minister of a country to follow. However, a handful of the 1779 are profiles that will make you squirm. Serial abusers, rumor-mongers, misogynists, handles brimming with communal venom\u2026 you will find them all there.\n\nLet us take a look at some of these tweets of the people the Prime Minister of our country has handpicked to follow. Please bear with us, the list is long. It is a hall of shame.\n\nFor all that the \u201cproud\u201d nationalists may say about \u201csanskar\u201d and rich traditions, when we review the handles followed by the Prime Minister, sexist tweets directed at women stands out as a prominent feature. The attack is always personal and the targets are often journalists who are seen as critical of the government like Barkha Dutt, Rana Ayyub and Sagarika Ghose.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\nHere are some lewd jokes of Samir Varier, yet another person followed by Mr. Modi.\n\nThe abuse is often unprovoked. In this case, it is not sexist but this gentleman, whom Mr. Modi follows, doesn\u2019t think twice before calling Rana Ayyub a terrorist and suicide bomber because she said her flight was running late.\n\nMahaveer who is also followed by Mr. Modi posted this picture of journalist Neha Dixit and her husband Nakul Sawhney asking whether payment was made in \u201ccash or kind\u201d.\n\nSonia Gandhi is also often a target of hateful misogynistic tweets\n\nThis is an old tweet of Alok Bhat, dating before 2014. Mr. Modi chooses to follow him as well.\n\nFormer Vice President Hamid Ansari was following the flag code when he was called an \u201casshole\u201d and a \u201cbastard\u201d by Rahul Kaushik.\n\nHere is Nikunj Sahu of BJP IT cell abusing Arvind Kejriwal\n\nHere is another example of a twitter handle that is humbled to be followed by Narendra Modi\n\nIt is not just politicians of rival parties who are target of abuse but other twitter users as well. Here are a few examples:\n\nWhen Mahaveer\u2019s account was deactivated for abuse by twitter, it was BJP\u2019s Giriraj Singh who stood by him to get his account reactivated.\n\nAmitesh Singh who projected himself as a BJP youth leader and claimed to be related to a BJP politician was followed by PM Modi. He tweeted a call to \u201ckill 3000 Muslims\u201d in response to a rumor that was doing rounds on the internet. What followed was his arrest and a denial from BJP that he was associated with them. If he was not associated with BJP, why did Mr. Modi follow this 19 year-old? That is a question we never got an answer to.\n\nThe rumor which led Amitesh to tweet the threat was started by a handle that was also followed by Mr. Modi. The handle has been suspended by Twitter.\n\nWho spread the rumor of doctor lynched by a Muslim mob? Handles followed by Mr. Modi. Every tweet in the picture below is from people followed by Mr. Modi.\n\nThe rumor that the murder of Swati in Chennai was started by Ramki. His claims were later proven to be fake but there was no retraction or apology.\n\nThis handle followed by Mr. Modi called for a boycott of Muslim businesses.\n\nIn this case UP government had to tweet to bust the communal rumor being spread by Ritu Rathaur, another profile followed by Mr. Modi. The police filed a case against her for \u201cattempting to disturb communal harmony by spreading sensational and controversial posts on social media\u201d.\n\nEven funerals are not spared when it comes to spreading fake news. No national flag for MP E Ahamed\u2019s funeral, asked Kiran Kumar. A screenshot of TV footage said otherwisehttps://t.co/jKlNRbU0aC .\n\nHere is another rumor spread by Rishi Bagree\n\nIn this case an attempt to malign a UAE based business was led by Mahesh Vikram Hegde, one of the select few followed by the PM. The company filed a police case and the pictures were found to be photoshopped. Hegde is the founder of postcard news, a website that routinely spreads fake news.\n\nMeena Das Narayan raised the \u2018Hindus under attack\u2019 alarm after the Kollam temple fire. She knew \u201cfor sure\u201d. The fire was caused by pyrotechnics display that was held despite a ban on the same.\n\nSo why does the Prime Minister of India follow such people? Is it possible that his social media team is behind this and Mr. Modi is not really aware that his handle follows such profiles? In response to a RTI, PMO confirmed that \u201cPM Modi himself tweets and posts content on his personal Twitter and Facebook accounts\u201d. Mr. Modi is social media savvy and we have no reason to doubt the response of the PMO (:-P).\n\nThe other possible reason could be that these are like-minded individuals who are part of his core supporter group. He has personally met many of these individuals in specially organized events. All of them flaunt the selfie with him, stating, \u201cproud to be followed by Narendra Modi\u201d. This also makes it very difficult for him to unfollow them. A tweet by RS Prasad condemning the celebratory tweets on the murder of Gauri Lankesh had upset some of them. Imagine the backlash from his supporters if PM Modi was ever to un-follow any of them. They are already running a hashtag #IStandwithNikhil in support of the person who called Gauri Lankesh a \u2018kutiya\u201d.\n\nIt is not that Mr. Modi has never un-followed anyone. After a massive outrage in 2014, he unfollowed a handle that had tweeted a morphed photograph of Gul Panag.\n\nMore recently he un-followed Jwala Gurunath after she had a spat with BJP Delhi spokesperson Tajinder Bagga.\n\n\u201cHow can Narendra Modi be responsible for the tweets of people he follows?\u201d ask many of his supporters. None of us are responsible for the tweets of our followers. But hey, he is the Prime Minister of the country and he has handpicked this select group to follow. Moreover, this issue has been reported many times, tons of people have raised it on social media and there is no way PM Modi is not aware of this issue.\n\n\u201cWho are you to tell the Prime Minister who to follow?\u201d ask his supporters. Sure, it is his choice. He is free to follow anyone he likes, be they serial abusers tweeting lewd and sexist tweets, or rumor mongers and riot instigators. Including the person who described Gauri Lankesh\u2019s murder as \u201cA bitch died a dog\u2019s death\u201d. And the world shall know that this is his choice.\n\nScreenshots from the collection of @TruthofGujarat, @kapsology and @samjawed65 on Twitter", "lang": "en"}
