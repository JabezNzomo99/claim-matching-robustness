Remember the days of \u201cChuck and Nancy\u201d? Back in September, the two Democrats said the president had agreed to an outline of an immigration plan that did not include the border wall. That fell apart just over a month later when the White House outlined its very conservative priorities for a DACA deal.\n\nThis is a longtime favorite claim of the president\u2019s, but it hasn\u2019t gotten more accurate since the last time we looked into it. Most drugs do come into the United States across the southern border with Mexico. But a wall would not limit this illegal trade. The six main drug cartels use increasingly sophisticated methods to move product across the border, as much of it travels through legal borders \u2014 disguised as innocuous liquids or alongside other cargo \u2014 or under tunnels unaffected by any possible physical barrier.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement can issue a request to be notified when a \u201ccriminal alien\u201d is being released by state or local law enforcement so that they can take custody of the person in question while their immigration status is determined. But state and local law enforcement are under no legal obligation to tell ICE when someone is released and sometimes choose not to alert federal authorities to maintain trust with the community.\n\nDo sanctuary policies lead to \u201cdangerous & violent criminal aliens\u201d being released to \u201cprey\u201d on Americans? Not much research exists, but the limited research that does challenges Trump\u2019s claim. A handful of studies looked at whether there is a causation between sanctuary cities and crime. They either found no statistically significant impact of sanctuary policies on crime, or a reduction in crime due to immigrant-friendly policing strategies. Regardless, the idea that \u201cthousands of dangerous & violent criminal aliens are released\u201d just isn\u2019t right. Many sanctuary jurisdictions do alert federal authorities when they believe an inmate is a public safety threat.\n\nWe\u2019ve pointed this out before \u2014 the Trump administration has definitely not started building the wall. Trump sought $25 billion from Congress to build a southern border wall \u2014 but received only $1.6 billion. And that funding came with strings attached. It could not be spent on any of the concrete prototypes that Trump toured. Instead, it was designated for new fencing and maintenance on existing fencing \u2014 an effort that falls quite short of \u201cbuilding the wall\u201d the president effusively promised.\n\nAs for Mexico having \u201cvery strong border laws,\u201d PolitiFact reported that the White House pointed to a 2010 Washington Times article as evidence \u2014 but the Mexican law was changed in 2011 to decriminalize the act of entering the country without documentation and to allow undocumented immigrants to use education and health services. Moreover, Mexico\u2019s own southern border is much more porous than the U.S. southern border despite a number of efforts the country has taken to secure it.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates argue the Obama administration was tough on illegal immigrants, even giving the former president the moniker \u201cDeporter-in-chief.\u201d In raw numbers, more illegal immigrants were deported under the Obama administration than any time previously, but that was in part because of a change in how deportations were counted. Regardless, there\u2019s no reason to believe the Democrats are standing between the president and changing the U.S. immigration system. In fact, it\u2019s more the opposite \u2014 they have offered at least four pieces of bipartisan legislation to remedy DACA and update the immigration system.\n\nThere\u2019s no hard and fast definition, but \u201ccatch and release\u201d usually refers to U.S. immigration authorities\u2019 practice of releasing unauthorized immigrants while they await immigration hearings, rather than keeping them in custody. As we\u2019ve previously explained, with some exceptions, only children and asylum seekers are eligible for this kind of release. They often stay in the United States for months or years while their cases wind through the courts. Many of them do not show up for court dates and end up settling in the country without authorization.\n\nThe practice originated during the Bush administration largely because there was not enough space to house all the people waiting for immigration hearings. A court case during the Clinton administration required the federal government to release undocumented children. It worked differently under Bush and Obama. So, the history shows catch and release is a collection of policies, court precedents, executive actions and federal statutes spanning more than 20 years, cobbled together throughout Democratic and Republican administrations, including the Trump administration. It\u2019s safe to say the president can\u2019t pin this on the Democrats.\n\nThis is a ridiculous statement. If immigrants were crossing the border for DACA, they would be gravely disappointed. The program has a slew of requirements but in this case one is most important: DACA is only available to illegal immigrants who have continuously resided in the United States since 2007, meaning anyone who just recently crossed into the United States would not be eligible for the program.", "lang": "en"}
