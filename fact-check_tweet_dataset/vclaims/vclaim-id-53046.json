However, there is no indication that the people in this study were representative of the wider population, so no conclusions about vitamin D levels and Covid-19 outcomes in general can be drawn from the findings.\n\nNotably, this research was published as a preprint (meaning it was yet to be reviewed by other scientists) and has now been removed from the journal\u2019s website by the authors.\n\nThe headline of the Daily Express article also incorrectly claims \u201cLacking in a vitamin could increase death risk by 99 percent\u201d.\n\nWhere has the study gone?\n\nThis preprint was originally published on SSRN, an online research library which \u201cprovides the opportunity to share and distribute research well before it is published in journals\u201d, on 30 April 2020.\n\nSSRN said the paper was the fifth most downloaded paper on the website between 8 and 14 June. However, the preprint then disappeared from SSRN\u2019s website after 19 June.\n\nWe asked SSRN why the research was removed and it told us that \u201cthe paper was removed from our site by the author\u201d. We have contacted the authors to find out why they decided to remove the article, but they are yet to respond.\n\nThe study is still available to read in full on the website of dental product manufacturer Emerginnova\u2019s website, but has not been peer-reviewed there either.\n\nWhat does the study show?\n\nThe study, based in Indonesia, looks at the differences between 380 people who died and 400 who did not die after catching SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. The study does not report how these people were chosen for inclusion in the research.\n\nThe main focus of the paper is patients\u2019 vitamin D levels. Each patient was assigned to one category (normal, insufficient or deficient) based on \u201cpre-admission\u201d serum levels, which were \u201cchecked by two physicians based on the available clinical data of the patients\u201d.\n\nIt is unclear how far back vitamin D levels were recorded or what happened if participants were missing this information.\n\nOf those who died, about 4% were recorded as having normal vitamin D levels, 49% had \u2018insufficient\u2019 levels and 47% were \u2018deficient\u2019. On the other hand, of those who survived, about 93% had normal levels, 7% had insufficient levels and 1% were vitamin D deficient.\n\nIf these statistics are viewed by vitamin D level rather than survival status, then we see that about 99% of patients in the study who were recorded as vitamin D deficient died. The authors write that \u201c98.9% of Vitamin D deficient cases died while only 1.1% of them were active [alive] cases\u201d. The study tells us nothing about the risk in the wider population\n\nThe authors provide the average age and percentage of people with a pre-existing condition by vitamin D status. From this, we can see that those with deficient levels of vitamin D are older and far more likely to have other underlying illnesses.\n\nThis means that the group of people who died with Covid-19 were characteristically different from those who did not die.\n\nThere are other risk factors associated with lower vitamin D levels and poorer Covid-19 outcomes that are not measured in the study, such as ethnicity and obesity. Males are more likely to die from Covid-19 but, although sex was recorded in the study, the authors don\u2019t present this information by vitamin D status.\n\nBecause these other risk factors weren\u2019t accounted for in the study, we can\u2019t tell from the study whether vitamin D deficiency does affect the chances someone has of dying from Covid-19.\n\nThe study certainly cannot be used to say that 99% of Covid-19 patients with a vitamin D deficiency will die of the disease.\n\nThere is no strong evidence at present to suggest that vitamin D helps to prevent or limit Covid-19 illness.\n\nA rapid evidence summary by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body that provides national guidance and advice to improve health and social care in the UK, has concluded that \u201cthere is no evidence to support taking vitamin D supplements to specifically prevent or treat COVID\u201119\u201d.\n\nNICE also advises that \u201call people should continue to follow UK Government advice on daily vitamin D supplementation to maintain bone and muscle health during the COVID\u201119 pandemic\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
