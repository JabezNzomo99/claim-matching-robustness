Rick Santorum, R-Pa., criticized President Barack Obama\u2019s proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 on CNN\u2019s State of the Union.\n\nSantorum said he could support a smaller minimum wage increase, but not the nearly $3 an hour hike the president and other Democrats have called for.\n\n\"If you look at the CBO report, half a million people would lose their jobs as a result of the Obama minimum wage increase,\" Santorum said. \"I\u2019m talking more in the range of a dollar, phasing that in.\"\n\nSantorum didn\u2019t respond to our request for comment, but we were able to find the February 2014 he was speaking about. Santorum is largely quoting the report correctly.\n\nObama\u2019s proposed increase would take place in three steps, with the minimum hourly wage hitting $10.10 in 2016. It currently sits at $7.25, but many states choose to pay a higher minimum wage than federal policy mandates.\n\nThe CBO concluded if the federal government gradually increased the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for all workers, and tied future increases to inflation, the economy would shed 500,000 jobs by the second half of 2016 (all things constant under current law). That\u2019s about 0.3 percent of the workforce. CBO reached its conclusion, figuring:\n\u2022 Higher wages increase companies\u2019 production costs. In turn, that lowers the amount of goods and services produced. That means companies need to employ fewer workers.\n\u2022 Raising the cost of employing low-wage workers encourages companies to focus more on other, more cost-effective ways of producing goods and services: machines, technology and employing productive higher-wage workers.\n\nThe one thing that Santorum didn't note is that the 500,000-job estimate is just that, an estimate. Job losses could range from hardly any, all the way up to 1 million. It pegged 500,000 jobs as its \"central estimate.\"\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the CBO report had only bad news about Obama\u2019s proposal. The report also noted that about 16.5 million workers would see their wages go up.\n\nSantorum said if the United States raises the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, \"half a million people would lose their jobs.\" Santorum said \"would\" but really the 500,000-job figure was the CBO\u2019s best guess. Analysts say job losses could be anywhere from just a few workers to as many as 1 million.\n\nSantorum's statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
