It was a mistake to do that.\u201d\n\nThe remark was meant to emphasize why the use of chemical weapons by Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad necessitated an American military response.\n\u2022 None Former ambassador: Assad will test U.S. with more chemical attacks\n\nWhile chemical weapons weren\u2019t widely used on th battlefield in the European theatre in World War II, Spicer\u2019s comments immediately raised eyebrows because of the Nazi\u2019s extensive and well-documented use of poison gas during the Holocaust. Six million Jews were slaughtered in the Holocaust, many in Nazi gas chambers.\n\nPressed by a reporter to clarify what he meant by this remark, Spicer said that he meant that Hitler had never used chemical weapons in the way Assad had, while acknowledging they were used by the Nazis during the Holocaust.\n\n\u201cI think when you come to sarin gas, he was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing,\u201d Spicer said. Of Hitler, Spicer said, \u201cHe brought them into the Holocaust centers, I understand that.\u201d\n\nHe then added: \u201cBut in the way that Assad used them, where he went into towns, dropped them down to innocent -- in the middle of towns....I appreciate the clarification\u2026that was not the intent.\u201d\n\nAfter the briefing, the White House issued another statement: \u201cIn no way was I trying to lessen the horrendous nature of the Holocaust,\u201d Spicer wrote. \u201cI was trying to draw a distinction of the tactic of using airplanes to drop chemical weapons on population centers. Any attack on innocent people is reprehensible and inexcusable.\u201d\n\nThe clarifications didn\u2019t come soon enough for the Anne Frank Center, which called on President Trump to \u201cfire Sean Spicer at once.\u201d The Center in a tweet called Spicer\u2019s remarks \u201cthe most evil slur upon a group of people we have ever heard from a White House press secretary.\u201d\n\nIt was a call echoed by House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who lambasted Spicer over his comments.\n\n\u201cWhile Jewish families across America celebrate Passover, the chief spokesman of this White House is downplaying the horror of the Holocaust,\u201d she waid in a statement. \u201cSean Spicer must be fired, and the President must immediately disavow his spokesman\u2019s statements. Either he is speaking for the President, or the President should have known better than to hire him.\u201d\n\nLater Tuesday, Defense Secretary James Mattis said \u201ceven in World War II, chemical weapons were not used on battlefields.\u201d Chemical weapons were banned in 1925 under the Geneva protocol, a reaction to the horrors of World War I. Hitler, who was partially blinded by mustard gas in World War I, did not use the German stockpiles of chemical weapons on combatants on the battlefield, as Mattis noted. But by the end of World War II, Hitler had killed nearly 6 million Jews, using poisonous gas to kill many of them.", "lang": "en"}
