Other agencies have tactical or specialized teams that some may view as similar to SWAT teams. For example, the Bureau of Prisons has a special team that responds to high-risk situations in prison cells, the U.S. Marshals has a Special Operations Group that is trained and equipped for high-risk criminal situations and other emergencies and disasters, and the Energy Department has a security team to handle events and terrorist attempts associated with hazardous materials.\n\nIn June 2011, a local television station in Northern California reported that a SWAT team broke down the front door of Kenneth Wright\u2019s house at 6 a.m., as officers grabbed him by the neck and brought him out to his front lawn. The officers woke up his three young children, put them in a police patrol car and searched the house, Wright said. The station reported that the Department of Education had initiated the search and called in SWAT for his wife\u2019s defaulted student loans.\n\nThe officers were from the DOE\u2019s Office of Inspector General, and they were not part of a SWAT team. Offices of Inspector General have special agents that are federal law enforcement officers, and are sometimes issued protective gear. (The department\u2019s OIG does not have a SWAT team, a spokeswoman confirmed.) The search warrant released by Wright shows that officers were searching for materials related to violations of federal statutes regarding financial aid fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy and others.\n\nThey recruited students to sign up for college classes to receive financial aid funds, according to the 2014 DOJ press release on their sentencing. Some agreed to have their identities used for fraud, and others had their information used without consent. Wright was sentenced to a probation term and his wife was sentenced to prison.\n\nBoth were investigations as a part of the FDA\u2019s crackdown, using sting operations, on the sale of unpasteurized milk. Regulators say raw products \u2014 especially raw milk \u2014 can be dangerous and could lead to disease outbreaks. But raw-food advocates believed regulators unnecessarily were cracking down on alternative food sources, and that there was no need to draw guns on milk-buying clubs.\n\nThe first case: A multi-agency investigation of Rawesome, a raw food store in Venice, Calif., led to a raid of the store in 2011. The owners were arrested on suspicion of several charges, including illegally making and selling raw milk products. The FDA said the owners violated federal regulations requiring them to be licensed, regulated and inspected. The owners said Rawesome did not get a license because it was not an actual store, rather a members-only club that specialized in raw foods.\n\nThe second case: Undercover FDA agents had purchased unpasteurized milk from the Pennsylvania farm of Daniel Allgyer, an Amish farmer, and documented their deliveries to neighboring states over several months. Allgyer also was a part of a raw milk buying club and had \u201ccow share\u201d agreements. A federal court granted the FDA a permanent injunction against Allgyer, who illegally distributed raw milk across state lines and did not label raw milk containers that were sold to customers.\n\nBoth cases have become emblematic of government overreach to those who want minimal government regulations. Ron Paul was a champion for Allgyer in Congress and on the 2012 presidential campaign trail, and criticized raw milk sales bans as \u201cpasteurization without representation.\u201d Rand Paul wrote about this case in his book, \u201cGovernment Bullies: How Everyday Americans are Being Harassed, Abused and Imprisoned by the Feds,\u201d declaring: \u201cThis case goes far beyond the debate about the health factors that come with consuming raw milk. This prosecution by the FDA \u2026 now has jurisdiction over private property use.\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s description of federal agencies with law enforcement officers, the DOE case and the raw milk cases was inaccurate on almost all fronts. The federal government does not have 48 SWAT teams; it has one, with the FBI. There are dozens of agencies with specialized forces, or armed agents to carry out the agency\u2019s criminal enforcement \u2014 which is not the same thing as a SWAT team. The DOE case he described was debunked after the original local report, and it is irresponsible to continue to tell the details of the initially misreported story.\n\nHis second story also is inaccurate. The FDA (which he called USDA) does not have a SWAT team. The two sellers prosecuted in the case were not just penalized for selling unpasteurized milk, which was legal in their states. The California store owner did not obtain proper licenses, and the Pennsylvania farmer was prosecuted for interstate commerce, which is illegal. Both also did not meet the FDA\u2019s labeling regulations.", "lang": "en"}
