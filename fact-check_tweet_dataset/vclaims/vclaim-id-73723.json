His statement went on to condemn violence that \u201cendangers lives\u201d and that \u201cshutters businesses that serve the community.\u201d\n\nIn a Medium post, Obama made a similar comment, saying that the \u201csmall minority of folks who\u2019ve resorted to violence in various forms, whether out of genuine anger or mere opportunism, are putting innocent lives at risk, compounding the destruction of neighborhoods that are often already short on services and investment and detracting from the larger cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it,\u201d he added in the Medium post. \u201cIf we want our criminal justice system, and American society at large, to operate on a higher ethical code, then we have to model that code ourselves.\u201d (RELATED: Were 2 Hospitals Set On Fire During George Floyd Protests In Columbus, Ohio?)\n\nDuring a June 1 speech on the Senate floor, Schumer said, \u201cThe small minority who exploit the moment for violence and mayhem are wrong and do not advance the cause of justice.\u201d Other Democrats, including South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, have also spoken out against such actions.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the viral post arrived at the $100-billion figure, but the Insurance Information Institute states on its website that a preliminary estimate from insurance industry analysts puts the range between $500 million and $900 million in insured losses, though that may change \u201cas insurers are resurveyed and data is refined.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
