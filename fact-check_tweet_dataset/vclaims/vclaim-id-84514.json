Speaking in the context of gifts given to foreign dignitaries, he said, \u201cThis is the first time this has happened that when India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi goes abroad, or any foreign president visits India, he is gifted the Shrimad Bhagavad Gita or Ramayan\u201c.\n\nHere\u2019s the video where Yogi Adityanath speaks about Taj Mahal having no connection with India\u2019s culture.\n\nYogi Adityanath is right that Prime Minister Modi has gifted copies of Bhagavad Gita on a few occasions. It was in news when he gifted one to President Obama. Also when he visited Japan, he carried them for Emperor, Akihito and Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe. But Yogi is in for a shock if he sees the full list of gifts presented by Mr. Modi in the last three years.\n\nWhen it comes to gifts, one size doesn\u2019t fit all. Gifts for Prime Minister\u2019s foreign trips seem to be carefully picked keeping the recipient in mind. They not only represent India\u2019s diversity and rich cultural heritage but also the relationship between the two countries.\n\nOn his visit to Saudi Arabia, Mr. Modi\u2019s gift for King Salman represented an important part of Indian cultural heritage and India-Saudi trade ties. It was a gold plated replica of the first mosque in India, the Cheraman Juma Masjid built in 629 AD.\n\nWhen Mr. Modi visited Iran, he carried a special gift. A rare 7th century manuscript of the Holy Quran written in Kufic script.\n\nFor the president of Uzbekistan, he carried a specially commissioned replica of Khamsa-i-Khusrau by the 13th century Sufi poet, Amir Khusrau who was born in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nFor Prime Minister Enda Kenny of Ireland, he carried a reproduction of historic manuscripts & papers of two Irish officials who made important contribution to India during the British rule. Thomas Oldham was appointed the geological surveyor in 1850s. His joining day is marked as foundation day of Geological Survey of India. Sir George A Grierson conducted the 1st linguistic survey of India, which was published over several years between 1903 to 1928. It provided the first scientifically based taxonomy of Indo-Aryan languages.\n\nTo David Cameron, Mr. Modi presented a bookends with inscriptions from the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nFor the Queen among other gifts, he had Darjeeling tea from Bengal and organic honey from Jammu & Kashmir\n\nTo Prime Minister Harper, Modi presented a traditional Indian miniature painting showing Guru Nanak Dev with his disciples Bhai Bala & Bhai Mardana.\n\nUN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon was presented with a painting of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nHere is a partial list of gifts given by Mr. Modi during his foreign trips as compiled from the information shared by him and Ministry of External Affairs through their tweets:\n\nThe above list may not meet with Mr. Adityanath\u2019s approval but it captures very well, the cultural diversity and rich traditions of India. Be it a replica of the first Indian mosque or miniature painting of Guru Nanak Dev, be it a manuscript of the Holy Quran or a copy of the Bhagavad Gita or a book on Indian religions, the list is far from a narrow minded interpretation of the idea of India. It showcases art and traditions from different states of India. It is well researched and has a personal touch. For eg., Chancellor Merkel who is a doctorate in Chemistry was presented papers of Nobel Laureate, CV Raman. The list doesn\u2019t grudge history, it accepts it, as in the case of historic manuscripts acknowledging contributions of famous Irishmen during the British rule.\n\nWhen we compiled the list, we were pleasantly surprised by the amount of thought and preparation that seems to have gone into it. Yogi Adityanath may disagree, but the list is a fairly balanced representation Indian culture, history and traditions. Kudos to those who came up with it.", "lang": "en"}
