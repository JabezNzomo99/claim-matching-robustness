Yes, it says it did just that, and here is some context: Vaccines at Inovio Pharmaceuticals do not contain the virus but instead contain DNA sequences. Lead Stories reached out to Inovio, and the company explained how its research differs from traditional vaccines.\n\nThe claim originated from a video post (archived here) published by sportstertainment on February 20, 2020, under the title \"San Diego Lab Discovers COVID 19 Vaccine in 3 Hours.\" The text surrounding the video reads:\n\nUsers on social media saw this:\n\nThe YouTube post included a video report from News 8, the CBS affiliate in San Diego. In the piece, the reporter spoke with Dr. Trevor Smith, who is the director of research and development at Inovio. He said:\n\nFor more context on the discovery, Lead Stories reached out to Jeff Richardson, vice president of strategic relations at Inovio. He provided this statement:\n\nInovio's DNA vaccines are different than traditional vaccines which use the same process in use for the past 75 years. Our vaccines do not contain the virus....just DNA sequences. This is one reason we can move so quickly. Once the Chinese government put up the sequence of the virus....we made a construct of our DNA vaccine in about 3 hours after that...then to manufacturing the DNA vaccine...then into preclinical studies all with a few weeks. [We] hope to be in humans late Spring early summer.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, it may take even longer before the vaccine gets FDA approval:\n\nWe wrote other fact checks from YouTube before.
