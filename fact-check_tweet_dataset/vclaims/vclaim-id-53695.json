Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Gates ever said or wrote this expression.\n\nGates, a billionaire entrepreneur with an estimated net worth of $106 billion, co-founded the software firm Microsoft with Paul Allen in 1975. Gates and his wife Melinda chair the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a private charitable organization that works to improve global health and promote equal opportunity around the world.

Rowling The First Person To Fall Off The Forbes Billionaires List For Charitable Giving?)\n\nWhile Gates has given tips on business strategies in the past, there is no record of him ever saying or writing the expression attributed to him in the Facebook post. An internet search reveals no credible sources ascribing it to him.\n\nThe Daily Caller also searched his books, \u201cThe Road Ahead\u201d and \u201cBusiness @ The Speed of Thought,\u201d as well as his personal blog, but found no similar statements.\n\nIn 1947, automobile executive Clarence Bleicher testified before the Senate that one should \u201cput a lazy man on it\u201d to make a difficult job easier. Bleicher\u2019s testimony may have been abbreviated over the years into the statement falsely attributed to Gates, according to the website Quote Investigator.\n\nHowever, thematically-related sayings have appeared in print since at least 1920, according to the website Quote Investigator.", "lang": "en"}
