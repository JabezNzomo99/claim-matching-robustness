Taal is growing under you. This is why all the quakes. They said hydro volcanic activity is increasing.\"\n\nThe facts: Though fissure vents do naturally occur, it is unlikely for lava to come out of the fissures caused by Taal Volcano in the areas encircled on the map in the post, based on the volcano's historical eruptions.\n\nMoreover, Phivolcs' hazard maps only identify 5 potential eruption vents, all of which are in Volcano Island \u2013 a permanent danger zone \u2013 or Taal Lake, not in any of the towns nearby. These potential eruption vents are Taal Volcano Island main crater, Binintiang Malaki, Pirapiraso, Off-Calauit, and Binintiang Munti. (FAST FACTS: What you should know about Taal Volcano)\n\nAside from eruption vents, the maps also identify areas and buffer zones that will be affected by base surges and ballistic projectiles based on data from historical eruptions of 1754, 1911, and 1965. Base surges are clouds of hot gases, ash, and rocks traveling horizontally at speeds of more than 80 kilometers per hour, while ballistic projecties are large volcanic fragments explosively thrown out from the vent.\n\nThe hazard and buffer zones include Agoncillo, but only parts of Laurel and Lemery. It also includes towns that were not encircled on the map, like Taal and Santa Teresita.\n\nWhen asked about lava coming out of the fissures that have been created because of Taal Volcano's recent activity, Mariton Bornas, chief of the Volcano Monitoring and Eruption Prediction Division at Phivolcs said: \"There is no basis for these assertions, especially if judging [by] the historical eruptions.\" \u2013 Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
