She praised Wall Street for its role in creating the nation\u2019s wealth, then added that \u201ctoo many American families are not sharing\u201d in that prosperity. She said the brewing economic troubles weren\u2019t mainly the fault of banks, \u201cnot by a long shot,\u201d but added they needed to shoulder responsibility for their role. While there was plenty of blame to go around for the spate of reckless lending, and while Wall Street may not have created the foreclosure crisis, it \u201ccertainly had a hand in making it worse\u201d and \u201cneeds to help us solve it.\u201d\n\nModerator Rachel Maddow: \u201cYour campaign has now been criticized for its operatives essentially impersonating culinary union members wearing union pins in Nevada, and the Nashua Telegraph has complained recently that you falsely implied in an advertisement that they had endorsed you when they did not.\u201d [\u2026] Sanders: \u201cWe did not suggest that we had the endorsement of a newspaper. Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates, and to the best of my knowledge, that is what we did. So we never said, never said that somebody, a newspaper endorsed us that did not. What we did say is blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaper.\u201d Maddow: \u201cJust to follow up on that, the title of the ad in question was \u2018Endorsement.\u2019\u201d Sanders: \u201cBut that was only for \u2014 that was not to be on television. That\u2019s an important point. That was just something \u2014 as the secretary knows, you put titles on ads and you send them out, but there was no word in that ad, none, that said that those newspapers had endorsed us.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
