The announcement from Special Agent in Charge Aaron Rouse at a news conference Monday comes after the ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack without providing evidence.\n\nISIS has released similar vague claims of responsibility following previous attacks in Europe and the U.S., and on some occasions they have followed up with recorded video statements from terror attackers pledging allegiance to the group.\n\nOn other occasions, however, no links have been revealed, showing the terror group is willing to try and capitalize on an opportunity for publicity where no tangible support or contact existed. This has been seen more often in recent months, as the group sees its once vast territory in Iraq and Syria shrink rapidly.\n\nRecent claims of responsibility from ISIS for violence include the failed London subway bombing, after which the group quickly said it was the work of a \"detachment\" of ISIS soldiers. No accomplices have been found in that attack, and the ISIS claim also misstated the number of devices used.\n\nFollowing vehicle attacks in Barcelona, ISIS issued a statement of responsibility which appeared to do little more than echo details being reported by the media. It soon became clear that the group had no advance knowledge of the attacks.", "lang": "en"}
