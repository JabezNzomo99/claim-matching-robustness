Everyone pay attention to safety when driving.\"\n\nWe analysed the longer version of the clip and found that video is not from Mumbai or even India.\n\nWe noticed that the shop billboards present in the background had Chinese characters. We used Google's translation app which recognised the language as Chinese.\n\nAt the 1.30 minute counter in the video, a white truck passes by with 'JMC' written on it.
