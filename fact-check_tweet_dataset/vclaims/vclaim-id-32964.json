Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the video and also, the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Video shows Akhilesh Yadav being arrested for protesting against the removal of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. Fact: The video was taken in 2011 when Akhilesh Yadav was arrested by the Police for carrying out a protest against the then Mayawati government. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the video in the post was run through the \u2018InVid\u2019 plugin, several keyframes of the same were obtained. On subjecting these keyframes to reverse image search technique, a certain keyframe directed to a YouTube video, which was similar to the one posted on Facebook. When the timestamp of the video was checked, it was found to be uploaded on March 9, 2011, by \u201cTimes Now\u201d. The video has the following description with it- \u201cOn the last day of Samajwadi Party\u2019s state-wide agitation against the Mayawati government, party state president Akhilesh Yadav was today arrested at the Amausi airport as soon as he landed here from New Delhi\u201d.\n\nTo conclude, the video doesn\u2019t show Akhilesh Yadav being arrested for protests over Article 370. He was arrested in 2011 for carrying agitations against the then Mayawati\u2019s government in U.P.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
