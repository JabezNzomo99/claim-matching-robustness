John Cornyn (R-Tex.), one of the main authors of the Senate\u2019s legislation, brings renewed attention to the Senate bill, Cotton is leading the charge against it. The Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015 passed the Senate Judiciary Committee in the fall, and has bipartisan support that includes Koch Industries, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the American Civil Liberties Union and the White House.\n\nThe bill aims to alleviate over-incarceration in federal prisons, by reducing the length of mandatory minimum sentences and focusing federal resources on felons who commit violent crimes and serious drug felonies. The point is to make sure that the punishment fits the crime, especially for certain low-level, nonviolent offenses involving drugs and firearms. The effectiveness of mandatory minimums is beyond the scope of this fact-check.\n\nAccording to Caroline Rabbitt, Cotton\u2019s spokeswoman, the total number of eligible inmates add up to \u201cthousands\u201d of violent inmates. Even just using Sections 104 and 105, which deal with armed offenders, the number is in the \u201cthousands\u201d (3,433 inmates), she said. The rest of the eligible inmates essentially are repeat drug traffickers, whom Cotton still views as violent offenders, Rabbitt said.\n\nThis is a crucial point of difference in the debate: who regards whom as truly \u201cviolent\u201d or \u201cnonviolent.\u201d For Cotton and other opponents, drug trafficking or dealing is a violent act in itself. Supporters believe there should be lesser punishment for those in the lower rungs of a trafficking ring, such as drug mules, couriers or street corner dealers.\n\nSeveral officials pointed to the current weaknesses of the Armed Career Criminal Act, which has led to sweeping incarceration practices. The 15-year minimum sentence under this law is triggered for people who had three previous state or federal convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses at any point in their life, and then were found in possession of a firearm.\n\nIn many cases, this act has led to excessively severe sentencing for the crime committed, according to the Sentencing Commission. The commission recommended Congress clarify the definitions in the law and reduce its severity. More often than not, the prior three convictions are for state law violations, the CRS found.\n\n\u201cThe short answer is, yes, it would release some violent offenders. But to characterize it that way is quite misleading overall,\u201d said Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project. Mauer added: \u201cThe legislation is trying to get at the overly broad nature of the definition of a violent offense.\u201d\n\nFar fewer than the 11,524 maximum eligible inmates would withstand the judicial scrutiny and actually benefit from this law, said Frank Bowman, University of Missouri law professor who supports sentencing reform but thinks the Senate measure doesn\u2019t go far enough. Further, there is an unknown number of violent criminals who newly would be subject to mandatory minimums as a net result of the changes, he said.\n\nThe bill has safeguards that would not allow early release for anyone whose current offense was violent, said Marc Levin, policy director of Right on Crime. That means the offenses for which they are currently incarcerated must have been nonviolent crimes.\n\nThere are thousands of inmates \u2014 11,524, to be exact \u2014 who would be eligible for resentencing under the Senate bill. But not all of them are convicted of a violent crime, and it\u2019s unclear exactly how many of these inmates would actually get their sentences shortened if the bill became law. There are 3,433 inmates in the two sections that include people who may have been convicted of a violent felony. Even then, those inmates may be there because of a sweeping law that has been found to impose excessive sentences.", "lang": "en"}
