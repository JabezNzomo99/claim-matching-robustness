The incident happened on 13th March but came to light only two days ago. According to reports, the boy was a farmhand working with a family of a girl who he got romantically involved with and was murdered for the same reason. The images of the dead body show several injuries including severely mutilated genitals. The local circle inspector had initially termed this as a case of a suicide stating that no injuries were found.\n\nA video of the victim\u2019s mother and brother is now available in which they talk about the day when Manthani was not to be found and his body was discovered in a canal many hours later.\n\nAccording to the victim\u2019s mother, on Monday morning (13th March), Manthani Madhukar\u2019s family members, left for work while he was still at home. The last person who saw Madhukar leaving home was the neighbour. According to the neighbour, Madhukar took bath, ate food left the house at around 11 am. By the time, his mother and sister returned home, it was 6 pm and Madhukar\u2019s elder brother was waiting for them to enquire about his whereabouts. None of them \u2013 including the neighbour \u2013 knew where he had gone. All that they knew was that Madhukar had left home by 11 am. After asking around for a while, Madhukar\u2019s elder brother went on to the main road and asked the villagers if they anyone had Madhukar since morning. Simultaneously, the family was also trying to reach out to Madhukar on his mobile. Even though the call went through, Madhukar didn\u2019t answer the phone. After 10:00 pm on Monday, the phone was switched off. The family then frantically called the relatives, but Madhukar wasn\u2019t found anywhere. By 8:00 am on Tuesday, the elder brother and a cousin again started searching for Madhukar in Venkatapuram village but returned by 09:30 am without any information. Then around 20 people gathered and took auto, bikes and went out in search of Madhukar, but he was not found anywhere.\n\nAt 11.52am on Tuesday, the elder brother received a call and a girl informed him that her family had thrown Madhukar\u2019s body in the canal near his home. The call was disconnected abruptly after the girl\u2019s mother intervened, and the Madhukar\u2019s elder brother along with others went to Venkatapuram to check in the canal there. At around 05.30pm on Tuesday, someone called the youngest brother and told that they had seen Madhukar\u2019s body and everyone rushed to the spot immediately.\n\nAccording to a clipping from Andhra Jyothy newspaper dated 16th March 2017, the family of the victim protested out in the open with the victim\u2019s body in the ambulance. The family insisted that it is not a suicide and demanded a thorough enquiry into the issue. According to this report, the local inspectors assured the family that a thorough enquiry will be done.\n\nSome people from the activist fraternity who are in the victim\u2019s village today informed us that the victim\u2019s family is currently visiting the collectorate regarding the case.", "lang": "en"}
