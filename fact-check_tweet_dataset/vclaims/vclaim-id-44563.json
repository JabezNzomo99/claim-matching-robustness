It has received 259 shares as of posting.\n\nThe facts: The DepEd did not announce that there will be a Grade 13 and Briones did not say the quote attributed to her.\n\nThe supposed screenshot of a news report has a watermark that says \"breakyournews.com.\" The website is a meme generator that allows users to customize a news report template by changing the headline, ticker, and image.\n\nA reverse image search returns memes with the same format or images of Briones on other news reports. The reports don't mention an announcement of Grade 13.\n\nThere are no official reports on the possibility of an additional year to the government's K to 12 basic education program.\n\nThere are no official reports or recordings of Briones saying the quote that was attributed to her. \u2013 Vernise L Tantuco/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
