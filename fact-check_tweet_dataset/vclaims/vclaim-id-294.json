This claim is false as the footage has been taken out of context.\n\nAs of May 14, 2020 this video has been shared over 22,800 times on Facebook. Examples can be seen here , here , here and here\n\nMost of the iterations of this claim feature a poor quality screengrab from a news broadcast with an overlaid text that reads \u201cThe R.F.I.D CHIP Coming in all corona vaccine shots In next 18 months (MARK OF THE BEAST).\u201d\n\nThe original footage has been cropped and taken out of context. The video actually shows a 2017 report from NBC News\u2019 Today show about a Wisconsin company which offered its employees the chance to have a microchip implant in their finger that they could use to buy snacks, log in to computers or activate the copy machine (here).\n\nstory was reported by several media outlets, including Reuters ( here ), the New York Times ( here ) and the BBC ( here ).\n\nThe devices by Three Square Market which are featured in the video are not GPS enabled, nor designed for tracking purposes ( 32chip.com/ ). \u201cWe've never been in this to advocate that all people get chipped. That's not our agenda,\" said Todd Westby, CEO of Three Square Market, in a press release visible here .\n\nThe TikTok clip, posted by user @globaltrending (now deleted), is actually filmed from a five minute YouTube conspiracy video titled \u201cCoronavirus vaccine is the digital ID chip wow!\u201d uploaded on April 12, 2020. The video falsely claims that \u201cThe digital ID chips is in the vaccine shot, that\u2019s why they want everybody to take it\u201d. It uses the clip from NBC\u2019s Today report (taken out of context) as \u201cproof\u201d ( here ). There are several other claims within the video, which are out of scope of this Fact Check.\n\nNo vaccine has yet been approved for use against the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, though more than 100 are in development and at least 10 have reached the clinical testing stage ( here ). There is no evidence suggesting these vaccines will have a Radio-Frequency-Identification (RFID) chip.\n\nReuters has previously debunked false claims on social media that U.S. philanthropist Bill Gates planned to use microchip implants to fight the coronavirus ( here ).\n\nFalse. The video from a 2017 news report has been taken out of context. There is no COVID-19 vaccine available yet nor evidence that a potential vaccine will include a microchip.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
