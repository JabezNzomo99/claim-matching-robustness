You have to imagine a painting or sculpture is in front of you,\u201d says Newstrom. Paul Rooney, Lana\u2019s agent, believes she might be the greatest artist alive working today: \u201cWhen she describes what you can\u2019t see, you begin to realize why one of her invisible works can fetch upwards of a million dollars.\u201d said Rooney.\n\nIn fact, many online users encountered the story only through a graphic that was displayed to listeners who streamed the piece from the CBC\u2019s web site:\n\nWhat many online users missed was that all of this was nothing more than a clever spoof of the art world presented by the \u201cThis Is That\u201d program, which is hosted by two comedians, Pat Kelly and Peter Oldring, who fabricate stories satirizing current affairs in a public radio format:\n\nThis Is That is a current affairs program that doesn\u2019t just talk about the issues, it fabricates them. Nothing is off limits \u2014 politics, business, culture, justice, science, religion\u2013if it is relevant to Canadians, we\u2019ll find out the \u201cThis\u201d and the \u201cThat\u201d of the story. Each week, hosts Pat Kelly and Peter Oldring introduce you to the voices and stories that give this country character in this 100% improvised, satirical send-up of public radio.\n\nThe graphic displayed at the head of this article, showing art viewers looking at seemingly empty walls, is actually a picture taken at an exhibit of a Phil Stern photography collection at Forma Photography Foundation in Milan on 16 June 2010, from which the displayed artworks have been digitally removed.", "lang": "en"}
