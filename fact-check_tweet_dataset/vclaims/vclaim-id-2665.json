And this is just the guidance for one part of the benefits system.\n\nThe documents are designed so that DWP staff are aware of laws, regulations and cases that affect how people should be assessed for and paid their entitlements, among other things. \u201cIt helps them make decisions that are accurate and consistent\u201d, according to the government.", "lang": "en"}
