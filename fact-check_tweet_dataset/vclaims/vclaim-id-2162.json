He didn\u2019t even hold a press conference that day. He didn\u2019t hang a Confederate flag in the White House, either. The American Tribune made it all up.\n\nWe know that because of the website\u2019s copyright policy page, which states: \u201cThe American Tribune provides a satirical view of current events. Our articles should be taken with a grain of salt. Our articles are a parody of the terrible news coverage in 2016 and beyond.\u201d\n\nThat explains the part of the satirical story that says: \u201cPresident Donald Trump has been getting a lot of heat for his comments regarding White Nationalists and the tragedy in Charleston, North Carolina this past weekend.\u201d It\u2019s most likely a reference to genuine criticism that Trump received after comments he made about \u201cboth sides\u201d being at fault for violence at a white nationalist rally on Aug. 12 in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2014 not Charleston, North Carolina.\n\nOn top of that, the featured photo does not show a framed Confederate flag hanging in the White House. The image was originally used in a 2012 Miami Herald story about a Confederate flag on display at an elementary school in Miramar, Florida.\n\nSkeptical Facebook users flagged the American Tribune post as potentially fake news. Based on reader comments at the bottom of the story, it wasn\u2019t clear to everyone that the story wasn\u2019t meant to be taken seriously.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cTrump just defended the Confederate Flag he hung in the White House\u2026 and we give up.\u201d Theamericantribune.org. 18 Aug 2017.\n\nMerica, Dan. \u201cTrump says both sides to blame amid Charlottesville backlash.\u201d CNN. 16 Aug 2017.", "lang": "en"}
