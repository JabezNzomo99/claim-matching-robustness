Weiser, an election expert and vice president at the Brennan Center. \u201cIt\u2019s not even clear what the scheme is that they\u2019re envisioning. It seems like they\u2019re throwing as many allegations and conspiracy theories against the wall as possible in the hopes that some of it might stick, and drive fear and distrust in the election.\u201d\n\nWeiser said most of the states that are sending out ballots are not mailing them to inactive voters. \u201cInactive voters are not ineligible voters,\u201d she added. \u201cThe states that have this category use it as an interim category of people who are already on their list as registered voters but they think may have moved. \u2026 If the voters show up on Election Day, that flag is removed and they are active voters again.\u201d\n\nThe RNC video suggests one voter could cast multiple ballots (\u201cas many times as you want\u201d) but that\u2019s not how it works. Most states have bar codes printed on their mail ballots, and more states have begun to use bar codes this year. When a completed ballot arrives, election officials scan the bar code to link it with the voter registered in the system. Officials typically compare the signature on the ballot to the one in the registration, among other steps. Duplicate ballots from the same voter wouldn\u2019t be recognized by the system after the first ballot was scanned, Weiser said. If someone requested a new ballot, the original would be voided.", "lang": "en"}
