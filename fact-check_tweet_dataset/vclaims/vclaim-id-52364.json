Of course, she was an Aquino.\" The tweet, which gained at least 1,800 retweets and 4,300 likes as of writing, was also reposted on Facebook by several users.\n\nA post by the Facebook page DU30 MEDIA Network from February 2019 is also being reshared and circulated in light of the conviction of Ressa and Santos. Part of the post's caption reads, \"Corazon Aquino filed a libel case against veteran journalist Louie Beltran. You did not cry about her weaponizing the law against press freedom. Never. Not then. Not now.\" The post has 706 reactions, 108 comments, and at least 2,600 shares as of writing.\n\nSimilar claims were also made following the verdict, such as one Facebook user who used the same graphic from DU30 MEDIA Network's post, with the caption: \"Pres Cory Aquino sued a revered Filipino journalist Luis Beltran for libel before, no issue. Today a private citizen businessman sued an alien Filipino/American/Indonesian news correspondent Maria Ressa for libel, everybody is howling...Death of Press Freedom, Death of Democracy and President Duterte is a tyrant dictator.\"\n\nMeanwhile, one Facebook user said, \"Remember Louie Beltran, a brilliant and veteran journalist sued by Cory Aquino, nobody from the media especially from ABS-CBN says it was an attack against freedom of the press or the death of democracy.. Now Maria Ressa is convicted everybody from the yellow wing are saying death of press freedom and democracy.\"\n\n\"Coming so soon after the overthrow of the Marcos dictatorship, and during the term of someone who had vowed to be Marcos\u2019 exact opposite, the fear was that both the suit itself as well the Beltran conviction would intimidate the media and establish a precedent in which Presidents \u2013 armed with such undeniable advantages as their power to appoint judges \u2013 would henceforth go after journalists whose work they didn\u2019t like, or whom they just didn\u2019t like, period,\" Teodoro said.\n\nAn article entitled, \"Press Freedom in the Philippines: A Legacy of American colonialism\" published in the journal Media Asia in 1991 also stated: \"President Aquino was setting a dangerous precedent when she brought her suit against Beltran. If the Philippine press is to continue its rather unique adversarial tradition, it must not be fettered by repressive libel laws that prevent the kind of adversarial journalism Beltran engaged in.\"\n\nBeltran's daughter Marissa also tweeted about the case, saying there was always opposition to the libel case and that it was definitely a violation of press freedom. \"[Although] the manner of opposition was through print media [which] was the only medium then,\" she said.", "lang": "en"}
