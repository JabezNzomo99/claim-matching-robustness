What the high court did last Tuesday -- the same day the false report was published -- was to defer action on ABS-CBN\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) against the National Telecommunications Commission\u2019s (NTC) cease and desist order.\n\nThe SC also gave the NTC and Congress 10 days to comment on the network\u2019s petition.\n\nThe NTC\u2019s cease and desist order came May 5, a day after ABS-CBN\u2019s 25-year legislative franchise expired, effectively putting off the air its 42 television stations, 23 radio stations and 10 digital channels. On May 7, the network filed a petition asking the SC to declare NTC\u2019s order \u201cnull and void,\u201d and requested a TRO that would temporarily allow it to operate while its petition is being heard.\n\nOnline Balita\u2019s inaccurate report, which bore the title, \u201cJUST IN! SUPREME COURT PAYAG SA PAG SHUTDOWN NG ABS CBN DAHIL MARAMING VIOLATIONS (Supreme Court agrees to ABS-CBN shutdown because it has many violations),\u201d carried a May 19 Youtube clip by channel BALITANG BALITA TV, which spliced together two Facebook (FB) Live videos of controversial lawyer Larry Gadon wrongly claiming that the high court \u201cdenied\u201d ABS-CBN\u2019s petition, including its request for a TRO. (See: VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Gadon falsely claims SC denied ABS-CBN petition for TRO)\n\nBALITANG BALITA TV also featured a spurious \u201cbreaking news\u201d graphic throughout the length of its video that read, \u201cSupreme Court approves the closure of ABS-CBN.\u201d\n\nGadon, known for his firm pro-Duterte administration stance, has a history of purveying false and misleading information.\n\nSocial media monitoring tool CrowdTangle shows Online Balita\u2019s false report already got over 8,700 interactions from public and private FB accounts. It could have reached about 3.6 million social media users, with traffic coming largely from public FB groups Dugong Bayani Pinoy ako DU30 Online Warriors, BONGBONG MARCOS PILIPINAS SOLID GROUP\"\"FOR PRESIDENT MOVEMENT 2022, and ATTY. PERSIDA ACOSTA - PAO CHIEF FOR SENATOR MOVEMENT - SUPPORTERS GROUP!\n\nOnline Balita has been publishing stories since December 2017, BALITANG BALITA TV since July 2013.", "lang": "en"}
