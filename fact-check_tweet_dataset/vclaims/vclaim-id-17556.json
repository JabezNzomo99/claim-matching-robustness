(READ: FALSE: 'Ouster plot' against President Duterte 'bared')\n\nPanelo cited Article 8 of the Revised Penal Code, saying, \"Conspiracy and proposal to commit felony are punishable only in the cases in which the law specially provides a penalty therefor.\"\n\nHe listed proposals to commit treason, coup d'etat, and rebellion as examples of proposals to commit a crime which need no overt acts but are punishable under the Revised Penal Code.\n\n\"Only when all the elements of any of these crimes have been committed will we file a case against the conspirators. Should their plans lead to overt acts punishable by law, then criminal cases will also be filed against them. It is only when the cases are filed in court that proof will be submitted to substantiate the criminal charges,\" Panelo said.\n\nAs human rights lawyer Ted Te explained to Rappler, \"Conspiracy under Article 8 is not a crime unless it is defined as such; conspiracy to commit rebellion or sedition is a crime, so Panelo's claim is false.\"\n\nTe said the government does not need proof to file an information on those named in the \"matrix,\" only a prima facie evidence. \"He's basically admitting there is no basis for the matrix because they can't even come up with a prima facie case,\" said Te.", "lang": "en"}
