Trust Stamp \u2013 Bill Gates funded program that will link your identity to your vaccination history\u201d.\n\nThe July 21 post has generated more than 500 shares and more than 35,000 views.\n\nThe post\u2019s claim that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation funded two digital identity companies to develop programs to monitor humans is not true. Trust Stamp and COVI-PASS do not have partnerships with the Gates Foundation, nor have they developed microchip implants to track people using a \u2018social credit system\u2019.\n\nThe post\u2019s image appears to come from a July 19 article that appears on a website called GreatGameIndia. Trust Stamp is a global provider of identity proofing services aimed at preventing ID fraud and data loss. Some claims about Trust Stamp in the post are also similar to claims in the article.\n\nThe Great Game India article includes the sentence: \u201cThose who may not wish to be vaccinated may be locked out of the system based on their trust score\u201d.\n\nThe July 21 Facebook post has the passage: \u201cThe \u201ctrust\u201d part of the Trust Stamp name comes from the fact that if you are not vaccinated, you will be locked out of the system based on your \u201ctrust\u201d score.\u201d Both the article and the post refer to Trust Stamp being part of a system of \u201cpredictive policing\u201d.\n\nA Trust Stamp spokesperson told AAP FactCheck in an email the company was not in partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n\u201cTrust Stamp has never developed microchip technology meant to be implanted in humans,\u201d the spokesperson said in response to the claim it uses microchips to monitor users.\n\n\u201cOur only current involvement with vaccination initiatives is a result of our efforts to increase accessibility to markets, services and aid, through providing a means to prove identity for people that lack verifiable identity credentials (e.g a birth certificate).\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vaccination program captures the parents\u2019 biometrics, not those of the child, and there is no central storage of the biometrics or any other identity data. The biometric hash is stored on the device and on a card that the parent takes with them.\u201d\n\nRegarding claims that Trust Stamp monitors financial accounts and is running a \u201csocial credit system\u201d, the spokesperson told AAP FactCheck the company did not have \u201cany solutions that link healthcare records with access to financial tools\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe work we do for financial inclusion aims to establish the first source of verifiable identity for those that have none. We do not store data relating to how an individual makes use of these services nor do we have or use any kind of \u2018social credit system\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe post also makes several claims about COVI-PASS, an app-based digital health wallet that allows people to store COVID-19 test results.\n\nThe post claims COVI-PASS arose from the ID2020 project.\n\nID2020 is a not-for-profit program that is funded by corporate sponsors including Microsoft and the Gates Foundation vaccine project Gavi.\n\nA COVI-PASS spokesperson told AAP FactCheck in an email the company did not have a funding partnership with the Gates Foundation, nor had it developed \u201cimplantable microchips\u201d for humans.\n\nThe spokesperson said COVI-PASS was not developed out of the ID2020 project.\n\n\u201cCOVI-PASS is simply a digital wallet that is being developed with health credentials in mind,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cA COVID-19 test result can only be accessed with the wallet holder\u2019s permission.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson said COVI-PASS uses blockchain, military-grade encryption and double authorisation to assure user data protection and is GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliant.\u201d\n\nClaims Mr Gates planned to launch microchip implants have previously been debunked by AAP FactCheck following a March 2020 Reddit \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d Q&A in which he mentioned foreseeing the use of \u201cdigital certificates\u201d to show who has been tested for COVID-19.\n\nIn June 2020, the Microsoft founder told Wired magazine that he had never been \u201cinvolved in any sort of microchip-type thing\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is good to know which kids have had a measles vaccine and which have not, so there are data systems and \u2026 health records that people use to track that \u2026 but there\u2019s no chips or anything like that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost hard to deny this stuff because it\u2019s so stupid or strange, that to even to repeat almost seems to give it credibility.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
