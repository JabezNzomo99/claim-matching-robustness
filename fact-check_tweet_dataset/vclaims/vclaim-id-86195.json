The decline would be the first time in 46 years in the December-to-December time frame, but there have been other 12-month periods with index declines, mostly recently in 2013.\n\nHe pulled this number from a report issued in October by his Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), which found that \u201crelative annual price growth for prescription drugs has slowed since January 2017.\u201d That means prices are still going up but at a lower rate than before. The report includes a chart with a trend line of expected prices, based on the second half of President Barack Obama\u2019s term. (Note: an earlier version of this article incorrectly said that there was a spike in prescription drug prices because a new drugs to deal with hepatitis C. There was a spike in spending because such drugs entered the market.)\n\nThe $26 billion figure actually refers to the savings from the introduction of all new generic drugs in the first 19 months of the Trump administration (if you count all of January, though the president did not take office until the 20th). The analysis was based on an earlier report by the Food and Drug Administration that looked mainly at drug approvals in 2017. Contrary to the president\u2019s tweet, it is not a figure for all prescription drugs; it just reflects the impact of generic-drug introductions.\n\n\u201cWe find that 17 percent more generic drugs have been approved each month, on average, since January 2017 than were approved during the previous 20-month period,\" the CEA report said. \"Furthermore, we find that this increase in approvals has taken place despite the fact that the number of brand name drug patent expirations\u2014necessary precursors for generic entry\u2014has declined during this period.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the CEA report makes clear, large numbers of generic drugs entered the market in every year leading up to 2017 and that surely would have continued no matter what the administration had done,\u201d said Matthew Fiedler of the Brookings Institution, the CEA\u2019s chief economist in the Obama administration. He said the methodology was reasonable, but it is \u201cnot a remotely plausible estimate of the savings generated by the administration\u2019s policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe $26 billion in savings is likely disproportionately accounted for by the initial round of generic entry that occurs when a high-revenue brand-name drug comes off patent,\u201d Fiedler said. \u201cThese markets are so large and so lucrative to enter that incremental changes in the mechanics of the FDA approval process like those the administration has implemented so far, while potentially worthwhile, are unlikely to have a big effect on entry decisions.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, an Associated Press investigation found that brand-name prescription prices keep going up, with 96 price hikes for every price cut. But a simple count may not be especially helpful in determining what happened to the prices of prescription drugs that were most commonly used by consumers.\n\nThe White House initially did not offer an on-the-record comment. After this fact check was published, a CEA spokesperson said: \u201cThe new data and our research show that the Administration\u2019s efforts to make medicines more affordable are showing promising results, but of course the President believes there is more work to do.\u201d\n\nAs we noted, one could view the tweet as three distinct sentences \u2014 two facts and an opinion. But we believe most people would read it as a continuum: Prescription drug prices have declined, here\u2019s how much money you saved, and thus our policies are working. But the $26 billion number refers to the savings from the introduction of all generic drugs, most of which would have happened no matter who was president.", "lang": "en"}
