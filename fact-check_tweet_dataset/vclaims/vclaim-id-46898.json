The photo has been shared in a misleading context; it shows a mock prison cell set up by suffragettes at the Women\u2019s Exhibition in London, England in 1909.\n\nThe photo was published in this Twitter post on December 29, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\n\u201cSuffragette\u201d refers to women who campaigned for women\u2019s rights, primarily the right to vote in political elections, from the 19th century to the late 20th century in the UK and the US.\n\nThe same photo was also shared here, here and here on Twitter; here on Facebook; and here on Pinterest, with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is misleading; the photo actually shows a mock prison cell which was by suffragettes at the Women\u2019s Exhibition in London, England in 1909.\n\nThe same photo was published here by the Museum of London.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo:\n\nThe caption states: \u201cSuffragette 'prison' stand at The Women's Exhibition. A mock prison cell was erected at The Women's Exhibition held at Prince's Skating Rink, Knightsbridge, on 13-26 May 1909. At 3.30, 5 and 8pm, the 'female prisoner', played by an actual ex-prisoner, demonstrated the daily duties that suffragette prisoners carried out. These included scouring pots and pans, making beds, scrubbing floors, sewing and making mailbags. Visitors to the exhibition paid 6d (sixpence) for admission and an explanation of prison life.\n\nHere is an article about Broom, who frequently photographed suffragettes, published on the museum\u2019s website on December 14, 2017.\n\nOther images of suffragettes credited to her can be found here, here and here on the museum\u2019s website.\n\nMailOnline, the website for UK tabloid The Daily Mail, used the same photo of the mock prison stand in this report published on August 22, 2017.\n\nThe photo caption states: \u201cA mock prison cell for Suffragettes erected at The Women's Exhibition held at Prince's Skating Rink in Knightsbridge, May 1909\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the image in the report highlighted in red by AFP:\n\nThe same misleading claim was debunked in this tweet posted by Twitter account Fake History Hunter on December 30, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
