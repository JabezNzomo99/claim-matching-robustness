The new House rules were approved on 3 January 2017 along party lines, with only three Republicans joining Democrats in voting \u201cnay.\u201d The rule in question states that:\n\nAs the government transparency web site OpenSecrets.org pointed out, the new rule classifies congressional records as personal property and thereby has the potential to make investigations more difficult for prosecutors:\n\nWho cares whether a congressional office\u2019s budget documents, maintained at taxpayer expense, belong to each individual member, rather than Congress as a body? Maybe the Justice Department, for one. In investigating allegations of public corruption or misuse of funds, criminal investigators frequently need to subpoena such records.\n\nAlthough multiple web sites (including the alarmist liberal blog US Uncut) reported that the new rule \u201cshields\u201d members of Congress from prosecution, Michael Stern, former senior counsel to the U.S. House of Representatives, explained that rendering documents generated by public office as \u201cpersonal property\u201d of legislators means it will be more difficult, but not impossible, for investigators and prosecutors to obtain them:\n\nStern said that although the rule is new, it merely codifies a position taken by House members for years, and has not been controversial among them. But it is nonetheless troubling, said Meredith McGehee, strategic adviser for Campaign Legal Center, a government accountability organization:\n\nThe general thought before this was, anything you generated in your office was considered official business \u2014 property of the office as opposed to the personal product of the sitting member. With this rule it is changing that long-held practice and clearly articulating that these kinds of materials don\u2019t belong to the office, but to the individual. We don\u2019t yet know what the exact impact of that change will be.\n\nAs an example, McGehee pointed to the case of Aaron Schock, a former Illinois representative who was indicted on two dozen counts related to accusations he improperly lived an extravagant lifestyle on the taxpayers\u2019 dime:\n\nMr. Schock, now 35, resigned amid questions about his financial practices, including accusations of spending tens of thousands of dollars from taxpayer-funded accounts on office renovations, using taxpayer and campaign funds on private jets and concerts, and failing to report extravagant gifts on his annual financial disclosure forms as required by House ethics rules. In addition to the wire fraud and theft of government funds charges, Mr. Schock was charged with making false statements, filing false federal income tax returns, falsification of Federal Election Commission filings and mail fraud.\n\nProsecutors in the Schock case had to argue this very issue, that Schock\u2019s spending records were the property of his public office and not private possessions:\n\nAt first, the court rejected Schock\u2019s \u201cact of production\u201d privilege, saying \u201cthe congressional office was a collective entity\u201d and thus had no right to claim the Fifth. But it later reversed the ruling and gave the government time to reconsider, \u201cgiven the importance of the issue\u2026and the unprecedented consequence\u2026to Schock and therefore all current and future Members of Congress as to their publicly-funded, non-private, public or official Congressional records,\u201d according to a government court record. Prosecutors in the case were not pleased. \u201cThey ask this Court to be the first court to recognize that Schock and every other current and future Member of Congress have a Fifth Amendment act-of-production privilege, thereby effectively screening [public or official documents] from public scrutiny,\u201d prosecutors in Schock\u2019s case wrote in a court document in Aug. 2015. \u201cThe government respectfully submits that this argument is repugnant to the fundamental principle that no man is above the law and that it should therefore be rejected.\u201d\n\nMcGehee noted that public office holders claim that because of the political nature of their positions, the new rule is necessary to prevent their opponents from going on unwarranted \u201cfishing expeditions\u201d and seeking to ensnare or embarrass them by accessing and sifting through troves of public records. But, she added, \u201cto me that\u2019s part of the territory. You\u2019re in politics.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
