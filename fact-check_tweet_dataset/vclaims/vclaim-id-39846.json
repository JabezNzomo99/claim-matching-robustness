It seems Swara also shared the article of October 2017, assuming it to be a recent one.\n\nMany Facebook pages such as 'Indian DemoCrazy' shared this post.\n\nSwara's tweet has been retweeted more than 1,500 times and liked by over 3,700 users. The tweet has been deleted now. Later, when people pointed out that the article is old, Swara clarified that she hadn't seen the date while reading and sharing the article.\n\nA simple Google search, using keywords, revealed that the incident is two years old. According to reports, on October 1, 2017, a 21-year-old Dalit youth -- Jayesh Solanki -- was allegedly beaten to death by a group of men from the upper caste community for attending a garba event in Anand district of Gujarat.\n\nAccording to the police, the accused said Dalits don't have any right to watch garba. Jayesh and his cousin were allegedly thrashed by some upper caste men. The incident was covered by several media organisations at that time. A report by The Indian Express said all the eight accused were arrested in the incident.\n\nWe scanned the internet thoroughly but couldn't find any lastest news report related to such type of incident.\n\nIt is, therefore, clear that the two-year-old incident from Gujarat has resurfaced on social media just to mislead people.", "lang": "en"}
