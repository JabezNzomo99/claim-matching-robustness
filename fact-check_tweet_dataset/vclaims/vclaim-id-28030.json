According to the message, Rituraj\u2019s mother Asha Sahani wanted him to take her with him to America or admit her to an old-age home. Facebook page \u2018National Crime Investigation Bureau\u2019 posted the message with the image on February 27.\n\nSeveral other individuals on Facebook and Twitter posted the image with the same narrative.\n\nWith a reverse image search of the image on Russian search engine Yandex, Alt News found the same image posted on a blog on October 14, 2016. According to the blog, the human skeleton was found in a pastor\u2019s house in Nigeria\u2019s Ogun state. Daily Post, a Nigerian newspaper, on October 14, reported, \u201cThe news made the rounds on Friday of a certain unnamed pastor whose late sister\u2019s skeleton was found in his apartment in Peace Land Estate in the Akute area of the state. Nemesis caught up with the man whose landlady tried to evict him from his flat over late payment of rent, as he had not paid his rent for a year.\u201d The landlady had invaded into the pastor\u2019s house and discovered the said skeleton.\n\nAccording to an October 17, 2016 report by the media outlet, Sunday Oluwatobiloba, the pastor was arrested by the police and later paraded before the press at the police headquarters. The skeleton was alleged to be of Oluwatobiloba\u2019s sister Funmi, who reportedly went missing in a mysterious manner since 2010. The pastor and his second sister Elizabeth believed that their sister Funmi was on a spiritual journey. The pastor was quoted by the newspaper saying, \u201cShe (Funmi) has gone on a spiritual journey and she has been in that position in the last six years. We (he and Elizabeth) are expecting her back before the end of this year and we are not afraid to live with her.\u201d\n\nDespite the fact that the image is from Nigeria, the story of an NRI named Rituraj Sahani finding his mother Asha Sahani\u2019s corpse is real.

Police also found an empty bottle and a spray while recovering Rs 50,000 in cash.\n\n\u201cThe police said Rituraj was unable to return to India because he was embroiled in divorce proceedings initiated by his Indian-origin wife staying in the US. Rituraj has custody of their 10-year-old son, said an officer. The police said before April 2016, Sahani had visited US for a week and stayed with Rituraj. She had told him not to worry about her and that she can live in an old age home, Rituraj told police in his statement.\u201d, stated the report. Moreover, the police also said that the son spoke to the mother last in April 2016 and used to visit her every year or once in six months.\n\nIn conclusion, an image of a human skeleton found from pastor\u2019s home in Nigeria was shared as 62-year-old woman Asha Sahani\u2019s remains recovered from her Mumbai apartment in 2017.", "lang": "en"}
