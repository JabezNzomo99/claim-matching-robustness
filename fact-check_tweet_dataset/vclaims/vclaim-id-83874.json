The video is misleading; it shows India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi arriving in Russia's capital Moscow for a bilateral summit, while Pakistan\u2019s then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is seen landing in the smaller city of Ufa for a regional summit.\n\nThe video has been posted repeatedly on Facebook, for example here where it has more than one million views since it was shared February 17, 2019, and here where it has been watched more than 700,000 times since it was uploaded February 20, 2019.\n\nThe misleading posts are headlined: \u201cHow Other Countries Treat India and Pakistan\u201d and have a caption saying: \u201cI feel so sad for Pakistan for losing its respect!\u201d\n\nThe writing across the top of the video says: \u201cHow Russia welcomes\u201d.\n\nThe video contains two clips alongside each other. The clip on the left is marked \u201cNawaz\u201d with a Pakistani flag; the clip on the right is marked \u201cModi\u201d with an Indian flag.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading video:\n\nThe \u201cNawaz\u201d clip shows a small jet with \u201cPakistan Air Force\u201d written on its side taxiing to a halt. Nawaz Sharif can then be seen walking down the aircraft\u2019s stairs onto the tarmac where he is greeted by a small group of formally dressed people.\n\nThe \u201cModi\u201d clip shows Narendra Modi walking out of a large, double-decker plane onto a red carpet. A military band is lined up along the red carpet and plays for Modi, before an honour guard of soldiers marches past.\n\nThe misleading footage of Sharif actually shows Pakistan\u2019s then-Prime Minister arriving in Ufa, a small city in Russia, on July 8, 2015 ahead of a regional summit.\n\nThe footage in the misleading clip is an edited version of video posted to YouTube, which can be seen here.\n\nVideo agency Ruptly, which is owned by Russian state-backed broadcaster Russia Today, also broadcast very similar footage of Sharif\u2019s arrival that can be seen here.\n\nThe video\u2019s caption reads: \u201cPakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif touched down at Ufa International Airport in the Russian Republic of Bashkortostan, Thursday, to take part in the final day of the seventh BRICS summit before attending a meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).\u201d\n\nThe misleading footage of Modi actually shows the Indian Prime Minister arriving in Moscow on December 23 2015, for an annual India-Russia summit.\n\nThe exact same footage as is used in the misleading clip was posted online as a livestream by Ruptly and can be seen here.\n\nModi also attended the 2015 Ufa summit. Here is a livestream video posted online by Ruptly on July 8, 2015 of his arrival in Ufa.\n\nThe caption says: \u201cLive: Prime minister of India Narendra Modi arrives in Ufa.\u201d\n\nThere is no red carpet or military band in the footage of Modi\u2019s arrival at Ufa.\n\nBelow is the live video of his arrival:", "lang": "en"}
