They failed to build new bricks and mortar classrooms for eight long years.\u201d\n\nNSW Opposition Leader Michael Daley pledges to replace unpopular demountables with permanent classrooms in public schools. February 24, 2019\n\nWith the NSW election looming on March 23, Labor leader Michael Daley has committed $1.4 billion to fixing the state's public schools by building more bricks-and-mortar classrooms. [1]\n\nAAP FactCheck has examined Mr Daley\u2019s claim that since being elected in 2011 the Liberal government has failed to build permanent classrooms in public schools and has been masking \u201csevere overcrowding\u201d by installing demountables.\n\nMr Daley\u2019s claim the NSW Liberal government \u201cfailed to build new bricks-and-mortar classrooms for eight long years\u201d is not true.\n\nIn March 2015, a NSW Department of Education spokesman told The SMH: \"Since 2011, 18 new and relocated schools and 44 major upgrade projects have been announced. These projects will provide 694 new and permanent classrooms and more than 10,000 student places.\" [2]\n\nEducation Infrastructure NSW was set up by the NSW Liberal government in 2017 to \u201coversee the planning, supply, and maintenance of NSW schools\u201d. [3]\n\nIn June 2018, NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet announced as part of the NSW Budget that 230 new and upgraded schools had been completed since 2011. [4]\n\nAccording to Education Infrastructure NSW, the state government announced 17 new and upgraded schools would open for the first day of Term 1 in 2019, providing almost 400 new classrooms for students across the state. [5]\n\nMr Daley\u2019s claim demountables are \u201csupposed to be used temporarily\u201d is supported by a statement NSW Education Minister Rob Stokes made in parliament last December. \u201cThe Department of Education uses demountable buildings to manage changing enrolment patterns; provide accommodation to meet emergency needs \u2026 and provide temporary accommodation needs as a result of capital works and maintenance projects,\u201d Mr Stokes said. [6]\n\nMr Daley\u2019s claim the \u201cLiberals have been piling them [demountables] into schools\u201d was unable to be verified by comparative statistics. However in 2017, the independent Government News website reported the NSW Labor opposition, using Freedom of Information, obtained an Education Department document that showed 6114 demountables were in use in NSW schools and TAFE sites. [7]\n\nThere was clear evidence supporting Mr Daley\u2019s reference to \u201csevere overcrowding\u201d in NSW public schools.\n\nNSW education department data released in 2018 showed 636 schools in NSW had reached or exceeded capacity - the equivalent of almost a third, or 31 per cent, of all public schools. [8]\n\nTwo years earlier, The Sydney Morning Herald reported similar statistics showing more than 800 public schools across NSW were operating at 100 per cent capacity or more, and of those 800, a total of 180 were above capacity. [9]\n\nAAP FactCheck concludes Mr Daley's claim the Liberal government had not built any new classrooms in the past eight years is false, while his assertion the Liberal government was \u201cpiling them [demountables] into schools\u2019\u2019 could not be verified. He was correct to say there is severe overcrowding in NSW schools and that demountables are meant to be temporary.", "lang": "en"}
