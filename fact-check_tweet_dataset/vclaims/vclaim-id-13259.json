From the Twitter handle of one @javaidShaikh, the clip attracted over 13,000 views (archive).\n\n@javaidShaikh\u2019s tweet was quote-tweeted by Hanif Qadir whose bio says that he is the CEO of a UK Youth Charity \u2013 Active Change Foundation. The website of the charity says that Qadir was a former member of Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan but turned his back on the terrorist organisation upon witnessing crimes committed against civilians. Since then, as claimed by the website, Qadir and his charity help safeguard youth in the UK from similar experiences.\n\nOther individual users have also shared the same video, drawing thousands of views (1, 2). A Turkish Twitter handle EHA News circulated the video with a similar claim.\n\nWe found that the video was also uploaded on YouTube last year with an identical narrative.\n\nAlt News broke up the video into individual frames using InVid software, and reverse searched the images via Google. We found that a Facebook page Bytes Today had shared the video on June 12, 2018, and described it as \u2013 \u201cSSP office Aligarh: Police lathi charge on Hindu Jagran Manch coterie.\u201d\n\nThe incident in question had occurred when activists of the Hindu Jagran Manch (HJM) staged a protest outside the SSP\u2019s office. ANI, The Times of India, and The Indian Express were among the many media outlets that reported the incident. The video posted below depicts the same event shot from a different angle.\n\nHindutva outfit HJM is affiliated to the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP). On June 12, 2018, its workers forcibly locked the gate of the SSP\u2019s office while demanding the arrest of a man booked for attempt to murder. The Indian Express had reported that the man was a cinema hall owner who had open-fired at two members of HJM three months ago. According to The Times of India, SP (crime) Ashutosh Dwivedi assured the protesters that he will personally look into the probe after they claimed that the police was not investigating the case properly. The TOI report further stated that \u201cmoderate\u201d force was used to disperse the protestors when they did not heed to police\u2019s requests and \u201cmisbehaved\u201d with the general public.\n\nAlt News has debunked this video three times in the past \u2013\n\nJune 2018: When Rajasthan Congress committee general secretary shared it as police lathi-charge in the state.\n\nAugust 2018: Two months later, the video was viral as police lathi-charge on youth sitting on a dharna outside UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath\u2019s residence.\n\nFebruary 2019: Earlier this year, it was shared as police lathi-charge on youth protesting in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nIt is common for old, unrelated videos to resurface on social media with changed narratives.
