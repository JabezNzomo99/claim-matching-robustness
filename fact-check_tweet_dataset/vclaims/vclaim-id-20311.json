Instead we are seeing skyrocketing prices, due to the China policy and a risk that recycling will be lost.\"\n\nLinda Scott, president of Local Government NSW (LGNSW), Labor councillor and deputy mayor of the City of Sydney Council, wants to work with the NSW government to help solve the recycling \u201ccrisis\u201d. March 4, 2019.\n\nCouncillor Scott wants the NSW government to work with councils to divert $727 million in revenue to develop waste management and recycling solutions to process rubbish previously shipped to China. Cr Scott believes this would prevent rising costs and the death of recycling. NSW Environment Minister Gabrielle Upton declared the LGNSW recycling argument was a \"fact free zone\". [1]\n\nAAP Factcheck examined Cr Scott\u2019s claims the NSW government needs to work with councils to create a sustainable recycling industry to stop \u201cskyrocketing\u201d costs and recycling risked being \u201clost\u201d as a result of China\u2019s policy shift. As a result, Ms Upton\u2019s claim the LGNSW recycling argument was a \"fact free zone\" was also checked.\n\nOn January 1 2018, China\u2019s National Sword policy took effect banning the import of 24 categories of solid waste and kerbside recycling from Australia. [2]\n\nBefore China\u2019s policy change in 2016/2017, 30 per cent or 1.27 million tonnes of all recycling sent overseas for processing by Australia was exported to China, according to a study (of ABS statistics) commissioned by the federal government. [3]\n\nAfter China\u2019s policy change started halfway through the 2017/2018 financial year, ABS data showed Australian recyclables exported to China fell to 17 per cent or 0.75 million tonnes, with paper, cardboard, and plastics most heavily affected. [3]\n\nThere was evidence supporting Cr Scott\u2019s claim that China's new policy had led to \u201cskyrocketing\u2019 prices for processing recycled waste within Australia.\n\nAn Australian Covenant Packaging Organisation report found in the months following China\u2019s announcement - but before its introduction - the average price of mixed paper scrap fell from around $124 per tonne to $0 per tonne. Scrap mixed plastics and cardboard similarly suffered, falling from $325 per tonne to $75 per tonne and $210 per tonne to $125 per tonne respectively. [4]\n\nQueensland\u2019s Ipswich City Council reacted to the price shift by announcing on April 17, 2018 all its kerbside recycling would go straight to the tip due to rising costs of recycling. [5]\n\nRecycling contractors told the Ipswich council the charge to dispose of recycling items would \u201cskyrocket\u201d, with an increase of around $2 million each year. That would mean a council rate rise of 1.5 - 2 per cent. [6]\n\nA public backlash however forced Ipswich council to reverse its decision after just 24 hours. [7]\n\nAustralia wasn\u2019t the only country affected by China\u2019s policy shift, leading to a global oversupply of recyclable materials, putting downward pressure on prices and reducing returns/profits. [8] [9]\n\nThere was no evidence to support Cr Scott\u2019s claim that recycling risked being \u201clost\u201d if state and local government didn\u2019t work together to prevent it becoming landfill.\n\nResearch shows there is a public and corporate appetite for recycling and an economic benefit.\n\nAn October 2018 report by the Australian Council of Recycling, a peak national industry association established in 1983 representing about 70 recycling businesses, published a 10-point investment recycling industry plan, saying 90 per cent of Australians supported such a plan. ACOR said a key public policy driver needed to achieve the plan was leadership. [10]\n\nDeakin University environmental sciences lecturer Trevor Thornton argued an all-of-government solution was needed. \u201cOne barrier is the lack of a centralised approach by all three spheres of government. It doesn\u2019t make sense for state or local governments to have to manage this large-scale infrastructure issue in isolation.\u201d [11]\n\nIndustry groups including Waste Management Association of Australia (WMAA) and Suez Waste Management also argued all levels of government need to work together to make recycling viable.\n\nWMAA president Garth Lamb said: \"Recycling in general, and the environment, is supposed to be a federal issue first and foremost - the state of our environment as a whole. Then it becomes state government in terms of managing waste, and then a local government (issue).\" [12]\n\nRegarding the viability of recycling and its economic benefit, the ACOR study said the recycling sector was valued at $20 billion and supported 50,000 jobs. [10]\n\nThe same study said some 500 jobs in Australia would be created by re-manufacturing in Australia 50 per cent of waste formerly sent to China.\n\nAnd while China is no longer the major destination for Australian recycled waste, Indonesia, Vietnam, India, Malaysia and Thailand remain among the top export destinations, according to Data on Exports of Australian Wastes published in January 2019 by Blue Environment, an Australian environmental consulting company. [3]\n\nAAP Factcheck concludes two of Cr Scott\u2019s three claims are true. Different levels of governments need to work together to make recycling viable and costs did \u201cskyrocket\u201d as a result of China\u2019s policy shift. Her claim that recycling risked being \u201clost\u201d was false.\n\nMs Upton\u2019s claim the LGNSW recycling argument was a \"fact free zone\" was also false.", "lang": "en"}
