Candidates have thrown around quite a few numbers while accusing their opponents of either supporting or opposing some key health-care legislation.\n\nIn a closely fought campaign for North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District, Republican Mark Harris is following suit after his Democratic opponent, Dan McCready, accused Harris of wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare. We recently checked McCready\u2019s claim and found it to be Half True. Harris has not supported any plans that would immediately cut these two programs, but has expressed that he wants an \"overhaul\" of Social Security.\n\nA Facebook ad, paid for by Harris, addresses this claim directly.\n\n\"My opponent attacks me, alleging I want to cut Social Security and Medicare, when it was the liberal Democrats who back his campaign that cut $716 BILLION from Medicare to fund their healthcare scheme: Obamacare,\" the ad said. The ad has been running since Oct. 22, 2018.\n\nWe are specifically checking if $716 billion was \"cut\" from Medicare in order to pay for Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health law passed in 2010. It. This is a claim PolitiFact has checked numerous times. Politicians have been using the $716 billion number since at least 2012.\n\nOld claim and old number\n\nIn 2012, PolitiFact checked a similar claim from presidential candidate Mitt Romney and rated it Half True. Paul Ryan, Romney\u2019s vice presidential pick in 2012 and now the speaker of the House, made a similar claim that year that got him a Mostly False rating. Finally, a 2015 claim by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee was rated Half True. And there are many more.\n\nPoliticians often were using the right number but the wrong context.\n\nAsked where Harris\u2019s $716 billion figure comes from, Jason Williams, his campaign manager, shared a link of a Washington Post blog post from 2012. The article says Mitt Romney, former Republican presidential candidate, is right in saying Obamacare cuts the Medicare budget by $716 billion. And while there was a cut in spending, there was never a loss of services or a decrease in quality of services.\n\nBut that article is more than six years old, and so are the government numbers it relies upon. So let\u2019s take a fresh look.\n\nHarris\u2019s claim makes it sound like the ACA cut benefits for the elderly.\n\nMatthew Fiedler from the Brookings Institution, a center-left think tank, says there isn\u2019t any evidence of that.\n\n\"The implication when this claim was made is that these harmed Medicare beneficiaries. That implication is not accurate. These were changes that reduced what physicians and hospitals received from Medicare,\" Fiedler said.\n\nThe ACA aimed in part to bring down the future growth of costs in Medicare, offsetting some of the cost of the law.\n\nAn analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, from 2011, says the health-care legislation would \"permanently reduce the growth of Medicare\u2019s payment rates for most services.\"\n\n\"You might suggest maybe that reductions in payments may have reduced the quality in care. I don\u2019t think there is a whole lot of evidence of that,\" Fiedler said. \"Various other changes were aimed at giving hospitals and physicians incentives to provide better care.\"\n\nFiedler said that prior to the ACA, people were paying more for medical services than they needed to in order to cover the costs. After the ACA, premiums and co-payments went down, saving Medicare beneficiaries money.\n\nThe $716 billion figure was an estimate of how much would be saved. But that was a projection, and while Obamacare has been in effect for years, PolitiFact wasn\u2019t able to find a recent estimate of what happened in reality.\n\nAny repeal or replacement bill that has passed through Congress actually included these same provisions, even Republican plans, according to Tricia Neuman, the senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care policy organization.\n\n\"Subsequent proposals to repeal the ACA retained those Medicare savings. It\u2019s sort of having it both ways for criticising ACA savings, but keeping them in subsequent proposals,\" Neuman said of Republicans.\n\nNeuman also said that the ACA improved drug coverage and preventative services for Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nHarris\u2019s number would\u2019ve been closer to the truth if this was 2012 and not 2018. However, his use of the number also gives a false impression. The number actually represented a projection of how much federal money Obamacare would save over the years, mainly at the expense of insurers, medical providers and hospitals.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\n\nThis story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab and PolitiFact.
