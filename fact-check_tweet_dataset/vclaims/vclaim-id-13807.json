The photograph shows the two sporting saffron scarves on which \u2018Vote for BJP N Modi\u2019 is printed. The text accompanying the image reads, \u2018\u0915\u092e\u0932 \u0915\u093e \u092c\u091f\u0928 \u0926\u092c\u093e\u0915\u0930 \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0930\u0915\u094d\u0915\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092d\u093e\u0917\u0940\u0926\u093e\u0930 \u092c\u0928\u0947\u0902\u2019 (Press the lotus button, become a part of the nation\u2019s progress- translated).\n\nThe post is by the page Ek Bihari 100 Pe Bhari. The page has a rather modest following of a little over 36,000. The post however has been shared over 4000 times already. It has also been posted on the group Main Bhi Chowkidar. A post by an individual user has garnered over 2600 shares.\n\nUpdate: Deepika Padukone visited JNU in solidarity with students injured during violence in the campus by masked goons on the intervening night of January 5-6. The actor has attracted massive criticism by supporters of the BJP. The same image is circulating with a caption that mocks those targetting the actor. It says, \u201cDeepika Padukone was a nationalist in 2019 and today after visiting JNU she has become anti-national? Wow hypocrites.\u201d\n\nAs expected, the image is digitally altered. Alt News reverse searched the image on Google and found the real photograph, which was clicked on November 30, 2018. Singh and Padukone had visited the Siddhivinayak temple in Mumbai, where the picture was clicked. It was carried by several media publications.\n\nAs is evident from the image above, the duo had sported plain saffron scarves and not BJP scarves. The original picture was tampered with. The two images- photoshopped and real, have been posted together below for comparison.\n\n[Update: The claim viral after Deepika Padukone\u2019s JNU visit has been added to the story.
