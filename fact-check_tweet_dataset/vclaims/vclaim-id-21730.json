The school\u2019s chancellor, Malcolm Little, said that regardless of her status as a former first daughter, the rules are the rules and she won\u2019t be welcome there this fall. The stunning announcement came after Malia was caught in a Boston hotel lounge vaping marijuana with friends. Harvard has a strict no drug policy. Massachusetts is one of the states that now allows for recreational marijuana and the hotel is \u201cweed friendly,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that she broke the rules.\n\nMalia Obama was not expelled from Harvard University for smoking marijuana. This report originated with The Last Line of Defense, an entertainment web site that publishes satirical stories, as a disclaimer on the site\u2019s \u201cAbout Us\u201d page states:\n\nThe Resistance may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don\u2019t necessarily exist. All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney. Pictures that represent actual people should be considered altered and not in any way real.\n\nAlthough Malia Obama was accepted to Harvard University, she has not started her college career as of this writing. The White House previously announced that Malia would take a \u201cgap year\u201d before starting her college career in the Fall of 2017:\n\nMalia Obama, the older daughter of President Obama, plans to attend Harvard University beginning in the fall of 2017, the White House announced, waiting until her father leaves office to begin her college career. Malia\u2019s much-speculated-upon decision, announced in a news release after months of official silence from the White House about her college search process, will make her the latest in a long line of presidential children to attend the elite university in Cambridge, Mass. Both of her parents attended law school there. \u201cThe President and Mrs. Obama announced today that their daughter Malia will attend Harvard University in the fall of 2017 as a member of the Class of 2021. Malia will take a gap year before beginning school,\u201d the White House said in a statement.", "lang": "en"}
