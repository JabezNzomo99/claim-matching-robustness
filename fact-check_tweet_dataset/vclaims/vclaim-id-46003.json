The viral message has also been shared in the form of what looks like a circular by WHO. The image carries a stamp of the international body.\n\nThe message states that the lockdown protocol should be as follows \u2013 one-day ban followed by a 21-day ban, then a 28-day ban after a 5-day hiatus, then a 15-day day after another 5-day hiatus. It also points out that the first two steps are similar to the steps taken by the Indian government \u2013 Janta curfew on March 22, followed by the ongoing 21-day ban which is to end on April 14. If the viral message is to be believed, the curfew will end for good on June 10.\n\nThe complete viral text reads, \u201cWORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION PROTOCOL&PROCEDURE OF LOCKDOWN PERIODS FOR CONTROLLING ON MOST DANGEROUS VIRUS STEP 1 \u2013 1 DAY. STEP 2- 21 DAYS. AFTER 5 DAYS. STEP 3- 28 DAYS. AFTER 5 DAYS. STEP 4 \u2013 15 DAYS. The sameway, our Indian governments are follow: MAR 22-1 DAY ( TRIAL LOCKDOWN) MAR24-APR14 \u2013 21 DAYS(FIRST LOCKDOWN) APRIL15- APRIL19 \u2013 RELAX FROM LOCKDOWN. APR20 \u2013 MAY 18 \u2013 28 DAYS(SECOND LOCKDOWN) INCASE,Covid19 patient ratio is Zero Withdraw the LOCKDOWN. Otherwise, May19 \u2013 May 24 \u2013 Relax from LOCKDOWN. May 25 \u2013 June 10 \u2013 15 days (FINAL LOCKDOWN)\u201d.\n\nAlt News has received several requests to fact-check the viral text on WhatsApp (+91 76000 11160) and on our official Android application.\n\nFirst and foremost, the poor English used in the viral message \u2013 grammatical errors and haphazard sentence formations \u2013 itself hints that it hasn\u2019t been issued by the WHO. On April 5, WHO South-East Asia posted a tweet debunking such forwards.\n\nSecondly, it seems like the viral message is based on media reports and a study published by students at Cambridge University, UK.\n\nAn ABPreport from April 3 states, \u201cTwo Indian-origin researchers from the University of Cambridge in the UK have come up with a model that predicts a flat 49-day nationwide lockdown.\u201d Since then, several media outlets have carried reports which question if three-week lockdown is sufficient or not.\n\nRajesh Singh and R. Adhikari of the Centre for Mathematical Sciences, University of Cambridge published the research paper \u2018Age-structured impact of social distancing on the COVID-19 epidemic in India\u2019.\n\nThe research presented a mathematical model of the spread of infection in a population structured by age and social contact between ages. The study found that a three-week lockdown is insufficient to prevent a resurgence and, instead, suggested protocols for lockdown with periodic relaxation. One of them forecasts a three-fold lockdown \u2013 21-day, 28-day and 18-day, just like in the viral message.\n\nTherefore the social media claim associated with the WhatsApp text is false. The World Health Organisation has not issued any such \u2018lockdown protocol\u2019.\n\nNote: The number of positive cases of the novel coronavirus in India exceeds 5,000 and more than 150 deaths have so far been reported. The government has imposed a complete restriction on movement apart from essential services to tackle the pandemic. Globally, more than 14 lakh confirmed cases and over 80,000 deaths have been reported. There is a sense of panic among citizens, causing them to fall for a variety of online misinformation \u2013 misleading images and videos rousing fear or medical misinformation promoting pseudoscience and invalid treatments. While your intentions may be pure, misinformation, spread especially during a pandemic, can take lives. We request our readers to practice caution and not forward unverified messages on WhatsApp and other social media platforms.\n\n[Update: Rajesh Singh and R. Adhikari were referred to as students at Cambridge University. Singh is a post-doctoral researcher while Adhikari is an assistant professor at the University.
