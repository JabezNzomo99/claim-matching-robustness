No, that's not true: The button on the rear bottom of the toy was designed to trigger giggling sounds whenever the doll is placed in a sitting position. There is no evidence, beyond the fears of some mothers, that the button is part of a secret strategy by the toymaker to prep kids for sex trafficking. Hasbro, however, told Lead Stories they were discontinuing production of the troll because of the controversy, and anyone who already bought the doll can contact the company's customer care department for a replacement that does not have a bottom button.\n\nThe claim appeared in several video posts (archived here) including this one on Facebook on August 4, 2020. The caption on the post opened:\n\nThis... This is VERY disturbing. \n\n\n\n This is 100% why I say that they have been GROOMING kids all along... \n\n\n\n Why is this button placed specifically where it is? Why is it not mention on the box? Why does it make such CREEPY sounds?\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nThe 3-minute-long video was recorded by a mother who said her daughter received the doll as a gift at her second birthday party, which had a \"Poppy\" theme.\n\nOk, I wanted to do a quick video, because I find this disturbing and I find it's something that needs to be shared. As you all know, stuff that's been going on in the world about the sex trafficking in kids and things that are thrown in our kids faces to kind of groom them and make them kind of a little bit more obliviously to things that are really happening.\n\nThe mother demonstrates what she found to be disturbing:\n\nYou touch her tummy, and she makes little singing sounds and she's super cute. Well, I was showing her to my husband and I heard some other sounds that I'd never heard before.\n\nAnd if you look down here -- I figured a video was the way -- so I just touched her tummy and she's going to sing for a minute. But down here is a button, right here on her privates, and if you push those, she makes these sounds.\n\n(doll sounds Boop! Whee! Uhh! Ooh!)\n\nLike a gasping sound.\n\nAnd I know some of you might not, like, think this is a big deal, but especially since I've had kids -- this is wrong. \n\nFor one, this button -- it says nothing about this button on the box, nothing. It's just, it's just there. And it makes a gasping sound when you touch her privates. And to me it's just like sexual sounds and it's so disturbing.\n\nThe marketing materials for the doll don't say there is a button on the bottom, but they do reveal that it makes sounds when it is put in a seated position, according to the Hasbro product descriptions. \"When you sit her down, she makes other funny sounds, too!,\" the description reads.\n\nThis version of the \"Poppy\" doll, \"Giggle 'n Sing Poppy,\" is one of a number of \"Poppy\" dolls that was created by Hasbro for the new Trolls movie, \"Trolls World Tour,\" that was released in April 2020. Not all of the \"Poppy\" dolls have this button, according to Julie Duffy, the senior vice president of global communications for Hasbro:\n\nHasbro is \"in the process of removing the item for purchase,\" Duffy said.\n\nThe earliest version of the video we have been able to find was posted on Saturday, August 1, 2020. Lead Stories has reached out to the woman who appears to be the person who produced it. It has since been copied many times and reshared.", "lang": "en"}
