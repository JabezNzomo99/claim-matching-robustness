You can\u2019t get much more toxic than TBHQ. This synthetic preservative is created from butane (a very toxic gas) and has been linked to vision disturbances, liver enlargement, childhood behavioral problems, and stomach cancer in animal studies. New research coming out of Michigan State University links it to the rise in food allergies, which has prompted more research. Although the FDA allows this in America, this additive is banned for use in food in other countries including Japan, and is on the Center For Science in The Public Interest\u2019s list as one of the worst additives to be avoided in our food. Please share! #FoodBabeArmy\n\nTBHQ, tertiary butylhydroquinone, is a synthetic antioxidant that is commonly used as a food preservative. Although TBHQ does contain a butyl moiety, this does not mean that the preservative is \u201ccreated from butane\u201d (which is commonly used as lighter fluid).\n\nIn response to a similar claim made in 2007 about McDonald\u2019s Chicken McNuggets, the ScienceBlogs web site explained TBHQ\u2019s relationship to butane:\n\nTBHQ contains a butyl moiety (a tert-butyl moiety, more accurately), but so does butter, which contains esters of the blameless butyrate (when degraded to free butyrate, it\u2019s the origin of the smell of rancid butter, esterified, as in fresh butter, it\u2019s not a problem). Butter is not lighter fluid, nor is TBHQ. A butyl group does not butane make. It\u2019s worth noting that preservatives might not be entirely benign (you also encounter BHT and BHA, your cereal box\u2019s cardboard is probably impregnated with one of these). However, none of these are lighter fluid by a long shot.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that TBHQ has been banned in Japan, it is not \u201ctoxic,\u201d as the FDA and the European Food Safety Authority both classify TBHQ as a safe food additive in the small amounts present in foods such as Cheez-It snack crackers.\n\nIn response to the message posted by \u201cFood Babe,\u201d Cheez-It stated on their Facebook page that they have been testing natural alternatives to TBHQ:\n\nWhile synthetic preservatives may not be the healthiest of options, TBHQ is not \u201ccreated from butane,\u201d it is not \u201ctoxic, nor is it been deemed by the FDA to be dangerous to consume in moderate quantities.", "lang": "en"}
