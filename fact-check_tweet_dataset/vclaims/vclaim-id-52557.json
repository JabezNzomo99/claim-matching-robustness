Another post mentions that a Mexican family in the U.S. also recovered through this method.\n\nWe fact-checked the above information and found it to be fake.\n\nWe checked the official WHO website for any such cures and came across an article dated April 19, 2020, which mentions the effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on Coronavirus patients.\n\nIn its conclusion, the article mentions: At present, there is no evidence of severe adverse events, acute health care utilization, long-term survival, or quality of life in patients with COVID-19, as a result of the use of NSAIDs.\n\nIn fact, we also found an article in The Guardian, dated March 14, 2020, stating that anti-inflammatory drugs may aggravate COVID-19, as per authorities in France.\n\nFurther, we also checked the WHO website for cures for Covid-19. It clearly states that there is no cure, drug, or treatment for COVID-19 as of now.\n\nHence, there is no evidence, treatment, or cure of COVID-19 using aspirin. The claims are, thus, false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
