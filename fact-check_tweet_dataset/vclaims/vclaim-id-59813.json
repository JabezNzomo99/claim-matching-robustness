Rafale on the way\u201d reads the tweet.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the tweet was made by a parody Twitter account of Macron. The Twitter bio of the account itself mentions that.\n\nHowever, social media users, believing that the tweet by made by the French President himself retweeted and shared screenshots of the same in thousands. Till the time of writing this article, Macron has not commented on the arrival of the first batch of five Rafale jets from France to India.\n\nWhile retweeting the viral tweet, many users have thanked Macron for delivering the Rafales to India. The archived version of the tweet can be seen here.\n\nThe account, created in January this year, has around 6,000 followers, most of whom are Indians. The handle \u201c@MacronEmmauel\u201d is very similar to the actual Twitter profile of the French President, which is \u201c@EmmanuelMacron\u201d, thus confusing many.\n\nThe simplest way to call out a fake or parody account of bigger personalities is the absence of a blue tick, which the real account of Macron must have. When the account was created in January, it liked many unrelated tweets of random Indian users, an action highly unlikely by Macron.\n\nAnother tweet by this account, related to the delivery of Rafales to India, has also gone viral. \u201cCongratulations INDIA. Finally, we have delivered the first batch of Rafale Jets to you,\u201d reads the tweet.\n\nWe checked the verified Twitter account of Macron and found that until the writing of this article, he has not tweeted anything related to the landing of Rafales in India on July 29.\n\nIn September 2018, Macron had broken his silence on the Rafale controversy, saying it was a government-to-government discussion and he was not in charge when the Rafale deal was signed.\n\nBefore that, in an interview with India Today, Macron said that if the Narendra Modi government wants to disclose some of the critical information covered under the secrecy clause of the deal, France would not object to it.", "lang": "en"}
