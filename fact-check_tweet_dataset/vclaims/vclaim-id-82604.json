The video is being circulated as that from the deadly attack in Pulwama.\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search of several frames from the video and found out that it is originally of an Improvised Explosive Device (IED), packed in one of the trucks passing the convoy near Camp Taji in Iraq. The video was uploaded by multiple YouTube users as early as April 2008. The dateline of the CCTV video, at the time of filming the explosion is that of 9/2/ 2007.\n\nThe video is corroborated by another user Brian Spalding, who had uploaded the video on Youtube in December, 2008. \u201cThis is a vbied ied right outside of the gate at camp Taji iraq sep 02 2007 I was laying in bed watching a movie when I heard the explosion, and the room shook and blew out the windows. My living quarters were 1/4 mile away.\u201d\n\nA VBIED is a car, lorry, truck bomb, also known as a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) and is an explosive device placed inside cars or other vehicles and detonated.\n\nBrian Spalding\u2019s statement has also been acknowledged by eyewitnesses of the US army, who were stationed at the Taji camp in 2007. A news report compiling attacks in Iraq mentioned multiple bomb attacks on September 2, 2007.\n\nBOOM cannot independently verify the details of the attack in Iraq in the absence of credible news reports. However, we can say that the video is not from Kashmir.\n\nThis is not the only video that is claiming to be from the Pulwama attack. Earlier on Saturday, BOOM was the first website to debunk a video of an explosion at a Syrian-Turkish checkpoint that claimed to be from Pulwama.\n\nALSO READ - Syria Blast Video Falsely Shared As CCTV Footage Of Pulwama Attack", "lang": "en"}
