Most prominent and oft-repeated one among these claims is that \u2018COVID-19 is an artificial virus prepared in a Chinese lab\u2019. More recently, the theory found support in Union minister and senior BJP leader, Nitin Gadkari. In an interview to NDTV on Wednesday, 13 May, Gadkari said that the novel coronavirus is not a natural virus and people will have to learn the art of living with it. \u201cWe have to understand the art of living with corona. This is not a natural virus. It is an artificial virus and now many countries in the whole world \u2013 they are researching on it for a vaccine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vaccine is not available. It is expected that a vaccine will be available as soon as possible, then there will be no problem,\u201d he added. Before Gadkari, the \u2018lab origin\u2019 theory has also been endorsed by top US politicians including President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and media outlets like The Washington Times. WHO, MEDICAL JOURNALS, EXPERTS \u2013 ALL DENY THE THEORY The theory of the novel coronavirus being an artificial lab-made virus has few takers in the scientist, doctors and virologist communities. In a report published on 23 April, the World Health Organisation (WHO) stated that data studied so far suggests that the virus has a natural animal origin. \u201cAll available evidence for COVID-19 suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic source. Many researchers have been able to look at the genomic features of SARS-CoV-2 and have found that evidence does not support that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory construct,\u201d the report reads. Another analysis by a group of researchers, which was published by Nature Medicine in March, shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not a \u2018laboratory construct\u2019 or a \u2018purposefully manipulated virus\u2019. These researchers studied the genomic data of SARS-CoV-2 to discover how the virus mutated into the virulent version that the whole world is struggling to contain. \u201cIt is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus,\u201d the study reads. Further, the researchers have explained two plausible origins of the virus, which includes:\n\u2022 Natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer. And before this study, a report published by as many as 27 non-Chinese scientists in the renowned science journal The Lancet, dismissed the possibility of the virus being artificial. \u201cThe rapid, open, and transparent sharing of data on this outbreak is now being threatened by rumours and misinformation around its origins. We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,\u201d the report stated.

Even the US National Intelligence Director\u2019s office released a statement on 30 April, underlining that the virus wasn\u2019t man made. \u201cThe Intelligence community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not man made or genetically modified,\u201d the statement read.

While the origin of the conspiracy theory is unknown, there were unsubstantiated rumours which were doing the rounds on the internet in January and February. Users on various social media platforms made these claims and several fact-checkers had called them out. Even The Quint had debunked this claim earlier in February. We have also found some that some of these claims originated from fictional pieces that appeared on websites like Reddit for entertainment purpose, and were passed around as facts on WhatsApp and other platforms. Some were even falsely attributed to experts to lend credence. But, none of them have been substantiated or backed by evidence. The outbreak of COVID-19 in December last year has pushed countries into lockdown and scientists, pathologists, doctors and virologists across the globe are working round the clock to study its nature and develop a vaccine. But, no medical research has corroborated this theory. Overcrowded Train Carries Migrants From Mumbai to WB? Video is Old You can read all our fact-checked stories here.", "lang": "en"}
