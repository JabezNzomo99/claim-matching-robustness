We searched and found that it is an image manipulation and contest website, that holds contests on different themes and allows many digital creators to showcase their skills.\n\nWe also found that the website has now been renamed as Design Crowd.\n\nSo, we put the picture through a Reverse Image Search along with the keyword and found the picture on Design Crowd.\n\nAccording to the website, the above picture was edited by a user called \u2018Whitmath57\u2018 from the United States. The website also states that it was created by the American designer on 14th August 2011 for DesignCrowd\u2019s contest \u2018Size Matters 4\u2019.\n\nMoreover, we also looked for reports of any such discovery in Kurukshetra but did not find any credible reports on the matter.\n\nHence, from the above information, it is clear that the posts in circulation are false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
