The pictures have gone viral with the claim that this is for the first time in India\u2019s history that lakhs of Shiva Lingas were seen in Karnataka\u2019s Shivakashi river after water levels dropped.\n\nThe caption in Hindi along with the viral images translates to, \u201cFor the first time in the history of India, lakhs of Shiva Lingas were seen in Karnataka\u2019s Shivakashi river after water levels dropped. Har Har Mahadev! Sanatan culture continues to give evidence of its grand history. Wake up Hindus, recognise Sanatan culture. It\u2019s the best. Be proud to say that we are Hindus.\u201d\n\nThe archived versions of some of the posts can be seen here and here.\n\nAFWA probe Reverse-searching the images, we found a similar picture on the official website of Uttara Kannada district. As per the website, the picture is from Sahasralinga, situated on the banks of Shalmala river in Karnataka\u2019s Uttara Kannada district. Sahasralinga in Sanskrit means 1,000 idols, and the place is famous for its 1,000 Shiva Lingas.\n\nThe website further says that Sahasralinga is an important eco-tourism spot in the district and also attracts thousands of devotees on Shivaratri. According to the district administration, these lingas were carved between 1678 and 1718 AD, under the patronage of then king of Sirsi, Arasappa Nayak, for his descendants.\n\nWe also found the viral images in a blog from 2011. This means the images are not recent and at least nine years old.\n\nAccording to some travel blogs, the best time to see these idols is from October to March when water levels in the river are low. Most of the lingas get submerged in monsoon.\n\nSimilar claims regarding the Shiva Lingas went viral two years back as well and \u201cThe Times of India\u201d had then debunked it.\n\nTherefore, the claim that lakhs of Shiva Lingas were seen in Karnataka\u2019s Shivakashi river is misleading. Some 1,000 Shiva Lingas are on the banks of Shalmala river in Karnataka\u2019s Uttara Kannada district. For years, it has been a popular pilgrimage destination.", "lang": "en"}
