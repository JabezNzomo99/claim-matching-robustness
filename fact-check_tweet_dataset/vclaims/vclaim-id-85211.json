{"title": "Fact-checking President Trump\u2019s inaugural address", "subtitle": "President Trump painted a portrait of the United States that often was at variance with reality.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2017-01-20T20:54:42Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85211", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/01/20/fact-checking-president-trumps-inaugural-address/", "vclaim": "Among the 25 most populous metropolitan areas, the D.C. metro area has the highest median income in the nation \u2014 $93,294 versus a U.S. median of $55,775 \u2014 though growth has slowed in recent years, in part because of reductions in defense spending. Indeed, income in the D.C. area has grown essentially at the same rate as the rest of the nation since 2006, including a dip in median income during the Great Recession.\n\nAs we have repeatedly pointed out, violent and property crimes overall have been declining for about two decades, and are far below rates seen one or two decades ago. Homicides have spiked in major cities in 2015 and 2016, but the rates remain far below their peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nAs for subsidizing the armies of other countries, Trump appears to be referring to military bases that the United States has overseas. A 2013 Senate report found that the United States spent $10 billion a year on bases abroad, with 70 percent focused on three countries \u2014 Germany, South Korea and Japan. Germany is the center of European defense obligations, while the troops in Japan are the core of U.S. projection of power in Asia. The troops in Korea deter an attack by North Korea. Given a defense budget of more than $500 billion, the cost of maintaining these bases is a mere pittance.\n\nAs for the \u201cvery sad depletion\u201d of the U.S. military, this is hyper-exaggeration. One can argue about whether the military budget should be boosted, but there is no question that the U.S. military is stronger and more capable than any other nation\u2019s. The website Globalfirepower.com ranks countries based on 45 factors, and the United States tops the charts. Here\u2019s one small statistic: The United States has 19 aircraft and helicopter carriers, as of the end of last year; no other country has more than four.\n\nSo Trump only gets to \u201ctrillions and trillions of dollars\u201d by including wars. The Iraq war is estimated to have cost $1.7 trillion through 2013, though one estimate says that the cost will rise to $6 trillion through 2053, primarily from paying the interest on the debt incurred to wage the war because the Bush administration chose not to raise the taxes to pay for it. But we doubt Iraqis would say the war made the country \u201crich.\u201d\n\nSome analysts calculate that between 1 million and 2 million U.S. jobs were lost after China was admitted to the World Trade Organization in 2000. But economists believe the biggest factor in the decline in manufacturing is automation, not jobs going overseas. Another factor is decreased consumer spending on manufactured goods. A new report by the Congressional Research Service notes that \u201cemployment in manufacturing has fallen in most major manufacturing countries over the past quarter-century,\u201d so the U.S. experience is not unusual.", "lang": "en"}
