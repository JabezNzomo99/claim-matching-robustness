The claim is false; the footage has actually been taken from a Chinese television programme that shows Zhong visiting a hospital ward in 2016.\n\nThe video was published in this Facebook post on February 18, 2020. It has been viewed more than 5,700 times.\n\nThe 15-second clip shows Zhong speaking in Mandarin with a hospital patient lying on a bed. Their comments can be translated to English as:\n\nPatient: \"...not sure if caused by serious coughing.\"\n\n Zhong: \"I see, coughing is serious. Let me discuss with Director Chen.\"\n\n Patient: \"Sorry to trouble you.\"\n\n Zhong: \"Will discuss, take it easy.\"\n\n Patient: \"Save me.\"\n\n Zhong: \"Yes, take it easy. You are still young.\"\n\nThe logo for Douyin, the Chinese version of video-sharing app TikTok, can be seen in the bottom right-hand corner of the video.\n\nThe Facebook post\u2019s traditional Chinese-language caption translates to English as: \u201cProfessor Lin Zhengbin is the leader in the field of organ transplantation in China. When academician Zhong Nanshan visited Professor Lin, the top professional of the country, Professor Lin begged, \u2018save me!\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying to see academician Zhong wearing such little protective equipment!\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nZhong is a prominent scientist at China\u2019s National Health Commission who helped expose the scale of the SARS outbreak that killed hundreds of people in both mainland China and Hong Kong in 2003.\n\nProfessor Lin, a chief physician at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, who died of novel coronavirus at the age of 62 on February 10, 2020, according to Health Times, a newspaper published by Chinese state media People\u2019s Daily.\n\nAs of February 26, COVID-19 has killed more than 2,600 people and infected almost 80,000 others, mostly in China, according to this AFP report.\n\nThe same footage of Zhong was also shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook here, here and here; on Twitter here, here and here; and on YouTube here and here.\n\nThe claim is false; the footage has been taken from a television programme broadcast by Chinese state media channel CCTV in 2016. It shows Zhong meeting with a 71-year-old patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that year.\n\nThe same footage was found in this episode of the programme, Great Masters, which was published on CCTV\u2019s science and education YouTube channel on October 12, 2016.\n\nThe video\u2019s simplified Chinese headline translates to English as: \u201c20161012 Great Masters respiratory specialist Zhong Nanshan\u201d.
