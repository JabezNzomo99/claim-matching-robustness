Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is misleading.\n\nThe post shared on Facebook reads: \u201cLive in under the sun\u2026. cause UV ray can kill CORONA Virus \u2026 take care everybody\u2026. we will be better soon i believe that\u2026 pray more / eat well / sleep well and stay at home.\u201d The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nWe searched on Google using appropriate keywords and found a report on the website of BBC Future titled: Can you kill coronavirus with UV light? As per the article \u201cThough there hasn\u2019t been any research looking at how UVC affects Covid-19 specifically, studies have shown that it can be used against other coronaviruses, SARS.\u201d The report in BBC Future quotes Dan Arnold, who works for UV Light Technology, a company that provides disinfecting equipment in the UK.\n\nWe further researched and found a Youtube video published by South China Morning Post\u2019s channel titled: Shanghai introduces ultraviolet light to disinfect public buses. As per the video, ultraviolet (UV) light can be used at extremely high intensities as a disinfectant.\n\nAs per World Health Organization (WHO), \u201cUV radiation can cause skin irritation and damage your eyes. Cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing your hands with soap and water are the most effective ways to remove the virus.\u201d WHO also suggests that ultra-violet lamps should not be used as a disinfectant for hands or areas of skin.\n\nVishvas News spoke to Prof. Shailendra K. Saxena, Professor & Head, Centre for Advanced Research (CFAR), King George\u2019s Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow. He said: \u201cIt is true that Sun exposure raises a person\u2019s vitamin D levels, reducing the incidence of acute respiratory infection. But, while exposure to sunlight is generally considered beneficial, it does not help get rid of COVID-19. Ultra-violet radiation destroys viruses, but there is not enough UV radiation in sunlight to accomplish this.\u201c\n\nHe added: \u201cUV light waves damage the DNA structure in the chromosomes of living organisms. DNA does have a \u2018repair mechanism\u2019, but this appears to work for mild exposure. Therefore, exposing viruses to a concentrated amount of UV light would kill the viruses. However, these viruses would have to be on exposed surfaces for this to work.\u201d\n\nThe post is shared on Facebook by a user named Darli Thiri Aung. We scanned the profile of the user and found that she has 2576 followers.\n\nThe post claiming UV rays from sunlight kill coronavirus is misleading. Ultra-violet radiation destroys viruses, but there is not enough UV radiation in sunlight to accomplish this.\n\nDisclaimer: The #CoronavirusFacts database records fact-checks published since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak.
