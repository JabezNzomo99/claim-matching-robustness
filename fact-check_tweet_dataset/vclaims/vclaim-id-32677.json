The words gained traction after the journalist shared a video of a mob chanting \u201cJai Shri Ram\u201d and \u201cHinduon ka Hindustan\u201d planted a saffron flag atop a mosque in Delhi. Ayyub later took down the video after Tehseen Poonawala claimed that it is unrelated to protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Ayyub has now posted the video again after confirming its authenticity.\n\nPoonawala, in response, attached a statement by DCP North West, Delhi which says that no mosque has been damaged in Ashok Vihar area.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Poonawalla retweeted ANI\u2019s tweet which has over 8,000 likes. Since then several users have claimed that Ayyub was circulating false information.\n\nMany individuals including Sadhvi Khosla called for the arrest of Ayyub. Ramesh Solanki claimed that Ayyub shared a two-year-old video from Bihar and wrote that he has filed a police complaint against the journalist.\n\nTimes Now broadcast a show on the DCP\u2019s statement and declared that the video was \u201cfake\u201d. Right-wing website OpIndia penned a report on unverified social media claims, saying that the outlet doesn\u2019t vouch for the authenticity of the allegations.\n\nThe Wire\u2019s Naomi Barton reported that the mosque in question is in Ashok Nagar (which was earlier described as Ashok Vihar but rectified). Alt News found a higher resolution video of a mob climbing atop the minaret and hoisting a saffron flag.\n\nA YouTube user uploaded a video of the incident from a different angle.\n\nBarton tweeted that she personally saw the flag on top of the minaret and witnessed a footwear shop underneath the mosque being looted.\n\nSpeaking with Alt News, she informed that the name of the mosque is Badi Masjid. Barton was accompanied by journalist Avichal Dubey who shot photographs of the mosque. Dubey shared a close-up image with Alt News.\n\nAccording to the EXIF data of the photograph, it was shot on February 25 at 3:57 pm.\n\nThe Wire had also uploaded a video of water hoses being used to dose the fire in the mosque. Heavy smoke is seen coming out of the building, same as in the viral video and the image shared by Dubey. The journalist shared another video with Alt News where firefighters can be seen at the same spot. However, the most important portion of the clip starts at the 13th-second mark when the same minaret, where the saffron flag was planted, is visible.\n\nA place of worship, Badi Masjid, in Ashok Nagar was indeed set on fire by a mob. This was also confirmed to us by a local on the condition of anonymity.\n\nSeveral social users falsely claimed that the video is two years old when a similar incident had taken place in Bihar\u2019s Samastipur. It is noteworthy that another mosque was vandalised in Delhi however this was in Gokulpuri area and is a separate incident.\n\nWhile DCP North-West Delhi\u2019s statement that no mosque was vandalised in Ashok Vihar is true, ANI and Times Now did not clarify that the incident took place in Ashok Nagar. This gave rise to the misinformation that no such incident occurred.", "lang": "en"}
