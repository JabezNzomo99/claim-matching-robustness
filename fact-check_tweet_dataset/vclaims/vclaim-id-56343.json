The claim is false; the accusation was originally published in a satirical article; a spokesperson for Aly's show The Project said the claim had \u201cno basis of truth or fact whatsoever\".\n\nThe claim about Aly was published on Twitter here on June 21, 2020. The post has since been retweeted more than 300 times.\n\nThe tweet reads: \u201cWaleed Aly applauds African gang who assaulted young girl at train station for \u2018courageously standing up to white privilege\u2019. Get him off our tv and out of this country - his views are obscenely at odds with the Australian way of life.\u201d\n\nOther instances of the misleading claim appeared here, here and here on Twitter and here and here on Facebook.\n\nBut the claim is false; the accusation appears to have originated from a satirical article and has been refuted by The Project, the Australian news and current affairs programme that Aly has co-hosted since 2015.\n\nThe claim was published here in the satirical section of a website called XYZ on June 19. The article is titled: \u201cWaleed Aly applauds African gang who assaulted young girl at train station for \u2018courageously standing up to white privilege\u2019\u201d.\n\nThe satirical article reads in part: \u201cProject panellist Waleed Aly has applauded the assault of a white teenage girl at Southern Cross Train Station in Melbourne earlier in the week, lauding the attack as a \u2018stunning and brave assault on white privilege.\u2019\n\n\"In a 15-minute lecture on The Project last night that some critics have claimed was \u2018Waleed at his patronising, race-baiting best,\u2019 Aly had to hold back tears several times as he narrated the gang\u2019s \u2018struggle against systemic oppression.\u2019\u201d\n\nA day before the satirical article was published, Melbourne newspaper Herald Sun reported here on June 18 about a viral video that purportedly shows an attack targeting a 16-year-old girl at Southern Cross train station in Melbourne.\n\nThe term \"African gang\" was adopted by conservative media to describe young people of African appearance who had committed violent offences in Victoria since the mid-2000s. However, Victoria Police had raised doubts over whether the term had overstated the issue, The Guardian reported here in January 2018.\n\nIn response to the satirical article, The Project stated here on its verified Twitter account that the claim has \u201cno basis of truth or fact whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you\u2019ll see at the top of the article, it says \u2018satire\u2019. Incredibly poor taste, but essentially someone has written this thinking it\u2019s funny or clever. It has no basis of truth or fact whatsoever,\u201d the tweet reads.\n\nSusan Carland, Aly\u2019s wife, also responded to the claim here on Twitter, stating that the article was \u201cnot real\u201d.\n\nCarland added in another tweet here: \u201cTo clarify: I\u2019m not upset. Weird & blatantly untrue things about my husband are merrily posted online regularly & most I ignore (\u2018someone\u2019s wrong on the internet\u2019 isn\u2019t a way to live a life). But this astounded me because so many people believed something so obviously fake.\u201d\n\nNetwork Ten, which airs The Project, and Creative Representation, Aly\u2019s management agency, did not immediately respond to requests for comment by AFP.", "lang": "en"}
