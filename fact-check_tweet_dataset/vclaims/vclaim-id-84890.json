However, he said out of 30,000 emails that Clinton returned to the State Department, 110 emails in 52 email chains were found \u201cto contain classified information at the time they were sent or received\u201d \u2014 a contradiction to Clinton\u2019s original, technical wording about whether or not classified materials were in her emails. Eight of the chains contained information that was \u201ctop secret\u201d at the time they were sent. Thirty-six chains contained \u201csecret\u201d information. Eight contained \u201cconfidential\u201d information, the lowest classification.\n\nA Clinton campaign official sent the following comment in response to Comey\u2019s announcement: \u201cWe have not seen the emails the Director is referring to. We heard this for the first time when it was announced on TV, just like everyone else. The Secretary and campaign always have spoken to the best of our knowledge. And it was not just the campaign \u2013 but also the State Department, which also reviewed these emails \u2013 that had said none of these emails were marked classified. The bottom line is that career officials handling this case have determined that no further action by the Department is appropriate. And that there was no intent to do anything wrong. That is the main takeaway here.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
