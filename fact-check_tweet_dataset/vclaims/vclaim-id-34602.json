He was the first big-name movie star to enlist in World War II. An accomplished private pilot, the 33-year-old Hollywood icon became a US Army Air Force aviator, earning his 2nd Lieutenant commission in early 1942. With his celebrity status and huge popularity with the American public, he was assigned to starring in recruiting films, attending rallies, and training younger pilots. Stewart, however, wasn\u2019t satisfied. He wanted to fly combat missions in Europe, not spend time in a stateside training command. By 1944, frustrated and feeling the war was passing him by, he asked his commanding officer to transfer him to a unit deploying to Europe. His request was reluctantly granted. Stewart, now a Captain, was sent to England, where he spent the next 18 months flying B-24 Liberator bombers over Germany. Throughout his time overseas, the US Army Air Corps\u2019 top brass had tried to keep the popular movie star from flying over enemy territory. But Stewart would hear nothing of it. Determined to lead by example, he bucked the system, assigning himself to every combat mission he could. By the end of the war he was one of the most respected and decorated pilots in his unit. But his wartime service came at a high personal price. In the final months of WWII he was grounded for being \u201cflak happy,\u201d today called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). When he returned to the US in August 1945, Stewart was a changed man. He had lost so much weight that he looked sickly. He rarely slept, and when he did he had nightmares of planes exploding and men falling through the air screaming (in one mission alone his unit had lost 13 planes and 130 men, most of whom he knew personally). He was depressed, couldn\u2019t focus, and refused to talk to anyone about his war experiences. His acting career was all but over. As one of Stewart\u2019s biographers put it, \u201cEvery decision he made [during the war] was going to preserve life or cost lives. He took back to Hollywood all the stress that he had built up.\u201d In 1946 he got his break. He took the role of George Bailey, the suicidal father in \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life.\u201d The rest is history. Actors and crew of the set realized that in many of the disturbing scenes of George Bailey unraveling in front of his family, Stewart wasn\u2019t acting. His PTSD was being captured on filmed for potentially millions to see. But despite Stewart\u2019s inner turmoil, making the movie was therapeutic for the combat veteran. He would go on to become one of the most accomplished and loved actors in American history. When asked in 1941 why he wanted to leave his acting career to fly combat missions over Nazi Germany, he said, \u201cThis country\u2019s conscience is bigger than all the studios in Hollywood put together, and the time will come when we\u2019ll have to fight.\u201d This weekend, as many of us watch the classic Christmas film, \u201cIt\u2019s A Wonderful Life,\u201d it\u2019s also a fitting time to remember the sacrifices of Jimmy Stewart and all the men who gave up so much to serve their country during wartime. We will always remember you! Postscript: While fighting in Europe, Stewart\u2019s Oscar statue was proudly displayed in his father\u2019s Pennsylvania hardware store. Throughout his life, the beloved actor always said his father, a World War I veteran, was the person who had made the biggest impact on him. Jimmy Stewart was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1985 and died in 1997 at the age of 89.\n\nIt\u2019s a stirring account, and one firmly rooted in an accurate presentation of the basic sequence of events of Stewart\u2019s involvement in World War II. However, elements of the story \u2014 the claim that Stewart was removed from flying missions over Germany because he suffered from PTSD, and descriptions of him suffering nightmares of \u201cmen falling through the air screaming\u201d \u2014 appear to be rather thinly sourced and not corroborated in other accounts of the actor\u2019s military service.\n\nThe version of events presented in the meme appears to have borrowed heavily from a 2016 book by the nonfiction writer Robert Matzen, called \u201cMission: Jimmy Stewart and the Fight for Europe.\u201d The book charted Stewart\u2019s early career as an actor, his friendships and relationships, his family\u2019s history of military service, his famously close and affectionate bond with his father, and his entry into military service during World War II.\n\nHowever, the book attracted attention in the media for the revelatory claim that Stewart had suffered from what would now be diagnosed as PTSD, as a result of the horrors of flying 20 bombing missions over Germany, to such an extent that Stewart had to withdraw from combat missions, and that his trauma was visible to those on the set of \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what Matzen wrote in the book itself about Stewart\u2019s state of mind after returning to Hollywood from the war:\n\nOn several occasions throughout the book, Matzen described Stewart as \u201cflak happy,\u201d a World War II-era phrase for symptoms of anxiety, sleeplessness, nightmares, and so on, which would now likely be diagnosed as PTSD. In one instance, he cited an interview he conducted with Lt. Barry Shillito, a fellow pilot and contemporary of Stewart\u2019s, as follows:\n\n\u201c\u2026 Shillito was shocked at the change in his old squadron commander. Stewart was gray of face, with bags under his eyes and a furrowed brow. His full head of hair had begun to recede and was half silver. Jim had grown so thin that the skin hung from his neck. It was almost as if Jim Stewart had been imprisoned like the others. \u2018He went flak happy there for a while,\u2019 said Shillito. \u2018He wasn\u2019t flying anymore and he was quieter than I remembered.'\u201d\n\nThe specific claim that Stewart had suffered nightmares about \u201cplanes exploding and men falling through the air screaming\u201d appears to be of dubious origins. It comes from the prologue of Matzen\u2019s book, which is in several places written in an impressionistic style, mixing third-person narration with first-person, stream-of-consciousness prose, the latter a style that does not lend itself well to source-checking. The book reads:\n\n\u201cIn every newspaper, in every magazine were stories about families who didn\u2019t recognize the boys who had come home. This isn\u2019t my son. This isn\u2019t my husband; this isn\u2019t my brother. He\u2019s so cold, so distant, and the rages, the nightmares!\n\n\u201cOh yes, the nightmares came every night. There he was on oxygen at 20,000 feet with 190s zipping past, spraying lead and firing rockets, flak bursting about the cockpit. B-24s hit, burning, spinning out of formation. Bail out! Do you see any chutes? How many chutes? Whose ship was it? Oh no, not him! Not them! Bodies, pieces of bodies smacking off the windshield \u2026\u201d\n\nIn the chapter notes, Matzen wrote the following about the sourcing for the prologue:\n\n\u201cThe prologue was written last and drew upon all the research that came before. I interviewed dozens of Armed Services personnel about the experience of coming home from wartime and their feelings of unreality and disconnectedness from friends, family and co-workers who couldn\u2019t possibly understand what had happened overseas.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly plausible that Stewart, who led and took part in multiple bombing missions, might have experienced nightmares or had traumatic memories of those difficult experiences. However, the \u201cexploding planes\u201d claim serves as a useful warning about describing what might be a general impression of the collective experience of World War II aviators as a specific experience that Stewart himself personally had.\n\nThe Facebook post\u2019s claim that Stewart was \u201cgrounded for being \u2018flak happy'\u201d is also factually dubious. The broader assertion that Stewart had to fight to be allowed to fly combat missions, and play a more active part in the war, is fully corroborated in two other sources that we consulted: \u201cJimmy Stewart: The Truth Behind the Legend,\u201d a book by the film historian Michael Munn; and \u201cJimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot,\u201d a book by Starr Smith, an author and journalist who worked alongside Stewart as an Eighth Air Force intelligence officer during World War II.\n\nAccording to all three sources, the \u201chigher-ups\u201d within the U.S. military preferred to deploy Stewart\u2019s fame and widespread respect among the American population by using him for propaganda purposes, morale-raising exercises, and to encourage other young men to enlist. However, Stewart was persistent in requesting combat missions, and was eventually stationed in England where he led or took part in 20 bombing missions over Germany.\n\nNeither Munn nor Smith\u2019s accounts describe Stewart as \u201cflak happy,\u201d \u201cshell-shocked,\u201d or suffering from what would now be diagnosed as PTSD. Neither account describes any nightmares or obvious trauma on Stewart\u2019s part, in detail, and neither book ascribes his supposed condition as the reason he was withdrawn from combat missions towards the end of the war.\n\nRather, according to Smith, Stewart was promoted and moved in the spring of 1944, as part of what Smith describes in his book as a natural progression in his military career, given his frequently commended performance as a bomber pilot and squadron leader:\n\n\u201c\u2026 Toward the end of March [1944], the news came: Major Stewart had been promoted. After flying twelve missions with the 445th Group and commanding the 703rd Squadron, he was leaving to become the operations officer of the 453rd Group, at Attleborough, or Old Buc \u2026 When the appointment was announced, nothing was said about \u201cflying too many missions.\u201d The official word was that the 453rd needed an operations officer, and Major Stewart had been promoted to the job. I was then a combat intelligence officer with the 453rd, and met Stewart for the first time upon his arrival at Old Buc \u2026 Since then, I have been asked many times about it. I must say that I think it highly unlikely that Stewart\u2019s mission schedule and high command\u2019s efforts to \u201cprotect\u201d him had any bearing on his transfer and promotion.\u201d\n\nSmith speculates, in the book, that Col. Bob Terrill, with whom Stewart had a close affinity, might have lobbied for the transfer, but otherwise describes it as \u201ca routine air force change of assignment,\u201d adding:\n\n\u201cStewart was a mature, knowledgeable and experienced air force officer with an operational and administrative background. And a stellar combat record. He knew the territory. In short, he was ready for promotion. And deserved it.\u201d\n\nMatzen\u2019s depiction of Stewart\u2019s state of mind as \u201cflak happy\u201d towards the end of World War II (a depiction reflected in Forney\u2019s viral Facebook post) was relatively thinly sourced, and involved only one direct quotation from a person who met the actor at that time.\n\nBy contrast, two other detailed accounts of Stewart\u2019s World War II service make no mention of his having suffered symptoms equivalent to PTSD, nor claimed that such symptoms were the cause of his being gradually withdrawn from combat missions as the fighting reached its conclusion. One of those accounts was written by an Air Force intelligence officer who worked side-by-side with Stewart between the spring of 1944 and the end of the war.\n\nHowever, we don\u2019t have definitive evidence in either direction. Since \u201cflak happy\u201d is an inherently rather fuzzy description of symptoms, rather than a specific clinical diagnosis, it\u2019s perfectly plausible that Shillito might have seen in Stewart\u2019s demeanor clear signs of the condition (an appraisal he passed on to Matzen) whereas others who encountered him might have come to a completely different conclusion, either due to their own subjective point of view, or because Stewart acted differently around them.\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt that much of the account presented in Forney\u2019s viral Facebook post was accurate. Stewart pushed back against bureaucratic delays and hesitation among military leadership and persistently requested to be allowed to play a more active role in the war effort, rather than being a mere \u201cposter boy.\u201d While stationed in England, he flew and led 20 combat missions over Germany, and received promotions and commendations, in particular for his leadership of those around him. Naturally, he keenly felt any loss of life and later described the fear he routinely felt when embarking on bombing missions.\n\nHowever, the available evidence is indecisive on the question of whether Stewart was so acutely affected by the horrors of World War II that he suffered nightmares, anxiety, and traumatic memories that would, today, amount to a diagnosis of PTSD. And the available evidence points against any such condition being the reason that he was gradually withdrawn from combat missions.", "lang": "en"}
