Amidst the excitement regarding the same, a video of \u2018Dhol Tasha\u2019 (drums) group performing on the streets of Spain, is doing the rounds on social media, with a claim that Indians have started celebrating in Spain.\n\nThe Facebook caption read, \u201cIndians have already started * celebrations * in Spain on this occasion of building Rama\u2019s temple in ram land in Ayodhya.\u201d\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found it to be false.\n\nAfter breaking down the video into keyframes via InVID, we ran a Google Reverse Image Search and found a similar video on dated October 16, 2018. The video was titled, \u2018Dhol Tasha on the streets of Spain(Part-1): Swargandhar Dhol Tasha Pathak\u2019.\n\nFurther, we found the second part of the video in the suggestion box of that was also uploaded on the same day by the same Youtube channel.\n\nOn putting keywords \u2018Swargandhar Dhol Tasha Pathak\u2019 and \u2018Spain\u2019 on Google Search, we found an invite on a Facebook Page named \u2018Catalunyaar\u2019 dated June 17, 2018. In the invite, there was a caption that said that Swargandhar Dhol Tasha Pathak will take their first tour to Spain.\n\nThe Facebook post read: Spain says Hola\u2026!!!! Its time to greet Holaaaaa with our Namaste\u2026. Its time to allure Spain with the folk music of India\u2026!!

On that page, we found a similar that was recorded live, about 2 years ago, along with many more such videos.\n\nMoreover, it should also be noted that during the ongoing pandemic, it is essential for every individual to wear a mask, but when we look at the video, nobody is wearing a mask.\n\nIn conclusion, the video of Dhol Tasha performance on the streets of Spain is not for the occasion of building Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.
