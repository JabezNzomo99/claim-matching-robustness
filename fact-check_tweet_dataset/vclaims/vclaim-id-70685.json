Inequality has deepened. Upward mobility has stalled. The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by - let alone get ahead. And too many still aren't working at all.\"\n\nHere, we will check Obama\u2019s claim that during the past four years, \"average wages have barely budged.\"\n\nAt PolitiFact, one of our core principles is \"words matter.\" So in this item, we will look at average wages -- not the median wage, and not the average (or median) family income or household income.\n\nWe found two federal data sets that look at the average wage.\n\u2022 The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates\n\nThese statistics are based on data collected from employers in all industry sectors and in all types of regions nationwide. The most recent year available is 2012.\n\nSo according to this data set, the average annual wage increased by 8.3 percent between 2008 and 2012. (We also looked at the changes between 2009 and 2012, since either date range seems a plausible \"four-year\" period to us, and the numbers were similar..)\n\nHowever, this raw wage data doesn\u2019t take into account inflation -- something economists like to consider when determining whether a wage \"barely budged.\"\n\nWhen you use an , the average wage from 2008 was equivalent to $45,075 in 2012 dollars, meaning that the inflation-adjusted wage rose during that period, but only narrowly -- about 1.6 percent.\n\nBy this data, Obama is correct.\n\nThese are the used to calculate Social Security recipients\u2019 benefit levels. Here\u2019s the breakdown:\n\n\n\nAccording to this data set, the average annual wage increased by 7.2 percent between 2008 and 2012.\n\nAfter you adjust for inflation, the average wage from 2008 was $44,079 in 2012 dollars. So from 2008-12, the inflation-adjusted wage rose by less than 1 percent.\n\nWhichever data you use, the increases are pretty modest, particularly given that they were spread out over a four-year period.\n\nObama said that during the past four years, \"average wages have barely budged.\"\n\nTwo federal data sets broadly agree: Over the most recent four-year period, the average wage has risen no more than 1.7 percent above inflation. That\u2019s a rising wage -- but by a small amount, about a half a percentage point above inflation per year. We think that\u2019s a reasonable definition for \"barely budged.\" So we rate Obama\u2019s claim True.", "lang": "en"}
