It would have been impossible for this to take place as the two men are in separate prisons\u2014Huntley in Frankland prison in County Durham, and Bronson in HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes. Bronson was reportedly held in HMP Frankland for just over a year, but was moved to Woodhill in February 2019.\n\nAdditionally, there have been no reports of either getting into a recent fight with other prisoners.\n\nWe also recently fact checked an untrue claim that Huntley had died in prison.", "lang": "en"}
