That poster had shared the post from a group called \u201cExposing the modern day left\u201d.\n\nFraser Anning is a former federal senator for Queensland.\n\nThe February 6, 2020 article says a \u201cnew trend has emerged where young vegan adults, instead of walking a pet such as a cat or a dog, take cabbages for walks on a leash\u201d.\n\nThe National File article quotes a psychiatrist named Wen Chao stating: \u201cThe idea is simple \u2013 you feel as lonely and as simple as a cabbage, so you begin to act like one and befriend one.\u201d\n\nAn unnamed \u201cvegan student\u201d is quoted as saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a way by which depression and loneliness can be escaped; I feel free, I feel unchained-going for a walk with (the cabbage) makes me feel fully recharged.\u201d The report includes a photo of a group of young people dragging cabbages with leashes.\n\nNational File describes itself as \u201ca bold new media project\u201d focused on news topics \u201cpertaining to the New Right\u201d.\n\nThe National File report has been posted more than 40 times on Facebook, including posts by Australian groups here and by Facebook groups overseas here and here. In total the report has received more than 43,000 interactions, been shared more than 3,900 times and received more than 14,000 comments.\n\nStories about teens walking cabbages as a cure for loneliness started to appear in May 2014 with The Daily Star, Metro UK and the Huffington Post all reporting on the \u2018craze\u2019.\n\nThe original report was published on May 2, 2014, by the Austrian Times, a now-shuttered news outlet that was part of Central European News (CEN) a news agency run by English-born journalist Michael Leidig.\n\nThe 2014 Austrian Times story, titled \u201cChina\u2019s Cabbage Patch Kids\u201d, contains many of the same quotes from psychiatrist Wen Chao and student Lui Ja Chen as the 2020 National File story.\n\nHowever the Austrian Times article does not mention vegans or quote a \u201cvegan student\u201d as the National File article does.\n\nA story titled \u201cTeens Are So Lonely, They\u2019re Taking Cabbages On Leashes For Walks\u201d appeared in the Huffington post in 2014. The piece attributed a quote and linked to the Austrian Times story. The American news website and blog later updated and corrected the piece after it was debunked by Chinese media outfit thatsmags.com and gaming website Kotaku. \u201cThe teens pictured walking cabbages on leashes were taking part in a performance art piece,\u201d reads the correction.\n\nBeijing-based artist Han Bing told the Wall Street Journal in 2014 that people were walking cabbages at a music festival as part of a performance art piece he had devised.\n\nIn a 2014 interview with The New York Times, Mr Han said he has been walking cabbages as an artistic statement since 2000. \u201cAt the beginning they treated me like a psychopath. Now young people are more open and accept it, they even choose to walk cabbages,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2015 Buzzfeed published a report on an investigation into the veracity of some stories published by Central European News. The story titled \u201cThe King of Bull Sh*t News\u201d said evidence suggested \u201can alarming proportion\u201d of CEN\u2019s \u201cweird news\u201d stories were \u201cbased on exaggeration, embellishment, and outright fabrication\u201d. The Austrian Times cabbage-walking story was among the examples cited.\n\nIn 2016 Michael Leidig and CEN launched a $US11 million libel lawsuit against BuzzFeed in response to the story. The case was rejected in March, 2019 and an appeal was thrown out in December 2019, with the US Court of Appeals ruling that the \u201cplaintiffs [Leidig and CEN] offered no evidence regarding the accuracy of the story about young people walking cabbages in China out of loneliness\u201d.\n\nMr Leidig\u2019s lawyer was reported as saying there would be a challenge to the Court of Appeals ruling.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the Facebook post to be false. There is no evidence that \u201cvegans\u201d are walking cabbages as a method to cure depression. The photo used in the post is of people at a 2014 Chinese music festival who were walking cabbages for a performance art piece. The artist responsible has given interviews confirming the cabbage-walking is something he devised as an artistic statement. False \u2013 The primary claims of the content are factually inaccurate. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://factcheck.aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
