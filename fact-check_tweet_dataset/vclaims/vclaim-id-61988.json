She has pleaded not guilty to the charges and is being detained until her trial next year, according to CNN.\n\n\u201cIf you think it\u2019s ridiculous to think that child traffickers are in the highest positions of responsibility, then explain why Ghislaine Maxwell hung out with royalty and spoke before the UN at least nine times,\u201d reads the text at the bottom of the Instagram image. (RELATED: Does This Image Show Boris Johnson With Ghislaine Maxwell?)\n\nStephane Dujarric, a spokesperson for the U.N., told Check Your Fact in an email that, to his knowledge, Maxwell has never addressed an official meeting of a U.N. legislative body. Check Your Fact found two instances of her speaking at events held at the U.N. in her capacity as the founder of the oceanic conservation group TerraMar Project.\n\nIn 2013, she spoke with Stuart Beck, Palau\u2019s then-ambassador to the U.N., about sustainable development in relation to oceans at a press conference. Maxwell also participated in a \u201cconversation with the International Financial Institutions, the Private Sector and the Civil Society on healthy Oceans and Seas\u201d during a 2014 event hosted by the Sustainable Oceans Alliance, the governments of Italy and Palau and the Global Partnerships Forum, according to a U.N. document.\n\nDujarric told Check Your Fact that he is \u201conly aware of two instances of her speaking at the UN, one in 2013 and another 2014,\u201d though he noted that \u201cthere may be more, but we do not keep records of who attends non-official meetings.\u201d He also emphasized that there is a distinct difference between speaking \u201cat the UN\u201d and speaking \u201cto the UN.\u201d\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Alison Nathan on Aug. 25 denied Maxwell\u2019s requests to learn the identities of the three accusers in the indictment against her and to be moved to the general prison population, Fox News reported.", "lang": "en"}
