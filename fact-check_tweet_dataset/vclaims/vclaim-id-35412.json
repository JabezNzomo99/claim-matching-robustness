That account claims to be run by a photographer named \u201cWilliam Moon,\u201d who is neither the official White House photographer (Shealah Craighead is) nor a member of the White House News Photographers Association. According to Vox, Moon \u201cappears to be a Trump enthusiast who attends White House open press events.\u201d\n\nWhoever actually runs it, the \u201cWhite House Photos\u201d Twitter account is not connected with or controlled by the White House itself, so its actions do not represent or reflect White House interests or policies. So the fact that that same Twitter account later posted a black-and-white version of the same photograph is not evidence that Trump and/or the White House attempted \u201ccover up\u201d the original picture by de-colorizing it (which actually served to heighten the facial contrast) or by deleting it (the original color version remains on the account\u2019s timeline):\n\nTrump himself tweeted the (de-colorized) version of the photo, calling it \u201cFake News\u201d that was \u201cphotoshopped, obviously\u201d:\n\nAs for whether the photograph is \u201creal,\u201d the White House Photos account later posted that the picture was not \u201cphotoshopped,\u201d but \u201cApple smartphone\u2019s photo app\u201d had been used \u201cto adjust the color of the picture\u201d:\n\nOther pictures taken at the same time and place also show a marked \u201ctan line\u201d on the president\u2019s face, but not nearly as much bright orange coloration:\n\n\n\n \n\n The Independent\u2019s indy100 website declared of the \u201cunbelievably orange face\u201d photo that:\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that while we\u2019re not here to shame anyone for having a fake tan/bronzer/foundation mishap, this is something which has been going on for years. After being mocked mercilessly and having all the money in the world at his disposal, one would think Trump would at least try and get someone to show him how to apply his make-up properly. Or at the very least watch a YouTube video? PLEASE??", "lang": "en"}
