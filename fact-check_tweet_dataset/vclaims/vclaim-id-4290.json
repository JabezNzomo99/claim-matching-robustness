People must simply be stopped at the Border and told they cannot come into the U.S. illegally. Children brought back to their country\u2026\u2026 \u2026.If this is done, illegal immigration will be stopped in it\u2019s tracks \u2013 and at very little, by comparison, cost. This is the only real answer \u2013 and we must continue to BUILD THE WALL!\u201d\n\n \u2014 Trump, in a pair of tweets, June 25, 2018\n\nA long-standing framework of federal statutes, regulations and court precedents governs how U.S. officials handle asylum claims. Together, these lay out the \u201cprocess\u201d that asylum seekers are \u201cdue\u201d under U.S. law. As long as these laws are on the books, turning away asylum applicants without court proceedings in many cases would be a violation of their due-process rights under U.S. law, experts say. In addition, the United States has agreed to abide by international compacts that extend the right to seek asylum to qualified immigrants, namely the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.\n\n\u201cIn both 2015 and 2016, expedited removals (for persons ordered deported at the border) and reinstatements (for persons who reentered after being previously removed, including through expedited removal) are at 85 percent of all removals \u2014 so a slight and steady increase,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cKeep in mind that these numbers do not capture people subject to administrative removal (because they are nonlawful permanent residents with convictions that a DHS officer thinks is an aggravated felony) or stipulated removal orders (which have declined significantly in use), which also allow the government to deport without hearings.\u201d\n\nAs we reported in May, the U.S. judicial branch has nearly 1,300 sitting federal judges. This includes all Article III judges who sit in the district courts, the courts of appeal, the Court of International Trade and the Supreme Court. Immigration judges are not counted toward this total, since they work in the executive branch, inside the Justice Department. But the point is that all the Article III judges, hearing all sorts of federal cases, at all the different levels, number only 1,300 or so \u2014 not in the thousands.\n\n\u201cMost Americans don\u2019t realize that some of the basic legal norms that we take for granted in the justice system \u2014 the right to have one\u2019s day in court, the right to a fair judge \u2014 often do not exist for immigrants facing deportation,\u201d Koh said. \u201cFor those immigrants who do qualify to receive immigration court hearings (with no right to government-appointed counsel), this administration has taken step after step to dismantle the basic fairness of the immigration courts by imposing timelines on judges, taking away judges\u2019 ability to manage their cases, and reinterpreting the law to eliminate defenses to deportation.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
