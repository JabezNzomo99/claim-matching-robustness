Their faces have been blurred.\n\n. But are over 4,000 officers \u2013 who would be expected to uphold the law \u2013 convicted criminals? We checked.\n\nDuring a parliamentary question and answer session in April 2019, police minister Bheki Cele\n\nthat 4,174 members of the police service had criminal records. This included 32 senior managers.\n\nof the figure by division and province was included in Cele\u2019s written reply and published by the\n\nIt showed that most of the offences were traffic violations. Others were more serious, including assault, theft, kidnapping and fraud.\n\nAfrica Check contacted police national spokesperson Vish Naidoo to find out more about the figure.\n\n\u201cWhen the question was raised in Parliament, we did a quick ID [identity] check on all the members and according to the IDs, it came up that about 4,000 members had criminal records,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that is not a confirmed figure.\u201d\n\nThe initial ID check may not have produced accurate figures, due to duplication or misidentification. \u201cSo it could be more or it could be less,\u201d Naidoo said.\n\nThe only way to get an accurate number is by taking the fingerprints of all SAPS members. \u201cThe process has started where we are checking every single member on their fingerprints, but this will take some time,\u201d Naidoo said. \u201cI mean, we are talking about more than 192,000 members.\u201d\n\nThe department says it hopes to complete the process by the end of 2020.\n\nWhat does it mean to have a criminal record?\n\n\u201cHaving a criminal record is the same as having been found guilty or convicted of a crime, which is the same as being a convicted criminal,\u201d\n\nSome cases, particularly traffic offences, would not go to trial but would be settled through an admission of guilt fine, she said. However,\n\non the seriousness of the traffic offence, an admission of guilt could still land you in the police\u2019s criminal record centre database.\n\nA police officer who commits a crime may also face an internal disciplinary process, through the\n\n. Naidoo said that there were police members currently facing internal disciplinary actions for more serious offences but he would not discuss the details due to privacy concerns.\n\nA picture circulating on Facebook claims that over 4,000 South African police officers are convicted criminals. National police spokesperson Vish Naidoo told Africa Check that in April 2019, a \u201cquick ID check\u201d revealed that 4,174 police officers had criminal records.\n\nBut this figure has not been confirmed. The department is in the process of taking the fingerprints of all its members to get an accurate figure. The final figure could be more or less than the 4,000 figure cited in the Facebook post.\n\nSince the accuracy of the available data is in question, we rate the claim as unproven. We will update this report with the confirmed estimate when it is released by the police.", "lang": "en"}
