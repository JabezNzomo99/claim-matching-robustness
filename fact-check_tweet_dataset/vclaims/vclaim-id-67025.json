These posts were flagged by Facebook Claim Check, a tool that detects potentially false content on the platform.\n\nThe photo was manipulated, and Sison debunked the claim on the same day, saying he is healthy.\n\nA reverse image search showed that the original photo was that of a different person, and was sourced from the website wisegeek.com. It also showed that the altered graphic circulated as early as August 2018.\n\nOn Facebook, Sison addressed the claim saying the image of him was photoshopped and that he is healthy.\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
