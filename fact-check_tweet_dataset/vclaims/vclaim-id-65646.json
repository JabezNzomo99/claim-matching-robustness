A spokesman for Osteen\u2019s church has confirmed the account is fake and clarified that they do not charge for prayer requests.\n\nOsteen is a popular Texas-based televangelist known for preaching the \u201cprosperity gospel,\u201d a form of Christian teaching that equates faith with material well-being. His sermons, which are broadcast globally, have generated an estimated 52,000 people in weekly attendance at his Lakewood Church in Houston, according to the Christian Post.\n\nMultiple Facebook users recently shared an image that purportedly shows the Joel Osteen Ministries refusing to accept a woman\u2019s marital prayer request on Facebook until she pays a monthly donation fee. (RELATED: Did Televangelist Kenneth Copeland Say Christians Who Don\u2019t Support Trump Will Be Punished?)\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, your Joel Osteen prayer request account has not been activated,\u201d the supposed Joel Osteen Ministries account responds. \u201cIn order to activate your account, you will need to add a monthly donation of $24.99, which will give you access to 3 prayer requests per month. If you donate $49.99 each month you will become a Platinum Prayer Request member, which gives you access to over 10 prayer requests per month and a chance to buy tickets to my\u2026\u201d\n\nBut the Joel Osteen Ministries account that responded to the request appears to be an imposter. The account lacks the blue check mark that indicates it has been verified by Facebook, whereas Osteen\u2019s official account has it. Osteen\u2019s website also includes a page where prayer requests can be submitted for free, once a user creates an account.\n\n\u201cJoel Osteen Ministries never requests money for prayer,\u201d said Donald Illoff, a spokesman for the church, in an email to The Associated Press. \u201cThe image being circulated is from an impostor account.\u201d\n\nOsteen\u2019s verified Twitter account also weighed in on the screen grab, writing, \u201cIf you see this, it is FAKE. Joel Osteen Ministries never requests money for prayer.\u201d\n\nComedian Ben Palmer, who creates parody Facebook accounts of various organizations, appears to have made the account pictured, according to USA Today. In a May 2020 YouTube video, he took credit for it, explaining he \u201cmade a Joel Osteen lookalike page and responded to that person.\u201d He previously made a parody account for the City of Atlanta that got shut down after he announced that the city was going to destroy Stone Mountain, according to BuzzFeed News.\n\nThe screen grab of the interaction between the parody account and the woman has been circulating since at least 2019.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
