On the contrary, Russia is assisting Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime militarily and politically, thereby disregarding the rights of a large part of the Syrian population.\n\n \n\n \u201cRyabkov's statement couldn't be further from the truth,\u201d Julia Davis, an investigative reporter who monitors Russian media, told Polyfraph.info in an email. \u201cRussia is aggressively meddling in Syria, which it considers to be the battleground for asserting its greatness on the world's stage. Russia's priority is to prop up Assad - not because he is good for the Syrians, but solely because he is a reliable ally to the Russians and a foe to the West.\u201d\n\n \n\n Moscow\u2019s support for the Assad regime is not a secret. Russia, a permanent United Nations Security Council member, has vetoed eight UNSC resolutions on Syria. Russia\u2019s seventh veto, cast in February, was against a resolution imposing sanctions on the Assad regime. President Vladimir Putin called that UN resolution \u201ctotally inappropriate.\u201d\n\n \n\n In April, again because of a Russian veto, the UNSC failed to condemn the deadly April 4 chemical gas attack on Syrian civilians. Russia claimed that any such resolution would interfere with the UN-led peace negotiations between the warring sides in Syria.\n\n \n\n \u201cLooking at Russia's actions, it seems clear it has thrown its full weight behind the Syrian regime, ignoring the opinion of the millions of Syrians who protested and continue to protest against it when possible, and those who support the opposition,\u201d Hossam Abouzahr, Associate Director at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East, wrote to Polygraph.info.\n\n \n\n By blocking multiple UN resolutions, Abouzahr said, Russia is hindering the international community\u2019s efforts to exert pressure \u201con the [Assad] regime to lift restrictions on freedom of expression, such as on the issue of arbitrary arrests and the estimated 150,000-200,000 individuals held in regime prisons.\u201d\n\n \n\n Experts told Polygraph.info that Russia supports the Assad regime more for its own reasons than for the benefit of the Syrian people. Besides, due to the complexity and diversity of the factions fighting in Syria, it is unclear who Ryabkov meant when he said \u201cSyrians should decide for themselves what to do with their country.\u201d\n\n \n\n \u201cThe Syrian people rose up against Assad, which is at the core of the civil war that turned into a bloody massacre, due to Assad's unwillingness to relinquish his power,\u201d said Julia Davis. \u201cThe needs of the Syrian people are the last on Russia's agenda.\u201d\n\n \n\n A \u201cconvenient delaying tactic in negotiations\u201d might be part of Russia\u2019s calculations, Abouzahr said, adding that this \u201cabsolves Russia of any real responsibility for finding a solution.\u201d And, since the Assad regime seems encouraged by the support it is getting from the Kremlin, it is able to \u201cprevent any negotiated settlement from taking place,\u201d he said. Thus, a protracted civil war is mutually beneficial for both sides of the Russia-Syria alliance.\n\n \n\n In January, Moscow signed an agreement with Damascus that allows Russia to almost double its presence at the Tartus naval base and which extended the lease for the base for the next 49 years (automatically renewable for an additional 25 years). The agreement also covers an air base near Latakia. This development gives Russia the ability to deploy forces in Syria for the next half-century, if not longer.\n\n \n\n \u201cThis clearly shows that Russia is there to stay,\u201d said Davis. \u201cAssad's hold on power will be cemented by Russia's continued military presence. This environment is hardly conducive to the right of the Syrians to choose their leader.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
