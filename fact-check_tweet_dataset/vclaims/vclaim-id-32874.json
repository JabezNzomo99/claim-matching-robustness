Another can be seen trying to place an Indian flag on the minaret. The video was shared by many including noted journalist Rana Ayyub on Twitter.\n\nHowever, Ayyub took down the video after several, including Tehseen Poonawalla, claimed that the video was fake and unrelated to the current events. After confirming its authenticity, she posted it again.\n\nLater in the day, DCP North West, Delhi, said that the news regarding the mosque being vandalised in Ashok Vihar was fake. \"Some false information/news item has been circulating regarding damage to a mosque in Ashok Vihar area. It is to clarify that no such incident has taken place in the area of Ashok Vihar. Please do not spread false information,\" the DCP said. Poonawalla also shared the same in reply to Ayyub's video.\n\n1. No mosque was vandalized during the Delhi Riots During Delhi riots, a mosque was vandalized in Ashok Nagar, not Ashok vihar. Many people are confusing Ashok Vihar with Ashok Nagar, where the vandalism actually too place. Even, The Wire had initially reported that a mosque in Ashok Vihar, Delhi was set on fire. However, they later clarified that the video was from Ashok Nagar. It is also to be noted that in the various reports doing rounds on social media, DCP North West, Delhi, clearly says that no mosque was vandalised in Ashok Vihar.\n\nThe Logical Indian reached out to Dubey, who said that the mosque that was vandalised was Badi Masjid at Ashok Nagar, Mandoli, Near Yamuna Vihar. \"When we reached the location, the mosque was already on fire, and it was being vandalised. At that time, no one was climbing it or placing a flag. However, the people with us told that two flags were placed on the minaret - one of the Hanuman flag and the other an Indian flag. However, the latter had fallen down,\" said Dubey. He also shared a close-up of the mosque.\n\nHours before the video of the mosque surfaced online, several people had taken to social media to report about the violence in Ashok Nagar. This further corroborates Dubey's statement that the riots had been going on for hours before the video was shot. Around 2:20 pm, one user reported about stone-pelting incidents in the area on Facebook. \"Police came to Ashok Nagar. Met the people who have been hiding in their homes. Police refused to cooperate with them,\" the user wrote.\n\nThe Video Not Connected To Samastipur Incident False claims of the video being filmed in 2018 from Samastipur in Bihar where saffron flags were hoisted by a mob on a mosque are being circulated on social media. In video grabs from the incident, it can be seen that the structure of the Samastipur mosque is completely different from the Ashok Nagar mosque.
