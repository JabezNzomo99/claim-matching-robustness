Given that his opponent is portraying him as anti-woman, McConnell\u2019s recent comments on women\u2019s issues to a group of Kentucky voters were bound to attract media attention.\n\nMcConnell was speaking at Fastline Publications, which produces catalogs for farm equipment. When an audience member asked him about \"the most important issues facing Kentucky women,\" McConnell , \"We\u2019ve come a long way\" and added that \"most of the barriers have been lowered.\"\n\n\"I think virtually everything I have mentioned today applies to both genders equally,\" McConnell said. \"We\u2019ve come a long way with pay equity. There are a ton of women CEO\u2019s now running major companies, and more women are graduating from college now than men.\" He also said he received 50 percent of the women\u2019s vote the last time he was elected, and he cited Xerox as an example of a company with a woman CEO.\n\nAfter the event, McConnell received for his comments that workplace sexism and inequality between the sexes was a thing of the past.\n\nSome of his claims are too subjective to fact-check. But we decided to look at his claim that \"more women are graduating from college now than men.\"\n\nAccording to a by the Pew Research Center, women have outpaced men in pursuing postsecondary education in recent years, partly because of a growing acceptance of women in a wider variety of jobs, meaning that \"the benefits of a college education grew more for women than men.\"\n\nThe Population Reference Bureau, a nonprofit organization that produces information for academic and research purposes, published a study that validated McConnell\u2019s comments. \"Simply put, young women are now more likely to enroll in, and graduate from, college than young men,\" Kevin Pollard . The graph below, which was included in Pollard\u2019s analysis, shows the percentage of U.S. adults between the ages of 25 and 29 with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, the chart shows, men graduated from college at higher rates than women did. However, that trend reversed in the early 1990s, when women began to outpace men. And since then, this pattern for bachelor\u2019s degrees has held steady. In women earned 1,025,729 bachelor\u2019s degrees, or 57 percent of all degrees conferred that year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, a federal office.\n\nWomen also earned a majority of master\u2019s degrees and doctoral degrees in the 2011-12 academic year. Women received 60 percent of all master\u2019s degrees, compared with 40 percent for men. In doctoral studies the margin was narrower, with 51 percent of PhDs being awarded to women and 49 percent being given to men.\n\nDon Stewart, a spokesman for McConnell, provided PolitiFact with a wide variety of support for McConnell\u2019s claim, including an written by President Barack Obama for the 40th anniversary of Title IX, a statute that banned discrimination in educational programs on the basis of sex.\n\n\"In fact, more women as a whole now graduate from college than men,\" Obama said in the article. So Obama\u2019s comments square with those made by McConnell last week -- though they draw different conclusions. Obama\u2019s concludes that \"there are always more barriers we can break and more progress we can make,\" while McConnell said \"most of the barriers have been lowered.\"\n\nMcConnell said that \"more women are graduating college now than men.\" We found that since the early 1990s, women have earned more postsecondary degrees than men -- and in the 2011-12 academic year, women earned more degrees of all types -- bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s and doctoral -- than men did.
