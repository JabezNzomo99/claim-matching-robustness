This is false. The Canadian Veterinary Medical Association told AFP that a few ice cubes are fine for healthy dogs.\n\nThe post says it is \u201cfrom a vet on Facebook\u201d and states: \u201cPLEASE do NOT give your dogs ice cubes or other frozen items in the heat to cool them down! Ice cubes do not cool dogs down!\u201d\n\nIdentical versions of the publication were shared by concerned individuals like in this post and by pet care businesses here and here.\n\nLori Tarbett, of the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association told AFP by email: \u201cA few ice cubes are fine for normal, healthy dogs. Of course, you would want to limit the size (choking hazard) for any dog, as well as the amount. And it is important not to force a dog to consume an ice cube.\u201d\n\nThe post explains that ice cubes are dangerous for dogs in hot weather because \u201cthe canine anterior hypothalamus is triggered to warm up the body because it recognises something icy cold has been absorbed, and subsequently the bodily temperature rises to compensate for this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is definitively pseudo-science,\u201d \u00c9ric Troncy, animal pharmacology expert at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, told AFP in an email.\n\nTroncy pointed out that although a part of the anterior hypothalamus, the preoptic region, does serve a temperature regulation purpose in dog brains, it is not anatomically connected to the pharynx-oesophagus through which ice would circulate.\n\nInstead, \u201ctemperature changes are detected by thermal nervous receptors\u201d, on the skin or on viscera and vessel walls, \u201cwhich then send the information to the central nervous system before it is sent to the thermoregulatory center (in the hypothalamus),\u201d Troncy added.\n\nTroncy told AFP he thinks the hoax could come from the fact that pet owners are advised not to submerge an overheating dog into ice cold water, which could aggravate cardiovascular disturbances that occur when a dog overheats.\n\nAccording to Tarbett: \u201cThe main thing is not to let your dog overheat. Provide lots of water, which they use to cool by evaporation (panting). And ensure there is ample shade for your dog if s/he is outside.\u201d\n\nIn the UK, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals does advise dog owners to put ice cubes in the canines\u2019 water bowls in order to help them cool down.\n\nIn the United States, the Humane Society recommends letting dogs suffering from heatstroke \u201cdrink small amounts of cool water or lick ice cubes,\u201d while taking them to a veterinarian.", "lang": "en"}
