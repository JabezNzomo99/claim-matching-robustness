Social distancing norms went for a toss as central and state governments, suffering from a dip in revenue generation, decided to open up some vends.\n\nSoon enough, netizens started sharing photos and videos of long queues outside liquor stores, and some with happy faces exiting the shops with their hands full. Amid this, a video of a drunken policeman is doing the rounds on social media with the claim that this is the effect of liquor shops opening.\n\nThe 90-second video with a logo of \"News 18\" shows an inebriated policeman, lying on the roadside, being taken away by other cops on a motorcycle.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is three years old with no connection to the lockdown and subsequent reopening of liquor shops.\n\nFacebook user \"Md Ainul Haque Hashmi\" shared the video, which till the filing of this story, was already viewed 80,000 times and shared 16,000 times. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nThe viral claim looked suspicious as none of the policemen in the video were wearing masks in the time of novel coronavirus.\n\nUsing InVID and reverse image search, we found the original news clip from the \"News18\" website. According to the news report aired on June 27, 2017, Durgesh Giri, a cop from Faizabad police station in Uttar Pradesh, was found lying drunk on the roadside, after which a police team reached the spot and rescued him.\n\nThe central government came under criticism for permitting liquor shops to resume business as it resulted in large crowds throwing caution to the winds. Following the chaos on Monday, many shops were closed down later.\n\nBut this particular video of a drunken cop lying on the roadside has nothing to do with liquor shops opening after lockdown relaxation. The viral clip is from 2017.\n\nIndiaToday.in has plenty of useful resources that can help you better understand the coronavirus pandemic and protect yourself.
