The video has been being circulated in a misleading context; it shows members of several Islamic organisations burning a Morning Star flag in Poso, Central Sulawesi.\n\nThe 16-second video was published here on Facebook on October 6, 2019. It has been viewed more than 8,900 times and shared more than 130 times.\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe Indonesian-language caption translates to English as: \u201cPsst\u2026\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be noisy. Later Togok and BANSER will hear that FPI is already in Wamena and has burned the Morning Star flag. Just keep quiet.\u201d\n\n\u201cTogok\u201d refers to Togog, a clown character in Indonesian puppet theatre. The name \u201cTogog\u201d is recently used as a mocking reference to President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo by the supporters of his political opponent Prabowo Subianto, as explained in this Indonesian-language article.\n\n\u201cBanser\u201d is the paramilitary youth wing of Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia\u2019s biggest mass Islamic organisation, which supports Jokowi during the 2019 presidential election.\n\n\u201cFPI\u201d refers to the Islamic Defenders Front, an Islamist organisation, which supported Prabowo during the 2019 presidential election.\n\nWamena is a town in Indonesia\u2019s Papua province that has experienced one of the worst clashes since violence broke out in the Papua region in August 2019. AFP reports on the unrest were published here and here.\n\nThe Morning Star flag is the flag of the West Papuan independence movement.\n\nThe video with a similar claim also appeared on other Facebook posts here, here and here, where it was viewed more than 262,000 times and shared more than 5,300 times. It was also shared on YouTube here with a similar claim.\n\nThe video has been circulated in a misleading context. It shows members of FPI and other Islamist organisations burning a Morning Star flag in Poso, Central Sulawesi province.\n\nA keyword search on Google found two videos published on YouTube on October 5, 2019.\n\nThis 16-second video shows an identical scene as the video in the misleading posts. The Indonesian-language title translates to English as: \u201cFree Papua Movement\u2019s flag is burned by FPI.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading post (L) and the YouTube video (R):\n\nThe second video is the longer version of the same event but was taken from a different angle. The video's title translates to English as: \u201cFPI\u2019s action of burning the Morning Star flag.\u201d\n\nA journalist in AFP's Jakarta bureau analysed the clip. At the 50 second mark, a person can be heard speaking in Indonesian.\n\nThe person's comments translate to English as: \u201cIf the red and white flag can\u2019t wave proudly in Wamena, then Muslims will bring Al Liwa and Ar Rayah\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAl Liwa\u201d and \u201cAr Rayah\u201d refer to Islamist flags, white and black in colour respectively, with a Shahada creed printed on them, according to this Republika article.\n\nAt the two-minute 40-second mark of the longer YouTube video, a person can be heard saying: \u201cTherefore today, we in Poso must say that Papua should be under martial law because over there they have killed Muslims, they have killed migrants.\u201d\n\nBetween the one-minute 50-second mark and the one-minute 55-second mark, the video shows a building that corresponds with the Poso Prosecutor\u2019s Office here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison between the location seen in the longer version of video (L) and the the prosecutor\u2019s office on Google Street View (R). AFP has circled prominent features in red.\n\nThe Central Sulawesi branch of FPI told on AFP on October 10, 2019, by telephone that FPI and other Muslim organisations staged the flag-burning protest in Poso on October 4, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
