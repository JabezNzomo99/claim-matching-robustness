The encounter escalated, McClain was put in a chokehold, and a few days later he was dead.\n\nElijah McClain, 23, was walking home from a store around 10:30 p.m. on a Saturday evening when authorities contacted him near Billings Street and Colfax Avenue in Denver. Someone had called 911 to report a \u201csuspicious person\u201d who was wearing a ski mask and waving his arms. McClain routinely wore masks when he was outside because he had anemia \u2014 a blood condition \u2014 and became cold easily, according to his family. After a struggle, McClain was handcuffed and officers requested medical assistance. Aurora Fire Rescue later injected him with ketamine in an attempt to sedate him, police said. He suffered cardiac arrest during the ambulance ride to a nearby hospital. The following Friday McClain was declared \u201cbrain dead\u201d and was expected to be taken off life support that afternoon, family members said. He died later that day.\n\nMcClain\u2019s family called for the police officers involved in his death to be prosecuted, but it was announced in November that they would not face criminal charges. McClain\u2019s case did not receive the same national attention as other similar incidents, but it was thrust back into the spotlight after George Floyd\u2019s death in May 2020, when protests against racial injustice and police violence spread across the United States.\n\nIn June 2020, an image of text supposedly relaying McClain\u2019s \u201clast words\u201d started going viral on social media:\n\nI can\u2019t breathe. I have my ID right here. My name is Elijah McClain. That\u2019s my house. I was just going home. I\u2019m an introvert. I\u2019m just different. That\u2019s all. I\u2019m so sorry. I have no gun. I don\u2019t do that stuff. I don\u2019t do any fighting. Why are you attacking me? I don\u2019t even kill flies! I don\u2019t eat meat! But I don\u2019t judge people, I don\u2019t judge people who do eat meat. Forgive me. All I was trying to do was become better. I will do it. I will do anything. Sacrifice my identity, I\u2019ll do it. You all are phenomenal. You are beautiful and I love you. Try to forgive me. I\u2019m a mood Gemini. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. Ow, that really hurt. You are all very strong. Teamwork makes the dream work. Oh, I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t trying to do that. I just can\u2019t breathe correctly.\n\nThis is a largely accurate transcript of what McClain said in a video recording of his encounter with police in August 2019. These remarks can be heard on the body cam footage of one of the police officers involved in the incident. An official copy of this video from the Aurora Police Department can be seen below (the relevant portion of the video starts at around the 12:30 mark).\n\nThe text in the viral transcript has been slightly edited to remove repeated phrases and inaudible moments (McClain says \u201cI\u2019m just different\u201d multiple times), but none of the edits are misleading. The text describing actions in the viral post \u2014 at one point noting that McClain was crying, at another noting that he vomited \u2014 are also accurate.\n\nThis viral transcript does omit at least one phrase uttered by McClain during this encounter. A few moments after the final words of this viral transcript, McClain says \u201cI can\u2019t fix myself\u201d before vomiting again.\n\nSomeone picks up a body camera and McClain can be seen lying on his side with both hands restrained behind his back, and one officer jamming his knee on the man\u2019s torso. When McClain attempts to roll over to vomit, they shout at him to \u201cstop fighting us.\u201d \u201cIf you keep messing around, I\u2019m going to bring my dog out here and he\u2019s going to bite you,\u201d says an officer standing over McClain. McClain\u2019s body goes limp and he passes out. But he\u2019s not asking McClain. He\u2019s speaking to the officer on top of him. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m good,\u201d the officer says shifting his weight.\n\nWhen paramedics arrived, McClain was injected with ketamine (described by Aurora Police as \u201ca standard medication routinely utilized to reduce agitation\u201d) and then loaded into an ambulance where he suffered cardiac arrest. On August 30, McClain was pronounced brain dead, removed from life support, and died.\n\nIn February 2021, an independent investigation commissioned by the city found that police officers did not have legal basis to stop McClain. The Denver Post reports:\n\nAurora police officers did not have a legal basis to force Elijah McClain to stop walking, to frisk him or to use a chokehold on him, an independent investigation commissioned by the city found. The initial investigation into the incident led by the department\u2019s detectives in the Major Crimes Unit was also deeply flawed, the investigators found. The detectives failed to ask basic, critical questions of the officers involved in McClain\u2019s death and instead \u201cthe questions frequently appeared designed to elicit specific exonerating \u2018magic language\u2019 found in court rulings,\u201d the report states. Aurora city officials on Monday morning released the 157-page report on the death of McClain at the hands of city police and paramedics. The city hired a panel of investigators to examine the officers\u2019 and paramedics\u2019 decision and make policy recommendations \u201cto lessen the chance of another tragedy like this one from happening again,\u201d the report states.", "lang": "en"}
