The tweet posted below was shared by a user who identifies as \u2018Cyber Defense & combat team of Pakistan\u2019. She wrote, \u201cIndian Army struggling to pick dead bodies\u2026\u201d\n\nIndia and Pakistan traded fire in the Tangdhar sector of Kupwara district in North Kashmir on October 20. While India claims to have lost two soldiers and killed at least six Pakistani army men, the neighbouring country claimed to have lost only one solider and killed nine Indian army men. Both nations have rejected each other\u2019s claims.\n\nAnother Pakistani citizen shared the same image and wrote, \u201cIn today\u2019s clash, the brave army of Pakistan sent nine Indian soldiers to hell.\u201d\n\nOne Milan Zahid took a step further and claimed that 53 Indian soldiers were killed the firing.\n\nA simple reverse image search on Google reveals that Pakistani handles used an old, unrelated photograph to depict slain Indian army men. The oldest instance of this image discovered by Alt News dates back to 2014. A May 11, 2014 Gujarati report by Oneindiacarried the image in a story about a Naxal attack in Maharashtra\u2019s Gadchiroli where seven policemen were killed.\n\nAn old image was therefore shared by several Pakistani Twitter handles to portray slain Indian army men in the recent cross-border skirmish.", "lang": "en"}
