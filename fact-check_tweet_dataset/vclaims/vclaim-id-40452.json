NO!", "subtitle": "", "author": "dubawa.org", "date": "2019-06-23T12:32:09+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-40452", "url": "https://dubawa.org/did-governor-fayemi-budget-n1-2bn-for-travelling-no/", "vclaim": "A media aide to former governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State, Lere Olayinka, on Monday, June 17, 2019, said the state\u2019s current governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, has budgeted N1.2 billion for travelling.\n\nOlayinka took to different social medial platforms to make the claim, which has so far sparkled debate among internet users who are majorly citizens of the state. The former governor\u2019s spokesman posted a tweet containing the claim on Twitter via his verified handle (@OlayinkaLere) at exactly 08:16 AM Nigerian time, a duplicate of the claim was also posted on his Facebook account at the said time.\n\n\u201cNEXT LEVEL: Fayemi budgets N1.2bn for travelling,\u201d Olayinka said both on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nDr. Kayode Fayemi of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) was sworn into office on October 16, 2018 for the second term after defeating his closest rival, who is the immediate former Deputy Governor of the state and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prof. Kolapo Olusola, and other candidates to emerge the winner of the state\u2019s July 14, 2018 governorship election held.\n\nPrior to the election, Kayode Fayemi was Nigeria\u2019s substantive Minister of Mines and Steel Development under President Muhammadu Buhari first term in office. Buhari\u2019s first term in office was tagged \u201cChange\u201d, while his second term was christened with the \u201cNext Level\u201d slogan.\n\nOlayinka did not specify where the travelling fund was allocated to, but only made reference to Fayemi as the focus. Calls put across his mobile phones by BusinessDay did not get through.\n\nBusinessDay conducted checks on the Ekiti State 2019 Approved Budget obtained from the state government\u2019s website to ascertain the accuracy of the claim.\n\nThe budget tagged \u201cBudget of Restoration\u201d was Fayemi\u2019s first budget document since his return to power, and has a total estimate of N129.92 billion of which N72.7 billion was allocated for recurrent expenditure, while N57.2 billion was earmarked for capital expenditure.\n\nGovernor Fayemi presented the appropriation bill (budget) on December 21, 2018. The state\u2019s House of Assembly passed the budget on January 17, 2019 and the spending plan was signed into law on January 17, 2019.\n\nThe state\u2019s spending plan was divided into six (6) sections comprising personnel cost, other charges, consolidated revenue fund, transfers, expenditure IGR (tertiary institutions), and transfer to other funds.\n\nOut of these, the \u201cother charges\u201d section, which detail the expenditure on daily or periodic expenses of the state for the fiscal year, comprises the amount allocated for transport and travelling related expenses.\n\nAccording to the budget figures seen and analysed by BusinessDay, out of the 221 ministries, departments, agencies and units that enjoyed allocation for various expenses in the budget, only 189 were considered for transport and travelling in 2019.\n\nThe summation of all the funds allocated for \u201ctransport and travelling\u201d under \u201cother charges\u201d was N998.1 billion with the Government House ad Protocol unit getting the highest share of N391.5 million, while the Public Private Partnership unit got the smallest portion of N90,000 for the 2019 fiscal year.\n\nFurther checks and analyses reveal that a total sum of N1.4 trillion was allocated for the same \u201ctransport and travelling\u201d expenses in the 2018 budget signed by Fayose before the expiration of his tenure. However, out of this amount, a total sum of N1.01 trillion was eventually expended on \u201ctransport and travelling\u201d in the 2018 fiscal year.\n\nSince Ekiti state Government budgeted a total sum of N998.1 billion for \u201ctransport and travelling\u201d expenses in the 2019 fiscal year, the claim by Fayose\u2019s aide is FALSE.\n\nThis fact-check was done by a Dubawa Fact-checking Fellow in collaboration with BusinessDay, the leading medium for up-to-date news and insightful analysis of business, policy and the economy in Nigeria.
