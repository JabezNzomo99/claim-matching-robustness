This tweet responds to Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman\u2019s recent statement that the deal for the procurement of 126 Rafale combat aircraft, which was sought under the UPA regime, fell through because Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) did not have the required capability to produce them. Those who are saying that HAL is not capable of producing Rafale jets should know what we at HAL have produced\n\n\u00e2\u009c\u0088 MiG-21\n\n\u00e2\u009c\u0088 MiG-27\n\n\u00e2\u009c\u0088 Jaguar\n\n\u00e2\u009c\u0088 Hawk\n\n\u00e2\u009c\u0088 Sukhoi-30\n\n\u00e2\u009c\u0088 Dornier 228\n\n\n\nV hv also produced \n\n\u00f0\u009f\u009a\u0081 Light combat helicopter\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u009a\u0081 Light utility helicopter\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u009a\u0081 Chetak\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u009a\u0081 Dhruv\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u009a\u0081 Rudra pic.twitter.com/SNlJ5lm92h \u2014 Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (@HAL_India) September 18, 2018 Posted on 18 September, the tweet has been retweeted over 1,400 times already. Many social media users have shared it, in the process lauding HAL for \u2018standing up for itself\u2019 against the assertion of the defence minister over the MMRCA deal, which has been mired in controversy. It has been shared widely on certain Facebook pages, including the official page of Mumbai Youth Congress. It has also been posted by the page, FekuExpress, which has over 530,000 followers. Another page which posted it is Drunk Journalist, which has a follower base of over 145,000. Several individual users too have shared this tweet with the claim that HAL has \u2018given a befitting reply to Nirmala Sitharaman\u2019.\n\nNot the Official Account of HAL As can be seen from the name of the account, the tweet which has been shared so profusely on social media is not from the official account of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. This is mentioned in the \u2018Bio\u2019 section itself which clarifies that this is an unofficial account. Another point worth noting is that in the tweet which has gone viral, the name of the account, as can be seen, is Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. However, the word \u2018parody\u2019 was added to the name of the account later. Moreover, HAL has tweeted that the account HAL_India \u2018impersonates\u2019 the official handle and that a formal complaint has been lodged with Twitter regarding the same. To this tweet, Hal_India replied clarifying that it is not the official account of HAL. It has come to our notice that Twitter handle @HAL_India impersonates our this official handle @HALHQBLR. A formal complaint has already been lodged with Twitter. All are requested to take a note of this. @DefProdnIndia @drajaykumar_ias @DefenceMinIndia @SpokespersonMoD \u2014 HAL (@HALHQBLR) September 20, 2018 There are numerous instances wherein social media users unwittingly fell for unofficial or parody accounts. This tendency has been observed mostly in the context of spoof accounts of mainstream media organisations in general and TV news channels in particular. Social media users are encouraged to check the veracity of the accounts which they may endorse.", "lang": "en"}
