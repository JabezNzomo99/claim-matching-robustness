Ghafoor posted a 103-second clip on Twitter with the message, \u201cAdmission of Indian failure and losses on 27 February 2019 by a well-decorated Indian Airforce veteran Air Marshal Denzil Keelor.\u201d At the time of the writing this article, the video has been retweeted more than 5,600 times.\n\nIn the clip, several visuals of a crashed aircraft and Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman\u2019s clip that was released by the Pakistani army after he was captured are visible on the top-left corner. It further shows Keelor saying, \u201cSome of the things that happened are losses, for instance. During the war, you win and you lose. Some of the losses were not right. They were due to tactical errors, due to inexperience and you know you can\u2019t go to war with this type of inexperience. As I told you, we had trained people there and the people who went for training had to come in and join us. So, you had a group of people who were trained and who are not trained. The price we paid for it was quite heavy.\u201d He then goes on to talk about Pakistan\u2019s radar, interception and air defence system.\n\nThe video posted by Asif Ghafoor was found out to be old and edited. Ghafoor\u2019s claim that the former Air Marshal was admitting to Indian Air Force\u2019s loses in Balakot airstrike is false as the interview was uploaded on YouTube almost four years ago. Balakot airstrike took place in February 2019.\n\nThe description posted along with the video calls out the false narrative propagated by the Pakistani army spokesperson on Twitter. It also states that Keelor\u2019s statement was made in the context of the 1962 and 1965 wars.\n\nAfter several netizens pointed out to Ghafoor that he had posted an old video of Indian Air Marshal, the Pakistani army spokesperson tweeted a clarification regarding the video while refusing to delete the same.\n\nIn conclusion, Pakistani army spokesperson Major General Asif Ghafoor tweeted an old and edited video of former Indian Air Marshal Denzil Keelor to falsely claim that the latter had admitted to the Indian Air Force suffering major loses in the Balakot airstrike.", "lang": "en"}
