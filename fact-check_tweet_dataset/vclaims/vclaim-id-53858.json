THATS RIGHT PEOPLE!! All the rumours u may have heard about Chinese people buying up all our stock from super markets well its not a rumour!! Its TRUE\u201d.\n\nThe post continues: \u201cThe hole [sic] joint was full of repacked boxes of BABY FORMULA, TOILET PAPER, PALLETS OF HAND SANITIZER, TISSUES, FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS,\u201d The post then says: \u201cThey had everything from cleaning products to food pasta, rice, tinned goods, pet food even medicine and boxes of paracetamol/panadol,\u201d\n\nThe post finally claims: \u201cWhen i asked the asian guy told me they have been packing 2 shipping containers full everyday and sending it all back to China!! And the company responsible for shipping it all is a company called Freight Net\u201d.\n\nThe Facebook post has been viewed over 6.5 million times, shared at least 100,000 times and has been interacted with over 15,000 times since being posted on March 20.\n\nA Facebook post claims a Melbourne factory is sending food, toilet paper and other items to China.\n\nWith the confirmed cases of COVID-19 at more than 2,250 as of March 25, the coronavirus outbreak forced the introduction of strict new measures including overseas travel bans, requirements to remain at home except for essential outings and closures of non-essential businesses.\n\nFears about the impacts of the virus have also triggered panic buying and hoarding that have left many supermarket shelves bare, with toilet paper and basic food and sanitary items particularly targeted.\n\nAAP FactCheck found three separate iterations of a widely shared March 20 Facebook post that claims a Melbourne based e-commerce business and freight company are sending essential goods to China. The posts were all uploaded after the March 20 post. (See them here, here and here)\n\nThe posts claim freight company TT Express has been \u201cpacking 2 shipping containers full everyday\u201d of essential items like \u201cfood pasta, rice, tinned goods, pet food even medicine and boxes of paracetamol/panadol\u201d and been \u201csending it all back to China\u201d.\n\nHead accountant of TT Express Dinh Nguyen told AAP FactCheck in an interview that TT Express doesn\u2019t send any goods to China. Rather the company ships consumer goods back to Vietnam for Vietnamese people living in Melbourne.\n\nSince the post went viral on Facebook TT Express has had to close down their Facebook and Google business pages after receiving torrents of abuse, Mr Nguyen said.\n\n\u201cPeople keep calling and threatening, sending bad messages. We couldn\u2019t handle it anymore,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis has really hurt our business.\u201d\n\nThe company mentioned in the post as being responsible for shipping the goods, Melbourne-based freight business Freight Net, has also been adversely affected.\n\nFreight Net company director Steve Hancock told AAP FactCheck over the phone that TT Express was their client but that the claim of goods being shipped to China was false and had been addressed by Victoria Police.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a crazy 48 hours for us, this is something that we\u2019d never do. It\u2019s a complete fabrication,\n\n\u201cWe have received threatening phone calls and also had vehicles doing slow drive by inspects of the office,\u201d Mr Hancock said.\n\nVictoria Police told AAP FactCheck in a statement, which was also posted to their Facebook page, that they were aware of the claims.\n\n\u201cPolice have spoken to the company and found these claims to be false,\u201d Victoria Police said.\n\nMr Hancock told AAP FactCheck Freight Net received an apology from someone who uploaded an iteration of the March 20 Facebook post then deleted it.\n\nAAP FactCheck has seen the apology and a screenshot of the deleted post.\n\nThe Facebook user, who AAP FactCheck has decided not to name, told Freight Net they asked Facebook to remove all other similar posts.\n\n\u201cI am really sorry about what I have done. I was awake all night thinking about it,\u201d the apology reads.\n\nIt continues: \u201cI thought if u [sic] have contacts with different charities would it help if I donate $1000 to one of them on behalf of Freight Net and TT Express?\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
