People are confused. The problem is not only in the flying birds, some of the ducks swimming in the lake in the park don\u2019t get enough air while trying to fly away and get into the roads that cars pass. The remaining ducks are always starting to put their heads in the water.\u201d\n\nThe post connects the alleged incident to a \u201cnewly built 5G post on the building on the other side of the park,\u201d which it says was being \u201ctested at the time of death.\u201d\n\nThis is misleading. There are no recent reports of starlings dying en masse in a park in a western city of the Netherlands. Instead, the photo on the right which accompanies the Facebook post originates from an incident in October 2018 in Huijgenspark in The Hague, a Dutch city on the country\u2019s west coast. The news report here includes a video that shows the photo of the dead bird at 51 seconds in.\n\nThe death of these birds in 2018 was not due to 5G. According to Wageningen Bioveterinary Research (WUF), which carried out post-mortems on the birds, the primary cause of death was bleeding from trauma. Some natural poison - mostly likely from yew berries \u2013 were found in the organs of the starlings (here) (here). The institute acknowledged that it couldn\u2019t guarantee that the birds were weakened by natural poison, but that it also couldn\u2019t be ruled out.\n\nSeparately, the Antenna Bureau of the Dutch government confirmed there had been no testing of 5G masts near that particular park in October 2018 (here). In a statement, it added that all transmission masts in the Netherlands are bound by safety standards and that \u201cfrom measurements, radiation is well below the safety standards.\u201d\n\nThe photo on the left in the Facebook post originates from a widely-reported incident of starling deaths in Anglesey in Wales, in late 2019 (here). According to an update on Twitter from North Wales Police\u2019s rural crime team in March 2020, these birds were primarily killed after striking the tarmac or by piercing themselves on nearby bushes.\n\nSergeant Rob Taylor explained in a video post that following results from a veterinary examination, the deaths were \u201cprobably consistent with the birds avoiding either severe weather or a raptor in the area (here).\n\nFalse. There is no connection between the mass deaths of starlings to testing of 5G masts in the Netherlands.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
