The parents had supposedly found the baby (alive) in the microwave, covered in barbecue sauce with bite marks on the boy\u2019s arms and legs.\n\nSo even in the context of the post, he didn\u2019t really get eaten. If it\u2019s any comfort, not only is the story fake, it also said the boy was expected to recover.\n\nThe photo included on most of the posts is not a ravenous, drug-smoking teenager from Missouri. It\u2019s actually of a 28-year-old Indiana woman arrested in January 2016 on domestic battery charges.\n\nThe true source of this story is a Jan. 20, 2016, article on WorldNewsDailyReport.com, a website known for posting fake articles. (That version said the babysitter\u2019s name was Anna Krutchiev.) The site says in its disclaimer that it is responsible for \"the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.\"\n\nThere is no indication on the post we checked, or on most of the others reblogging the same fake story, that it's fabricated. Comments on these stories make it clear some horrified readers were tricked.\n\nBut this story about a babysitter getting high and attempting to eat a child never happened.\n\nWe rate it Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
