The day, 10 October, is observed every year.\n\nTo mark the day, the\n\n, a private company, issued a warning on the signs of teen suicide. Its\n\nwas picked up by the\n\n\u201cAlmost one in ten teenage deaths in South Africa every year are the result of suicide,\u201d the release said. \u201cUp [to] 20% of high school learners have tried to take their own lives.\u201d\n\nAfrica Check compared these claims with the best available evidence.\n\nAfrica Check asked the Psychiatry Management Group for the research on which they based the claim.\n\n. It stated that \u201cin South Africa 9% of all teen deaths are caused by suicide\u201d.\n\n(Stats SA) reports on the country\u2019s causes of death, using data from death notifications. Data extracted from the\n\nshows that 55 teenagers \u2013 people aged 13 to 19 \u2013 were reported to have died from self-harm in 2016. \u201cSelf-harm\u201d covers 25 different types of death, including self-poisoning, strangulation and jumping from a high place.\n\nThe report recorded a total of 8,251 teenager deaths, from all causes, in 2016. The 55 suicides therefore accounted for under 1 in 100 deaths for this age group.\n\nBut these numbers are probably underestimated, experts warn. World Health Organization statistician, Gretchen Stevens,\n\nAfrica Check that suicide may not be recorded on death records because of stigma. This would skew official records.\n\nStudies that take this problem into account may produce more reliable estimates.\n\nThe most recent study that adjusts for under-reported suicide is the 2012\n\nfor South Africa. Debbie Brashaw, the director of the\n\nand an author of the study, extracted data on death by suicide for people aged 10 to 19 at Africa Check\u2019s request. (\n\nThe data shows an estimated 565 suicides among people aged 10 to 19. In comparison, Stats SA recorded 83 for the same period from death certificate information.\n\nIn the National Burden of Disease Study, suicide accounted for 4.5% of deaths in this age group. This equals one in 20 deaths of people aged 10 to 19.\n\nThe claim that \u201calmost one in 10 teenage deaths in South Africa every year are the result of suicide\u201d is not supported by the available data. We rate it incorrect.\n\nat the Medical Research Council and honorary associate professor at the\n\n, Arvin Bhana, told Africa Check that care must be taken when information about teen suicide is shared.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for us to not make teen suicide out to be an epidemic in South Africa,\u201d Bhana explained. \u201cExaggerating suicide numbers to bring attention to it doesn\u2019t help the problem. It just makes it seem like it\u2019s impossible to deal with and that is not the case.\u201d\n\nBhana said schools can play an important role by finding help when they see a child is struggling. He called on parents and teachers to watch for changes in behaviour that could be caused by depression.\n\nChristensen told Africa Check that this statistic came from the 2011\n\nIt gives information on risky behaviour by South African public school pupils in grades 8 to 11.\n\nThe document says 17.8% of pupils \u201cmade one or more suicide attempts\u201d in the six months before the survey.\n\nThis figure is slightly lower than the 20% given by the Psychiatry Management Group. It also leaves out private school pupils.\n\nThis is the most recent data on suicide attempts by high school pupils in South Africa. An author of the study, Ronel Sewpaul, told Africa Check that they will conduct another study once funding becomes available.\n\nThe unique problems young people face can lead to depression and suicide, according to Bhana. And the situation can get worse if they don\u2019t receive support at home or school.\n\n\u201cAdolescence is a time when young people are in a state of transition,\u201d he said. \u201cMany things are changing for them, from hormonal influences to managing relationships to academic performance.\u201d\n\nFinding the right help can also be difficult, said the director of the Health Systems Research Unit, Catherine Meadows.\n\n\u201cSocial services are very inadequate and overburdened, so people can\u2019t get the support they need,\u201d Meadows told Africa Check. \u201cFor many reasons, teens do not seek the care they need from primary health care services and primary health care clinics are not geared up to treat depression.\n\n\u201cThey often don\u2019t have the ability to provide the drugs and they don\u2019t offer the necessary cognitive behavioural interventions.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
