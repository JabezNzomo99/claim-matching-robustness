Hail our Prime Minister- translation).\n\nAlong with the above message, a photograph which has been shared widely on social media shows an elderly man in the driver seat of an auto-rickshaw. This man looks a lot like Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThe above post is by a Facebook page BJP- New Delhi. The same has been shared in a Facebook group named Narendra Modi. It has also been shared by individual users. The message and photo have made their way to Twitter as well, although the share count is almost nil at this stage.\n\nThe photograph has been circulating since at least 2016. The claim had been debunked in the past by several media organizations. Posted below is a screenshot of a report by Navbharat Times.\n\nThe person seen in the photograph is NOT the brother of PM Narendra Modi, as claimed so profusely. His name is Sheikh Ayyub, and he drives an auto rickshaw in the Adilabad district of Telangana.\n\nIt may be noted that none of PM Modi\u2019s brothers drives an auto-rickshaw. Narendra Modi has three brothers- Sombhai Modi, Amrut Modi and Prahlad Modi. According to a India Today article, Sombhai runs an old age home in Vadnagar, Gujarat. Amrut Modi worked as a fitter in a private company. Prahlad Modi who is the youngest among the four brothers, is a fair price shop owner.\n\nThe photograph showing a lookalike of PM Narendra Modi, seated in the driver\u2019s seat of an auto-rickshaw, is not the brother of PM Modi. He is just a lookalike from Telangana.", "lang": "en"}
