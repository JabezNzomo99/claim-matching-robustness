At that time, social media users shared a photograph of a flyer for an \u201cEnd the Lockdown\u201d rally that seemed aimed at achieving the worst possible outcome in encouraging that participants need not wear masks, should bring their children along, and attend even if they were already sick:\n\nThe cropping of the image seen above cut off the top portion of the poster, which identified it as referring to a \u201cLiberate Staten Island\u201d rally. We don\u2019t know at this time whether the flyer was on the level or whether it was intended as a spoof of the reckless attitudes of some protesters, but we can verify that at least a few such flyers were posted around Tottenville, a neighborhood on the South Shore of Staten Island, as reported by the Staten Island Advance:\n\nFliers promoting an \u201cEnd the Lockdown Rally\u201d were spotted at the CVS on Page Avenue, and on the corner of Main Street and Amboy Road. The promotional material said the rally would take place Sunday morning at 11 a.m. on the Conference House lawn in Tottenville. \u201cNo mask needed. Bring your children. Non-essential workers. If you\u2019re sick still come, it\u2019s your right!\u201d stated the fliers. The instructions were followed by the phrase \u201cKeep America Great!\u201d and \u201c#MAGA,\u201d which stands for President Donald Trump\u2019s original campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d NYPD has been tasked by Mayor Bill de Blasio to issue fines for people who are not social distancing.\n\nIn the event, if the posters weren\u2019t a joke, then apparently poor planning, cold feet, or apathy kept attendees away, as according to the Advance no one but police turned out for the rally:\n\nAccording to fliers posted around Tottenville, some non-essential workers planned an \u201cEnd the Lockdown Rally\u201d for Sunday at Conference House Park, in hopes of protesting the current \u201cNew York on PAUSE\u201d mandates under Gov. Andrew Cuomo in an effort to stop the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). But no one showed up for Sunday\u2019s rally \u2014 except the police. Around the time the rally was supposed to begin, police officers were seen canvassing the empty Conference House Park lawn. Police confirmed they were at the site in anticipation of the rally.", "lang": "en"}
