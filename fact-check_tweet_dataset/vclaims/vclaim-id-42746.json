The tweet is from the Twitter handle \u2018@0NitaAmbani\u2019 and has a profile picture of Reliance Foundation Chairperson Nita Ambani. In the tweet, the government is criticized for spending 35,000 crores every year on the Haj pilgrimage as there would have been an AIIMS in every district of India if that money was used properly. But FACTLY has found the Twitter handle \u2018@0NitaAmbani\u2019 to be of a fan-page of Nita Ambani. A tweet with the same content can also be seen on a Twitter account with the username \u2018@0Nita_ji\u2019. That account was also found to be run by fans of Nita Ambani. When searched if Nita Ambani has an account on Twitter, it was found that she does not have any official Twitter account. So, Nita Ambani did not tweet criticizing the government for its spending on the Haj pilgrimage; the tweet is from a fan-page. Earlier, when screenshots of multiple tweets went viral on the name Nita Ambani, FACTLY has debunked them and those fact-checks can be read here, here and here.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
