The Test and Trace system, which only covers England, does not publish a daily figure for the number of people being tested. (The other UK nations have their own tracing systems.)\n\nThe most recent Test and Trace data, however, says that 366,397 people were newly tested in the week that ended on 22 July. This would mean that on average roughly 52,000 were being newly tested each day.\n\nIncluding previously tested people, and people tested in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, would make this number higher for the whole UK, but not bring it close to 330,000 a day.\n\nWe contacted Mr Gibb\u2019s office and a spokesperson told us, \u201cthe Minister unintentionally misspoke. When he said \u2018we are testing\u2026\u2019 he should have said \u2018we are able to test\u2026\u2019; he was referring to testing capacity in the system.\u201d\n\nThe UK\u2019s daily testing capacity currently stands at around 338,000. However, this figure includes antibody and surveillance tests that are not part of the Test and Trace programme. Nor is the number of tests the same as the number of people being tested, because some people are tested more than once.\n\nWe have also expressed concern in the past that the government\u2019s published testing capacity may not reflect its real ability to conduct tests in practice.", "lang": "en"}
