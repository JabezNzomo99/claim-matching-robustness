There\u2019s no evidence that Biden was under investigation, although he was a board member for a company whose owner was under investigation.\n\u2022 Trump said of North Korea: \u201cThey haven\u2019t had any tests over the last two years \u2014 zero.\u201d It\u2019s true that they haven\u2019t had any nuclear tests or long-range missile tests, but North Korea has tested short-range missiles twice this month.\n\u2022 The president said he will provide $15 billion in assistance to U.S. farmers hurt by the trade war, because that\u2019s \u201cthe most money that China has ever paid\u201d for U.S. agricultural goods. But federal data show that China purchased nearly $27.2 billion in U.S. agricultural goods in 2012.\n\u2022 Trump boasted that Honda is \u201ccoming in [to the U.S.] with $14.5 billion\u201d in investments. A Michigan-based automotive research group says that Honda has announced $1.7 billion in U.S. vehicle manufacturing investments over the last five years.\n\u2022 The president said he has \u201ctremendous poll numbers now.\u201d Trump\u2019s average approval rating is .\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview that aired May 19 on \u201cThe Next Revolution,\u201d Trump and the show\u2019s host, Steve Hilton, discussed foreign policy, international trade, the economy, politics and more.\n\nAt one point, Hilton raised Trump\u2019s campaign promise to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d asking the president whether former White House aides should be allowed to lobby for foreign companies. The president pivoted to 2020 \u2014 implying that a potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden, intervened while he was vice president to halt an investigation in Ukraine of his son, Hunter.\n\nTrump twisted the facts when he said that the then-vice president threatened to withhold $2 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine dropped its investigation into Hunter and fired the prosecutor. There\u2019s no evidence that Hunter was under investigation.\n\nLet\u2019s review what we know \u2014 and don\u2019t know \u2014 about the Bidens and Ukraine.\n\nAs vice president, Biden went to Ukraine and told the government that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees if Ukraine failed to address corruption and remove its prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin. We know this because Biden boasted about it last year during an appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nThe former vice president, who is now running for president, said the incident occurred during a visit to Kiev.\n\nThe U.S. wasn\u2019t the only one critical of Ukraine\u2019s anti-corruption efforts. A month earlier, the International Monetary Fund threatened to withhold $40 billion unless Ukraine undertook \u201ca substantial new effort\u201d to fight corruption.\n\nAt the time, Hunter Biden was a board member for the Burisma Group, one of the biggest private gas companies in Ukraine. He joined the board in May 2014, instantly raising concerns about a potential conflict of interest. An Associated Press article called Biden\u2019s hiring \u201cpolitically awkward.\u201d\n\n\u201cHunter Biden\u2019s employment means he will be working as a director and top lawyer for a Ukrainian energy company during the period when his father and others in the Obama administration attempt to influence the policies of Ukraine\u2019s new government, especially on energy issues,\u201d the AP wrote.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that Hunter Biden was under investigation or that his father pressured Ukraine on his behalf.\n\nA few days before Fox News aired the Trump interview, Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine\u2019s current prosecutor general, gave his own interview to Bloomberg News and said: \u201cHunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nLutsenko told Bloomberg that the prosecutor general\u2019s office in 2014 \u2014 before Shokin took office \u2014 opened a corruption investigation against Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of Burisma, and numerous others. He said the probe\u2019s focus was Serghi Kurchenko, who owned a number of gas companies, and a transaction that occurred in November 2013, months before Biden joined Burisma.\n\nThe investigation is still active, he said.\n\nThe president also spoke about North Korea and its nuclear weapons program. Trump met with North Korea dictator Kim Jong Un in June of last year, and the two leaders agreed to \u201cpromote the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d\n\nDuring Kim\u2019s reign, North Korea has conducted numerous nuclear tests and missile launches \u2014 including four nuclear weapons tests and three test launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs.\n\nIt\u2019s true that North Korea has not conducted a nuclear test since Sept. 3, 2017, and it hasn\u2019t launched an ICBM since Nov. 29, 2017. (See details in the Arms Control Association timeline.) But North Korea has conducted short-range missile tests twice this month, and it continues to actively pursue a nuclear weapons program.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community released a threat assessment report in January that said, \u201cWe continue to observe activity inconsistent with full denuclearization.\u201d\n\nThe report didn\u2019t detail what kind of activity. But a week earlier, the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington issued a report that said it found \u201capproximately 20 undeclared missile operating bases,\u201d including one that serves as a missile headquarters.\n\nA month later, three Stanford University researchers issued a report that said North Korea \u201ccontinued to operate and, in some cases, expand the nuclear weapons complex infrastructure. It continued to operate its nuclear facilities to produce plutonium and highly enriched uranium that may allow it to increase the number of nuclear weapons in its arsenal from roughly 30 in 2017 to 35-37.\u201d\n\nAnother subject that the president addressed was the ongoing trade war with China.\n\nThe Trump administration last year imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and China responded with tariffs on $110 billion of U.S. goods. The trade dispute escalated this month. First, the Trump administration on May 10 raised tariffs from 10 percent to 25 percent on about $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. China responded three days later when it announced that it would increase tariffs from 10 percent to 25 percent on roughly $60 billion worth of U.S. goods, beginning June 1.\n\nThe dispute has hurt U.S. agricultural exports in particular, and the administration responded by authorizing up to $12 billion in aid to U.S. farmers. Trump said he would increase financial assistance to $15 billion and explained how he arrived at that number.\n\nTrump told a similar story in a recent speech to the National Association of Realtors.\n\nWe asked the White House and the Department of Agriculture about this conversation. Neither responded. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative referred us to the White House.\n\nBut this much we know based on available data and emails from two federal agencies: $15 billion isn\u2019t \u201cthe biggest amount\u201d that China has spent on U.S. agricultural exports.\n\nIn its annual reports on shifts in U.S. merchandise trade, the United States International Trade Commission reported that China purchased $27.2 billion in U.S. agricultural products in 2012 \u2013 the most in one year from 2010 to 2017.\n\nThe most recent USITC report covers 2013 to 2017, and a commission spokeswoman told us a new report covering 2018 would not be released until November. However, according to the Department of Agriculture, agricultural exports to China fell dramatically to $9.2 billion in 2018. That was \u201calmost all due to retaliatory tariffs\u201d imposed by China, Wallace E. Tyner, who teaches agricultural economics at Purdue University, told us in an email.\n\nWe also know that, as of the morning of May 20, the U.S. has paid $8.54 billion to farmers through three aid programs, a USDA spokesperson said.\n\nThe Market Facilitation Program \u2014 the largest of the three programs \u2014 can provide up to $10 billion to producers of corn, cotton, sorghum, soybean, wheat, dairy, hogs, almonds and sweet cherries, according to a December report by the Congressional Research Service on the trade aid programs. The top five commodities that received assistance through the program were soybeans, corn, wheat, cotton and sorghum, the USDA spokesperson told us.\n\nWe found that, from 2009 through 2018, the most that China imported of those five commodities in any one year totaled nearly $20 billion, according to Census Bureau export data. That occurred in 2012, when China\u2019s agricultural purchases included nearly $14.9 billion in soybeans, $3.4 billion in raw cotton and $1.3 billion in corn, according to Census data.\n\nAs we said, we don\u2019t know what the president meant when he said that $15 billion was \u201cthe biggest amount they\u2019ve ever spent in this country.\u201d We will update this item if the White House responds.\n\nIn talking about the U.S. economy, Trump boasted about companies coming to the United States \u2014 singling out one car company in particular.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how many companies have relocated to the U.S. or have left the U.S. But the president overestimates Honda\u2019s future investment in the U.S.\n\nOn its website, Honda said that its total capital investment in the U.S. (not just auto manufacturing) has been $21 billion over the last 60 years, including $5.6 billion in the last five years. We could not find any new automotive investments that would equal $14.5 billion, so we reached out to the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research Group, which tracks new investments in the United States.\n\nKristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics, told us that she, too, could not match the $14.5 billion figure cited by Trump, and \u201cwe try to keep very close tabs on these things.\u201d She said Honda has announced auto manufacturing investments totaling $1.7 billion over the last five years.\n\nIn February, Honda announced that it would close a manufacturing plant in Swindon, England, in 2121, when it stops production of its current Civic model. Honda Chief Executive Officer Takahiro Hachigo told Automotive News that the next generation Civic will be manufactured in North America, but the company has yet to say where the plant or plants will be located.\n\nUpdate, May 24: \u201cWe have not provided any further detail other than we are considering production of Civic for North America in North America,\u201d Honda corporate spokesman Chris Abbruzzese told us in an email. He provided us with a list of $712 million worth of vehicle manufacturing investments that Honda had made in the United States in 2017 and 2018.\n\n\u201cWe do not disclose our future investment plans publicly,\u201d Abbruzzese said.\n\nHonda currently has five vehicle manufacturing plants in the United States, including one in Indiana that builds the current Civic models. It also manufactures Civic models in Ontario, Canada.\n\nThe president also boasted that he has \u201ctremendous poll numbers now.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s subjective, of course, to describe one\u2019s poll numbers as \u201ctremendous.\u201d But Trump\u2019s average job approval rating \u2014 based on polling data assembled from dozens of polls by Real Clear Politics and FiveThirtyEight \u2014 is currently below 43 percent.\n\nAs of May 22, Trump\u2019s average job approval rating on Real Clear Politics was 42.5 percent, and FiveThirtyEight put it at 41.1 percent. By contrast, those who disapproved of Trump\u2019s job performance averaged 53.7 percent, according to Real Clear Politics, and 53.8 percent, according to FiveThirtyEight.\n\nAs for individual polls taken this month, Trump\u2019s job approval rating reached a peak of 51 percent in the Zogby Poll, which was conducted May 2 to May 9 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percent. The low point was a Morning Consult poll, which showed the president at 37 percent. That poll was taken May 17 to 19, and had an error margin of plus or minus 2 percent.\n\nAs we often find, the president also repeated some false claims that we have previously debunked:\n\nChina Trade Deficit: The president said, \u201cWe have a trade deficit with China of $500 billion.\u201d That\u2019s false. As we have written before, the U.S. trade deficit with China in goods and services was a record $378.7 billion in 2018, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (see table 3). The U.S. had a $419.3 billion deficit with China in goods (table 6) and a $40.5 billion surplus in services (table 9).\n\nTariff Revenue: Trump said that, as a result of tariffs he has placed on Chinese goods, \u201cwe are going to be taking in possibly $100 billion, possibly more than that in tariffs. We never took in 10 cents from China.\u201d It\u2019s not true, as we have previously said, that the U.S. has never collected tariffs on Chinese goods. The amount of tariff revenue has increased, but the U.S. did collect billions of dollars each year since at least 2000. For example, the U.S. collected about $13.4 billion in 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission database. As we also wrote, tariffs are taxes paid by U.S. importers in the form of customs duties, not by the Chinese government or its companies.\n\nLiquefied Natural Gas Exporting. The president said, \u201cI was in Louisiana opening up a $10 billion LNG plant that would\u2019ve never been approved under another type of administration, never,\u201d and, \u201cThey\u2019ve been trying for years to get it built, but we got approvals very quickly for the big LNG.\u201d That\u2019s false. As we wrote before, the plant in question, Sempra Energy\u2019s Cameron LNG plant, was approved in 2014 by the Obama administration, a fact Sempra Energy confirmed.\n\nUpdate, Sept. 27: An earlier version of this story said that Biden\u2019s threat to withhold a $1 billion loan guarantee to Ukraine occurred in March 2016. We could not verify the exact date when Biden issued his ultimatum.", "lang": "en"}
