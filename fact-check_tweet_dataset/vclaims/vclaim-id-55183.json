It also came amid escalating attacks on China by the Trump administration concerning human rights, trade, espionage and maritime claims.\n\nThe BBC showed Liu the drone footage, in addition to a video testimony of an Uighur woman, and asked him to respond. Among other things, he said:\n\n\u201cThere is no such concentration camp in Xinjiang \u2026 People in Xinjiang enjoy a happy life. China is strongly opposed to any torture, persecution and discrimination of people of any ethnic group.\u201d\n\nAllegations that the Chinese authorities maintain internment camps in Xinjiang, located in western China, surfaced in 2016, and have been substantiated by leaked Chinese government documents, satellite photos, interviews and U.S. sources.\n\nSome of the most authoritative evidence came from The New York Times\u2019 \u201cXinjiang Papers\u201d and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists\u2019 \u201cChina Cables.\u201d They revealed China had an internal procedure for \u201cdealing\u201d with the Uighurs.\n\nChina has admitted to the mass detention of Uighurs but has repeatedly insisted that the camps are \u201cjob-training centers\u201d having \u201cnothing to do with human rights [or] religion.\u201d\n\nThe Xinjiang Papers suggested that the internment camps had been active at least since 2016. Chinese authorities have told family members of detainees that their relatives have been \u201cpoisoned\u201d with \u201cunhealthy\u201d Islamic extremism and that they will be \u201ccured\u201d in these camps.\n\nAccording to the Times, the Chinese Communist Party told local officials to treat \u201cany expression of doubt\u201d as a crime and to look for \u201csymptoms\u201d of religious radicalism. The detainees were not afforded due process, the Times reported, and many were detained merely for \u201cwearing long beards, giving up smoking or drinking, studying Arabic and praying outside mosques.\u201d\n\nThe China Cables revealed a Chinese government \u201cmanual\u201d for managing the detainees, including a system of warrantless searches, the use of artificial intelligence to first identify groups of Uighurs to arrest, and prison-like surveillance within the camps. The ICIJ notes that neither \u201cterrorism\u201d nor \u201cextremism\u201d is defined in any of the leaked documents, although they are the rationale for the mass arrests.\n\nMultiple international organizations, including the United Nations, have criticized China\u2019s antiterrorist policies, which have served as the basis for the creation of internment camps.\n\nA 2019 report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR) cited multiple human rights abuses that \u201cdeeply erode the foundations for the viable social, economic and political development\u201d of the Uighur Muslims.\n\nThe OHCHR found that China\u2019s policies defined religious activities as terrorism, lacked due process, restricted free speech and allowed collection of biometric data from Xinjiang residents without their full consent.\n\nThe history of the relationship between Uighurs and the Han Chinese people is complicated.\n\nThe Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region stretches along a large part of China\u2019s western border and has a Muslim majority population. As the official name suggests, there have been brief periods of self-rule.\n\nAn economic incorporation plan by China\u2019s central government, which led to significant demographic changes and increased cross-cultural contact, sparked separatist terrorist attacks in the 1990s.\n\nThe Xinjiang Papers suggest that a suicide bombing attack during Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s visit to Xinjiang in 2014, in addition to attacks before and after his tour, motivated Xi to \u201cshow absolutely no mercy\u201d to terrorists in Xinjiang.\n\nHowever, the OHCHR said \u201cdisproportionate emphasis placed by the authorities on the repression of rights of minorities risks worsening any security risk.\u201d\n\nOn July 9, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced visa restrictions on Chinese Communist Party (CCP) members alleged to be \u201cresponsible for, or complicit in, the unjust detention\u201d of minority groups in Xinjiang.\n\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, threatened sanctions on China for the \u201cgross and egregious\u201d human rights abuses against the Uighurs.\n\nThere have been calls to boycott the 2022 Beijing Summer Olympics over Xinjiang and other issues, led by key medal-winning countries, including Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.", "lang": "en"}
