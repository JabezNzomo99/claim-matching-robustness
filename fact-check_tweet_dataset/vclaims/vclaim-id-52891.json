Property damage, looting and violence have occurred during some of the protests, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Facebook video claims to show someone attempting to steal an ATM and drag it onto a bus, purportedly during the recent unrest. In the video, the bus driver shuts the door before the man can load the ATM onto the bus.\n\nThrough a reverse image search of key frames, the Daily Caller discovered that the video is not from 2020. The video appears in March 2019 articles published by NJ 101.5, a local radio station, and the Daily Mail. Both articles describe the incident as a \u201cprank\u201d orchestrated by comedian Darius Kinney in New Jersey.\n\n\u201cThe video was staged by a local comedian,\u201d a Newark Police spokeswoman said to NJ 101.5. \u201cThe ATM was put out for trash and used to shoot the video.\u201d (RELATED: Does This Video Show Protesters Breaking Into The White House?)\n\nNew Jersey Transit later posted the video on its Twitter account, asking followers to caption it, according to Newsweek. The video was later deleted.\n\n\u201cWe asked our customers to caption the already posted video; we did not stage, post or film this video so we have no context around it. We are interacting with and engaging our customers based on something already circulating on social media,\u201d a New Jersey Transit spokesperson said to Newsweek.\n\nKinney told Newsweek that the video was \u201creally just a joke.\u201d Other videos on Kinney\u2019s Instagram show he has done similar pranks with ATMs in the past.", "lang": "en"}
