The posts claim the photo shows a scene in Australia during the country's deadly bushfires. The claim is false; the posts show a virtual image created by an Australian artist using several photos.\n\nThe photo was published in this Twitter post on January 7, 2020.\n\nThe caption reads: \u201cImage is more powerful than screams of Greta. A silent girl is holding a koala. She looks straight at you from the waters of the ocean where they found a refuge. She is wearing a breathing mask. A wall of fire is behind them.
