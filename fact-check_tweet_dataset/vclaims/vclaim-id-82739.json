Marco Rubio repeats a problematic claim about what Clinton may have told the families of Benghazi victims.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2016-01-07T17:02:14Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-82739", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/01/07/recidivism-watch-rubio-on-what-clinton-told-benghazi-families/", "vclaim": "We starting a new feature: The Fact Checker Recidivism Watch. This is when candidates repeat claims that we have previously found to be incorrect or false. We intend to keep these posts short and to the point, with links to the original fact check. We welcome reader suggestions.\n\nJust two days after The Fact Checker published a comprehensive look at what Hillary Clinton may or may not have told the families of the Benghazi victims, Rubio once again claimed that Clinton \u201clied\u201d to them and asserted that the attack took place because of a video.\n\nAs we have noted, the evidence for this claim is murky and open to interpretation. But Rubio really goes too far in suggesting that she told this to all of the families of the four who were killed in the terrorist attacks. Here\u2019s the rundown of what we know:\n\nAt the very least, Rubio cannot so sweepingly declare that she made such statements to \u201cthe families of those four brave Americans.\u201d Some of those family members say they did not hear that.", "lang": "en"}
