The clinics served as an alternative to his preferred single-payer system, according to an article in the Intercept that details his role in the ACA debate: \u201cCommunity health centers accept anyone regardless of health, insurance status or ability to pay. They are founded and managed by a board composed of patients and local residents, so each center is customized to fit the needs of a community. No two health centers are alike.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would point out that as someone who supported the health-care reform bill of last year, that after health-care reform is passed, after it is implemented, we are still going to be looking at 23 million Americans without any health insurance at all,\u201d Sanders said in a joint news conference with McDermott announcing their reintroduction of the bill in 2011. He continued: \u201cI think that health-care reform is a step forward. We have got to go a lot further.\u201d\n\n\u201cHealth care should be a right of all people, not a privilege. This is not a radical idea\u2026. That is why I believe in a Medicare-for-all, single-payer health-care system. Yes. The Affordable Care Act, which I helped write and voted for, is a step forward for this country. But we must build on it and go further.\n\n Medicare for all would not only guarantee health care for all people, not only save middle-class families and our entire nation significant sums of money, it would radically improve the lives of all Americans and bring about significant improvements in our economy. People who get sick will not have to worry about paying a deductible or making a co-payment. They could go to the doctor when they should, and not end up in the emergency room. Business owners will not have to spend enormous amounts of time worrying about how they are going to provide health care for their employees. Workers will not have to be trapped in jobs they do not like simply because their employers are offering them decent health insurance plans. Instead, they will be able to pursue the jobs and work they love, which could be an enormous boon for the economy. And, by the way, moving to a Medicare-for-all program will end the disgrace of Americans paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.\u201d\n\nSanders has said repeatedly that he wants to build on the health-care system created under the Affordable Care Act and to expand it to provide health insurance regardless of income or age. It\u2019s clear that the provision in his bill to \u201crepeal\u201d ACA state exchanges was not just for the sake of repealing the law, in the way critics who oppose passage of ACA use the term \u201crepeal.\u201d\n\nWe wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios. Sanders makes it sound as if he would tack on some additional provisions or coverage to ACA \u2014 when, in reality, his new single-payer health system would replace the ACA and all other existing federal coverage. He employs political wordsmithing by calling the criticism of his bill \u201cold-fashioned political gimmickry.\u201d However, he did \u201chelp write\u201d ACA by pushing for an alternative (community health centers) to his single-payer system, making an important contribution to help get the law passed. So that tipped his rating to Two Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
