{"title": "Prophet Mohammed London Buses", "subtitle": "An old photograph of Islamic messages on London buses circulated on Facebook with claims that a UK double standard favored Muslims over Christians.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2015-12-10T00:00:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-689", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/prophet-mohammed-london-buses/", "vclaim": "The British government banned the Lord's Prayer in cinemas but then allowed Islamic messages to appear on London buses.\n\nOn 4 December 2015 a Facebook user shared the above-reproduced status update and photograph, with the former reporting that:\n\nThe user\u2019s claim that the buses were \u201call over London\u201d on 4 December 2015 was demonstrably false; reverse image searches for the photo used by that individual were dated to January 2015 (nearly a year earlier):\n\nAfter the photograph of the Islamic message on a London bus initially appeared in January 2015, it was later recirculated with a claim that the banner had been attached to the bus by order of the British government:\n\nWe were unable to substantiate any involvement by the British government in the use of the banner, but its visual style doesn\u2019t match official government signage, and the placement outside the bus appears atypical for advertisements on public transport in the UK. Although we were unable to locate a complete explanation for the banners, a commenter to the Facebook post suggested that they were displayed on buses engaged as transport for a private event:\n\nWhile the source of the banner remains unclear, the photograph in question was taken on 9 January 2015 at the latest (and wasn\u2019t from 4 December 2015).\n\nThe poster additionally claimed that \u201cthe Lords Prayer was banned in cinema\u2019s [sic],\u201d which was also not entirely accurate. A 22 November 2015 BBC article reported that a cinema chain management agency had rejected a Church of England advertisement. That advertisement included the Lord\u2019s Prayer and was turned down because its overall content was deemed too overtly religious (a policy that broadly applies to both political and religious content in cinema ads):\n\nThe Church of England has said it is \u201cdisappointed and bewildered\u201d by the refusal of leading UK cinemas to show an advert featuring the Lord\u2019s Prayer. However, the Digital Cinema Media (DCM) agency, which handles British film advertising for the major cinema chains, Odeon, Cineworld and Vue, refused to show the advert because it believed it would risk upsetting or offending audiences. In a statement, DCM said it had a policy of not accepting political or religious advertising content in its cinemas. It said that \u201csome advertisements \u2014 unintentionally or otherwise \u2014 could cause offence to those of differing political persuasions, as well as to those of differing faiths and indeed of no faith,\u201d and that \u201cin this regard, DCM treats all political or religious beliefs equally\u201d.\n\nOn 23 November 2015, the Guardian reported that:\n\nAccording to the advertising policy on DCM\u2019s website, to gain approval an advertisement must not \u201cin the reasonable opinion of DCM constitute political or religious advertising\u201d. That meant \u201cadvertising which wholly or partly advertises any religion, faith or equivalent systems of belief (including any absence of belief) or any part of any religion, faith or such equivalent systems of belief\u201d.\n\nThat piece quoted a British ad industry exec, who asserted that accepting the Church of England\u2019s ad would open the door for in-cinema proselytizing :\n\nHowever, one of the UK\u2019s leading advertising figures backed the ban. John Hegarty, who co-founded the top agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty, said it was right to have a ban on political and religious advertising in cinemas. \u201cPeople pay money to go to the cinema, very diverse audiences, and they really don\u2019t want religion dictating to them,\u201d he said. The subject matter was completely different from brands, such as trainers or soft drinks. \u201cReligion deals with profound philosophical belief.\u201d If an advertisement on behalf of the church was accepted, he said, it would be difficult to draw the line at adverts for Scientology or Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.", "lang": "en"}
