The Justice Department inspector general on June 14 released a report that found fault with the FBI\u2019s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. The 500-page report doesn\u2019t delve into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election or possible collusion with Trump\u2019s campaign, although it does scrutinize anti-Trump text messages sent by several FBI agents.\n\n\u201cManafort has nothing to do with our campaign. . . . I feel a little badly about it. They went back 12 years to get things that he did 12 years ago?\n\n\u201cYou know, Paul Manafort worked for me for a very short period of time. He worked for Ronald Reagan. He worked for Bob Dole. He worked for John McCain, or his firm did. He worked for many other Republicans. He worked for me, what, for 49 days or something? A very short period of time.\u201d\n\nManafort, who was ordered to jail June 15 for violating bail conditions, worked on Trump\u2019s presidential campaign for 144 days in 2016, 92 of them as its chairman. He was an instrumental figure.\n\n\u201cI feel badly for General Flynn. He\u2019s lost his house. He\u2019s lost his life. And some people say he lied, and some people say he didn\u2019t lie. I mean, really, it turned out maybe he didn\u2019t lie. So how can you do that?\u201d\n\nTrump has said repeatedly that he dismissed Michael Flynn for lying. The president asked for the resignation of his first national security adviser and accepted it Feb. 13, 2017. Days later, in a news conference Feb. 16, 2017, Trump said he had fired Flynn for providing incomplete information to Vice President Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. In December 2017, the president tweeted, \u201cI had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI.\u201d Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Kislyak.\n\nThis is false. As part of its border crackdown, the Trump administration is separating undocumented immigrant children from their parents largely due to a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy implemented by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. No law requires these separations. The government must release rather than detain immigrant children under a 1997 federal consent decree and a bipartisan human-trafficking law from 2008. But neither of these requires family separations.\n\n\u201cBarack Obama, I think you will admit this, he said the biggest problem that the United States has, and by far the most dangerous problem . . . is North Korea. Now, that was shortly before I entered office. I have solved that problem. Now, we\u2019re getting it memorialized and all, but that problem is largely solved, and part of the reason is we signed, number one, a very good document. But you know what? More importantly than the document \u2014 more importantly than the document, I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s denuclearization agreement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is light on details and its success or failure will depend on difficult negotiations still ahead. It\u2019s far too early to say Trump has \u201csolved\u201d the problem posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons. Trump points to the \u201cvery good document\u201d he signed, but its language is weaker than in previous agreements negotiated by the United States, which North Korea later broke.", "lang": "en"}
