By the year 2008, at the end of the Bush administration, the top 1 percent took home 21 percent of all the income earned in America. The discrepancy has not been seen since the early 20s, the 1920s. Something fundamental has happened here.\u201d\n\nBut here, let\u2019s take a look at how he frames the data on income inequality. Note that he mentions only two presidents \u2014 Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. Is it fair to look at what happened through such a partisan lens?\n\nFirst of all, the information on the disparity between chief executive officer pay and the average worker (not \u201clowest-paid worker,\u201d as Biden put it) comes from the Economic Policy Institute, which receives some funding from labor unions. We are not going to argue with the data, but take a look at the chart that illustrates the trend.\n\nAs you can see, the really huge jump in disparity took place between 1992 and 2000, when it went from about 75 to 1 to nearly 400 to 1. Who was president then? Bill Clinton, a Democrat.\n\nIn fact, the ratio is better now, after the recessions that took place at the beginning and end of the Bush presidency. A large part of the reason for the growth in the gap during the Clinton presidency is a soaring stock market and the increasing practice of awarding stock options to corporate executives. Recessions \u2014 and the subsequent decline in stocks \u2014 made those options less valuable, so the disparity declined a bit.\n\nA similar dynamic exists with income figures for the top 1 percent cited by Biden. (Here, again, Biden was not precise when he referred to \u201cwage earners.\u201d He should have said \u201cincome earners,\u201d as that would include capital gains, which accounts for a lot of the income for the top 1 percent.)\n\nWith sleight of hand, Biden refers to 1980 and mentions Reagan, and then 2008, and cites the \u201cend of the Bush administration.\u201d He somehow skips over Clinton, but look at the chart (Figure 2) from which his numbers are drawn, courtesy of Emmanuel Saez of University of California at Berkeley.\n\nOnce again, readers can see that the really big spike took place during the Clinton years, when incomes of the top 1 percent rose in real terms at an annual rate of 10.3 percent a year between 1993 and 2000 \u2014 compared to 2.68 percent for the bottom 99 percent.\n\nThere is also a bit of a jump in the Reagan years, but to some extent you need to discount that because of noisy data \u2014 the Reagan era is distorted by a change in tax policy in the tax reform act of 1986, when doctors, lawyers and so forth shifted from filing corporate income taxes to individual income taxes. The shift in reporting is reflected in an apparent surge in the income of top earners between 1986 and 1988, especially when you do not include capital gains income.\n\nAs regular readers know, The Fact Checker generally does not think it is appropriate to measure broad economic trends by presidential term. (Indeed, Saez measures income growth by business cycles.) But the Economic Policy Institute offers a chart that shows the issue has not abated during the Obama presidency \u2014 and in fact has gotten worse.\n\nThe vice president was making a point he often makes \u2014 we inherited a mess in 2008, but the middle class was being squeezed long before the Great Recession, and has not shared in the gains from the economic expansions of the last 30 years. Any way you measure it, the pay discrepancy between the wealthy and the middle class has grown dramatically over that period. The partisan takeaway from the vice president\u2019s speech is not which president or administration is primarily responsible for the discrepancy, but which political party wants to put policies in place that will help improve the situation. As the vice president made clear, supporters of the House Republican budget want to double down on the same policies that helped contribute to the status quo.\n\nLaying aside questions about the accuracy of the data, it is not intellectually honest for Vice President Biden to suggest that the disparity in income growth is entirely caused by Republican presidents and policies. The biggest changes occurred during the presidency of Bill Clinton, an economic boom period that Democrats frequently cite as a model for their policies.", "lang": "en"}
