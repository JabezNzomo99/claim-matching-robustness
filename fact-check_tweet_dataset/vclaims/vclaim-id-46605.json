It detects lights sources present on the earth's surface and can be used for environment and climate monitoring. It is specifically used to detect fires, ice, ocean color, vegetation, clouds, and land and sea surface temperatures.\n\nBesides this, data from the VIIIRS is also used for boat detection by international non-profit organization Global Fishing Watch to detect the activities of vessels in the sea at night.\n\nRappler was able to recreate the map with the layer Batongbacal used by downloading the archived keyhole markup language (kml) file for the corresponding date (June 9) from the VIIRS data repository of the Earth Observation Group. The kml file was then layered on the Google Earth application to show the activities of boats near the Philippine territory on June 9.

(READ: China omits 'besieging' by PH boats in new statement)\n\nHe said in his post that there were only a few Filipino fishing vessels that were even \"spread over the wide area of Reed Bank.\" How could the Chinese vessel possibly be \"besieged by 7 to 8 Filipino fishing boats,\" as claimed by the embassy? \u2013 Glenda Marie Castro/Rappler.com\n\nIf you suspect a Facebook page, group, account, a website, or an article is spreading false information, let Rappler know by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
