Bill Nelson says that under Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s leadership, Florida has fallen short on education funding.\n\n\"Rick Scott subtracted $1.3 billion from public schools,\" Nelson\u2019s campaign said in a September Facebook post on the page Not for Florida.\n\nA narrator in the attached video makes the timeframe a little more clear, saying \"when Rick Scott became governor he subtracted more than $1 billion from local public schools.\" Beside the words \"$1.3 billion\" in Florida ink, there\u2019s a citation for a 2013 PolitiFact fact-check.\n\nScott, the Republican challenging Nelson in November, has defended his education funding record.\n\nWe found Nelson is cherry-picking Scott\u2019s record on education funding by zeroing in on his first year and ignoring the next several years.\n\nThe video cites our fact-check of former Gov. Charlie Crist, who unsuccessfully sought his old job against Scott in 2014. Crist said Scott \"cut education by $1.3 billion\" \u2014 in his first year \u2014 which we rated Mostly True.\n\nNelson\u2019s ad focused on Scott\u2019s budget but left out what happened with the next seven budgets Scott signed.\n\nAs Scott approached his first legislative session in 2011, he unveiled a budget proposal at a tea party rally that included billions of dollars in spending cuts, including to education. The Republican-led Legislature backed some of those cuts.\n\nThe $1.3 billion figure included the reduction in state money and the expiration of the federal stimulus funds, which was the largest chunk of the cut.\n\nBy the end of his first year, Scott changed his tune on education funding. He called for a $1 billion boost to education.\n\nThe K-12 budget has since risen every year of Scott\u2019s tenure, whether we count total K-12 funds or only the state share. Scott\u2019s spokesman pointed to the fact that the total state share of K-12 funds rose from $8.7 billion in his first year to $11.9 billion in 2018-19, an increase of $3.2 billion.\n\nThe $21.1 billion for K-12 schools approved earlier this year included an increase of about $485 million, including for school safety following the Parkland shooting.\n\nWhile Scott has promoted the increases each year, his critics have said that the state\u2019s education budget is underfunded and pointed out that Florida ranks 41st in per student expenditures nationwide.\n\nAs we\u2019ve concluded in similar fact-checks, the state\u2019s total K-12 education budget has increased in raw dollars every year for the last several years. However, adjusting for inflation, we found per-pupil spending is not as high as it was before the recession crippled state tax revenues.\n\nNelson\u2019s campaign said in a Facebook post that \"Rick Scott subtracted $1.3 billion from public schools.\"\n\nNelson is repeating a familiar attack line against Scott, but this attack has become increasingly inaccurate as we get further away from Scott\u2019s first year in office.\n\nScott did oversee a $1.3 billion education cut, in 2011. Over the next seven years with Scott as governor, the education budget grew each year. That's severe cherry-picking. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
