Trump singled out Afghanistan to make his point in a speech June 13, 2016, in New Hampshire.\n\n\"According to Pew Research, 99 percent of the people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia law,\" Trump said.\n\nFirst, what is Sharia law? The Council on Foreign Relations offers a useful primer.\n\nMeaning \"path\" in Arabic, Sharia is largely derived from the Quran and is intended to guide various aspects of Muslim life. Sharia law has been incorporated in different ways, ranging from secular governments to fully Islamic governments.\n\nMany Republican presidential candidates have criticized Sharia law for its unequal treatment of women and after the Orlando attacks its views on homosexuality. They have also criticized the inclusion of Hudud punishments (ranging from stoning to execution) that are required for certain crimes such as adultery or theft.\n\nScholars say that these punishments are not necessarily used in practice and that different countries interpret and apply Sharia law differently. Like other religions, personal interpretations are subject to change over time, said Abdullahi Ahmed An-Nai\u2019im, a professor of law at Emory University.\n\n\"Sharia is understood to be the religious obligations of Muslims, but it is a normative system in which Muslims have profound differences and always have,\" An-Nai\u2019m said.\n\nTrump\u2019s figure does come from a Pew Research study published in April 2013, titled \"The World\u2019s Muslims: Religion, Politics and Society.\"\n\nOne clarification right of the bat \u2014 the Pew study found that 99 percent of Muslims in Afghanistan supported Sharia law as the \"law of the land.\" Trump said people in Afghanistan.\n\nHowever, Pew also estimated in a 2012 study that Muslims made up 99 percent of the Afghanistan population, so that distinction does not invalidate Trump\u2019s claim. Furthermore, Pew reported that their 2013 sample was representative of 94 percent of the Afghani adult population.\n\nA Pew spokeswoman said that Trump\u2019s claim is \"largely accurate.\" The \"largely\" qualification came because their study did not include the word \"oppressive\" like Trump did.\n\nTrump\u2019s statistic is relatively solid, but the survey does shed some additional light on what the 99 percent figure means, and does not mean.\n\nThe survey notes that, while overwhelming numbers of Afghani Muslims favored making Sharia law official, respondents were not unanimous on certain beliefs contained within Sharia law. Percentages are of Afghani Muslims.\n\u2022 58 percent think suicide bombing is rarely or never justified in the defense of Islam.\n\u2022 30 percent believe men and women should have equal inheritance rights;\n\u2022 37 percent believe it is \"often justified\" to kill a woman for dishonoring her family.\n\u2022 96 percent believe converting others to Islam is a religious duty.\n\nSo people\u2019s interpretation of Sharia law is not universal. Nor is it universal whom Sharia law should apply to.\n\nNearly 40 percent of respondents, for instance, said that Sharia law should only apply to other Muslims, not non-Muslim citizens.\n\nMoving away from Afghanistan, it is also important to note that other Middle East countries yield different figures.\n\nOnly 12 percent of Muslims in Turkey favor making Sharia law the \"law of the land,\" for example, and only 66 percent of Muslims in Iraq think converting others to Islam is a religious duty.\n\nThe Pew study Trump cites is also not the only study on the matter. A November 2015 study found that the majority of people in 10 countries with large Muslim populations viewed ISIS negatively (except Pakistan). The study did not include Afghanistan.\n\nArguing in favor of his proposed ban on Muslims entering the country, Trump said that a Pew Research Study had found \"99 percent of the people in Afghanistan\" support Sharia law.\n\nPew said Trump\u2019s contention was \"largely accurate,\" noting that the phrase \"oppressive\" was Trump\u2019s own. We did not take a stance on his use of the adjective.\n\nThere is some nuance in the Afghanistan results, however, as Muslims surveyed have different perspectives on various aspects of Sharia law and how it ought to be implemented. And nearly 40 percent of respondents in Afghanistan said that Sharia law should only apply to other Muslims, not non-Muslim citizens.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
