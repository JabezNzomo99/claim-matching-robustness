Try to defend that.\"\n\nPence responded, \"Well, he never said that, senator.\"\n\n\"He has absolutely said it,\" Kaine said. \"Saudi Arabia. South Korea. Japan.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s stated positions on nuclear proliferation are often contradictory, so we decided to lay them out for you here.\n\nBut reading through these exchanges, it\u2019s clear that Trump thinks it might not be such a bad thing if South Korea and Japan were to develop their own nuclear weapons, given the threat posed by North Korea.\n\n\"Mr. Trump has indicated that countries need to defend themselves and that nuclear weapons are an option that they have, but not that he supports them having those weapons,\" said Trump spokesman Steven Chung.\n\nHere are some of Trump\u2019s key comments about whether more countries should have nuclear weapons.\n\nThe New York Times asked Trump if he\u2019d object to Japan or South Korea having nuclear weapons, given their proximity to North Korea.\n\nTrump responded, \"At some point, we cannot be the policeman of the world. And unfortunately, we have a nuclear world now. And you have, Pakistan has them. You have, probably, North Korea has them. ... And, would I rather have North Korea have them with Japan sitting there having them also? You may very well be better off if that\u2019s the case. In other words, where Japan is defending itself against North Korea, which is a real problem.\"\n\nHe added later in the same interview: \"If Japan had that nuclear threat, I\u2019m not sure that would be a bad thing for us.\"\n\nCNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper asked Trump, \"If you're concerned about proliferation, letting other countries get nuclear weapons, isn't that proliferation?\"\n\nAs part of a winding response, Trump said that he both opposes nuclear proliferation (\"No, no, not proliferation. I hate nuclear more than any;\" \"I don't want more nuclear weapons\") and supports some countries obtaining nuclear weapons for the first time.\n\n\"Wouldn't you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?\" he asked Cooper.\n\nCooper: \"You would be fine with them having nuclear weapons?\"\n\nTrump: \"No, not nuclear weapons, but they have to protect themselves, or they have to pay us.\"\n\nFox News Sunday\u2019s Chris Wallace asked Trump, \"You want to have a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula?\"\n\nTrump: \"In many ways, and I say this, in many ways, the world is changing. Right now, you have Pakistan and you have North Korea and you have China and you have Russia and you have India and you have the United States and many other countries have nukes.\"\n\nTrump later added of Japan and South Korea, \"Maybe they would be better off \u2014 including with nukes, yes, including with nukes.\"\n\nCNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer asked Trump, \"You're ready to let Japan and South Korea become nuclear powers?\"\n\nTrump responded, \"I am prepared to, if they're not going to take care of us properly, we cannot afford to be the military and police for the world.\"\n\nPence said Trump \"never said\" that more nations should get nuclear weapons.\n\nTrump has said some countries, namely Japan and South Korea, might be \"better off\" if they were to develop nuclear weapons, given their proximity to North Korea.\n\nHowever, he has also said \u2014 often in the same interview \u2014 that he opposes nuclear proliferation in general.", "lang": "en"}
