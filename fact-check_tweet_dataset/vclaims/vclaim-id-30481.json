Bikers in Indonesia film a mysterious humanoid creature,\u201d and \u201cReal Hobbit is Accidentally Caught On Camera in Aceh Forest.\u201d\n\nThe video, which reportedly shows a naked man spooking a group of dirt bikers before disappearing into a field of tall grass, was originally uploaded to the YouTube page \u201cFredography\u201d on 22 March 2017:\n\nAlthough the video\u2019s description provided a general location for the footage \u2014 the Aceh region of Indonesia \u2014 the uploader was not willing to provide further information:\n\nSo what exactly does this video show? Let\u2019s examine some of the most prominent theories behind this footage.\n\nWhile conspiracy theorists may claim that the figure spotted in this video is some sort of hobbit or humanoid, other commentators had a simpler explanation: It\u2019s fake. This theory holds that the \u201ccreature\u201d was digitally inserted into the footage, similar to this video of a bear chasing a biker through the woods, or this video of a snowboarder being chased by another bear.\n\nThe most convincing piece of evidence for this theory is a still frame from the video:\n\nOther commenters claim that the real evidence that the video was faked comes toward the end of the footage, when the figure disappears into the tall grass:\n\nWe slowed down the video to take a closer look at this moment, and did not find that argument convincing. Once the figure \u201cdisappears,\u201d the stick it is carrying can still be seen as it enters the grass:\n\nOne of the reasons that this video has become so popular is its connection to a piece of Indonesian folklore. Many believe that the figure seen in the video matched the description (tan, with a short stature) of the mythical Mante Tribe. However, experts say that there is little evidence this tribe exists:\n\nAceh historian Rusdi Sufi is also doubtful that the figure seen in the video was a Mante tribe member:\n\nIt is entirely possible, given how the Internet is, that the figure seen in this video was digitally created as some sort of prank. It is also possible (although highly unlikely) that this footage shows a member of a previously undiscovered \u201cpygmy tribe\u201d. However, the most plausible explanation is also the simplest: The video shows a nearly naked human, possibly a child, spooking a group of dirt bike riders before disappearing into a field of tall grass. An unusual scene, and possibly a prankster, but nothing more than that.", "lang": "en"}
