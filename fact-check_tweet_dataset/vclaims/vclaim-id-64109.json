Artist Walter Molino ~ La-Domenica-del-Corriere cover, December 1962.\"\n\nIndia Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) found this to be a misleading. The illustration of Walter Molino with the caption \"Will we go around town like this?\" published in the Italian newspaper \"La Domenica del Corriere\" in 1962 was his futuristic solution to the traffic problem in big cities. His creation had nothing to do with a pandemic.\n\nThe archived versions of the posts are saved here, here and here.\n\nWith the help of reverse image search, we found that this viral image had been circulating on the internet earlier as well.\n\nIn 2016, people posted this image with reference to the modern mode of transport like the segway - a self-balancing two-wheeled vehicle.\n\nThese posts also suggest that this was an artwork by Italian artist Walter Molino and which was published in Domenica del Correre, in 1962.\n\nWith the help of keyword searches, we found two articles published in two different Italian websites, \"Corriere Della Sera\" and \"Plurale\", which wrote about this particular illustration of Walter Molino.\n\nAccording to these articles, this graphic was indeed published in the December 16, 1962 edition of La Domenica del Corriere (Sunday Courier), an Italian weekly newspaper.\n\nThe illustration was the artist's vision of Singoletta (or singlet) or single-passenger vehicles to alleviate traffic problems in the modern-day busy city life.\n\nThe headline of the article published in the website \"Plurale\" reads, \"The Singoletta\", the grandmother of the Segway designed in 1962 by Walter Molino\".\n\nThe article also claims that the viral image along with another illustration on traffic issues on city streets drawn by the same artist was published in the edition of La Domenica del Corriere on December 16, 1962.\n\nWalter Molino (5 November 1915 - 8 December 1997) was an Italian artist known for his series of political and satirical cartoons and comics published in various Italian publications.\n\nThe 1962 article with Walter Molino's illustration on \"La Domenica del Corriere\" never mentioned anything about the pandemic of 2020 or social distancing. It was solely written on the futuristic solution to the modern-day traffic problem in busy city life. The viral image was the artist's vision for a future vehicle that would reduce traffic problems.", "lang": "en"}
