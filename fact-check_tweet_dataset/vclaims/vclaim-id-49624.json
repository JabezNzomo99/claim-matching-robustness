They urge the administration to stop the clean-up drive until a clear rehabilitation plan is laid out.\n\nUson also appears in the video, criticizing the left-leaning group and saying that its proposal would hamper the initiative to address the prolonged problem in Manila Bay.\n\nThe video carries the disclaimer that it is \u201cfan-made\u201d and the creator does not own any materials used.\n\nThe Facts: The Makabayan bloc did not ask to have the garbage collected returned to Manila Bay. They only filed a resolution to \"postpone\" the Manila Bay rehabilitation, with provisions for the protection of marginalized sectors from the impact of the project.\n\nBut Zarate reiterated that the group is in favor of cleaning up the bay as the water pollution affects the livelihood of the local fisherfolk, including those who belong to the Pambansang Lakas ng Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas or Pamalakaya-Pilipinas.\n\nThe video embedded in the blog sites was uploaded to a YouTube channel owned by a vlogger named JM Nang. The post in his Facebook page has low engagement, but his YouTube video has almost 60,000 views and 660 comments as of this writing. \u2013 Glenda Marie Castro/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
