BOOM was able to ascertain that the viral image of a letter addressed to PM Modi was an appeal by Swamy, for a CBI probe in Rajput's death. On July 15, lawyer Ishkaran Bhandari tweeted the letter along with a YouTube link of his channel as Subramanian Swamy went live discussing the matter. In the video, Swamy reiterates how Rajput, a young talent, was gone too soon.\n\nSwamy has appointed lawyer Ishkaran Singh Bhandari to probe the actor's demise. ABP news reported that advocate Ishkaran sent a letter to the commissioner of Mumbai police to 'seal' and 'preserve' Sushant Singh Rajput's house. Swamy also sent the lawyer a covering note to ask the Mumbai Police commissioner to do the same on July 11.\n\nSpeaking to Mid Day, Anil Deshmukh, Home Minister of Maharashtra said, \"I have the tweets and the campaign. But I don't think that a CBI probe is required. The Mumbai Police is competent enough to handle such cases and they are investigating every aspect of the case including professional rivalry. As of now, we do not see any foul play. Details of the investigation will be shared once it is completed.\" Mumbai Police has recorded statements from 34 people so far.", "lang": "en"}
