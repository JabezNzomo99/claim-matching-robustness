The archived version of the article can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the viral article to be a hoax. Elisa Granato, who received the first human trial vaccine for coronavirus, is doing fine.\n\nThe same story has been published by another website called \"The Nigerian News\". Several people on Facebook have shared the misinformation.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter user \"Simon Jaysek\" shared the \"News NT\" article and wrote, \"First volunteer in UK coronavirus vaccine trial has died\".\n\nReplying to it, Twitter handle \"@surrey13\" said the news is untrue. The user claimed that Elisa Granato, on her Twitter handle @Prokaryota, has debunked this false news and tweeted that she's doing fine. Since Granato's Twitter handle is protected, only a few approved users can see her posts.\n\nAs per \"@surrey13\", Granato has replied to a tweet saying, \"Nothing like walking up to a fake article on your death ... I'm doing fine everyone. Please don't share the article in question, we don't want to give them attention / clicks. Have a cute cat instead!\"\n\nOn April 23, the first human trial of a coronavirus vaccine was conducted on two persons. Granato was one of them. She told the BBC (https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52394485), \"I'm a scientist, so I wanted to try to support the scientific process wherever I can.\"\n\nWe found that the UK's department of health and social care has also debunked this false news and tweeted, \"News circulating on social media that the first volunteer in a UK #coronavirus vaccine trial has died is completely untrue.\"\n\nThe newspaper \"Mirror\" also confirms that Granato is alive and doing fine.\n\nAFWA found that the misinformation was first circulated on April 25 on \"investorshub\", a newswire website publishing press releases. It was later picked by \"News NT\", and netizens started circulating it on social media believing it to be true.", "lang": "en"}
