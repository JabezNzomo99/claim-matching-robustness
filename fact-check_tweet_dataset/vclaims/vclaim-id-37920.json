On social media, a few statements purportedly said by him in that regard are doing rounds. Let\u2019s check the authenticity of those statements.\n\n\n\nClaim: Kerala nun rape accused, Bishop Franco Mulakkal said- \u201cWhatever happened between me and nun, it is not rape. It is the Holi Ritual of enlightenment to feel the Magical Existence of Holi Jesus at the end of the act\u201d. Fact: Bishop Franco Mulakkal hasn\u2019t made these statements. The Twitter account of a \u2018parody\u2019 (satire) website has tweeted those statements attributing to him. Also, the news channel template carrying such statements with the image of Bishop Mulakkal is digitally created using a website. Hence the claim is FALSE.\n\nAn article of \u2018India Today\u2019 states that Bishop Franco Mulakkal is accused of raping a nun in Kerala. To check if Bishop Mulakkal has made such statements in that regard, Google search was performed with the text, \u2018Whatever happened between me and nun, it is not rape. It is the Holi Ritual of enlightenment to feel the Magical Existence of Holi Jesus at the end of the act\u2019. But no relevant information was obtained in the search results.\n\n\n\nWhen searched with the same text on Facebook and Twitter, it was found that such claims have been doing rounds on social media for the past one year. During the search process, it was found that a Twitter account with the name \u2018The Unpaid News\u2019 was the first to attribute those statements to Bishop Mulakkal. The profile of that account had the description- \u2018Indian Satirical News Website. Don\u2019t believe in rumours. We bring you best fake news\u2019. So, it is the Twitter account of a \u2018parody\u2019 website and the news posted by them are not true.\n\n\n\nThe tweet had a screenshot with a news channel template carrying such statements as said by Bishop Mulakkal. When observed it carefully, the spelling of \u2018Holy\u2019 is seen as \u2018Holi\u2019 and also, near the watermark of \u2018ANI\u2019, one can find website address \u2018breakyourownnews.com\u2019. \u2018Break Your Own News\u2019 is a website that offers one to create their own template just by giving headlines and uploading an image. So, \u2018The Unpaid News\u2019 might have created such a template using this website. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, false statements from a \u2018parody\u2019 account are being attributed to Kerala nun rape accused Bishop Franco Mulakkal. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
