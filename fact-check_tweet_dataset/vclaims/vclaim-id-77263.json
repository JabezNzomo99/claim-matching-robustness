Upon its first reference it is simply \"one startling number from recent years,\" and later it is noted that the figure was \"cited in various studies,\" including one by Express Scripts.\n\nTo be clear, Jones noted, such data is limited in several ways. The first is that it is government-reported data. The second is that many drugs are marketed in one country and not another; while used frequently in the United States, hydrocodone is virtually unused elsewhere.\n\nA defined daily dose is the quantity of a particular narcotic drug used in a day by one individual. It is not a recommended dosage, but rather it is a calculation created by the International Narcotics Control Board to statistically measure opioid use with a ratio that directly relates a country\u2019s population to its consumption.\n\n\"I would say it is a commonly quoted statistic...people across a variety of disciplines, who even are somewhat expert on the topic, have repeated that statistic,\" he said.\n\nSomething worth noting, Maurer said, was that when you look at the milligram-per-person statistics, \"some countries, including Germany, Austria, Denmark and Switzerland, have opioid-consumption levels comparable to that in the US, but they are not having the same problems with harms caused by overdose. Their drug-control systems ensure a balanced approach to opioid access.\"", "lang": "en"}
