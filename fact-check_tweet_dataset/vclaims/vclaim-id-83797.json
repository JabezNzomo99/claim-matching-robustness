Standing around the guillotine are a dozen individuals, all wearing the movement\u2019s iconic high-visibility vests. The photo was taken on the Palais Royal square, in Paris.\n\nThe photo was also published on an Italian Facebook page and by social media users around the world.\n\nHowever, this image, whose photographer we were unable to track down, has nothing to do with the yellow vests movement.\n\nOur Italian colleagues, blogger David Puente and fact-checkers from Pagella Politica, mistakenly thought that the photo was from Romania, because a satirical Romanian TV show had used it in July. It was then presented as a protest by the Romanian diaspora in France.\n\nThe image actually dates back to January 2018. There is no eye-catching yellow in the original: the ribbons are actually red.\n\nIn order to trace its origin, we searched \u201cguillotine palais royal\u201d on Twitter. We the found this Tweet, which led us to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration CGT du Spectacle, a French union that represents entertainment artists.\n\nCGT Spectacle secretary general Denis Gravouil told us he is pictured in the photo: he is the hat-sporting man partially hidden by the guillotine, though more visible in the original photo.\n\nGravouil confirmed to AFP that he \u201ctook out this guillotine twice,\u201d once in December 2012, and again \u201caround January 2018 to protest budget cuts in cultural policy that were being considered by the government.\u201d The photo in the false Facebook post comes from the second protest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not at all the yellow vests, it\u2019s rather the red vests,\u201d he told AFP, amused to see his federation\u2019s action taken out of context.", "lang": "en"}
