The point I\u2019m seeking to make is that government and the presidency in making this mistake must be held accountable and asked questions. How can you have a whole ministry with so many ministers, GES, the presidency and they could not have gotten the figures right? That should be something worrying to Ghanaians. For the President to have quoted that figure, not once, not twice but severally.\u201d\n\nGhanaFact is monitoring the MP\u2019s Facebook page and will duly update this fact-check report if he effects the necessary corrections to his post.", "lang": "en"}
