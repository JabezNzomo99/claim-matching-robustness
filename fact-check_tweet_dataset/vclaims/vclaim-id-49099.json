No, that's not true: This is a false rumor spreading around the world on social media, as well as through popular messaging services. The hoax has prompted authorities in several countries to issue denials.\n\nThe claim has appeared on multiple platforms, including a post (archived here) published on Facebook by Fanny Garcia-Torres on March 21, 2020. It opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this:\n\nThe posts have been copied and pasted countless times, and many of them featured the same misspelling of coronavirus (spelled in the posts as coranavirus).\n\nHere is just a sampling of countries and territories in which the posts and text messages have appeared (and the links to official denials in the country's media or on official government websites): Switzerland, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Nepal, and Puerto Rico.\n\nGov't Dismisses Rumor About Schedule to Spray Disinfectant From Helicopters A spokesperson for the Department of State of Puerto Rico denied the authenticity of a WhatsApp message that has been widely divulged among residents. According to the message, whose origin has not been confirmed, the government had scheduled a mass disinfecting spree tonight by aerial means in order to stop the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) \"Tonight as of 11:00 p.m.\n\nIt took a few days, but the false rumor has made its way to the United States, prompting the New York City Emergency Management to issue a tweet:\n\nThere is currently no known cure or vaccine to prevent the novel coronavirus. As of March 22, 2020, the virus has killed at least 13,000 people around the world, according to CBS News.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises the best way to prevent illness is to avoid close contact with others. The CDC also suggests cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces daily.\n\nStill, spraying disinfectants from helicopters would be a highly inefficient exercise and defies common sense. The claim is a hoax.\n\nConcerns about the novel coronavirus pandemic have generated an onslaught of misinformation. Hoaxers are capitalizing on this moment of international concern to spread falsehoods and create unnecessary panic. This is just one of the latest false rumors to circulate online.\n\nOther fact checks by Lead Stories concerning coronavirus misinformation include:\n\u2022 Fact Check: Tanks NOT Arriving In San Diego, NO Martial Law\n\u2022 Fact Check: Massachusetts State Police DO Warn Of Possible Scam Related To Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: NOT A Photo Of Hundreds Of Coronavirus Dead In Italy\n\u2022 Fact Check: Coronavirus Cases In U.S. NOT Linked To 5G Rollout\n\u2022 Fact Check: Joe Biden Did NOT Test Positive For Coronavirus, As African Hoax Website Claims\n\u2022 Fact Check: Homeland Security Is NOT Preparing To Mobilize The National Guard To Combat Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: Italy Has NOT Mandated No Treatment Of All Elderly With Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: A Banana A Day Does NOT Keep The Coronavirus Away\n\u2022 Fact Check: 15 Minutes In Sauna Will NOT Kill The Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: A Dog Vaccine Can NOT Be Used To Inoculate People Against Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: The CDC Is NOT Warning People The Morel Mushroom Increases Coronavirus Risk By 200%\n\u2022 Fact Check: Baby Formula NOT Necessarily Being Shipped For Free During Coronavirus Outbreak\n\u2022 Fact Check: Train Was NOT Marked With \"COVID-19\" On Its Side\n\u2022 Fact Check: NOT 10,000 Deaths In Virus Outbreak in Michigan, Washington, Idaho, North Dakota, Missouri, Mississippi\n\u2022 Fact Check: CDC Did NOT Recommend Men Shave Their Beards To Protect Against Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: Florida Man NOT Arrested For Robbery Using Cough As A Weapon\n\u2022 Fact Check: Lysol Products Can Kill Older Strains Of Coronavirus, But Tests Have NOT Scientifically Proven They Kill Novel Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: Hair Weaves And Lace Front Wigs Made In China NOT Likely To Contain Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: Scientists Did NOT Discover That Cocaine Kills Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: NO Evidence Coronavirus Is Bioweapon Leaked From Wuhan Lab\n\u2022 Fake News: Six Coronavirus Cases NOT Confirmed In Wichita, Kansas (Or Several Other U.S. Cities)\n\u2022 Fake News: 20 Million Chinese Did NOT Convert To Islam, And It Was NOT Proven That Coronavirus Epidemic Did Not Afflict Muslims\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Evidence To Support Claim From Bioweapons Expert Who Says Coronavirus Is Biological Warfare Weapon\n\u2022 Fake News: Popping Bubble Wrap Does NOT Expose People To Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fake News: Data From Windy.com Does NOT Show Massive Release Of Sulfur Dioxide Gas Near Wuhan\n\u2022 Fake News: Latest Research Published By Chinese Scientists Did NOT Say Coronavirus Will Render Most Male Patients Infertile\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Proof That High-Rise Buildings Have Become Human Incinerators To Combat Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fake News: Residential Building NOT In Wuhan, NOT Set Ablaze To Control Coronavirus Spread", "lang": "en"}
