Not that same day, but 91 percent of individuals on terrorist watch lists who have attempted to buy a firearm or explosives since 2004 were able to complete the sale \u2014 typically in three days.\n\u2022 U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch declined \u2014 twice \u2014 to say how many Americans are on terrorist watch lists, claiming \u201cwe don\u2019t provide those exact numbers\u201d or even a range. That\u2019s false. Federal officials have told Congress that the number of U.S. citizens and legal residents on watch lists currently ranges from 5,000 to 15,000.\n\u2022 Donald Trump said a Florida gun store owner \u201creported\u201d Omar Mateen to the FBI weeks before the Orlando shooting when Mateen attempted to buy body armor and bulk ammunition, but that \u201cauthorities didn\u2019t act on it.\u201d A gun store did report the suspicious activity, but was unable to provide the FBI with his name or other information about him.\n\nIn December, the Senate defeated an amendment offered by Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California that would have allowed the attorney general to block the sale of weapons or explosives to individuals on terrorist databases if the attorney general had reason to believe that the weapons would be used in connection with terrorism. But the mass shooting in Orlando by Omar Mateen in the name of the terrorist Islamic State has reopened that debate.\n\nAfter the Orlando shooting, Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut spoke on the Senate floor for nearly 15 hours, in an attempt to get the Senate to take up gun-control legislation \u2014 including a revised version of the Feinstein amendment.\n\nLanguage was added to the Feinstein amendment to include anyone who has been the subject of a federal terrorism investigation in the past five years. That\u2019s because the FBI investigated Mateen for terrorism ties in 2013 and 2014, but closed those investigations without taking action. Mateen purchased the guns used in the attack in June.\n\nThe Senate was expected to take up Feinstein\u2019s amendment June 20 during its consideration of the annual appropriations bill for the Department of Justice and other related agencies.\n\nOn June 16, CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer interviewed Sen. James Lankford, who voted against Feinstein\u2019s amendment last year. Wolf asked Lankford, of Oklahoma, if he would vote for legislation that \u201cwould prevent those on the terror watch list from getting a gun.\u201d Lankford said known or suspected terrorists \u201ccannot just walk in and buy a firearm\u201d at a gun store.\n\nLankford\u2019s response is misleading. The FBI has limited options in dealing with individuals on a terrorist watch list who want to buy a weapon or explosives, and while the sale or transfer may not happen immediately, it can happen after 72 hours.\n\nHere\u2019s how the National Instant Criminal Background Check System works: A prospective gun buyer who tries to buy a gun from a licensed firearms dealers fills out an application that is checked against a variety of databases to determine if the applicant is legally permitted to buy a gun. Those databases contain criminal records and court records (such as warrants and protection orders), as well as immigration and naturalization records if the applicant is not a U.S. citizen.\n\nAn FBI spokesman told us that a weapons sale or transfer can be approved in less than an hour if the background search turns up no evidence that the applicant is prohibited from owning a gun. But if the name of the applicant matches any of those in the databases, then the gun purchase can be delayed for up to 72 hours \u2014 giving NICS examiners at an FBI office in West Virginia time to review the case and determine if the person is indeed prohibited from purchasing a weapon.\n\nAn application can be denied, for example, if the person is a convicted felon or fugitive, or if the person is living in the U.S. illegally or has been convicted of a domestic violence offense.\n\nIn February 2004, the Department of Justice began checking prospective gun buyers against what the FBI calls the Known or Suspected Terrorist File \u2014 which includes the Terrorist Screening Database, commonly referred to as the FBI\u2019s terrorist watch list, as explained in a May 2013 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. A match in the terrorist database triggers an automatic 72-hour delay, even if there are no other so-called \u201cprohibiting factors.\u201d\n\nIt may be, for example, that the FBI has disqualifying information on that individual that is not entered in the NICS databases.\n\nSo Lankford is correct that the \u201cFBI is pinged\u201d whenever an individual on a terrorist watch list tries to buy a gun. But the sale can proceed after three days \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly what has happened in the vast majority of cases, as we mentioned earlier.\n\nSince the National Instant Criminal Background Check System began checking prospective gun buyers against terrorist watch list records in February 2004, \u201cindividuals on the terrorist watch list were involved in firearm or explosives background checks 2,477 times, of which 2,265 (about 91 percent) of the transactions were allowed to proceed and 212 were denied,\u201d according to the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office. (See GAO chart below for more details.)\n\nBy law, all identifying information about the buyer in cases like this must be destroyed in 90 days, except for the transaction number and date. But the CRS says \u201cit is unknown what happens to the information generated by NICS-related terrorist watchlist hits that are passed on to the FBI Counterterrorism Division and investigative personnel in the field.\u201d It is possible that that information is \u201crecorded and stored electronically in the FBI\u2019s investigative case files.\u201d\n\nAn FBI spokesman told us that the FBI can open an investigation if there is probable cause. FBI guidelines say a preliminary investigation may be opened \u201con the basis of any \u2018allegation or information\u2019 indicative of possible criminal activity or threats to the national security.\u201d\n\nWe take no position on Feinstein\u2019s amendment. But Lankford isn\u2019t telling the whole story when he says that individuals on a terrorist watch list \u201ccannot just walk in and buy a firearm\u201d at a gun store. They can after a three-day wait, and nine out of 10 of those who have tried have done so.\n\nOn ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch declined \u2014 twice \u2014 to say how many Americans are on the terrorist watch list, claiming \u201cwe don\u2019t provide those exact numbers\u201d or even a range. That\u2019s false. Federal officials have told Congress that the number of \u201cU.S. persons\u201d on terrorist watch lists ranges from 5,000 to 15,000.\n\nLynch made her remarks when asked about Feinstein\u2019s amendment by \u201cThis Week\u201d host Jonathan Karl.\n\nAs we have written before, there are multiple databases that contain the names of suspected or known terrorists. The largest is the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE. The National Counterterrorism Center maintains TIDE, which the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in a 2013 report referred to as the government\u2019s \u201ccentral repository\u201d of international terrorists and suspected terrorists. The number on that list stood at 1.1 million as of December 2013, including 25,000 \u201cU.S. persons\u201d (that is, citizens and legal permanent residents), according to an NCTC fact sheet.\n\nAs of June 17, the total number of names on the TIDE list had grown to 1.5 million names, although the number of U.S. persons shrunk to \u201cfewer than 15,000,\u201d according to Feinstein\u2019s office.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center separately maintains the Terrorist Screening Database, which is commonly referred to as the Terrorist Watchlist. The FBI told Feinstein\u2019s office that there are about 1 million records in the TSDB, and about 0.5 percent of those \u2014 or fewer than 5,000 records \u2014 are of U.S. persons. The watch list includes about 81,000 names on the so-called no-fly list, including fewer than 1,000 names of U.S. persons.\n\nThe senator\u2019s office said the data were obtained from \u201cthe National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to Congressional questions.\u201d The NCTC is within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, but the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center is in the department headed by Lynch.\n\nSo Lynch was wrong when she said \u201cwe don\u2019t provide those exact numbers\u201d or even a range.\n\nDonald Trump left out important facts when he said a gun store owner \u201creported\u201d Omar Mateen to the FBI weeks before the Orlando shooting due to suspicious behavior while Mateen was trying to buy body armor and bulk ammunition, but that \u201cauthorities didn\u2019t act on it.\u201d A gun store did report the suspicious activity, but was unable to provide the FBI with Mateen\u2019s name or other information about him. And so the FBI said that due to a lack of information, it was \u201cunable to conduct any meaningful investigative follow up.\u201d\n\nTrump raised the issue on two Sunday shows on June 19. One instance came on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d in an interview with Jonathan Karl.\n\nTrump reiterated the point in a CBS \u201cFace the Nation\u201d interview with John Dickerson.\n\nIn a June 16 interview on ABC News, Robert Abell, a co-owner of Lotus Gunworks in Jensen Beach, Florida, said a man later identified as Orlando nightclub shooter Mateen came into his store several weeks before the mass shooting and attempted to buy high-grade body armor and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition.\n\nAbell said a store salesman found Mateen\u2019s behavior \u201cvery suspicious\u201d due to odd questions about the body armor \u2014 which the store did not carry \u2014 and a subsequent cell phone conversation Mateen held in a \u201cforeign language.\u201d The salesman denied Mateen\u2019s request for ammunition \u2014 Abell said he wanted bulk ammunition only \u2014 and after Mateen left, the store called the local FBI office in West Palm Beach and reported the incident.\n\n\u201dSomething in his gut told him it was wrong,\u201d Abell said of the employee, according to a New York Times report.\n\nBut Abell said they weren\u2019t able to provide Mateen\u2019s name, because no sale was made, and the surveillance footage they had was grainy, ABC News reported.\n\n\u201cWe had no link, no contact, didn\u2019t know who he was,\u201d Abell said. \u201cBut we did contact authorities and let them know we just had a suspicious person that was in here.\u201d\n\nAbell said there was a follow-up conversation with agents, but he said the FBI never visited the store or investigated further, ABC News reported.\n\nAccording to a statement from the FBI on June 17, the store operators were \u201cunable to collect any information about him, to include name, date of birth, charge card, telephonic information, or e-mail address.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, given the lack of information about this individual, FBI agents were unable to conduct any meaningful investigative follow up,\u201d the FBI statement said.\n\nAbell said it wasn\u2019t until after the deadly attack in the Orlando nightclub that a store employee recognized that the man who had entered the store that day was Mateen.\n\n\u201dAnd here\u2019s a prime example of trying to do the right thing, and we got so close to it,\u201d Abell said. \u201cBut unfortunately, he slipped through the cracks, and this is where we\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nOn ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Karl asked U.S. Attorney General Lynch if the FBI did enough to follow-up on the gun store\u2019s tip.\n\nLynch said that \u201cbecause Mateen didn\u2019t make a purchase, there was no record, there was no identifying information. But [the gun store employee] did provide that information. And that\u2019s exactly what he was supposed to have done. And we appreciate that.\u201d\n\nKarl then asked if the FBI did anything with that information.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Lynch said, \u201cat the time, there was no identifying information on that and in fact, it wasn\u2019t until these tragic events of last weekend that the gun shop owner realized, oh my goodness, that was the man that came in and, in fact, provided that information that allowed us to connect those dots.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
