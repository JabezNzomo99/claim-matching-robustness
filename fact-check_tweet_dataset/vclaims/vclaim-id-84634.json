Quoting him, the Prime Minister said, \u201c\u2026Shriman Mani Shankar Aiyar e aaje kahyu chhe, ke Jahangir ki jagah jab shahjahan aaye, kya tab election hua tha? Jab Shahjahan ki jagah par Aurangzeb aye, tab kya koi election hua tha? Yeh to pehli se hi pata tha, ki jo badshah hai uski aulad ko hi satta milegi. Iska matlab ye hua ki Congress ke varisht neta yeh khud mante hai ki Congress party, ye party nahin hai, kunba hai, aur unka kisi ka satta ka matlab pe aane ka matlab hai, ki badshah ki aulad ka bethna. Yeh Aurganzeb raj, unko mubarak.\u201d\n\nModi was referring to a sound byte given by Aiyar to news channel ABP news on the occasion of nomination to the post of President of the Congress party. BJP social media incharge Amit Malviya tweeted this video with the text \u201cMani Shankar Aiyar does it again! Compares Congress rule with Mughal Raj\u201c.\n\nSo did Mani Shankar Aiyar compare the Presidential election within the Congress party to Mughal succession? Watch the full sound byte here\n\n\u201cEk to, jab Jahangir ke jagah Shahjahaan aaye, tab koi election hua? Jab Shahjahaan ke jagah Aurganzaeb aaye, tab koi election hua? Nai. Pehle se pata tha, ki jo bhi badshaah hai, unke aulaad jo hai, woh hi banenge, woh bhi banenge, aapas mein lade to alag baat hai. Lekin, democracy mein chunaav hota hai, aur shehzaad punawala ko amantran mein de raha hoon, ki aapko yahaan aake khada hona ho to aap pahonch jaiye, application dijiye, aapne kabhi Shehzad Poonawala ka naam pehle kabhi suna tha\u201d (\u201cWhen Shahjahan took the place of Jahangir, was any election held then? When Aurangzeb succeeded Shahjahan, was any election held then? This was always known that the heir to the emperor will inherit power, although it is another matter if the successors fight among themselves. But, in a democracy, elections are held. I invite Shehzad Poonawala to come and file an application for contesting the election)\n\nIt is clear from the video that Mani Shankar Aiyar had not drawn a parallel with the Mughals in comparing the Congress party. However, that did not prevent prominent BJP functionaries from tweeting this incomplete video.\n\nWhile Aiyar is notorious for having made controversial remarks in the past including the infamous \u2018chaiwala\u2019 remark, this is a definite instance of an incomplete statement being quoted out of context for political motives. Aiyar\u2019s statement highlighting the difference between party president election and dynastic rule under Mughals was mischievously clipped and given credence to by none less than the Prime Minister. Aiyar\u2019s mention that the process for electing the party President is democratic was conveniently glossed over to suit a particular narrative.", "lang": "en"}
