Rick Perry\u2019s recent criticism of President Obama by saying Perry had himself to blame for problems in Texas. Ramirez elaborated in a Jan. 20 press release: \u201cUnder (Perry\u2019s) watch as governor, over 6 million Texans have no health care coverage, including 1 million children, homeowners suffer from the highest insurance rates in the country and college tuition has skyrocketed 136 percent from 2003 to 2008.\u201d\n\n\n\nDid Ramirez's punches hit home? We revisited his left-right, left-right combination.\n\n\n\nRamirez and Stephanie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, each pointed us to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of U.S. Census data suggesting that in 2008, 6,023,000 Texans lacked health insurance\u2014placing the state second only to California, which had more than 6.7 million residents lacking coverage.\n\n\n\nMore than 1.4 million Texas children were uninsured in 2008, the foundation estimates. The state had the most uninsured children in the nation that year; California ran second with more than 1.1 million uninsured children.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic spokesman didn\u2019t forward evidence for his next jab, that Texans pay the nation\u2019s highest home insurance rates.\n\n\n\nJerry Hagins, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Insurance, said homeowners' insurance costs more in Texas because the state is exposed to severe weather in the form of hurricanes and tornadoes and hail. \u201cTexas is high (in its rates) and will always be high,\u201d Hagins said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to sugar-coat that.\u201d\n\n\n\nIndeed, the state's rates often top those of other states, as compiled by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. In its latest report, based on 2007 data, the rates for Texas were second only to those in Florida. \n\n \n\nIn general, home insurance rates historically run highest in Texas, Florida and Louisiana because they\u2019re big states with vast coastal exposures, said Michael Barry, spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, a New York group funded by the insurance industry. \u201cHomeowner insurance prices in these states reflect the risks of losses there,\u201d Barry said.\n\n\n\nBarry suggested Texas may rise to No. 1 in the next annual compilation of rates when the data from 2008 -- the year Hurricane Ike slammed Texas -- is absorbed. \n\n\n\nOne wrinkle: The NAIC and Texas insurance department caution against comparing the Texas statistics to those from other states--partly because fewer Texas homeowners carry the comprehensive coverage highlighted in the compilation and partly because calculations for some states, such as Florida and Louisiana, don't take into account the rates paid on policies from state-guided providers of last resort. Those providers offer insurance coverage when it's not available from private insurers.\n\n\n\nBy its own calculations \u2014 which differ from the national report \u2014 the Texas department found that homeowners here don't necessarily fare worse than residents of some other states. The average annual Texas premium in 2007 was $1,251--less than the $1,401 average premium in Louisiana and $1,560 in Florida (though the Florida average excludes policies written by the state's insurer of last resort). \n\n\n\nWhat about Ramirez\u2019s last punch, on college tuition?\n\n\n\nRamirez cited a state overview stating that tuition set by public college and university boards increased 136 percent on average from fall 2003 to fall 2008.\n\n\n\nBut the same analysis states that total tuition, meaning board-set tuition levels added to baseline amounts set by lawmakers, increased 69 percent on average. Separately, the Austin American-Statesman\u2019s Ralph K.M. Haurwitz, who covers higher education, has tapped state figures to conclude that average tuition and mandatory fees \u2014 every student faces such fees \u2014 at the state\u2019s public universities climbed 86 percent, to $6,300 a year, by fall 2008.\n\n\n\nAll in all, the Democratic spokesman landed his health-insurance blows. But he slipped when he claimed Texas currently has the nation's highest home insurance rates and overshot on changes in tuition.\n\n\n\nWe rate Ramirez\u2019s statement Half True.", "lang": "en"}
