Congress has been doing precisely this). This statement has been attributed to actor Nana Patekar, and has been circulating on social media.\n\n\u2018Yogi Adityanath ki sena\u2019 is one of the Facebook pages which has posted the quote with the question \u201ckya aap bhi iss baat se sehmat hain?\u201d (Do you agree with this?). It has been shared more than 5000 times from this page alone.\n\nThis quote is patently fake. Alt News spoke to Nana Patekar who said, \u201cNeither have I said any such thing nor is this my view\u201d. Alt News found that this particular quote is hardly new and has been doing the rounds of social media for the last few years. The following tweet is from 2013.\n\nDifferent versions of the quote have been used in different contexts by both BJP and Congress supporters to take potshots at each other.\n\nFake quotes have been floating on the internet for a long time. Almost everyday, a fake quote attributed to a celebrity is brought to our notice. Alt News had unearthed an entire factory of fake quotes which are churned out with alarming frequency, targeting major public figures. Many of these quotes are communal in nature and seek to divide communities and incite tension. There is a need to identify those who are behind such mischief and legal action ought to be initiated against them.", "lang": "en"}
