{"title": "FALSE: Shocking Video Shows Shark Attacking Surfer", "subtitle": "A video purportedly showing a man being attacked by a shark actually comes from a movie called 'The Shallows.'", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-17986", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/shark-attack-the-shallows-movie/", "vclaim": "On 28 August 2016, the video displayed above was posted to the \u201cHabitat 4 Insanity\u201d Facebook page, purporting to show a man being viciously attacked by a huge shark:\n\nWhile the video was shared without any text explaining where and when the incident allegedly occurred, many of the video\u2019s viewers (it was viewed more than 16 million times within two days of its initial posting) assumed that it must show a real shark attack.\n\nHowever, this video shows not a real shark attack, but a few unattributed seconds from the movie The Shallows. The clip can be glimpsed at the 1:34 mark in the following trailer for the movie:\n\nDirector Jaume Collett-Serra told Yahoo News that the creature was completely computer-generated:\n\nThis shark is all CGI. So what\u2019s not going to work? We don\u2019t have a shark! [Laughs] I don\u2019t think anyone could have a real shark. You could shoot elements of a shark, but it would never do anything you wanted it to do. Sharks and alligators are these are prehistoric creatures that are still among us. I made a movie with real alligators once, and they\u2019ll do anything they want. Other animals can be trained, but not these animals. So if you\u2019re doing a whole movie with these creatures, you have to recreate them.\n\nSharks generally do not leap out of the water in order to grab surfers by the arms with their teeth; while it\u2019s not unheard of, most are bite-and-release attacks from the water, which can be either exploratory or intended to disable their prey. However, that behavior is still relatively rare \u2014 sharks kill around ten people a year on average, compared to the 20 to 30 million sharks a year that humans kill on average.", "lang": "en"}
