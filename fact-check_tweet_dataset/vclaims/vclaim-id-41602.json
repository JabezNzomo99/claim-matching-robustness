The tweet is from Twitter handle \u2018@0NitaAmbani\u2019 and has a profile picture of Reliance Foundation Chairperson Nita Ambani. In the tweet, the opposition party leaders and Bollywood actors were criticized for their silence on the death of sadhus in the Palghar mob lynching incident. FACTLY has found that the account \u2018@0NitaAmbani\u2019 does not exist. As per Twitter policy, accounts are taken down on the grounds of authenticity, safety, and privacy. And, when searched if Nita Ambani has an account on Twitter, it was found that she does not have any official Twitter account. So, Nita Ambani did not tweet in the context of the Palghar mob lynching incident and the tweet is from an impersonating account. Earlier, when screenshots of tweets on the name Nita Ambani went viral, FACTLY has debunked them and those fact-checks can be read here and here.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
