The FBI and U.S. Justice Department said they are also looking into it.\n\nBut one Facebook user claims that these investigations are apparently already over, sharing a purported announcement from NASCAR that Wallace confused a circular serpentine automotive belt for a noose.\n\nThe post, made to look like a screenshot of a news report, reads:\n\n\"Talladega, Ala. \u2013 NASCAR said a serpentine belt was confused as a noose in Bubba Wallace\u2019s garage stall at Talladega Speedway in Alabama on Sunday. Wallace, who is from Mobile, is the only Black driver in the Cup Series\n\nIn a statement released Sunday night, NASCAR said, \u2018Late this afternoon, NASCAR was made aware that something that resembled a noose was found in the garage stall of the 43 team. We were angry and outraged, and cannot state strongly enough how seriously we took this allegation. We launched an immediate investigation, and determined Bubba Wallace had mistaken a 26\" serpentine automotive belt for a noose.\u2019\"\n\nIn the caption, the user wrote: \"What a moron! Can\u2019t drive and don\u2019t even know what a serpentine belt is. Get everybody all stirred up over your stupidity AGAIN!!!!\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nNASCAR made no such announcement. The post was manipulated to make it look like a NASCAR statement.\n\nDespite its appearance as a news story, the supposed development has not been reported by any news organization. The most we could find was this unsourced photo on social media.\n\nThe faux statement contains some similarities to the real one that NASCAR released on June 21, but it also has notable differences, particularly the omission of a serpentine belt.\n\nWallace released his own statement, and in a show of support, dozens of drivers and crew members pushed Wallace in his car to the front of the field during pre-race activities on June 22.\n\nA Facebook post says NASCAR announced that Wallace mistook a serpentine automotive belt as a noose.\n\nThis isn\u2019t accurate. NASCAR has made no such statement as investigations continue.\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
