The message on the placard is in Hindi and its English translation is as follows\u2013 \u2018The GOVERNMENT says Triple Talaq is banned in 21 countries, but it does not say that EVM is banned in the whole world\u2019. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Image of a woman wearing a placard with the message\u2013 \u2018The GOVERNMENT says \u2018Triple Talaq\u2019 is banned in 21 countries, but it does not say that EVM is banned in the whole world\u2019. Fact: The image in the post is not original but edited one. In the original image, the message seen on the placard is\u2013 \u2018The GOVERNMENT says \u2018Triple Talaq\u2019 is banned in 21 countries, but it does not say that RESERVATION is banned in the whole world\u2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen we subjected the image to reverse image search technique, many posts and tweets with a similar image were obtained. But the message seen on the placard worn by the woman is different from the message seen on the posted image. The message on the placard in these images is as follows\u2013 \u2018The GOVERNMENT says \u2018Triple Talaq\u2019 is banned in 21 countries, but it does not say that RESERVATION is banned in the whole world\u2019. And the images have the words \u2018GOVERNMENT\u2019 (\u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930) and \u2018RESERVATION\u2019 (\u0906\u0930\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923) in the same colour (orange) and are of same \u2018font\u2019 size. But in the posted image, the words \u2018GOVERNMENT\u2019 (\u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930) and \u2018EVM\u2019 are of different colour and of varying font suggesting the image to be edited.\n\nWhen we checked if Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) are banned in the entire world, it was found that many countries across the world still use the EVMs either nationwide or in some parts of their country. Further information about it can be read here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, this image of a woman wearing a placard with the message about the ban of EVMs across the world is photoshopped.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
