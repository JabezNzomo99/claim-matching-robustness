Last night, it appeared that late President Hage Geingob was said to have died after complaining of stoamch pain, a situation medical experts describe as food poisoning. Accordiong to Dr Richard Morocky, President Hage Geingob now late was rushed to the Roman Catholic Hospital, in Windhoek in a very critical condition. \"Team of doctors including myself worked tirelessly to control the situation but all frantic efforts put up proved futile.\"-Dr Morocky said.\n\nIf the many spelling and grammar mistakes didn't betray the questionable nature of the site the fact that Geingob sent out this tweet recently proves he is still among the living:\n\nThe fake story appears to be an identical copy of an article that appeared on the (now defunct) houstonchronicle-tv.com website. You can still read it in Google's cache here, where it has been present since at least January 8, 2018. A similar death hoax appeared on March 19, 2017 on newsdaily-tv.com.\n\nAll three sites appear to be part of the same network of fake news sites that we dubbed the Dash/The Editor network and which seems to have been specializing in celebrity death hoaxes recently.", "lang": "en"}
