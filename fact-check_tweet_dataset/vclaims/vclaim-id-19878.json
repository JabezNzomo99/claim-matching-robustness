Jacobs was asked to leave. After asking Jacobs to lower the recorder, Jacobs declined. Greg then attempted to grab the phone that was pushed in his face. Jacobs grabbed Greg's wrist, and spun away from Greg, pushing them both to the ground. It's unfortunate that this aggressive behavior from a liberal journalist created this scene at our campaign volunteer BBQ.\"\n\nWe decided to parse the Gianforte campaign statement in light of other available evidence, including a published audio recording of the fracas, as well as eyewitness accounts from other reporters and Jacobs himself.\n\nAlicia Acuna, a reporter based in Fox News\u2019 Denver bureau, witnessed the altercation with two colleagues. They were setting up to interview Gianforte as the incident unfolded.\n\n\"We were in a room adjacent to a volunteer barbecue for his campaign that was about to happen,\" Acuna told Fox News\u2019 America\u2019s Newsroom. \"And then (Gianforte) came in, we started talking, introduced himself, we started talking, just chitchat about Bozeman in general.\"\n\n\"Ben Jacobs from The Guardian came in with his recorder, placed his recorder right up to (Gianforte) about here,\" Acuna said while pretending to hold a recorder roughly 7-10 inches from her face (screenshot below).\n\nAcuna\u2019s use of the verb \"place\" to describe the action Jacobs used with his recorder is at odds with the campaign\u2019s verbiage (in a written account, Acuna said of Jacobs\u2019 recorder that he \"put it up to Gianforte's face\"). Acuna\u2019s statements create a far less provocative impression than the campaign\u2019s claim that Jacobs \"aggressively shoved a recorder in Greg's face.\"\n\nThe audio recording shows Jacobs attempt to ask Gianforte about an analysis of the Republican House-passed health care bill by the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO. Gianforte then tries to postpone the discussion until later. When Jacobs persists, Gianforte refers him to spokesman Shane Scanlon. That\u2019s when things became physical.\n\nJacobs: \"...the CBO score. Because, you know, you were waiting to make your decision about health care until you saw the bill and it just came out...\"\n\nGianforte: \"Yeah, we\u2019ll talk to you about that later.\"\n\nJacobs: \"Yeah, but there\u2019s not going to be time. I\u2019m just curious \u2014\"\n\nGianforte: \"Okay, speak with Shane, please.\"\n\n\"Badger\" means \"to harass or annoy persistently,\" according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary. That definition leaves wiggle room for subjectivity in interpreting what amounts to harassment or annoying behavior, and we\u2019ll leave it to readers to decide whether Jacobs\u2019 behavior meets that threshold (and obviously, that\u2019s a separate and distinct issue from what constitutes a proportional or legal response to such behavior).\n\nFor context, however, it\u2019s worth mentioning that Gianforte previously suggested he would have more to say about the GOP House-passed health care bill after the CBO report came out.\n\nAnother important note in the timeline is that The Guardian published an April 28 story by Jacobs about Gianforte\u2019s financial ties to U.S.-sanctioned Russian companies, which could help explain Gianforte\u2019s apparent antagonism.\n\nBuzzfeed News reporter Alexis Levine, who was on the scene, told The Guardian that before the kerfuffle she overheard Gianforte\u2019s staff tell Jacobs that \"the campaign was upset with the Guardian\u2019s previous reporting.\"\n\n\u2018Jacobs was asked to leave. After asking Jacobs to lower the recorder, Jacobs declined\u2019\n\nThe 40-second audio clip does not support the claim that Gianforte asked Jacobs to lower his recorder.\n\nAt one point, Gianforte orders Jacobs to \"get the hell out of here\" -- but that doesn\u2019t occur until after a crashing sound.\n\nAcuna makes no mention of Jacobs being asked to lower the recorder. Her account backs up the recording, indicating there was no gap between the time Jacobs is asked to speak to Scanlon and the physical altercation.\n\n\u2018Greg then attempted to grab the phone that was pushed in his face. Jacobs grabbed Greg's wrist, and spun away from Greg, pushing them both to the ground\u2019\n\nAccording to Acuna, who stood some two feet away, after Gianforte referred Jacobs to his press secretary, the politician attacked the reporter.\n\n\"At that point, Gianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground behind him. Faith, Keith and I watched in disbelief as Gianforte then began punching the reporter,\" Acuna wrote, referring to her two Fox News colleagues. \"As Gianforte moved on top of Jacobs, he began yelling something to the effect of, \u2018I'm sick and tired of this!\u2019 \"\n\nAcuna later recounted the events to Fox News\u2019 America\u2019s Newsroom:\n\n\"I did see the whole thing when Gianforte grabbed him by the neck -- both hands -- slid him to the side, body-slammed him and then got on top of him and started punching and then yelling at him. And Ben Jacobs eventually kind of scrambled to his knees, grabbed his glasses, and you heard him talk about his glasses being broken and that he wanted the police called.\"\n\nAcuna clarified part of her account slightly in a subsequent interview, telling radio host Laura Ingraham that Gianforte hadn\u2019t grabbed Jacobs \"around the neck,\" as if to strangle Jacobs, but \"had one hand on each side of his neck.\"\n\nThis sequence of events is corroborated in part by an account that Buzzfeed\u2019s Levine shared in a series of tweets describing the events as she witnessed them.\n\n\"This happened behind a half-closed door, so I didn\u2019t see it all, but here\u2019s what it looked like from the outside,\" Levine tweeted. \"Ben walked into a room where a local TV crew was set up for an interview with Gianforte. All of a sudden I heard a giant crash and saw Ben\u2019s feet fly in the air as he hit the floor. Heard very angry yelling (as did all the volunteers in the room) -- sounded like Gianforte.\"\n\nHearing Jacobs\u2019 contemporaneous narration on the audio recording, in which he repeatedly accuses GIanforte of body-slamming him, is at odds with a version of events whereby Jacobs\u2019 actions caused the men to be \"push(ed) to the ground.\"\n\nGianforte: (shouting) \"I\u2019m sick and tired of you guys!\"\n\nGianforte: \"The last guy that came in here, you did the same thing! Get the hell out of here!\"\n\nGianforte: \"Get the hell out of here! The last guy did the same thing! You with The Guardian?\"\n\nJacobs: \"Yes! And you just broke my glasses.\"\n\nGianforte: \"The last guy did the same damn thing.\"\n\nJacobs: \"You just body-slammed me and broke my glasses.\"\n\nGianforte: \"Get the hell out of here.\"\n\nJacobs: \"You\u2019d like me to get the hell out of here, I\u2019d also like to call the police. Can I get you guys\u2019 names?\"\n\nUnidentified third man: \"Hey, you\u2019ve got to leave.\"\n\nJacobs: \"He just body-slammed me.\"\n\nUnidentified third man: \"You\u2019ve got to leave.\"\n\nOn the eve of his election, Gianforte tried to lay the blame for a scuffle that caused both parties to fall to the ground at the feet of a questioning reporter.\n\nBut eyewitness accounts of reporters, as well as Jacobs' real-time narration, point to Gianforte as the sole aggressor.\n\nIf the decision by three of the state\u2019s largest newspapers -- The Billings Gazette, The Missoulian and The Independent Record -- to rescind their endorsements of Gianforte is a harbinger of what\u2019s to come, then Gianforte may pay a price at the ballot box from voters who aren\u2019t buying his version of events.", "lang": "en"}
