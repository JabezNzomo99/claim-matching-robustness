Swaziland that men will from June 2019 be required to marry at least two or more wives or be jailed if they fail to do so\".\n\n\"His Majesty has not made any pronouncement to that effect as it has never been an issue raised\" by the people, Simelane said.\n\nHe said the story was \"not only an insult to the monarchy and the culture of eSwatini but a disgrace to journalism\".\n\nThe government demanded that the Zambian Observer retract its story.\n\nBy Wednesday, the article had been replaced on the Zambian Observer's website with a short piece reporting the government's denial.", "lang": "en"}
