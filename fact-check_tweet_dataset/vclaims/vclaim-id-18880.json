Though it was posted 3 months ago, the post was still getting new engagements as of writing, with over 75,000 shares, 5,000 reactions, and 1,300 comments.\n\nThe facts: RA 1126 applies to first-time job applicants only and not to everyone, as implied in Philippines Report's post. It is also known as the \u201cFirst Time Jobseekers Act.\u201d Under the law, the benefits should only be availed of once.\n\nRA 1126\u2019s long title is \u201can act waiving government fees and charges in the issuance of documents required in the application for employment of first time jobseekers.\u201d President Rodrigo Duterte signed it on April 10, 2019.\n\nApart from the 9 documents listed by Philippines Report, the law also includes on the list \u201cother documentary requirements issued by the government that may be required by employers from job applicants.\u201d (READ: New law waives gov't document fees for first-time job seekers)\n\nHowever, applications to take professional licensure examinations conducted by the Professional Regulation Commission are not covered by RA 11261. First-time job seekers are also still required to pay for Philippine passport authentications and applications for a career service examination. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
