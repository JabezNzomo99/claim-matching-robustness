According to the description, the picture of traffic was taken on February 5, 2020.\n\nThe description reads: This combination of pictures shows vehicles moving slowly on a road in Bangalore on February 5, 2020 (top) and the same road (bottom) deserted during a one-day nationwide Janata (civil) curfew imposed as a preventive measure against the COVID-19 coronavirus on March 22, 2020. \u2013 Nearly one billion people around the world were confined to their homes on March 22, as the coronavirus death toll crossed 13,000 and factories were shut in worst-hit Italy after another single-day fatalities record.
