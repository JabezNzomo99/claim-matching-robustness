But the peculiarity of their report was the misleading statement that President Buhari approved the recommendations and thus, the creation of new state police. That news is totally false!\n\n[Both the Nation and Sahara Reporters have updated their report from the initial misleading post]\n\nThe speech obtained by Dubawa and available on the Statehouse website shows the President commending the work of the National Human Rights Commission and pledging full support for the implementation of its report recommendation.\n\n\u201cI am very happy with the work of the Panel and thank the Panel members for working hard towards the realization of the Presidential Directive.\n\n\u201cI believe that the Report of the Panel and recommendations contained therein would go a long way in redressing the grievances of the complainants, ensure accountability on the part of the Police Officers in discharging their responsibilities and facilitate the various Police reforms being introduced by this administration.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you and all Nigerians that this Administration will continue to fulfil its obligations of promoting and protecting human rights of Nigerians, and will give the National Human Rights Commission all the support required to ensure full implementation of the recommendations contained in its Report.\u201d\n\nWhile the President was presented with the recommendations, he never said that any of the recommendations were approved, but rather, directed the Solicitor General of the Federation/Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Justice and Inspector General of Police to work out a modality on the implementation of the report within three months from today.", "lang": "en"}
