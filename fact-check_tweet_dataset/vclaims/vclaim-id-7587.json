No, that's not true: the video is from several weeks before Robinson's arrest. There have been protests in Whitehall in front of Downing Street, but media reports put the attendance at \"hundreds\":\n\nAn example of the video can be seen in this tweet published on May 27, 2018 by user @USAHotLips (archived here) which had following text:\n\nIn reality the video was from an event where Robinson spoke on May 6, 2018:\n\nMilo Yiannopoulos expected to speak at controversial far-right rally in central London A band of far-right speakers including Tommy Robinson and Milo Yiannopoulos are expected to speak at a 'Day for Freedom' rally in Whitehall today. Thousands have registered their interest in an online Facebook event, which suggests controversial YouTubers Count Dankula and Sargon of Akkad will also appear at the event near Downing Street.\n\nNote: this does not mean there isn't a groundswell of support for Tommy Robinson online: a petition demanding his release has collected over 300.000 signatures so far:\n\nBut the video was not of a protest demanding his release. There was an actual demonstration for that in front of Downing Street 10 last weekend but it was smaller than the old video made it appear to be, as can be seen in actual footage of the event:", "lang": "en"}
