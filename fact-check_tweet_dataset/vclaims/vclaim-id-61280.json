So there was that one bill,\" Mattiello said. \"Most of the business, and I don't want to be fact-checked, but I think by 11 o'clock 95 to 98 percent of the business was done. So we really didn't have that late-night session. We were just holding on one bill.\"\n\nMattiello may not have wanted to be fact-checked, but we couldn\u2019t resist, because we had a very different recollection of a legislative day that didn't officially end until 4:06 Saturday morning. The last vote was at 3:48 in the morning.\n\nSo was 95 to 98 percent of the business done by 11 p.m.? Was only one bill at issue? And did the House not really have a late-night session?\n\nWhen we contacted Mattiello's office, spokesman Larry Berman said in an email that \"There were 126 votes taken by House members on the final day of session (June 20). Of those, 87 were made before 11 p.m.\"\n\nThat's 69 percent, not 95 to 98 percent.\n\nHowever, Berman said, Mattiello was referring to new business. Most of those after-11-p.m. votes don't count, he argued, because all but one of those issues had already been debated before by the House.\n\nThat's a distinction the speaker didn't make on Newsmakers.\n\nThe remaining votes did consist largely of cleaning up language so House and Senate versions were identical on bills that ; ; , and eliminated the so-called master level that provides for straight-party voting .\n\nBut those are still final votes on important issues. Those votes are not insignificant.\n\nAnd when you don't leave the building until after 4 a.m., that's a late night.\n\nNicholas Mattiello said that \"by 11 o'clock 95 to 98 percent of the business was done. So we really didn't have that late-night session. We were just holding on one bill.\"\n\nIt's true that one issue -- Newport Grand and its associated bills -- was holding things up on the last night of the session.\n\nIt's much less true that 95 percent of the business was done by 11 p.m.\n\nAnd Mattiello's suggestion that you shouldn't call a 4 a.m. adjournment a late-night session simply because most votes involved legislation that members had seen before strikes us as Pants On Fire ridiculous.\n\nHis statement contains just enough truth -- the fact that one bill was at issue -- to escape having his slacks scorched. We rule it False.", "lang": "en"}
