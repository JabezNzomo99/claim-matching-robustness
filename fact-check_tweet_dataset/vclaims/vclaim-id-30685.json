Despite the man pleading, the beating does not stop. BOOM has decided not to include the video as it shows graphic violence.\n\nAlso read: No, The Chinese PM Did Not Visit A Mosque To Protect Himself From Coronavirus\n\nAlso Read: Video Showing Protest In Indonesia Shared As Kashmir\n\nA Facebook user named 'Allaoui Ahmed Bachir' held a watch party of the video on January 31, 2020, from where it was shared over 92,000 times.\n\n\n\nThe caption accompanying the Facebook watch party video reads: \"Torture of Muslim brothers in China.\"\n\nAlso read: Communally Charged Speech By Muslim Cleric Revived As Recent\n\nBOOM looked at the video closely and found that the other man in uniform had 'PKD' written on his safety helmet. We looked for its meaning and found that PKD stands for Petugas Keamanan Dalam, which is a private railway security guard in Indonesia.\n\nWe also compared the helmets.\n\nWe, while searching on YouTube, found the same video uploaded on June 9, 2017, with a caption, \"Star gang children are beaten up by soldiers\" (translated from the Indonesian). \n\n\n\nA report published on May 24, 2017, by Tribune News used a screenshot of the same video. According to the article the incident took place on May 13, 2017 at the Depok Baru station in Jakarta, Indonesia. The man being beaten was a local pick-pocket who got caught at a railway station by PKD. Read the article here.\n\nOn searching on Twitter, we found a Tweet by Lijian Zhao, Deputy Director General, Information Department, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, China, calling out the video.\n\nThe video had also been debunked by AFP and BOOM Hindi in January last year when it went viral with a claim that a Muslim man was beaten in China for having a Quran.", "lang": "en"}
