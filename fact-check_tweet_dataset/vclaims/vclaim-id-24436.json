These users are sharing the video with a claim that these students raised ' Pakistan Zindabad ' slogan.Facebook user who goes by the name Bhavani Chouhan shared the video on July 17, 2019 with a caption in Hindi that closely translates to, \"The video is said to be of Anjuman school in Mandsaur. Kids are raising 'Pakistan Zindabad' slogan as soon as they step out of their school.\"Facebook user Rakesh Kumar shared the video yesterday with an Islamophobic caption.There are many Facebook accounts that shared this video.The video is being shared with the same claim on Twitter as well.The students were not raising 'Pakistan Zindabad' slogan. They were shouting 'Saabir sahab Zindabad'.If one listens to the video carefully, it is quite evident that the kids did not say 'Pakistan Zindabad'.Seeing the claim that the video is from Mandsaur, we did a simple search on Google with keywords 'Mandsaur students Pakistan zindabad' and found a report in The New Indian Express published on July 17, 2019 titled, \"Protests by MP madrasa kids in support of principal turns into 'Pakistan Zindabad' rally over social media\".As per the report , students of a madrasa-cum-English medium school in Khanpura area in Madhya Pradesh 's Mandsaur district raised 'Saabir sahab Zindabad' slogan thinking the principal of the school -- Saabir Panwala -- was going to be sacked.Times Fact Check got in touch with Mandsaur SP Hitesh Chaudhary to know the truth behind the video.Talking to Times Fact Check, Chaudhary said, \"There was a dispute between the principal, the president and the secretary of the school regarding its management. The principal's name is Saabir and students call him Saabir sahab. Students raised 'Saabir sahab Zindabad' slogan in support of him. Some people misheard 'Saabir Sahab Zindabad' as 'Pakistan Zindabad' and raised that concern. We have analysed the video and found that no pro-Pakistan slogan was raised by the students.\"A similar video was fact-checked by Times Fact Check in December, 2018 when Congress workers in Rajasthan's Rajsamand were accused of raising 'Pakistan Zindabad' slogan when in reality they were shouting 'Bhati sahab Zindabad' in support of Congress' Rajsamand candidate Narayan Singh Bhati.Times Fact Check has found the claim that the students of a school in Mandsaur raised 'Pakistan Zindabad' slogan to be false. The students were shouting 'Saabir Sahab Zindabad'.", "lang": "en"}
