But the rule-book, which covers codes of conduct by players and coaches during games, does not actually address the national anthem. However, the NFL game operations manual, a 260-page document that addresses game rules at a higher organizational level, does. Below is a snippet of the policy:\n\nThe National Anthem must be played prior to every NFL game, and all players must be on the sideline for the National Anthem. During the National Anthem, players on the field and bench area should stand at attention, face the flag, hold helmets in their left hand, and refrain from talking. The home team should ensure that the American flag is in good condition. It should be pointed out to players and coaches that we continue to be judged by the public in this area of respect for the flag and our country. Failure to be on the field by the start of the National Anthem may result in discipline, such as fines, suspensions, and/or the forfeiture of draft choice(s) for violations of the above, including first offenses.\n\nBefore 2009, according to McCarthy, players in prime time games were not required to be on the field, instead they came out after the anthem on cue from the networks. Players in daytime games, however, were on the field during the anthem. In 2009, the NFL decided that all players should be on the field to ensure consistency across all games.\n\nEven though the manual spells out a player\u2019s conduct during the anthem, a \u201cplayer\u2019s rights as an employee are largely determined by contract,\u201d according to Michael McCann, Sports Illustrated\u2019s legal analyst and associate dean for academic affairs at the University of New Hampshire Law School. McCann spelled out the routes the league could take to fire a player for protesting in a Sept. 23 post on SI.com.\n\nMcCann found that a standard player contract \u201coffers considerable discretion to teams in the decision to terminate a player\u2019s employment.\u201d McCann points to two sections of contract, including a clause that states players must conduct themselves on and off the field in a manner that maintains \u201cpublic respect\u201d for the game. Additionally, players must also ensure their \u201cpersonal conduct\u201d does not \u201cadversely affect or reflect on the Club.\u201d\n\nLankford, in referring to a firing over prayer, is talking about Joseph Kennedy, an assistant football coach at Bremerton High School in Bremerton, Wash. Kennedy had a practice of leading teams in prayer during school football games. When it came time for his annual review, Kennedy\u2019s contract was not renewed on the grounds he \u201cfailed to follow district policy\u201d and \u201cfailed to supervise student-athletes after games due to his interactions with (the) media and (the) community,\u201d according court documents.\n\n\n\n\u201cNowhere does the First Amendment or Constitution prohibit the government or government employees from referencing religion altogether, nor does it require that government officials proactively scrub all references of religion from the public square,\u201d he said. \u201cRather, the Establishment Clause ensures both that the government does not affirmatively impose or elevate one religion over another, and that the government does not take away an individual\u2019s ability to exercise religion.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
