The caption is false, as the video shows protesters on the grounds of the Ohio Statehouse.\n\nOne Instagram post here shows the video with a caption that reads \u201cFor the first time since the 9/11 attacks the US president is hiding in his bunker\u201d and tags the location as \u201cWashington D.C.\u201d Other examples of the video can be found here and here .\n\nThe video was first shared on Twitter by a Columbus, Ohio NBC affiliate reporter named Eric Halperin on the evening of Thursday, May 28 ( here ).\n\nSeen goo.gl/maps/C6mey1oxVMzcHgih9 , goo.gl/maps/af8KzQXEGXTxWuiU6 , and goo.gl/maps/AfPxDkoMKgrxqTj87 on Google Street View, the footage shows the Ohio Statehouse, located at 1 Capitol Square in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nThe death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020 has ignited protests across the U.S. ( here , here ).\n\nWhile these videos show Columbus, Ohio rather than Washington, D.C., it is true that protests have erupted in the nation\u2019s capital, with police firing tear gas at protesters outside the White House over the weekend ( here ).\n\nProtesters set fires near the White House on Sunday ( here ). The smoke mixed with billowing clouds of tear gas as police sought to clear from the area crowds chanting \u201cGeorge Floyd.\u201d The city\u2019s mayor, Muriel Bowser, announced on Monday a curfew would be in place for two days starting at 7 p.m. and lasting until the morning hours ( here ).\n\nFalse.
