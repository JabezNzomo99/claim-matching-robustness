But Russia isn\u2019t the only place where video games are represented as real combat. On January 24, the Turkish news outlet Habert\u00fcrk TV aired a segment which purported to show Turkish forces engaging \u201cKurdish terrorists\u201d in Syria\u2019s Afrin region (currently part of the so-called Democratic Federation of Northern Syria).\n\nViewers quickly noticed that the footage came from the 2010 video game Medal of Honor, which is set in Afghanistan.\n\nThe viewer can compare the two scenes below:\n\nHabert\u00fcrk TV was founded in 2009 as a daily newspaper, according to Reporters Without Borders, (RSF) and is owned by Turgay Ciner, whose corporation \u201chas investments in media, mining, energy, real estate and tourism.\u201d While the channel is under private ownership, Habert\u00fcrk TV drew the ire of protestors in 2013 when it was among mainstream media in Turkey that ignored mass protests against the government\u2019s arrests of opponents.Turkey is listed as 155th out of 180 nations on the RSF World Press Freedom Index.\n\nIn January of 2018, Turkey began military operations against the Afrin canton, currently controlled by the Kurdish Democratic Union Party and its military, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces. The U.S.-backed SDF was instrumental in liberating Raqqa, the de facto capital of the Islamic State, in October 2017.\n\nMedal of Honor\u2019s sniper mission is quite popular with international news outlets. In February 2016, the same footage was broadcast by Iranian state TV, which claimed that it depicted a Hezbollah sniper killing Islamic State fighters. The same footage appeared in Saudi Arabian media as well.\n\nMedal of Honor, a first-person shooter game, was released in 2010. Since then, video game graphics have only continued to improve and become more realistic. Thus, it is wise to be vigilant when news outlets show dramatic combat footage. This is especially true when the footage utilizes night vision or thermal imaging, both of which can sometimes make computer-rendered images harder to distinguish.", "lang": "en"}
