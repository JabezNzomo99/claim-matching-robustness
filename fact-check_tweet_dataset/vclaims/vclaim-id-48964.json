But, FACTLY found that the same video was found to be uploaded on YouTube and Facebook in 2015 with the title: \u2018Sex workers fleeing after FIA raid at a brothel in Karachi\u2019. So, the video is not related to Shaheenbagh and is not from India. The same video was earlier shared on social media as Muslim women fleeing from quarantine in Bangalore and as women jumping from a building after being locked by the Police for shopping during the lockdown. FACTLY had debunked these stories earlier and they can be read here and here.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
