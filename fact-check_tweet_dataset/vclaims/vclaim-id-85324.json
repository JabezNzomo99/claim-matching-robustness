Alt News has received several requests to fact-check the viral audio on WhatsApp (+91 76000 11160).\n\nSome of the claims made in the audio file are \u2013 \u201c59 people have been tested positive and identified over 200 Covid-19 cases in Nagpur.\u201d The man who made the claim also added that he was informed of these numbers by \u2018Nitin\u2019.\n\nAnother claim that was made in the viral audio was that three doctors were tested positive and \u201cDr Kamlesh\u201d is currently on a ventilator due to coronavirus. \u201cHis test had to be sent to Mumbai because labs in Nagpur don\u2019t have the capacity to conduct Covid-19 tests nor the staff knows how to conduct it.\u201d\n\nThe viral audio also suggests that the Maharasthra Medical Association has recruited six doctors from Sweden and are seeking approval from the PM. \u201cThey will visit for 12 days and test the samples,\u201d the man claimed, adding that news numbers of coronavirus cases were informed to the CM but the information hasn\u2019t been made public yet.\n\nThe full audio can be heard below\n\nAlt News spoke with Anil Gadekar, district information officer, Nagpur. He said, \u201cThe audio file that claims 59 people have been tested positive for Covid-19 and a team from Sweden is coming for 12 days to conduct coronavirus test is totally fabricated. A complaint has been registered with the police. Even the cyber cell in looking into the matter.\u201d\n\nGadekar shared the district government\u2019s official data on coronavirus patients. According to the data, as of now five people have been tested positive for coronavirus in Nagpur.\n\nThe translation of the information mentioned above can be found below. As per the information, the doctor who was tested positive in Nagpur is Civil Surgeon Dr VD Paturkar. He is also the first patient to be discharged in the city.\n\nOn March 27 Times of India reported that after interrogating 35 people, the cyber cell zero-downed on three suspects. Jay Gupta (37), Amit Pardhi (38) and Divyanshu Mishra (33) have been arrested for circulating the misleading audio file.\n\nPrior to this, Nagpur police clarified via Twitter that a fake audio clip is being circulated on social media. The tweet said, \u201cExtremely irresponsible as well as misleading audio and video clips are going viral in the context of corona, serious action is being taken against those sending false information or sending false messages. Posting rumours is a serious crime.

Among major countries, India has one of the lowest rates for coronavirus.\n\nNote: The number of positive cases of the novel coronavirus in India is close to 700. This has caused the government to impose a complete restriction on movement apart from essential services. Globally, more than 4 lakh confirmed cases and close to 22,000 deaths have been reported. There is a growing sense of panic among citizens, causing them to fall for a variety of online misinformation \u2013 misleading images and videos rousing fear or medical misinformation promoting pseudoscience and invalid treatments. While your intentions may be pure, misinformation, spread especially during a global pandemic, can take lives.
