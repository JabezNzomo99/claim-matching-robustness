This irreversibly dissolves the starch granules in water attaining a state of plasticity with an increased viscosity, gel strength and tensile strength. The water used in the cooking acts as a plasticizer which increases the viscosity or plasticity.\n\n \n\n2) Rice after cooking starch becomes fluffy and developed the property of adhesiveness.\n\n \n\n3) The fluffiness of the normal cooked rice will have a bouncing effect due to volume expansion and water/air entrapment and when shaped in to ball form.\n\nBOOM has already shown through its own kitchen experiment that it is possible to make rice balls with any brand of cooked rice.\n\n\n\nFSSAI on the presence of plastic rice\n\nFood Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has a statement regarding plastic rice on its website.\n\nFSSAI states that it is a natural phenomenon of rice to burn since it is a complex carbohydrate and since rice is 80% starch.\n\nIt further states that rice has cohesive and adhesive properties and when it is cooked and transformed into ball, the air gets entrapped and becomes bouncy like a ball.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu government had dismissed plastic rice rumours reported The Indian Express on June 16, 2017.\n\n\u201cPlastic rice has not been seized in any part of India. In Tamil Nadu, social media is creating rumours of plastic rice,\u201d Food and Civil Supplies Minister R Kamaraj had said in the state assembly.", "lang": "en"}
