The claim is misleading; health experts and government regulators in Myanmar say butterfly pea flowers are not carcinogenic; the doctor cited in the posts denied issuing such statements.\n\nThe post was published here on Facebook on July 3, 2020. It has been shared more than 1,600 times.\n\nThe Burmese-language post\u2019s caption translates to English as: \"The dried butterfly pea flower [Aung Mae Nyo in Burmese] is spreading liver cancer throughout Myanmar.\"\n\nThe post goes on to claim: \"If you put the butterfly pea flower under the sun and use it, it is like you are digging your own grave. By putting it in the sun, it is like the flowers are dehydrated and the Benzene compound left. Benzene causes cancer.\u201d\n\nThe post references and includes a photo of Professor Khin Maung Win, a well-known physician and hepatologist in Myanmar.\n\nA similar claim was also published on Facebook here and here, and on other websites here and here.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading, according to experts.\n\n\u201cWe have seen no evidence to support the claim that benzene is found in the Butterfly Pea nor of any cancer risk to humans from the plant,\u201d Dr. William G Cance, the chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, told AFP in an email on July 14.\n\nDr. Ruth Lunn, the director of the US National Toxicology Program\u2019s (NTP) Office of the Report on Carcinogens, also stated that while benzene -- a naturally occurring chemical compound -- does cause leukemia, it has not been linked to liver cancer.\n\n\u201cThe NTP has not studied butterfly pea, and therefore have not, and cannot, classify it as a carcinogen. Regarding the alleged breakdown product if put in the sun, benzene hasn\u2019t been linked to liver cancer,\u201d Lunn told AFP in an email on July 16.\n\nProfessor Khin Maung Win, the doctor referenced in the misleading posts, also denied making statements on the purported health effects of butterfly pea flowers.\n\n\u201cThat is completely false news. I don't know whether they wanted to attack me, or they wanted to attack the \u2018butterfly pea\u2019 producers,\u201d he told AFP in an interview on July 13. \u201cI didn\u2019t make any comments about this \u2018butterfly pea\u2019 in the media. I haven't said a single word about it.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
