The statement is false.\n\nOn April 21, Millendez uploaded a video of himself on Facebook and YouTube, telling the public he has been studying and reviewing various scientific journals that prove spermine, a polyamine compound found in the body\u2019s cells, can \u201ckill viruses.\u201d Spermine is present in semen, in higher concentrations.\n\nMillendez captioned his video clips with a summary of a study listed in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the U.S. National Library of Medicine. The 2016 study was the result of an experiment by scientists of the Pasteur Institute in France, on how reducing spermine and spermidine can control the Zika and Chikungunya virus from reproducing in the body. Both viruses are transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes.\n\nIn an email to VERA Files, Bryan C. Mounce, one of the authors of the study, said Millendez\u2019s claim is \u201cfactually incorrect\u201d and contradicts the result of their experiment.\n\n\u201cOur study shows that spermidine and spermine are pro-viral and that polyamine depletion is antiviral\u2026while spermidine and spermine are present in human semen, our studies do not support that semen ingestion would be antiviral,\u201d Mounce explained.\n\nAs for semen\u2019s supposed antiseptic properties, the Department of Health and World Health Organization (WHO) do not recommend its use to rid hands of germs to help prevent diseases including COVID-19. Washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is still best, according to the agencies. The alternative is using isopropyl or ethyl alcohol with at least 70% concentration.\n\nOn April 17, the Philippines was included in the countries participating in the WHO\u2019s Solidarity trial, which will \u201ctest the safety and effectiveness of four possible therapies in treating COVID-19.\u201d\n\nMillendez\u2019 YouTube post has been viewed over 116,000 times and shared in at least 25 public Facebook groups. It garnered over 163,000 interactions and could have reached over 1.6 million netizens. Other YouTube channels have edited and re-uploaded his clip.", "lang": "en"}
