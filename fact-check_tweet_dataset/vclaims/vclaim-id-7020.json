There was a furious backlash by religious researcher Joshua Grubbs that in reality many studies showed the opposite of what Pence claimed \u2014 that religion is declining in the United States.\n\nWe traced Pence\u2019s two key points \u2014 about the percentage of Americans \u201cwho live out their religion\u201d and the fourfold gain in religious Americans since 1776 \u2014 to a 2018 article that appeared in the Federalist. The Federalist article, headlined \u201cNew Harvard Research Says U.S. Christianity Is not Shrinking, But Growing Stronger,\u201d responded to what it called \u201can exceedingly silly article in The Atlantic on Vice President Pence.\u201d\n\nYou can see that while greater percentage of Americans have no ties to religion, there is a persistent percentage of Americans with a strong affiliation. Other charts show a similar trend. Whereas the percentage who never attend religious services is climbing and the percentage who sometimes attend is falling, the percentage who attend multiple times a week has remained steady.\n\nPence\u2019s language is \u201cimprecise because it chooses one thing to highlight while leaving out an equally important part of the story of American religious change: Although intense religion persists, moderate religion is declining quickly,\u201d Schnabel told The Fact Checker. \u201cIt may in fact be because of the intensity of American religion, and the perceived partisan polarization of American religion, that moderately religious people are leaving it behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur data do not support the conclusion that religion is on the rise in the United States,\u201d Schnabel said. \u201cSome of the coverage of our paper made that argument, including the Federalist coverage, but our study simply shows that intense religion is persistent even as moderate religion declines. Subsequently, of those who remain religious, a higher proportion are intensely religious.\u201d\n\nPew Research Center, 2015: U.S. Public Becoming Less Religious. \u201cAn extensive new survey of more than 35,000 U.S. adults finds that the percentages who say they believe in God, pray daily and regularly go to church or other religious services all have declined modestly in recent years.\u201d\n\nAs for Pence\u2019s claim that \u201cfour times as many Americans go to church on a regular basis than at the time of our nation\u2019s founding,\u201d that was derived from research by Finke and Starke for their book, \u201cThe Churching of America.\u201d We have reproduced a chart from the 2005 version of the book below. Their numbers for 1776, based on the fact the Colonial churches didn\u2019t have the capacity to hold a high percent of the population on any given Sunday, are lower than some other researchers. But there is little dispute among researchers that there was rapid growth in the proportion of people who were listed as members in churches in the 19th century and early 20th century.\n\nPence has latched onto one specific study to make the claim that the percentage of truly religious in the United States have remained consistent in recent decades and that \u201cfaith is gaining new life across America.\u201d But that study actually undermines his point, as it demonstrated that except for a core group, religion is fading away for other Americans. Other studies back up those trends. Pence earns Two Pinocchios for his cherry-picking. He\u2019s also simply wrong to claim that weekly attendance has been consistent; it\u2019s been dropping for years.", "lang": "en"}
