Is it a pole? A bottle?\u201d It was retweeted over 1,500 times.\n\nTwitter user @MrutyunjayNJ implied that the bullets shot were not genuine. He tweeted, \u201c1. Minute traces of blood. 2. RED COLOUR BOTTLE IN HAND. 3. Supplied with glucose bottle. Pulse rate measuring, and big plaster. It\u2019s like the man fired just gun powered and the boy applied red colour from the bottle. This are the same bullets that is used in movies.\u201d\n\nOn January 31, Alok Sharma, a former student of Armed Forces Medical College (as per Facebook bio), posted the viral images on Facebook and claimed that Farooq\u2019s injury is scripted. He wrote, \u201cAnd if you look closely you will also notice the \u2018blood\u2019 appearing first on the opposite side of injury!!! And on the hand of the assister.\u201d\n\nSeveral users have posted these images and questioned the nature of the red bottle on Facebook and Twitter. Alt News has received several requests to fact-check the images on WhatsApp (+91 76000 11160) and its official Android application. Alt News did a keyword search on Twitter and found a tweet by Saahil Murli Menghani, a journalist with CNN News 18. Menghani had shared the same image and said, \u201cShadab can be seen bleeding here. Jamia gun attack.\u201d Shadab can be seen bleeding here. On January 30, Prof. Ali Khan Mahmudabad from Ashoka University tweeted an image of Farooq from a different angle while replying to Mitra on Twitter and said, \u201cIf you cared to look at it from another angle- another perspective even- then you would see it\u2019s a water bottle being carried by the lady who was helping the injured man. It\u2019s stunning to see how far you are willing to go to peddle your propaganda.\u201d Alt News compared the viral image and the one shared by Mahmudabad. In the viral image, the bottle has been highlighted (yellow) in a manner its strap isn\u2019t visible. In Mahmudabad\u2019s image, the strap is clearly visible \u2013 highlighted in red by Alt News.\n\nThe women assisting Farooq is Midhat Samra, an economics student at Jamia Millia Islamia. Alt News spoke with Samra and she confirmed, \u201cThe red bottle is simply a water bottle.\u201d Samra also shared a picture of the bottle.", "lang": "en"}
