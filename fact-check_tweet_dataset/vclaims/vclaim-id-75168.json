Elizabeth Warren announced her bid to run for president in 2020, a claim started to go around saying she takes medication that treats disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\n\nA recent Facebook post shared on a page belonging to David Zublick, a conservative news personality, claimed that \"according to sources Senator Elizabeth Warren has been on Risperdal since first being prescribed the drug in 2011. Risperdal is used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and irritability caused by autism.....developing.\"\n\nThe Jan. 1 post, which was shared 580 times in six days, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe post contains no sources or evidence. No other details have been posted to Zublick\u2019s page since then. Zublick also did not respond to a request to provide documentation to back up his claim.\n\nA tweet with identical wording as Zublick\u2019s post from the user \"Anonamis6\" was also shared on Jan. 1. That tweet has since been removed from Twitter.\n\nWe inquired with Twitter as to why the tweet was removed from the site, but did not get an immediate response.\n\nWhen we searched Twitter and Facebook to see if there had ever been any earlier tweets or posts linking Warren with the drug, we found only one other mention: a tweet from Dec. 31 from an account called \"Gumlegs\" (which was what early 20th Century comedian W.C. Fields called wheelchair-bound Democratic Party leader President Franklin D. Roosevelt).\n\nThe Gumlegs tweet uses the same wording as Zublick and Anonamis6, stating that \"according to sources\" Warren has been taking the drug since 2011. But Gumlegs\u2019 tweet is made in response to a clip of a Fox News interview with President Donald Trump about Warren\u2019s announcement that she plans to run for president. In the interview, when asked if Trump believes Warren could win the presidency, Trump says \"you\u2019d have to ask her psychiatrist.\"\n\nIt is interesting that Trump would invoke questions about Warren\u2019s psychiatric health, given the scrutiny he has faced from mental health providers themselves.\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign told PolitiFact she is not taking the medication.\n\n\"She has never been prescribed, nor has she ever taken Risperdal,\" spokesperson Kristen Orthman said.\n\nThe medication is listed as an antipsychotic that treats certain mental-mood disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and irritability associated with autistic disorder.\n\n\"Risperidone (the drug\u2019s generic name) belongs to a class of drugs called atypical antipsychotics. It works by helping to restore the balance of certain natural substances in the brain,\" according to WebMD.\n\nA Facebook post claims Warren has been taking the medication Risperdal \"since first being prescribed the drug in 2011.\" It also says that the medication treats ailments such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\n\nThere has been no documentation or evidence offered to suggest this is true, and seems to stem from a comment Trump made suggesting Warren has a psychiatrist. Warren\u2019s campaign also says she has never been prescribed the medication.\n\nThis post lacks supporting evidence. We rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
