Increased deficits could lead to Medicare spending cuts, however.\n\nThere is a rumor floating around that the new tax bill has a hidden section included that will deny cancer treatment to patients on Medicare. Have you heard anything about it? It sounds absurd but so does so much else nowadays.\n\nSeveral readers have asked us some variation of this question. Like many rumors, it began with a nugget of truth and then took on a far-fetched life of its own.\n\nThere is no \u201chidden section\u201d in the Republican tax bill that denies cancer treatment, or any other kind of health treatment, to Medicare beneficiaries, or anyone with other types of insurance. Nor is it true that \u201cMedicare may no longer cover cancer treatment,\u201d as another reader inquired.\n\nWhat could happen under congressional rules is a spending cut to some mandatory programs, including Medicare, because the tax bill increases the deficit.\n\nA tax cut that isn\u2019t paid for would trigger offsetting spending cuts under congressional \u201cpay-go,\u201d or \u201cpay-as-you-go,\u201d rules. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, however, have said that Congress would waive the pay-go requirement so that the across-the-board cuts to some mandatory spending programs wouldn\u2019t happen.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a Nov. 14 report, requested by Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer, that because of the pay-go rules, if legislation \u2014 like the tax bill \u2014 increases the deficit, the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget \u201cis required to order a sequestration to eliminate the overage. The authority to determine whether a sequestration is required (and if so, exactly how to make the necessary cuts in budget authority) rests solely with OMB.\u201d\n\nSo, if the tax bill is enacted and would increase deficits by an estimated $1.5 trillion over 10 years, OMB would have to order spending reductions for fiscal 2018 of $136 billion, CBO estimated. That\u2019s unless other legislation is enacted to offset the deficit increase or there\u2019s a waiver of these pay-go rules, as McConnell and Ryan have promised. The pay-go law limits cuts to Medicare to 4 percentage points, which is about $25 billion for fiscal 2018.\n\nThis sparked news reports that the tax bill could prompt a $25 billion cut to Medicare.\n\nWhat does that have to do with cancer treatment?\n\nIn 2013, when Medicare faced an automatic 2 percent cut under the sequester, some cancer clinics told the Washington Post that they couldn\u2019t afford to continue administering pricey chemotherapy drugs and still stay in business. The Post\u2018s Sarah Kliff wrote: \u201cCancer patients turned away from local oncology clinics may seek care at hospitals, which also deliver chemotherapy treatments.\u201d\n\nOncology clinics are again concerned about a potential cut to payments they receive from Medicare for these cancer drugs. The Community Oncology Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy group for these practices, said in a Nov. 30 press release that a further cut \u201cwill reduce access and increase costs for patients.\u201d\n\nOf course that\u2019s not the same as Medicare \u201cno longer\u201d covering cancer treatments, as our readers have asked. One reader pointed to a headline on the liberal Daily Kos blog as the source of the claim. It said: \u201cThe Republican tax bill will end cancer treatment for Medicare patients.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve explained, that\u2019s not what the tax bill would do. There\u2019s certainly concern, however, about the pay-go spending cut trigger and the potential impact.\n\nMcConnell and Ryan issued a joint statement on Dec. 1, saying Congress would waive the pay-go requirement.\n\nRepublicans would need Democratic help to pass legislation to waive the requirement. Such a bill would need 60 votes in the Senate, and Republicans now have 52 seats, which will drop to 51 once the senator-elect from Alabama, Doug Jones, takes office.\n\nHoyer indicated in a statement that such a deal would be possible, with Democratic input. \u201cWhile it is possible to avoid the PAYGO enforcement cuts triggered by their added deficits, Republicans would need Democratic votes to do it, requiring them to abandon their go-it-alone partisan strategy,\u201d he said.\n\nMedicare is hardly the only program that would face spending cuts if the pay-go rules weren\u2019t waived, or the tax bill\u2019s deficit spending wasn\u2019t alleviated in another way. Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, wrote in a Dec. 12 op-ed for The Hill newspaper that automatic pay-go cuts would \u201capply to Medicare, agriculture subsidies, student loans, the Social Services Block Grant, parts of border security and mandatory spending in the Affordable Care Act other than exchange subsidies and Medicaid expansion. \u2026. Most affected programs other than Medicare, would be wiped out.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the CBO said in its letter to Hoyer that since the pay-go law exempts some programs, including Social Security, from automatic cuts, there aren\u2019t enough available resources left to make all of the required spending cuts for an increase in the deficit of $1.5 trillion over 10 years. \u201cGiven that the required reduction in spending exceeds the estimated amount of available resources in each year over the next 10 years, in the absence of further legislation, OMB would be unable to implement the full extent of outlay reductions required by the PAYGO law,\u201d CBO said.\n\nMacGuineas, who notes she is \u201csomeone who believes spending cuts are in order and overdue,\u201d wrote that allowing the pay-go triggered cuts to happen \u201cwouldn\u2019t be sensible at all \u2014 this would not be trimming the budget with a scalpel, a hammer or even a sledgehammer, but with a wrecking ball.\u201d\n\nThe CRFB president gave suggestions on how to lessen the cost of the tax legislation. Republicans hope to vote on a final bill next week.\n\nLetter to the Honorable Steny H. Hoyer.
