The letter is a supposed order issued by the Tourism Ministry which says that hotels and restaurants will remain closed till October 15.\n\nThe order also says that \u201call tourism departments of India\u201d have been informed. At one point, it specifically talks about closing north Indian hotels, restaurants and resorts. It also says that in case of any violation, a case will be filed against the owner of the property.\n\nFirst of all, the supposed order is replete with spelling and grammatical errors which is unusual for any official document. The order also mentions a website \u2013 indiantourism.org \u2013 which doesn\u2019t exist. The official website of the Tourism Ministry is tourism.gov.in. All government websites either end with \u2018.gov\u2019 or \u2018.nic\u2019.\n\nWith a keyword search on Google, we couldn\u2019t find any news report which said that hotels, restaurants, and resorts will remain closed till October 15. Press Information Bureau of India\u2019s fact-checking handle on Twitter had called out the misinformation and dubbed the order as fake. \u201cThe order is Fake and has NOT been issued by Ministry of Tourism.\u201d reads the tweet.\n\nEarlier, we had debunked a fake notice which was circulating in the name of the World Health Organisation (WHO).", "lang": "en"}
