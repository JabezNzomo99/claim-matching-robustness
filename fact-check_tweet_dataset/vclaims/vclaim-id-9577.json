Immediately, both sides of the dispute declared victory.\n\n\u201cThe European Court of Human rights (ECHR) has refused to recognize the embezzlement case against Russian activists Aleksey and Oleg Navalny as politically-motivated,\u201d RT, the Russian government-funded broadcaster, reported the same day the verdict was made public.\n\nThe Russian Justice Ministry said in a statement that the \u201cinadmissibility\u201d of the Navalny brothers claim of politically motivated prosecution was \u201cso obvious\u201d to the ECHR that the court did not even consider investigating it.\n\n\u201cWe have won. Thank you to all for your support,\u201d Alexey Navalny tweeted, with a link to his blog posting on the court decision.\n\nIt is possible for two opposing sides in a court case to perceive a verdict as a victory, but such cases usually involve some kind of a compromise, unlike in this case.\n\nThus, it appears that one side was not completely accurate in claiming victory over the other.\n\nHere are the facts from the ECHR\u2019s press release:\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s Chamber judgment in the case of Navalnyye v. Russia (application no. 101/15) the European Court of Human Rights held, unanimously, that there had been: a violation of Article 7 (no punishment without law) of the European Convention on Human Rights and a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (right to a fair trial).\u201d\n\nIn regard to fines and compensation, the ECHR ruled that:\n\n\u201cRussia was to pay to each applicant 10,000 euros (EUR) in respect of nonpecuniary damage; furthermore, it was to pay, in respect of costs and expenses, EUR 45,000 to Aleksey Navalnyy, and EUR 10,971 and 460,000 Russian roubles to Oleg Navalnyy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a strong result in any court,\u201d said Christopher Swift, a professor of National Securities Studies at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, referring to the Navalny brother\u2019s victory on two out of three claims.\n\nThe ECHR failed to act on the allegation that the Navalny prosecution was politically motivated, a provision of the convention the European court rarely invokes in cases involving Russia \u2013 not since 2004.\n\nWhile RT included some of the key details about the two violations in its report, the Justice Ministry ignored them completely. It hinted in its statement that Russia \u201cmight consider\u201d appealing the ECHR ruling, which raises the question of \u00adwhy anyone would appeal a verdict if it was a victory.\n\nThe Justice Ministry\u2019s sole focus on the one claim it denied \u201cmischaracterizes its implications,\u201d said Swift, who also practices international law at a Washington, DC firm. He told Polygraph.info that the Navalny brothers \u201cwere deprived of their right to a fair trial and punished unfairly\u201d by Russia.\n\nIn December 2014, the Russian court convicted the prominent Russian opposition leader and aspiring presidential nominee Alexey Navalny, along with his brother Oleg Navalny, of fraud. Many view that verdict as politically motivated.\n\nThe Navalny brothers filed a complaint with the ECRH in January 2015.\n\nSwift noted the brothers\u2019 appeal did not circumvent Russian law. \u201cThey\u2019re pursuing the last appeal available to them in a forum that the Russian Government accepted when it signed the Convention,\u201d Swift concluded.", "lang": "en"}
