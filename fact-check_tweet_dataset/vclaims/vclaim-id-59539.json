Fox News' Sean Hannity and Kimberly Guilfoyle talked about whether Hannity's head would spontaneously combust or simply explode if his kid had been among those at the school.\n\n\"That's not too creepy,\" Fox News host Glenn Beck said sarcastically on his Sept. 24 show after showing a clip of the video. \"Did anybody in the room stop and think for a second, 'Wait a minute. I really wouldn't want my kids chanting a song about George W. Bush, so maybe I shouldn't do it with this one?'\"\n\nBy Friday, the number of people who had viewed the video neared half a million.\n\nIn his e-mail, Steele said he was so stunned and outraged by the video, he felt the need to circulate it immediately.\n\n\"In the video, impressionable youngsters at a public school in New Jersey, most of whom are no more than six or seven years old, have been instructed to sing the praises of 'Barack Hussein Obama,'\" Steele wrote.\n\n\"Friend, this is the type of propaganda you would see in Stalin's Russia or Kim Jong Il's North Korea. I never thought the day would come when I'd see it here in America.\"\n\nYou can argue whether or not Steele laid the political rhetoric on a little too thick.\n\nThe fact we wanted to check was the question that immediately popped into our head when we saw the video, \"Did this really happen at a public school?\"\n\nThe short answer is yes. It happened at B. Bernice Young Elementary School in Burlington Township, N.J. That's a public school in the Burlington Township School District. In the video, about 18 second-graders are in an auditorium singing two songs about Obama.\n\nHere are some lyrics to the first song:\n\nHe said that all must lend a hand\n\nTo make this country strong again \n\n\n\nHe said we must be fair today \n\n\n\nThe second song is set to the tune of The Battle Hymn of the Republic .\n\n\"Hello, Mr. President we honor you today! \n\n\n\nFor all your great accomplishments, we all doth say \"hooray!\" \n\n\n\nThe first black American to lead this great nation! \n\n\n\nTo make this country's economy No. 1 again!\"\n\nAccording to school district officials, the video was shot in February 2009 and was part of a program to recognize famous and accomplished African-Americans during Black History Month.\n\n\"There was no intention to indoctrinate children,\" District Superintendent Christopher Manno said in a released statement. \"There was no political agenda underlying the activity.\"\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Education also responded via prepared statement.\n\n\"The commissioner has directed the superintendent to conduct a thorough review of what happened to ensure students can celebrate the achievements of African-Americans during Black History Month without inappropriate partisan politics in the classroom, as well as ensuring the privacy of children is not violated,\" said Beth Auerswald, a spokeswoman for the district. \"In addition, it is our understanding the teacher in question retired at the end of the last school year.\"\n\nIt's unclear who wrote the lyrics or shot the video. In a note to parents and the media on Sept. 24, Superintendent Manno said \"the recording and distribution of the class activity were unauthorized.\" Fox News reported that the video was originally posted on the Internet by Charisse Carney-Nunes, author of the children's book I Am Barack Obama. We sent an e-mail to the address on Carney-Nunes' Web site and received a response that, \"At this time, Charisse has no comment for press.\"\n\nOn Friday, Fox News caught up with a few parents in the drop-off line at B. Bernice Young Elementary School. Opinions varied about the appropriateness of the songs.\n\nNext stop Stalinist Russia? We'll leave that to parents, school officials and political pundits to argue about. We were checking Steele's comment that \"impressionable youngsters at a public school in New Jersey, most of whom are no more than 6 or 7 years old, have been instructed to sing the praises of 'Barack Hussein Obama.'\"\n\nYes, they were second-graders, which makes them 7 or 8 years old, and therefore, \"impressionable.\" And the video shows the teacher directing them to sing. Most importantly, this was at a public school. So we find Steele's claim to be True.", "lang": "en"}
