These posts can be seen here (archived), here (archived) and here (archived). Through this article let\u2019s fact-check the claims made in these posts.\n\nClaim: Videos related to the recent Indian and Chinese troops standoff near Ladakh on the intervening night of 29/30 August 2020. Fact: The Government of India in a press note on 31 August 2020, mentioned about a fresh standoff between the Indian and Chinese soldiers on the intervening night of 29/30 August 2020. The videos shared on social media were found to be available at least a few months prior to this incident. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nReverse image search of the screenshots of this video led us to a YouTube channel called \u2018SDP ARMY MAN\u2019 in which the same video was uploaded on 04 January 2020.\n\nFurther reverse image search led us to a news channel report with these visuals dating back to 20 May 2020. The description of the video reads \u2018Tensions escalate at India-China border\u2019. With this, we can conclude that this video is at least months old.\n\nReverse image search of the screenshots of the video led us to a video of a news report about the ceasefire violations at the Line of Control near India-Pakistan border in Jammu & Kashmir. This news video had the same visuals as in the post. This news report dated back to 14 June 2020.\n\nThe same video was uploaded on 15 April 2020 in a Facebook page called \u2018IAF Guard\u2019. With all these, we can conclude that this video is at least months old and not related to the latest standoff between Indian and Chinese army.\n\nReverse image search of the screenshots of the video led us to the same video which is posted on tumblr on 30 January 2020. We did not find any credible source to confirm that the soldiers seen in the video are Indian and that the video is from the Indo-China border.\n\nTo sum it up, in the light of the latest standoff between Indian and Chinese soldiers near LAC, old videos like these are being circulated across social media platforms with misleading claims.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
