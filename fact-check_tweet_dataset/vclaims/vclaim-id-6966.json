Some of the articles included video clips, but most provided an often out of context interpretation of Carson\u2019s remarks. Carson was frequently described as an \u201cexpert\u201d (in quotes), when her social media accounts use the word \u201ceducator.\u201d Overall, most takes suggested that her advice was parents necessarily obtain consent to change a diaper:\n\nThe following is a case study on how to tell if someone doesn\u2019t have kids. Or basic reasoning skills beyond \u201cDon\u2019t touch hot things. Burn. Ouchy. Fire!\u201d You say things like \u201cyou need to ask the baby\u2019s consent first.\u201d Baby here is not a two syllable word-filler for a pop song. But the human offspring which is expert only in pooping itself. Sexuality educator, speaker, and author Deanne Carson thinks you should ask a baby for consent prior to changing its diaper. Congratulations, 2018. You\u2019ve outdone yourself yet again \u2026 Right off the bat, consent is for sex. Just ask Eric Schneiderman. Or the people sexing up fish. Sex is the implication when people say we need to teach kids about consent. Especially if you call yourself a \u201csexuality expert.\u201d\n\nAs typically presented, the statements seemed bizarre, as most diaper-wearing infants are nonverbal and thus likely unable to comprehend the question. However, watching the brief segment in its original context paints a slightly different picture:\n\nYes, just about how to set up a culture of consent in their homes so \u201cI\u2019m going to change your nappy now, is that OK?\u201d Of course a baby is not going to respond \u201cyes, mum, that\u2019s awesome, I\u2019d love to have my nappy changed.\u201d But if you leave a space and wait for body language and wait to make eye contact then you\u2019re letting that child know that their response matters.\n\nWhen an off-screen interviewer asks about lessons about consent and bodily autonomy \u201cfrom birth,\u201d Carson responds:\n\nAlthough that detail may seem pedantic, misinterpretations of those remarks were likewise obtuse. Watching the full clip clearly shows that Carson herself did not believe that the proposed interaction involved meaningful consent from an infant to change their diaper, nor was she suggesting babies who did not consent be allowed to sit in dirty diapers indefinitely. What Carson proposed was teaching a child that \u201ctheir response matters,\u201d not allowing children to remain soiled because they refused to consent to a diaper change.", "lang": "en"}
