He knew that was the year. Let him be out before it implodes.\u201d\n\n \u2014 March 15 \u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophic situation, and there\u2019s nothing to compare anything to because Obamacare won\u2019t be around for a year or two. It\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\n \u2014 March 15 \u201cThey also want people to know that Obamacare is dead; it\u2019s a dead health-care plan. It\u2019s not even a health-care plan, frankly.\u201d\n\n \u2014 March 17 \u201cI have to tell you that Obamacare is a disaster. It\u2019s failing. \u2026 Obamacare will fail. It will fold. It will close up very, very soon if something isn\u2019t done.\u201d\n\n \u2014 March 17\n\nThere are some provisions that kicked in after the first few years of the law but none specifically designed to take effect or phase out in 2017 to the detriment of Obamacare. The Cadillac tax on high-cost employer-sponsored group health plans was scheduled to take effect in 2018 but has been pushed to 2020 (and would be pushed to a later date under the GOP replacement bill). A two-year moratorium on the medical-device excise tax, which imposes an effective tax rate of 1.5 percent on some medical-device manufacturers, is set to expire at the end of 2017 (and would be repealed under the GOP bill).\n\n\u201cI was in Tennessee \u2014 I was just telling the folks \u2014 and half of the state has no insurance company, and the other half is going to lose the insurance company.\u201d\n\n \u2014 March 17 \u201cI was in Tennessee \u2014 we had a tremendous crowd the other night, and they have \u2014 half of the state is uncovered. The insurance companies have left, and the other half has one insurance company, and that will probably be bailing out pretty soon also. They\u2019ll have nobody.\u201d\n\n \u2014 March 17\n\nDayton added that \u201cthe Affordable Care Act has many good features to it, it\u2019s achieved great success in terms of insuring more people \u2014 20 million people across the country \u2014 and providing access for people who have preexisting conditions and the like. But it\u2019s got some serious blemishes and serious deficiencies. And we\u2019re going to need both state and federal governments to step in and do what they need to do to remedy these problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people that are getting killed in this deal are small business people and individuals who make just a little too much to get any of these subsidies. Why? Because they\u2019re not organized, they don\u2019t have any bargaining power with insurance companies, and they\u2019re getting whacked,\u201d Clinton said while campaigning in Flint, Mich. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got this crazy system where all of a sudden, 25 million more people have health care and then the people that are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It\u2019s the craziest thing in the world.\u201d\n\nRecent data from the Association of American Medical Colleges shows physicians are actually retiring two years later, said Atul Grover, the group\u2019s executive vice president. Grover said the group has not seen a significant number of physicians leaving the industry because of the law: \u201cThere is also no evidence of a declining interest in medicine since the ACA took effect. Applications to medical school are at an all-time high. The real challenge the physician workforce faces is the cap on federal support for graduate medical education established by Congress 20 years ago. As a result, there are not enough residency positions to fill demand.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
