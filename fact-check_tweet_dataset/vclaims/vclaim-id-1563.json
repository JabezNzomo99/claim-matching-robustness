In a speech on Aug. 31, for example, he said: \u201cAccording to a report for the Boston Globe, from the year 2008 to 2014 nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not, under any circumstances, take them back.\u201d Trump then added, \u201cThese 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton\u2019s watch.\u201d\n\nAs we wrote at that time, the Globe wrote that ICE, not the State Department, \u201cfreed 12,941 criminals nationwide from 2008 to early 2014\u201d to comply with a 2001 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. The court ruled that, if another country refuses to accept them, the U.S. cannot hold convicted criminals (who have served their sentences) in detention without justification for longer than six months if their removal from the U.S. is not \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d\n\nAs we also pointed out, Clinton was not even secretary of state during the entire time that ICE released those nearly 13,000 criminal aliens. She was secretary of state from January 2009 to February 2013.\n\nThis time \u2014 at an Oct. 10 rally in Ambridge, Pennsylvania \u2014 Trump went even further in claiming that a Haitian man convicted of killing 25-year-old Casey Chadwick of Connecticut in 2015 was \u201cset free by Clinton\u2019s watch.\u201d\n\nChadwick, 25, of Norwich, Connecticut, was tragically killed June 15, 2015. Jacques, a Haitian immigrant, was convicted of her murder on April 11.\n\nAccording to a timeline in the IG report, Jacques fled Haiti after his father died in 1992, and he was picked up at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard. \u201cAt the time of his arrival to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Jacques did not possess any documents on his person identifying him as a Haitian citizen,\u201d the IG report said.\n\nIn 1997, Jacques was convicted of attempted murder in Connecticut, and he served 15 years in prison. After Jacques served his sentence, ICE took custody of him on April 18, 2012, and tried to deport him. But the Haiti government refused to accept him, \u201cbecause he did not possess sufficient documentation to prove his Haitian citizenship,\u201d the IG report said.\n\nICE ordered Jacques\u2019 release on Oct. 19, 2012, \u201cconsistent with ICE policy following the Supreme Court ruling\u201d in 2001, the IG report said.\n\nThe IG report noted that ICE could have sought the State Department\u2019s help in seeking a diplomatic resolution to Haiti\u2019s refusal to accept Jacques. But it did not do so.\n\nIG report, June 16: According to the [Enforcement and Removal Operations] Law Division, only the Department of State has the tools necessary to leverage a foreign country into accepting a deportee. Pursuant to Chapter 16.2(b) of the DROPPM, \u201cwhen a foreign country refuses to accept, or unduly delays acceptance, of its nationals found to be deportable from the United States,\u201d ICE may notify the State Department, which in turn \u201cmay suspend immigrant and nonimmigrant visa issuances\u201d for the country. These reports to the State Department should \u201c[i]nclude the date and time of every attempt to obtain a travel documents, the names of consular officials involved, names of aliens affected, and other relevant details.\u201d Following Haiti\u2019s several denials, Jacques\u2019 name was never reported to the State Department.\n\nAccording to the IG report, ICE officials \u201cbelieved that the State Department\u2019s involvement was typically limited to aliens engaged in terrorism or human rights violations.\u201d The IG report said its staff did not interview State Department officials about the Jacques case, and it had no reason to doubt ICE\u2019s past experience with the State Department. But it still faulted ICE for failing to attempt to seek the State Department\u2019s help.\n\nThe IG report also was critical of ICE for failing to contact Jacques\u2019 family members in the United States in an attempt to get the documents the agency needed to have Jacques deported. It also noted that a Haitian government official advised ICE to contact the Haitian consulate in Miami to request a travel document, but there is no record of such a request.\n\nThe IG reported added, however, that \u201cwe cannot conclude that those steps would have resulted in Jacques\u2019 removal from the United States.\u201d\n\nStill, Chadwick\u2019s mother, Wendy Hartling, told the Washington Times that ICE should have done more. \u201cI put the blame on ICE. That\u2019s their job,\u201d Hartling told the paper. \u201cTheir job is to deport criminal aliens.\u201d\n\nSome members of Congress have called on the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department to work together to pressure \u201crecalcitrant countries\u201d to accept criminal aliens.\n\nFor example, Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley wrote a letter in June to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in which the senator expressed surprise \u201cthat you have never recommended using 243(d) sanctions\u201d of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Under that provision, the secretary of state upon notice from the attorney general \u201cshall order consular officers in that foreign country discontinue granting immigrant visas or nonimmigrant visas, or both, to citizens, subjects, nationals, and residents of that country until the Attorney General notifies the Secretary [of State] that the country has accepted the alien.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. has not imposed such sanctions, which are to be made after consultation between the secretaries of homeland security and state, on any nation since Guyana in 2001, Grassley\u2019s letter said.\n\nMichele Thoren Bond, assistant secretary for consular affairs at the State Department, testified in July that the two departments have been working under a \u201cMemorandum of Understanding Concerning Repatriation\u201d since 2011 that addresses \u201crecalcitrant countries.\u201d The MOU, which was in place when Clinton was secretary, provides certain options, including \u201cdiplomatic intervention overseas and high-level engagement in Washington, practical measures designed to address resource and capacity limitations, and halting the issuance of visas.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Jacques, however, no attempt was made by ICE to get the State Department involved, so Trump\u2019s claim that Jacques was \u201cset free by Clinton\u2019s watch\u201d distorts the facts of the case.", "lang": "en"}
