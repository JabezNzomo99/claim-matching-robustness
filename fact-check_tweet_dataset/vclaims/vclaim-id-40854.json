No, there is no medical evidence to substantiate the claim. The eardrum is watertight, and neither peroxide nor other liquids can penetrate unless it is punctured.\n\nThe claim surfaced in a video on YouTube on April 15, 2020, titled \"Just a Few Drops...Boost Immune System to Fight Viruses with South Florida chiropractor Alan Mandell, DC\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nAt 01:10 in the video, chiropractor Mandell says, \"Back in the 1930s, German researchers were using hydrogen peroxide in the ear, putting it into the ear canal against the eardrum (tympanic membrane), and their theory is it's diffusing through the eardrum into the bloodstream which is ridding off [sic] and fighting the common cold, viruses, the flu. Over the years, because of what we call mainstream medicine, this has been ignored. But today, I can tell you that thousands of people are getting miraculous results.\"\n\nHe does not provide any specifics of those results in the video.\n\nDr. Mark Prince, an Ann Arbor, Michigan, ear, nose and throat specialist, debunks Mandell's claim. He told Lead Stories:\n\nMandell also advises using hydrogen peroxide frequently to dissolve deep ear wax. But hydrogen peroxide can be harmful to cartilage and skin, and WebMd warns to not use it to clean wax in the ears:\n\nMandell claims that a sizzling or swishing sound in the ear is proof that the hydrogen peroxide is making its way against or through the eardrum. \"You'll feel a sizzling. You'll hear that sizzling. That's the hydrogen peroxide working through against the eardrum.\" At 2:37 in the video, he states that hydrogen peroxide in both ears \"can do magic for you.\"\n\nBut other medical sources say that sizzling sound is not hydrogen peroxide pushing its way through the eardrum. It also can be heard when applied to a cut in the skin or mouth. According to WebMd, hydrogen peroxide works by releasing oxygen when it is applied to the affected area. The release of oxygen causes foaming, which helps to remove mucus and clean the area.\n\nLive Science states that the white fizzing foam of HP is actually a sign that that the solution is killing healthy cells, as well as bacteria. Putting drops of hydrogen peroxide into the ear canal can be harmful, Live Science explains. Hydrogen peroxide's oxidation also destroys healthy skin cells. This is why many physicians and dermatologists currently advise against using hydrogen peroxide to clean wounds, as it has been found to slow the healing process and possibly worsen scarring by killing the healthy cells surrounding a cut.\n\nThe American Society for Microbiology reinforces hydrogen peroxide's value as a general antiseptic. The article in the January 1999 issue of Clinical Microbial Review notes that the product comes in strengths from 3% to 90% and works well as a cleaner to kill molds, bacteria and some viruses on household surfaces.", "lang": "en"}
