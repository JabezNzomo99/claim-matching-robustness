Like its predecessor, the sequel makes misleading and false claims about a variety of topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHere are three checks on the video\u2019s claims.\n\nClaim 1: \u201cI feel quite convinced that this was a laboratory-designed organism,\u201d said Dr. Meryl Nass, an internal medicine specialist.\n\nWhile the exact origins of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, remain unknown, there is a scientific consensus that it came from nature. More than two dozen public health researchers in February published a statement in the journal The Lancet \u201cstrongly condemning\u201d the theory the virus \u201cdoes not have a natural origin.\u201d\n\nIn March, the journal Nature published an article by public health researchers that found, based on the new coronavirus\u2019 genome, there is no indication it was a \u201claboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.\u201d The Office of the Director of National Intelligence also issued a statement in April saying that the U.S. intelligence community \u201cconcurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified.\u201d\n\nAs Check Your Fact has previously reported, SARS-CoV-2 comes from the same family of betacoronaviruses as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome, both of which have origins in bats. Researchers suggest the new coronavirus may also have originated in bats and transferred to humans through an intermediary species, according to Nature.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely nothing in the genome sequence of this virus that indicates the virus was engineered,\u201d Richard Ebright, a professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, told the Washington Post.\n\nClaim 2: \u201cOn April the 25th, 2003, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention filed a patent on the coronavirus transmitted to humans. Under 35 U.S.C. 101, nature is prohibited from being patented. Either SARS coronavirus was manufactured, therefore making a patent on it legal, or it was natural, therefore making the patent illegal,\u201d said David Martin, founding CEO of M\u2219CAM Inc.\n\nSARS was first reported in Asia in 2003, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The virus is believed to have spread from bats to civet cats to humans, according to Nature.\n\nPer the Wall Street Journal, the CDC applied for a patent covering both the coronavirus that causes SARS and its genome in 2003. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as researchers in Canada and Hong Kong, also filed SARS-related patent applications, NBC News reported. The CDC was granted its patent in 2007 but, contrary to what Martin suggests, the CDC holding the patent isn\u2019t evidence SARS is \u201cmanufactured.\u201d\n\nWhile patents on genetic material have been granted in the past, current law no longer allows DNA in its natural form to be patented, according to the National Human Genome Research Institute. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2013 held that a \u201cnaturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated.\u201d The CDC applied and received its SARS-related patent prior to that ruling.\n\nDr. Julie Gerberding, the then-CDC director, said in a 2003 media briefing that the public health organization pursued the patent to \u201cget information about SARS and the SARS genome and the SARS coronavirus into the public domain as quickly as we possibly can.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe concern that the federal government is looking at right now is that we could be locked out of this opportunity to work with this virus if it\u2019s patented by someone else,\u201d Gerberding said. \u201cBy initiating steps to secure patent rights, we assure that we will be able to continue to make the virus and the products from the virus available in the public domain, and that we can continue to promote the rapid technological transfer of this biomedical information into tools and products that are useful to patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe CDC does hold some patents on life forms, but it generally does this for the common good, so a commercial company can\u2019t come along and patent it,\u201d David Sanders, an associate professor of biological sciences at Purdue University, told Newsmax Health in 2014 regarding an Ebola virus strain patent held by the CDC. \u201cThe CDC lets researchers work with the strain without fees.\u201d\n\nClaim 3: \u201cThe Parliament of India created a task force and they studied it and they kicked out the Gates Foundation,\u201d said Mary Holland, the general counsel for the Children\u2019s Health Defense.\n\nThe Indian Parliament investigated a 2010 human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine study conducted by the U.S. nonprofit Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH), according to Science Magazine. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded the study.\n\nAfter local media outlets reported the deaths of seven girls taking part in the trial, the study was canceled. Five of the deaths were unrelated to the vaccine, while the other two were less certain, though government investigators concluded the links between their deaths and the vaccine were \u201cunlikely,\u201d Science Magazine reported.\n\nThe Indian Parliament\u2019s Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare in 2013 found that the vaccine trial had committed a \u201cgross violation of consent and legal requirement of consent,\u201d according to the committee\u2019s report. After the report came out, PATH issued a statement saying they \u201cdisagree with the findings, conclusions, and tone of the released report and its disregard of the evidence and facts.\u201d\n\nThe Indian government in 2017 refuted reports that work with the Gates Foundation in the country had ceased as \u201cinaccurate and misleading,\u201d adding that the foundation \u201ccontinues to collaborate and support the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.\u201d At the time of publication, both the Gates Foundation and PATH continue to work in India.", "lang": "en"}
