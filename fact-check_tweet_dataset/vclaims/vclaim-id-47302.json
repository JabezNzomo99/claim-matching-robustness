This attack did not occur on January 3, 2020, as claimed in the fake story below. Iran said the attack was in retaliation for the killing by the U.S. of Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, a top Revolutionary Guards commander.\n\nUPDATE 2: It was reported on January 17, 2020, that 11 U.S. troops were indeed injured in the January 7 attacks.\n\nDid Iranian ballistic missiles hit the largest U.S. military base in Iraq? No, that's not true: there was no strike on the U.S. and Iraqi airbase recently, and the images show the aftermath of explosions in different nations in past years. The supposed attack on January 3, 2020, never happened.\n\nThe tweets come less than a day after President Trump ordered the assassination of Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Quds Force. Iran vowed \"forceful revenge\" in retaliation for the airstrike.\n\nThe account originated on the Iranian news Mizan, citing Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps chats on the encrypted messaging apps Telegram, according to tweets from Sina Toossi, an analyst from the National Iranian American Council.\n\nUsers on social media saw the following: Breaking: \n\nUnconfirmed reports of ballistic missiles hitting largest US military base Ain Al-Assad in #Iraq & massive explosions. pic.twitter.com/O6WjWNzvRZ -- Syed Shahbaz (@SayedShahbaz3) January 3, 2020 Five rockets did land on the base in early December 2019, according to an Iraqi military statement reported by Reuters. But there is no evidence that they were \"ballistic missiles,\" as is stated in the tweet, and there were no casualties as a result of the December incident.\n\nIn the first of a series of tweets posted at 1:17 p.m. Friday, January 3, 2020, Toossi erroneously claimed that the account began in the outlet Mehr:\n\nLater he corrected himself, tweeting:\n\nAt 1:32 p.m., the same information was tweeted by New York Times war correspondent Farnaz Fassihi:\n\nBut at 2:10 p.m., Fassihi said the reports of the attack were false:\n\nWashington Post Baghdad Bureau reporter Mustafa Salim also said the report was false i :\n\nAll three images in the collage are inaccurate. The first image in the collage was posted on the website of the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran, a political-militant organization based on Islamic and Marxist ideology which advocates for the overthrow of the Iranian leadership. It shows a 2015 attack on Camp Liberty, also known as Camp Hurriya, which housed members of the organization on the outskirts of Baghdad.\n\n\"The United States strongly condemns today's brutal, senseless terrorist attack on Camp Hurriya that killed and injured camp residents,\" Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement at the time.\n\nThe second and third images in the collage are cropped versions of images showing airstrikes attributed to Israel in Syria, not an Iranian airstrike on a U.S. airbase in Iraq.\n\nIt was accompanied by this tweet:\n\nWe wrote about twitter.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Video: Biden Did NOT Proclaim the 'European' Identity of America\n\u2022 Fake News: Nancy Pelosi Did NOT Say 'We Have Been Working On Impeachment For The Past 2 1/2 Years'\n\u2022 Fake News: Eagle Did NOT Land On Native American At College Football Game\n\u2022 Fake News: Trump Did NOT Play Golf During U.S. Embassy Siege In Baghdad\n\u2022 Fake News: Republican IS Offered As A Choice In California's 2020 Presidential Primary, But Only For Republicans", "lang": "en"}
