{"title": "MISLEADING: Iranian child's IQ 'beats both Hawking and Einstein'", "subtitle": "There is no evidence that Einstein took an IQ test, and if Hawking did, he did not publicize his results", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Jul 4, 2019 6:28 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-41414", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/iranian-child-iq-beats-hawking-einstein", "vclaim": "In the post, Sharifi's photo was placed beside Einstein's. The text above their images read: \"Iranian child genius IQ results beat both Hawking and Einstein.\" Between their photos is the logo of Mensa, an international organization made up of people whose IQ is in the top 2% of the population.\n\nAside from the claim about Sharifi, the photo's caption also claims that the US has killed more than 20 million civilians in 37 wars, coups, and invasions \"in the past decades,\" and spent $14 trillion on these wars. The United Nations (UN), the post said, estimates that ending world hunger annually would cost $30 billion.\n\nThe facts: Mensa confirmed to Rappler that Sharifi indeed scored a 162 in her Cattell III B test administered as part of a Mensa-supervised test. They also clarified that there is no evidence that Einstein took an IQ test, and if Hawking did, he never publicized his results. It is, therefore, impossible to compare Sharifi's score with that of Einstein's or Hawking's.\n\nMensa accepts individuals who score in the top 2% of the population, which is 148 for the Cattell III B, according to their website. \"The score of 162 is the highest a child can achieve on this test, and means Tara is in the top 1% of the population,\" Mensa said.\n\nThey further explained that the alleged IQs of Einstein and Hawking were estimated long ago by an unknown person based on their achievements. These estimates are inaccurate because it isn't known which test they were estimated against and different tests have different measurement scales.\n\nFor example, Mensa UK also offers the test Cattell Culture Fair III A, which has a top 2% score of 132 \u2013 this represents the same cognitive ability as a score of 148 on the Cattell III B.\n\nAccording to Politifact, the claim appears true on the surface but lacks substance: \"We found no advocacy group or expert who expressed confidence in the estimates of the total number of people who suffer from hunger or in any estimate of what it would cost to end it.\" \u2013 Vernise L Tantuco/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
