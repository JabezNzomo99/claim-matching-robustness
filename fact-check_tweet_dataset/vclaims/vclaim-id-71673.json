Have border communities in Texas seen a 25% reduction in crime since 2014?\n\nTexas DPS spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger provided an image with statistics about crime across the state and in five counties along the Texas-Mexico border.\n\nThe image cited the Crime in Texas Online Portal, a public-facing database that shows data about crime reported to the state agency from local law enforcement divisions across the state. The same information is collected through the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting Program, which McCraw cited in his testimony.\n\nThis data includes violent crime like murder and rape, as well as property crime like arson or burglary.\n\nA quick note about these figures: The FBI stresses that data published through this program should not be used to rank different locations or to evaluate the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies on crime, because \"there are many factors that cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place.\"\n\nThe data provided by Cesinger highlighted the five southernmost Texas counties that border Mexico, just one section of the state\u2019s roughly 1,300-mile border with Mexico.\n\nCesinger did not return a request for comment seeking more information about why McCraw zeroed in on these counties when making his claim.\n\nThere are 14 counties in Texas that border Mexico, including the five cited by DPS: Cameron, Hidalgo, Starr, Webb and Zapata counties.\n\nBrewster, El Paso, Hudspeth, Jeff Davis, Kinney, Maverick, Presidio, Terrell and Val Verde counties also sit along the Texas-Mexico border.\n\nAnother wrinkle here: DPS has historically defined the border in terms of its statewide regional divisions. Two of the six regions include the 14 counties along the border, so the agency often considers both regions part of the border \u2014 all 64 counties.\n\nThis definition of the border is the broadest. Some counties included are as far as 200 miles from the border. DPS has counted crime statistics from the entire region in fact-sheets on border security activity and in testimony before state lawmakers in the past.\n\nMcCraw referred to \"the border\" when making his claim. It turns out, according to Cesinger, he was referring to just five counties. We decided to check his claim against three geographic areas: the five southernmost border counties, the 14 counties along the Texas-Mexico border and the 64 counties in DPS\u2019s border region.\n\nWhat do the numbers say?\n\nWe looked at the same crime figures as DPS to assess this claim, but we also zeroed in on violent crime data, which are commonly used to assess the safety of a particular area. Violent crime figures, which include assault, rape, murder and robbery, are included in the count of overall crime.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, the state of Texas as a whole saw a 12.2% reduction in total crime, from about 3,379.7 offenses per 100,000 total population to 2,787.9 offenses. At the same time, violent crime increased by 9.9%.\n\nAll three border regions we considered also saw a reduction of total crime and violent crime during this time period.\n\u2022 -The five southernmost counties saw a 25.8% reduction in total crime and a 6.2% reduction in violent crime.\n\u2022 -The 14 counties along the entire border saw a 26% reduction in total crime and a 5.8% reduction in violent crime.\n\u2022 -The 64 counties in DPS\u2019s border region saw a 22.8% reduction in total crime and a 1.5% reduction in violent crime.\n\nMcCraw said that between 2014 and 2018, there has been a 25% reduction in crime in communities on the Texas-Mexico border.\n\nWe looked at three different definitions of the border to test McCraw\u2019s claim. Crime in all three areas declined by about 25% during this time period.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.", "lang": "en"}
