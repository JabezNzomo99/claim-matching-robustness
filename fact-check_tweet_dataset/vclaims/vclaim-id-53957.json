It has been shared more than 360 times.\n\nThe text in the image states: \u201cAustralian EMERGENCY Notice; If you feel unwell, have a fever or sore throat. PLEASE do not go to the medical centre/family clinic or the hospital, please contact the communicable disease control branch directly. There will be a doctor who will visit your place of residence and do a check up on you, it will be free of charge. Do the right thing! #staythefuckathome\".\n\nThe post then lists the phone numbers for nationwide Communicable Disease Branches, which are units under state health departments tasked with promoting immunisation, surveilling diseases and controlling outbreaks.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe purported notice circulated online as nations worldwide took unprecedented steps aimed at curbing the novel coronavirus, which has so far killed more than 14,000 people and infected over 330,000 globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nAustralia, which has 1,823 confirmed cases as of March 24, 2020, announced a nationwide lockdown to mitigate transmissions.\n\nThe purported notice was also shared on Facebook here, here, here and here; as well as on Twitter here, here, here and here with a similar claim.\n\nThe Ministry of Health in New South Wales, Australia\u2019s most populous state, wrote on Twitter on March 17, 2020 that it did not issue the notice.\n\n\u201c@NSWHealth is aware of a text message advising people to contact their local communicable disease control branch directly for a \u2018free doctor visit\u2019. This text message did not originate from NSW Health,\u201d the agency wrote in a Twitter thread. \u201cOur Public Health Units are now being inundated with unnecessary phone calls by concerned people who have received this text message.\u201d\n\nHealthdirect Australia, a government-run health services organisation, did recommend that patients seeking medical assistance after suffering coronavirus symptoms should call a clinic or hospital before visiting one. Nowhere, however, does the organisation say the government will provide free home visits.\n\nA keyword search of the Department of Health main website also resulted in no mentions of free doctor visits.", "lang": "en"}
