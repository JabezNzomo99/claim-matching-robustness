In 2015, we were second behind the USA. Germany and the UK are both leading the table in 2016.\n\nThe latest data from the International Monetary Fund has the UK growing at essentially the same rate as Germany, 1.8%.\n\nEconomic growth figures are frequently revised, sometimes even years after their first publication. So at the moment it seems that the UK and Germany basically tied in 2016, but the next set of data might give a clearer lead to one or the other.\n\nThe UK\u2019s GDP growth rate has slowed from 3.1% in 2014 to 1.8% in 2016.\n\nThe IMF\u2019s latest forecast is for UK growth to be 2% in 2017, behind the USA\u2019s 2.3%. However, it expects UK growth to slow to 1.5% in 2018, below several of the G7.", "lang": "en"}
