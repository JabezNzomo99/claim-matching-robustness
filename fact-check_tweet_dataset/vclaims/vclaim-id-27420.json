It refers to the situation in 2030, rather than immediately after Brexit.\n\nIt\u2019s not right to say this will cost every Scottish person \u00a31,600\n\nThe \u00a31,600 claim is based on Scottish government analysis from January 2018, which it repeated at the end of October 2019.\n\nThe original analysis compares estimates of Scotland\u2019s GDP (which is the total value of everything that happens in its economy) in 2030 in several different scenarios.\n\nOne scenario estimated that under a free trade agreement post-Brexit, where the UK is outside of the EU\u2019s single market and customs union, Scotland\u2019s GDP would be 6% lower in 2030 than it would have been had the UK stayed in the EU.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said about similar claims before, that doesn\u2019t mean the economy shrinks by 6% (or that people in Scotland lose \u00a31,600 in cash). It means that, according to these estimates, it\u2019s expected to grow by 6% less than it otherwise would have.\n\nGDP growing by 6% less up to 2030 is the equivalent of about \u00a31,600 per person if you divide that amount of GDP by the population of Scotland.\n\nBut you cannot say that slower GDP growth will cost every person \u00a31,600.\n\nIndividual incomes are affected by a number of factors including the cost of living and government welfare spending. So slower GDP growth on its own will not automatically mean less in people\u2019s pockets. Additionally, even if incomes did grow less slowly, they would be unlikely to hit everyone equally.\n\nIn any case, the 6% figure isn\u2019t definitive. It\u2019s a relatively old estimate that relies on a lot of assumptions.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written before, the UK and EU haven\u2019t negotiated a free trade agreement yet so we don\u2019t know what Boris Johnson\u2019s trade deal would look like. However, the Scottish government\u2019s analysis is based model of a \u201cfree trade deal\u201d which shares broad similarities with what Boris Johnson wants to negotiate.\n\nWe\u2019ve written before on what you need to know when interpreting claims from economic models.", "lang": "en"}
