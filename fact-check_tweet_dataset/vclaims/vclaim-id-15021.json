From a Facebook page Akhilesh Yadav-The Lion, the video was shared over 8,000 times and had over 1.6 lakh views at the time of writing this report (archive).\n\nFrom another Facebook page Viral Story Insight, the video attracted 78,000 views and over 4,000 shares (archive).\n\nThe footage viral on social media does not represent a recent event. It dates back to 2017 when BJP West Bengal President Dilip Ghosh was chased and heckled in Darjeeling. The incident was reported across media platforms, including ABP News that ran the same clip which is currently viral. A BJP delegation led by the party President was visiting the city after a 104-day strike for a separate Gorkhaland state was withdrawn by GJM. Ghosh was in Darjeeling on October 5, 2017, when he was allegedly thrashed by supporters of GTA chairman Binay Tamang. The video viral on social media, thus, has nothing to do with the coming elections but represents a two-year-old unrelated event.", "lang": "en"}
