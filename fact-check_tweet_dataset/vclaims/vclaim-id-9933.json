Robert Pittenger faces a challenge from Rev. Mark Harris, who lost the 2016 primary against Pittenger by only 134 votes. The duo has traded barbs over Pittenger\u2019s voting record, whether Harris worked to stop Donald Trump from becoming president and now over the omnibus bill that Congress passed and Trump signed in March.\n\nHarris thinks Pittenger should\u2019ve opposed the bill since it didn\u2019t fully fund a border wall, among other reasons. Pittenger, meanwhile, has touted its benefits.\n\nOne of the bill\u2019s positives, Pittenger said in a recent newsletter, is that the bill \"does not designate a single dollar for Planned Parenthood.\"\n\nWhen asked about the newsletter, Pittenger\u2019s staff pointed to a breakdown of the omnibus bill that was circulated by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, chair of the House Republican Conference.\n\nHer summary of the bill, emailed to House Republicans, says \"there has never been a line item for Planned Parenthood in the Labor, HHS, Education appropriations bill.\"\n\nThe Pittenger campaign also pointed out a congratulatory letter he received from the National Right to Life organization \u2013 which the campaign included in its statement about Planned Parenthood funding. National Right to Life is an anti-abortion group that has endorsed Pittenger and gives him a 100 percent \"pro-life\" voting record.\n\nThe group\u2019s letter supports Pittenger\u2019s claim that the bill doesn\u2019t include any \"line item\" money specifically for Planned Parenthood. But, the NRL letter notes that Planned Parenthood affiliates \"are able to tap into funds from the various long-standing health programs.\"\n\n\"The greatest amount of federal money to Planned Parenthood flows through so-called \u2018mandatory spending programs,\u2019 mostly Medicaid,\" the letter says.\n\nIndeed, recent estimates show that the organization about 40 percent of its funding from the government. Planned Parenthood receives more than $500 million in combined state and federal government funds.\n\nIf a Medicaid patient comes to Planned Parenthood, the organization can bill the organization for services the patient chooses.\n\nAnother portion can come through the government\u2019s Title X Family program, which subsidizes birth control and tests for sexually-transmitted diseases. But Congress and President Donald Trump last year passed a law that allows states to withhold that funding for groups like Planned Parenthood. Pittenger voted for that law.\n\nLawrence Shaheen, a spokesman for the Pittenger campaign, argued that the newsletter isn\u2019t deceptive because it included the National Right to Life letter explaining that Planned Parenthood still receives funding through other means.\n\nSome tried to cut all funds\n\nSo the omnibus bill doesn\u2019t end funding for Planned Parenthood, even if the health organization isn\u2019t specifically mentioned as a funding recipient. But it wasn\u2019t for a lack of trying by some Republicans in Congress.\n\nSome House Republicans \u2013 including several from the House Freedom Caucus \u2013 tied their support for the spending bill to cutting federal funding to Planned Parenthood, according to Politico. However, the effort died largely because the bill wouldn\u2019t garner enough support in the Senate to pass, according to Vox.\n\nPlanned Parenthood's continued eligibility for federal funding prompted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to tout the bill as a victory for Democrats.\n\n\"We don\u2019t have the House. We don\u2019t have the Senate. We don\u2019t have the presidency,\" Schumer said, \"but we produced a darn good bill for the priorities that we have believed in.\"\n\nWhile the omnibus bill gives no new funding to Planned Parenthood and doesn\u2019t designate money for the organization by name, it does allow Planned Parenthood to continue receiving money from the federal government.\n\nPittenger said the spending bill \"does not designate a single dollar for Planned Parenthood.\" Technically, in the very literal sense of the word \"designate,\" Pittenger is right. The bill doesn\u2019t specifically direct funding to Planned Parenthood by name.\n\nBut the federal government continues to pay for Planned Parenthood\u2019s services through Medicaid and other programs. And since voters are more likely to care about whether their tax dollars go to an organization \u2013 not whether the organization is specifically named in legislation \u2013 we rate Pittenger's claim Half True.", "lang": "en"}
