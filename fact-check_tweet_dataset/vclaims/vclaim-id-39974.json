Unlike the previous debates, which took place over two evenings, only one night was needed to feature all who qualified for the showdown. Here is how the candidates\u2019 remarks stacked up against the truth. [And here are highlights from the debate.] Juli\u00e1n Castro said Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s health plan would not cover enough of the nation\u2019s uninsured population and would not automatically enroll people who were eligible. \u201cI also worked for President Obama, Vice President Biden, and I know that the problem with your plan is that it leaves 10 million people uncovered.\u201d Later, he added, \u201cThe difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in, and I would not require them to opt in \u2014 they would automatically be enrolled.\u201d\n\nThis is mostly true. Mr. Biden is not backing the Medicare for All Act being promoted by Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, which would replace all private insurance coverage with a government-run plan. Mr. Biden wants to expand Obamacare by offering a public option. He says his plan would cover 97 percent of Americans \u2014 a figure that Mr. Castro appeared to seize on to justify his statement that the Biden plan would leave 10 million people uncovered. Among them would be undocumented immigrants who would not qualify for the federal subsidies that could help make coverage affordable. Most people would have to enroll themselves in the public option under Mr. Biden\u2019s plan \u2014 leaving the possibility that some would fall through the cracks \u2014 but it would automatically enroll millions of low-income people in states that have rejected the option of expanding Medicaid under Obamacare. Mr. Biden sought to distance President Barack Obama\u2019s immigration policies from President Trump\u2019s by saying the Obama administration didn\u2019t lock migrants in cages. \u201cWhat Latinos should look at, comparing this president to the president we have is outrageous, No. 1, we didn\u2019t lock people up in cages. We didn\u2019t separate families. We didn\u2019t do all of those things, No. 1.\u201d\n\nThis is misleading. The Obama administration built some detention facilities at the border \u2014 the same ones being used by the Trump administration. A federal judge also criticized the conditions and care provided to migrant children during the Obama administration in Border Patrol facilities. But the facilities were never meant for long-term detention of children. This year, dozens of children were held in cramped cells in facilities that were built for single adults. Mr. Biden is right that the Obama administration did not have a policy of separating families at the border. Families at the border were broken up, but it was rare and typically in cases when the relationships of the children and accompanying adults were in doubt. Mr. Trump\u2019s administration announced a \u201czero-tolerance policy\u201d in April 2018 that resulted in nearly 3,000 children being forcibly separated from their parents. Mr. Sanders drew a distinction between his trade policy and that of Mr. Biden, pointing to his opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr. Biden supported. \u201cI helped lead the opposition to NAFTA and P.N.T.R., which cost this country over four million good-paying jobs.\u201d This is mostly true. While NAFTA often receives much of the blame from Democrats for the loss of American manufacturing jobs, it is P.N.T.R. \u2014 Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China \u2014 that economists tend to point to as the cause of more job losses. A 2014 report from the Economic Policy Institute estimated that 851,000 jobs were lost because of the trade deficit with Canada and Mexico. The same group found that the trade deficit in goods with China cost 3.4 million jobs from 2001 to 2017.\n\n\u201cAnd so, I took on the position that allowed me, without asking permission, to create one of the first-in-the-nation initiatives that was a model and became a national model around people who were arrested for drugs and getting them jobs. I created one of the first-in-the-nation requirements that a state law enforcement agency would have to wear cameras and keep them on full time. I created one of the first-in-the-nation trainings for police officers on the issue of racial bias and the need to reform the system.\u201d This is mostly true. As San Francisco\u2019s district attorney, Ms. Harris created the \u201cBack on Track\u201d program in 2005 that gave some young, first-time drug offenders the chance to enroll in a pilot program involving job training, community service and counseling in lieu of jail. As California\u2019s attorney general, Ms. Harris instituted an implicit bias training program in her office. Her record on the use of body-worn cameras is more mixed. In 2015, Ms. Harris put in place a policy requiring law enforcement officers working for her office to wear body cameras. But that same year, she opposed statewide regulations mandating local police officers to do the same and stated she did not believe in a \u201cone-size-fits-all approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got to defend the fact that 500,000 Americans are going bankrupt. You know why they\u2019re going bankrupt? Because they suffered a terrible disease, cancer or heart disease.\u201d This is exaggerated. The number comes from a study based on surveys of people who declared bankruptcy from 2013 to 2016. In that research, the latest in a series of such surveys, more than half of families with bankruptcies said that medical bills or a health crisis contributed to their financial crisis. (Fun fact: Elizabeth Warren was an author on earlier installments.) But that research method has been criticized by many scholars who say that asking people whether health problems caused their bankruptcy is not the best way to answer that question. Another recent study, which followed every Californian who was admitted to a hospital over several years, produced a substantially lower estimate of the number of Americans whose bankruptcies were caused by health problems that involved a hospital stay. But in both studies, it was not just medical bills but the income losses associated with illness that caused financial distress. The 500,000 estimate includes people who cited only health-related income loss as a contributor to their bankruptcies. That is a problem that even universal health insurance would do little to address.", "lang": "en"}
