The book \u2014 which tells the story of a listless, unnamed office worker who helps start an underground fight club \u2014 was adapted for film a few years later, starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nHowever, the expression attributed to \u201cFight Club\u201d in the Facebook post doesn\u2019t appear in the book nor the movie. Searching the novel and screenplay for the quote returned no matches.\n\nThe website Quote Investigator traced the earliest strong match for the statement back to a 1928 newspaper column by American humorist and journalist Robert Quillen, though elements of the quote appeared earlier. In that column, he defined \u201cAmericanism\u201d as \u201cusing money you haven\u2019t earned to buy things you don\u2019t need to impress people you don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nA year later, one Edgar Allan Moss published a variation of the expression under the pseudonym Junius, according to etymologist Barry Popik. Others also employed the statement after it was already in circulation.\n\nThe quote was likely attributed to \u201cFight Club\u201d because it sounded like something that might have been said in the book or movie, according to Quote Investigator. At one point in the book, a character says, \u201cAdvertising has these people chasing cars and clothes they don\u2019t need. Generations have been working in jobs they hate, just so they can buy what they don\u2019t really need.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
