Cyclone Amphan has made landfall in the coastal areas of West Bengal on 20 May 2020 causing severe damage in the coastal areas of West Bengal and Odisha. FACTLY has found that the video in the post is old and not related to the recent cyclone. The video is found to exist on the internet at least since 26 April 2020. FACTLY could not ascertain the exact location of the video. As the video was found to exist at least 3-4 weeks prior to the landfall of cyclone Amphan, the claim is false.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
