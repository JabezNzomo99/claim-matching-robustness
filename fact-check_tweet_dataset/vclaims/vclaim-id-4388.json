The government explained the recommendations in more detail and also tried to quantify the savings from such a move. In addition, the government also mentioned that India is not the first country to undertake such a measure. The FAQs make a mention of Japan & USA as countries that have done this earlier. How true is this claim?\n\nWhat is the actual recommendation made by the government?\n\n Bureau of Energy Efficiency (Ministry of Power) has issued guidelines to major commercial establishments to set the default temperature on Air Conditioners to 24 degree celsius from the conventional 20-21 degree celsius. This move, the government says is to conserve energy and can result in approximately 24% of energy savings. However, users can adjust the temperature as per his/her choice. The government\u2019s guidelines mention that temperatures up to 25 degree celsius are quite comfortable for human body, along with desired humidity and air movement values.\n\nThe government estimates that the potential for energy conservation through this measure is to the tune of 20 billion units (worth Rs10,000 crores) annually. As per government\u2019s calculations, even if half (50%) the consumers adopt the recommendations, this would result in about 10 billion units of electricity, which is equivalent to reduction of 8.2 Million tonne of CO per year.\n\nThese guidelines have been recommended to major commercial establishments such as Airports, Hotels, Shopping Malls, Offices and Government Buildings (Ministries & attached offices, State Government and Public-Sector Undertakings) and are currently voluntary in nature. The government plans to increase awareness and encourage consumers to adopt the guidelines. A public survey would also be conducted after 4-6 months of awareness campaign.\n\nDid other countries also enforce such limits?\n\n The FAQs released by the government make a mention of Japan and the California state in USA as having enforced such limits. Let us examine these claims.\n\nThe case of Japan\n\n Claim: Japan introduced a default setting for air conditioners at 28 degrees Celsius.\n\nJapan, in the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, did impose restrictions on power usage and mandated large buildings & businesses to reduce electricity usage by 15%. Fines were also prescribed for companies that use too much power. But these restrictions were withdrawn in September 2011.\n\nJapan also runs a \u2018Cool Biz\u2019 campaign during summer where it encourages people to dress more casually without a tie and a jacket so that they can work comfortably even in a room at 28 degrees Celsius. Japan started the \u2018Cool Biz\u201d campaign in 2005. Similarly, a \u2018Warm Biz\u2019 campaign is run during winters. Both the campaigns are voluntary in nature.\n\nThe case of USA\n\n Claim: In U.S, states like California have enforced limits on lowering the air condition beyond 26 degrees Celsius.\n\nIn the case of California, a New York Times article in 2008 talks about the state seeking to control thermostats through a radio controlled device, by sending temperatures up or down. This was contemplated to manage electricity shortages. But this move never seems to have been implemented.\n\nInstead, the state of California currently issues \u2018Flex Alerts\u2018. A \u2018Flex Alert\u2019 is a call for consumers to voluntarily conserve electricity when there is a predicted shortage of energy supply, especially if the grid operator needs to dip into reserves to cover demand. These alerts are issued a day in advance so that consumers can better prepare for the event. The campaign asks consumers to set thermostat at 78\u00b0 F ( ~ 26 degree celsius) or higher. Since the year 2000, \u2018Flex Alerts\u2019 have been issued a total of 104 times, with each alert ranging for a few hours to a day.", "lang": "en"}
