Never Give Up!\"\n\nIndia Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the story attached to the viral post is misleading. Coca-Cola was first served in glasses, and not bottles. Also during the first year, the average sale was nine servings per day in Atlanta in the US.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nThe post is quite viral on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nAccording to the website \"World of Coca-Cola\" the beverage was first prepared by an Atlanta pharmacist -- Dr John S Pemberton -- in the year 1886. The first servings of the drink were not sold in bottles but in glasses at the price of five cents per glass. This website is maintained by The Coca-Cola Company.\n\nAs mentioned on the website, \"During its first year, sales averaged a modest nine servings per day in Atlanta. Today, daily servings of Coca-Cola beverages are estimated at 1.9 billion globally.\"\n\nAccording to the website \"World of Coca-Cola\" in 1894, to make the beverage portable, the company started to sell it in bottles. \"In 1894, impressed by the growing demand for Coca-Cola and the desire to make the beverage portable, Joseph Biedenharn installed bottling machinery in the rear of his Mississippi soda fountain, becoming the first to put Coca-Cola in bottles. Large scale bottling was made possible just five years later,\" says Coca-Cola.\n\nIt is clear that Coca-Cola didn't sell just 25 bottles in its first year, in fact, it was initially served in glasses only.", "lang": "en"}
