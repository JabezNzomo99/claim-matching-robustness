Although a document published by the Rockefeller Foundation in May 2010 with a chapter titled \u2018Lockstep\u2019 was found, the chapter does not contain the exact content read by the speaker in the audio.\n\nThe conspiracies surrounding COVID-19 do not seem to be tailing off, as a 14-minute audio purported to be from the President of Ghana, Akufo-Addo, warns Ghanaians to pay attention to an alleged extract from an article titled \u2018Rockefeller Lockstep 2010\u2019 on the Rockefeller website.\n\nIn the audio, the speaker\u2019s main claim is on the Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s detailing of a simulated global outbreak, the required steps involved, the various phases required, the overall timeline and the expected outcomes.\n\nSome of the plans and phases the speaker purports to be from the article include:\n\n1.The creation of morbid viruses such as SARS, MERS and HIV in a laboratory to be stolen and smuggled to Wuhan, China as a pandemic.\n\n2. The Foundation\u2019s plans to fund organisations such as WHO, CDC and the UN\n\n3. The creation and funding of a vaccination development plan, vaccination verification certification protocols, digital IDs to enforce the vaccination program after the mandatory rollout is enacted\n\n5. The establishment of public quarantine to destroy regions\u2019 economy\n\n6. The creation of civil unrest, breakdown of supply chain to cause the start of mass food shortages, as well as weaken immune systems due to lack of interaction.\n\nThe speaker further requested for the audio to be passed around to create awareness so that the document can be pulled down from the Rockefeller website.\n\nThe audio circulating is accompanied by a message which reads:\n\nTHIS VERY IMPORTANT SECRET AUDIOTAPE BY THE PRESIDENT OF GHANA MUST BE CIRCULATED TO THE ENTIRE HUMANITY FOR EXTREME AWARENESS OF THE CORONAVIRUS PLOT\n\nThe speaker in the audio\n\nIt is evident that the voice of the speaker in the audio is not that of President Akufo-Addo. Yet, Dubawa further contacted the spokesperson for the President of Ghana, Eugene Arhin, who could not be reached yet. Additionally, Dubawa has contacted the Ministry of Information and awaiting a response.\n\nPresident Akufo-Addo has made no official announcements in any publication or on any platform concerning such a matter. Rather, he continues to publicly update Ghanaians on measures and efforts by the government to contain the spread of the virus.\n\nDubawa found a 54-page pdf document titled Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development \u2013 a report produced by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Global Business Network, published in May 2010.\n\nThe document focuses on how technology can help in globalisation by using scenario planning to develop strategies to respond to each scenario over a period of years.\n\nOn page 18 of the document, which contains that chapter on the \u2018Lockstep\u2019 as a Scenario Narrative, the document indicates the LockStep to be \u2018a world of tighter top-down government control and authoritarian leadership with limited innovation and growing citizen pushback\u2019.\n\nIt predicts and narrates a global pandemic expected in 2012, which would affect world economies and international mobility of persons. It is also expected to affect industries such as tourism and break global supply chains. Locally, the global pandemic is also expected to affect shops and buildings by keeping them empty of supplies for months. The chapter also predicts how the most pandemic-prepared and developed countries would be overwhelmed, as countries such as America would be unable to contain the spread whereas China would have a quick and effective enforcement of mandatory quarantine for its citizens.\n\nThe global pandemic is also predicted to result in mandatory wearing of face masks, body temperature checks at communal spaces, and states that Ghana\u2019s government would have ambitious programmes to improve basic infrastructure and \u2018ensure the availability of clean water for all her people\u2019 which would lead to \u2018a sharp decline in water-borne diseases\u2019.\n\nIt stipulates that people would grow weary of so much top-down control and letting leaders and authorities make choices for them to the extent that there would be protests. It further predicts that developed countries would have innovations and technology whereas developing countries\u2019 access to technology would remain limited.\n\nIt finalises the import of this narrative and provides timelines for the occurrences from 2010 to 2030.\n\nAlthough the Rockefeller 2010 Lockstep chapter Dubawa accessed contains simulations on a hypothesised global pandemic with indicated timelines with the purpose of using technology to enforce governmental control on citizens, the chapter does not reveal the exact claims made by the speaker in the audio, unless such claims are otherwise contained in another similar document.\n\nIt is, however, certain that the speaker is not the president of Ghana.\n\nThe claim that the president of Ghana has cautioned Ghanaians of a Coronavirus plan by the Rockefeller Foundation is false. President Akufo-Addo has made no official pronouncement or publication of such announcements to Ghanaians.\n\nAlso, even though the Rockefeller Foundation document containing the 2010 Lockstep chapter simulates a global pandemic and predicts its global effects, the content is not the same as the claims the speaker makes in the viral audio.", "lang": "en"}
