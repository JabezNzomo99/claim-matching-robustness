[1]\n\nFederal Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor told ABC News Breakfast the International Energy Agency (IEA) advised him there were \u201cample commercial stocks\u201d of fuel available and there was \u201cno threat to fuel supplies in Australia\u201d. [2]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined Mr Taylor\u2019s statement that Australia has close to 90 days of fuel reserves.\n\nAustralia is a member country of the International Energy Agency (IEA) and a signatory to a 1974 treaty that requires IEA members to hold oil reserves that will cover at least 90 days in the event of a severe oil supply disruption. Australia has not complied with the IEA\u2019s 90-day reserve requirement since 2012. [3]\n\nThe IEA is the global energy authority which provides information on the energy sector and advocates policies to \u201cenhance the reliability, affordability and sustainability of energy in its 30 member countries\u201d. [4]\n\nAccording to the IEA, Australia had a total of 58 days of oil stock reserves as of June 2019, the lowest among the 30 member countries. [5]\n\nWhen questioned about the statement that Australia has close to 90 days\u2019 supply, Mr Taylor\u2019s office referred AAP FactCheck to the Department of Environment and Energy\u2019s monthly petroleum statistics report. The report calculates petroleum stocks in different ways, including the IEA standard of \u201cnet import coverage\u201d, also called \u201cIEA days\u201d, which is based on average daily imports. [6]\n\nThe report also shows how many days\u2019 fuel supply is held on ships destined for Australia and the number of days\u2019 supply held for the Australian market both in Australia and overseas. [6]\n\nMr Taylor\u2019s calculation is based on the estimated IEA days of net import coverage plus stocks held for, and on the way to, Australia. The minister indicated this at the time of his statement, saying the calculation \u201cincludes stock on water\u201d. Using this method Australia has averaged fuel stocks to cover 86.6 days during 2019. [6]\n\nThe Department of Environment and Energy\u2019s Liquid Fuel Security Review interim report, released in April 2019, states that counting stock on water is not in line with IEA requirements, which do not allow countries to count stocks still being shipped towards their reserves. [7]\n\nIn an interview on ABC Radio on August 5, 2019, Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) executive director Peter Jennings said counting oil contracted or en-route for delivery may not be a viable way to ensure Australia\u2019s fuel security in the event of an oil shortage. [8]\n\n\u201cI think that is really just looking at what has been contracted and if you're in a difficult strategic situation, ships may not be able to take to sea,\u201d Mr Jennings said.\n\nThe Liquid Fuel Security Review interim report notes that there are \"different ways to measure fuel stocks\u201d.[7]\n\nThe report notes that the Australian government has committed to \"returning to compliance\" with IEA requirements by 2026. The government is working with the IEA over how to do this and how to possibly make reforms to those requirements. [7]\n\nThe report also says the government\u2019s \u201cpreferred measure of domestic fuel security\u201d is consumption cover, which counts how many days fuel stocks will last under normal demand. \u201cConsumption cover of petrol, diesel and jet fuel has been consistent over the last decade, ranging between 17 and 20 days on average,\u201d it says. [7]\n\nAustralia has \u201dthe equivalent of around nine IEA days of stock in foreign ports and 20 IEA days of stock on route to Australia\u201d, according to the report. Because those stocks are owned by Australian companies and are destined for import into Australia, it says, the IEA method used to count the 90-day stockholding \u201cdoes not capture the full picture of domestic liquid fuel security, particularly as it also does not include Defence stockholdings\u201d. [7]\n\nModelling of an \u201cextreme\u201d scenario where there are no oil imports to Australia suggests the country could support \u201ccritical users\u201d for three months, the report says, although it states further testing is needed. [7]\n\nThe Australian Institute of Petroleum, the representative organisation for Australia\u2019s petroleum industry, argued in a 2017 submission about a new petroleum data reporting regime that not counting on-water stocks gave an incomplete picture of how much petroleum was available to the domestic market. On-water stocks represent about a quarter of Australia\u2019s total fuel inventory, the AIP said. [9]\n\nDr Paul Barnes, head of risk and resilience at ASPI, told AAP FactCheck in an email that \u201cincluding stocks at sea and not yet in Australia does not comply with the detail laid out in the IEA\u2019s compliance regime about having reserves to address surprises and contingencies\u201d. [10]\n\nThe Liquid Fuel Security Review interim report states that there are \u201ca number of questions about exactly how Australia\u2019s liquid fuel market would work in the case of major disruptions\u201d and further modelling and testing \u201cwill provide the information that the Government requires to make sound decisions on how to manage the risks in\u201d. [7]\n\nDeakin University Law School Professor of Law Samantha Hepburn told AAP FactCheck that Australia should not count on-water supplies towards IEA stocks \u201cbecause we don't have full control of our fuel stocks on international waters until it is on our soil\u201d.\n\nProfessor Hepburn also said the purpose of the IEA\u2019s 90 day fuel stock is to ensure there is a sufficient global stockpile for \u201ca collective response in the event of a massive fuel disruption\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf you don't have 90 days of reserves, excluding on-water stocks, Australia would be unable to contribute to the global response in the event of a fuel shortage and this would undermine global security,\u201d Prof Hepburn said. [11]\n\nBased on this evidence, AAP FactCheck finds that Mr Taylor\u2019s statement is mostly accurate: based on his stated measure of including on-water stocks being shipped to Australia, the nation\u2019s fuel reserves are close to 90 days\u2019 cover.\n\nHowever, Australia\u2019s fuel reserves currently do not meet the 90 days\u2019 cover required under its commitment to the IEA international energy program treaty. Energy security experts have expressed concern about counting on-water stocks in fuel reserves. The Liquid Fuel Security Review interim report states that early modelling suggests critical users could be supported for three months if Australia could not receive oil imports but also states that a number of questions remain about what would happen in a major disruption.", "lang": "en"}
