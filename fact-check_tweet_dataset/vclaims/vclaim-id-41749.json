Some pointed to the removal of a Aytu BioScience video explaining the treatment from YouTube and the suspension of the company\u2019s Twitter account as \u201ccensorship\u201d intended to make the president look bad:\n\nAytu BioScience\u2019s website states that the basis for its proposed prototype, named \u201cHealight,\u201d is a 2019 study titled \u201cInternally Applied Ultraviolet Light as a Novel Approach for Effective and Safe Anti-Microbial Treatment,\u201d published in the United European Gastroenterology Journal. The article isn\u2019t accessible without an account (and our attempts to create an account resulted in error messages), but Aytu BioScience\u2019s Healight web page summarizes the findings: \u201cHere, the authors show that UVA light exhibits significant in vitro bactericidal effects in an array of clinically important bacteria. Additionally, this is the first study using intracolonic UVA application, which reports that UVA exposure is not associated with endoscopic or histologic injury.\u201d\n\nAytu BioScience\u2019s proposal for a UV light treatment has not yet been fully tested. The company\u2019s website warns that \u201c[Healight] has not been reviewed by the FDA\u201d and it warns specifically that it is not approved for use in the fight against coronavirus. \u201cThis device, or concept of this device is currently not indicated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.\u201d The video that was removed from YouTube can still be found on AYTU BioScience\u2019s website, and it bears a similar disclaimer: \u201cProposed prototype device depicted. This has not been reviewed by the FDA. Currently not indicated for treatment of COVID-19.\u201d Aytu BioScience CEO Josh Disbrow wrote an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal about the politicization of his company\u2019s research, in which he expressed hope that the new technology could eventually be used on coronavirus but conceded, \u201cThere is still much work to do on Healight\u2014much to study, and much to verify.\u201d\n\nSome experts are skeptical that even after the work is done Healight will amount to much. There\u2019s an important distinction to be made between forms of ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet light exists on a spectrum split up by wavelength; ultraviolet A (UVA) light has the longest wavelengths, followed by ultraviolet B (UVB) light, while ultraviolet C (UVA) light has the shortest. Aytu BioScience\u2019s Healight uses UVA light. Another form of ultraviolet light that\u2019s being explored to combat coronavirus, though to kill the virus in the air not in humans, is a specific, very short form of UVC light called far-UVC light.\n\nDr. David Brenner, director of Columbia University\u2019s Center for Radiological Research, has been exploring ultraviolet technology to combat coronavirus, and he has seen promise using far-UVC light. He doubts UVA light would work and thinks it may even be dangerous to internal tissue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting idea, though I have doubts that it would work,\u201d Brenner told the Dispatch Fact Check. \u201cThe airways and lung are pretty complex geometrical structures, so any small amount of material between the virus and the UV light source would protect the virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, UVA is not particularly effective at killing viruses\u2014far less effective than UVC,\u201d Brenner said. He mentioned one 2006 paper from the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research that showed while UVC light efficiently kills SAR-CoV-1 (the virus that caused the 2003 outbreak of SARS), UVA light does not.\n\n\u201cFinally, I have some concerns about safety of the lining of lung exposed directly to the UVA light, without any protective layer of dead cells, which is typically the case with external exposure to sunlight,\u201d Brenner said.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the Aytu BioScience has faced questions about its products. Earlier this year the company made news for selling coronavirus tests produced by Chinese manufacturers whose tests did not meet Chinese regulatory standards. Aytu\u2019s website notes: \u201cThe FDA has not reviewed Aytu BioScience\u2019s validation of the [coronavirus] test.\u201d The Denver Public Safety Department used Aytu\u2019s tests, and a spokeswoman said the tests generated an unexpectedly high number of false positives.\n\nWas the content removed simply because it was touted by Donald Trump? The company acknowledges in both the written and video content itself that it is not FDA-approved and is not \u201cindicated for treatment of COVID-19.\u201d YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said in an interview that the platform would remove any \u201cmedically unsubstantiated\u201d videos about coronavirus and Twitter leadership has similarly announced it will remove anything that \u201cgoes directly against guidance from authoritative sources of global and local public health information.\u201d While there is an ongoing debate about whether those guidelines are the right ones, Healight meets the stated criteria for removal from both websites.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
