Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of the claim in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: The man in the photo is sent a notice of Rs 1,50,000 by the UP government for pelting stones. Fact: The image is on the internet at least since 2016. A few users have posted in January 2016 saying that the image is related to \u2018Malda riots\u2019 (West Bengal). The photo in the post has nothing to do with the recent protests in Uttar Pradesh. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nIn Uttar Pradesh, there have been protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act over the past few days. From an \u2018India Today\u2019 article, it can be found that UP CM Adityanath had said that if the protesters destroy public property, the government will seize their assets.\n\nWhen the image in the post is subjected to Google reverse image search technique, a tweet with the photo was found in the search results. The tweet was made on January 8, 2016, and the user has written that the photo is that of \u2018Malda riots\u2019 in West Bengal. The January 6, 2016 article of \u2018India Today\u2019 has reported that riots broke out in West Bengal\u2019s \u2018Malda\u2019 in opposition to the speech of \u2018All India Hindu Mahasabha\u2019 leader Kamalesh Tiwari. While the exact context of the photo cannot be ascertained with the available information, the image in the post is an old one and has nothing to do with the recent protests in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nTo summarize, an old image is being shared with a false narrative of \u2018the man in the photo is sent a notice of Rs 1,50,000 by the UP government for pelting stones\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
