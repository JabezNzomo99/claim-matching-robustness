These are \u2018full-time equivalent\u2019 nurses working in psychiatry and with people with learning disabilities. More recent figures to September 2016 show the fall at around 6,500.\n\nMr Corbyn is using a broad definition of mental health nurses here, including those who work with learning disabilities. NHS Digital, which publishes the figures, uses this definition so that figures for mental health nurses can be compared back over time.\n\nLooking only at mental health nurses working in psychiatry (and excluding those working in learning disabilities) there were around 4,600 fewer between 2010 and 2015. That\u2019s a reduction of about 11%. Adding in the more recent figures to September 2016, that fall is around 4,800.\n\nThe number of places for trainee mental health nurses has increased in recent years. But this won\u2019t necessarily lead to more nurses actually working for the NHS\u2014Health Education England is concerned that \u201cthe existence of over 3,000 vacancies indicates this education supply is not translating into increased numbers in employment\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked Mr Corbyn\u2019s office about the source of his claim that there are 400 fewer doctors working in mental health.\n\nThere were 167 fewer fully trained doctors specialising in psychiatry and psychotherapy in September 2016 compared to September 2010, and 36 fewer such doctors overall, according to the latest NHS England workforce statistics.", "lang": "en"}
