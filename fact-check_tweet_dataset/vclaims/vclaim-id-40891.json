People are asked to stock up food and other essential items that are good for 2 weeks.\n\nSeveral variations of this claim have circulated online, particularly on social media and messaging apps. All of them claim that all establishments aside from hospitals and drugstores will be ordered to close down. This includes markets, groceries, and banks.\n\nThe posts were shared from the second to third week of April. Readers also sent screenshots of these messages to Rappler for verification.\n\nThe facts: The Philippine National Police (PNP) said the claim is not true. Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles and national policy Chief Implementer Carlito Galvez also said officials are still discussing what should be done next after the extended Luzon lockdown is lifted on April 30.\n\nOn April 12, the PNP debunked the claim on its Facebook page, saying that the information circulating about a total lockdown is \u201cfake.\u201d The PNP also reminded the public to be mindful of what they share online because spreading unverified information is punishable by law.\n\n\u201cAfter April 30, we will try to set up new guidelines for the \u2018new normal.\u2019 All things being considered, kung maganda ang makita natin (if we see good results) within the next 14 days. So kailangan po talaga natin ng kooperasyon ng bawat isa (we really need everybody\u2019s cooperation) to make the decision easier for us,\u201d he said.\n\nOn April 14, Galvez also said that there are currently no plans to declare a national lockdown. \u201cWe are trying to have it from highly centralized to the localized interventions,\u201d Galvez said in an interview with DWIZ.\n\nThe Philippines has been under a state of calamity due to the coronavirus since March 16, with the entire Luzon under lockdown until April 30. Local government units in the Visayas and Mindanao have also enforced lockdowns to prevent the spread of the disease. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
