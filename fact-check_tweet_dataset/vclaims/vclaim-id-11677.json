She also agreed to cooperate with U.S. investigators.\n\nPutin\u2019s claim that \u201cno one knows anything about her at all\u201d is also false on multiple levels.\n\nFirstly, Putin is a friend and close associate of Alexandr Torshin., the figure described in the U.S. indictment as the \u201cRussian official and Butina\u2019s handler.\u201d\n\nDuring Putin\u2019s years in power, Torshin, a highly decorated government official, appeared at public events standing next to Putin \u2013 an honor reserved for those in the Kremlin inner circle who are closest to the president.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s criminal complaint against Butina, which she described in court as a \u201ctrue and accurate\u201d account of her actions, includes quotes from her direct message exchanges with Torshin and emails to her American associate \u2013 identified by prosecutors as \u201cU.S. Person 1\u201d \u2013 in which she refers to Putin\u2019s direct approval of her \u201cmission\u201d at least on seven occasions.\n\nIn a letter dated March 30, 2016, Butina refers to a conversation between Torshin and Putin, writing that Torshin \u201csuggested to President Putin that he consider coming to the Prayer Breakfast next year, Feb. 2017, and Pres. Putin did not say \u2018no\u2019!\u201d She also suggests that for Putin to attend the National Prayer Breakfast, he must receive a personal invitation from the U.S. president.\n\nIn her letters, Butina repeatedly referred to the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s approval for her own actions and for Torshin\u2019s visits to the U.S. and meetings with influential American politicians. In two instances, she wrote to Torshin telling him she has his diplomatic passport and that she can purchase plane tickets for him.\n\nIn 2012, Spanish police investigating a Russian organized crime group operating on the island of Mallorca discovered that a figure whom some of the suspects referred to as their \u201cgodfather\u201d was Torshin.\n\n\u201cSpanish prosecutors decided in the summer of 2013 to arrest Torshin, who was then a senator, officials say,\u201d ProPublica wrote earlier this year. \u201cPolice set up an operation to capture him during a visit to Mallorca, but he mysteriously canceled the trip at the last minute, apparently as the result of a tip, authorities said. Torshin was never charged, while the other suspects were convicted of money laundering. Last year, he publicly denied any wrongdoing in the Spanish money-laundering case.\u201d\n\nTorshin has been the target of U.S. sanctions for his role in the Russian clandestine operations in foreign countries.\n\nFor Butina, the plea deal means she will remain in jail until her cooperation with the U.S. government is complete, after which the judge will decide on the sentence. While the maximum punishment she could receive is five years imprisonment, she could potentially face deportation with no right to apply for U.S. citizenship or a U.S. visa. By pleading guilty, Butina also loses the right to appeal the court verdict.\n\nInformation discovered by a popular Russian Telegram channel suggests that Butina\u2019s involvement with Russian government agencies may have been even broader than that shown in the U.S. case against her.\n\nAccording to the Telegram post, Butina is the founder of \u201cAntares,\u201d a Moscow firm with a budget of 10,000 rubles and no employees. Polygraph.info confirmed the information via the Russian tax authorities\u2019 online database.\n\nBut, the most interesting piece of this new information is that Butina\u2019s firm is located in the same office in Moscow as the LLC \u201cPrestige,\u201d whose founder and owner, Sergey Krechetov, is affiliated with \u201cMKPK Universal\u201d \u2013 a developer and distributor of top secret strategic air force equipment for the Russian Defense Ministry.\n\nBefore the plea was announced, Polygraph.info fact checked the story going around in Russia that Butina would receive U.S. citizenship. We were able to update the story, following the hearing, and the verdict.", "lang": "en"}
