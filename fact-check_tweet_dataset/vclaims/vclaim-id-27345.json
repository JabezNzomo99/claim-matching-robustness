But some Facebook users are posting as if they have.\n\nOne post published Nov. 12 and shared several hundred times includes photos of four Republican lawmakers. Text above the images claims they have voted to impeach Trump.\n\n\"Will Hurd, Fred Upton, Susan Brooks and Brian Fitzpatrick,\" the post reads. \"Remember these faces next election!\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe House has voted on whether to authorize a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump, but it hasn\u2019t voted on articles of impeachment. The resolution to start an inquiry passed in a 232-196 vote Oct. 31. No Republicans voted for the measure.\n\nWe reached out to the Facebook user who published the photo for evidence to back up the claim, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\n\nThe first public impeachment hearings began Nov. 13 in the House. On Sept. 24, Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the inquiry, which centers on whether Trump solicited foreign interference from Ukraine in the 2020 election.\n\nRepresentatives have not yet voted on whether to impeach Trump. That will happen after hearings conclude, which could be as soon as late December.\n\nThe four lawmakers cited in the Facebook post have criticized Trump in the House before. In July, Reps. Hurd of Texas, Upton of Michigan, Brooks of Indiana and Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania were the only House Republicans who voted in favor of a resolution to rebuke the president\u2019s comments that four minority Democratic congresswomen should \"go back\" to their ancestral countries.\n\nOther Republicans who criticized Trump in recent months have faced similar disinformation on social media. After he expressed concern about the president\u2019s July phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, Rep. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, became the subject of false claims about his own ties to the country. When Vermont\u2019s Republican Gov. Phil Scott spoke in favor of an impeachment inquiry, another social media post falsely claimed he, too, had \"voted\" to impeach the president.\n\nThis new Facebook post is inaccurate as well. We rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
