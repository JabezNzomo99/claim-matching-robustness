Here is what you should be looking out for. 1. No, There\u2019s No Proof That the Fire Has Been \u2018Intentionally Set\u2019 or \u2018a Terrorist Attack\u2019 From Maldito Bulo \u2013 The exact cause of the fire has not been determined yet. The Paris prosecutor has opened an investigation for \u201cinvoluntary destruction by fire\u201d, as the cathedral was going under renovation works. Investigators, this Tuesday, 16 April, are favouring the possibility of an accidental fire . Monument to \u2018Best of Civilisation\u2019: Art Experts on Notre Dame Fire\n\nA tweet from Christopher J Hale, a Time columnist, has propelled the \u201carson\u201d theory. \u201cA Jesuit friend in Paris who works in #NotreDame told me cathedral staff said the fire was intentionally set\u201d, he wrote, adding in a second tweet: \u201cI should note that he has zero evidence beyond what the staff said. So qualify this as an unsubstantiated rumor.\u201d This didn\u2019t keep from publishing an article on the sole basis of this tweet, that has since been deleted. Other pieces of misleading information have been circulating, claiming that the fire was the consequence of a terrorist attack. In Spain, the website Alerta Digital has published this baseless claim, reports Maldito Bulo. 2. No, Gas Tanks Have Not Been Found Near Notre-Dame on the Day of the Fire From Maldito Bulo \u2013 Many social media accounts are sharing a real article from The Telegraph, headlined: \u201cGas tanks and Arabic documents found in unmarked car by Paris' Notre-Dame cathedral spark terror fears\u201d. This story is from 2016, and is unrelated to the fire. The Telegraph has added a disclaimer on its article .\n\n3. There Was No Man Standing Next to the Fire While It Started. It\u2019s a Statue of the Virgin From AFP Factuel \u2013 A conspiracy theory has spread on French social media, involving a picture in which we can see the figure of a person standing next to the fire. This figure is the one of \u201cla Vierge du trumeau du portail du Clo\u00eetre\u201d, as you can see here: 4. Yes, This Picture of Notre Dame and the Eiffel Tower Is Real From Checknews \u2013 Some people have suggested that this picture, published on the Facebook page A G Photographie, was a fabricated image. It is not: it\u2019s mostly a matter of perspective and of material, reports Checknews, which published an interview with the photographer . The picture was taken very far from the scene with a tele photo lens. 5. No, This Is Not the Second Time Notre-Dame Has Been Burning From 20 Minutes \u2013 This misleading tweet claims that the cathedral was bombed during the First World War. It has not, and the pictures on the tweet are from the Cathedral of Reims. Just a reminder if you're not familiar with the history of Notre Dame, but this isn't the first time it's burned. It was shelled during WWI and was restored to its current state before the fire.\n\n\n\nFrance will do the same again, I'm positive. pic.twitter.com/o1w84PdbxH \u2014 \u00f0\u009f\u008c\u00bb Mao (@Maolfunction) April 15, 2019 Old, Unrelated Articles Go Viral After Notre Dame Blaze in France", "lang": "en"}
