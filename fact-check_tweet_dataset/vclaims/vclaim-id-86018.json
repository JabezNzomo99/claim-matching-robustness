By 2038, under our extended baseline, the deficit would be 6.5 percent of GDP, and federal debt held by the public would be 100 percent of GDP even before we account for the economic effects of that increase in debt. That would be more than any year except 1945 and 1946.\u201d\n\nFirst of all, one reason why the deficit appears to be falling rapidly is because it soared to great heights during the Great Recession. Because of emergency actions taken by President George W. Bush at the end of his term and President Obama at the beginning of his term, it\u2019s hard to draw a bright line between the administrations. Thus different people might disagree about how large a deficit Obama inherited or helped create.\n\nA Treasury official said that Lew\u2019s statement is correct because in fiscal year 2009, the deficit as a share of the gross domestic product had risen to 10.1 percent. For 2012, the share was 7 percent, so that means a decrease of 3.1 percentage points over that three-year period. Hence, in Treasury\u2019s formula, no other three-year period has a decrease as large until you get back to 1949, when the deficit as percentage of GDP had fallen from 7.2 percent in 1946 to a small surplus that year.\n\nRegular readers know that The Fact Checker is often wary of raw numbers. Context is important. But in this case, the numbers have already been adjusted to account for the size of the economy, so in that sense it is fair to compare sets of years decades apart. You end up with odd and not especially useful results if you go a step further, such as taking these adjusted numbers and determining the percentage of the drop over the years.\n\nIn any case, both situations \u2014 World War II and the Great Recession \u2014 were unusual cases that led to a large spike in deficits. Given that the deficits soared because of a temporary situation, it also makes sense that they would rapidly decline. At the end of this fiscal year, the deficit as a percentage of GDP is expected to shrink to about four percent \u2014 though that is still higher than the year before Obama took office.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t dispute that day-one, deficits were very large \u2014 far larger than they were a year prior to that, as a result of historical events,\u201d said the Treasury official. \u201cBut the measure of achievement from that point still seems to be best measured by how much progress we\u2019ve made as a share of the economy from that point, which is what the Secretary did.\u201d\n\nStill, Lew attributing the decline to \u201cthe policies that we\u2019ve put in place\u201d is a bit like the rooster congratulating himself for the sun coming up every morning. In making this link, he goes further than President Obama, who made a similar statement about the decline in deficits over the summer that, in a rare fact checker dispute, PolitiFact deemed correct and FactCheck.org said was misleading.\n\nJust as much of the rise in the deficit in the early part of the administration can be attributed to recession, the decline also stems from the recovery, though it has been painfully sluggish. There is an endless debate among economists about whether Obama\u2019s policies helped or hindered the recovery; The Fact Checker takes no position on the matter, except to note that most studies found at least a modest, positive effect from Obama\u2019s stimulus.\n\nMoreover, the deficit has also fallen because, especially after the Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in 2010, Congress rejected the much higher spending levels that were proposed by the president. The administration has also objected to the sequester that sliced budgets across the board and thus has slashed even more spending. So it hardly seems correct to suggest, as Lew does, that all of the deficit reduction stems from the administration\u2019s policies.\n\nMeanwhile, Elmendorf made clear in his testimony Tuesday that the administration and Congress have been cutting the wrong kind of spending \u2014 primarily the increasingly smaller discretionary side of the budget. The mandatory spending side of the budget, such as health care and Social Security, has barely been nicked, except (in the case of Medicare) to help fund the Affordable Care Act. Moreover, the administration, with Congress, made permanent virtually all of the Bush-era tax cuts, which Elmendorf said significantly worsened the long-term budget picture.\n\nIn a recent presentation (see slide 3), Elmendorf showed that the long-term projection for debt as a percentage of GDP now is not much different than it was two years ago, despite extensive budget fights that supposedly slashed nearly $3 trillion in spending over the next 10 years. That\u2019s because the tax deal earlier this year wiped out much of those savings, according to CBO\u2019s accounting. So, the debt as a percentage of the economy could rise to 100 percent in a quarter century, up from 73 percent today, he said.\n\nBoth statements by Lew and Elmendorf mention the spike in the debt, as a percentage of the economy, after World War II. But Elmendorf\u2019s reference is more troubling, because he is talking about debt that built up over the decades, not debt that was required for a short-term emergency, such as war or a recession. Such a debt load would be extraordinarily difficult to reduce, which is why the CBO director is raising a warning flag now.", "lang": "en"}
