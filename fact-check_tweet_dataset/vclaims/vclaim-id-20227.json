Wajahat Saeed Khan, a Pakistani journalist tweeted, \u201d Mid-conflict, the Indian Air Force has changed its Air Officer Commanding the Western front, with Pakistan? So is the previous guy fired? Or just golfing?\u201d. The tweet suggested that the Air Marshal was fired after the purported \u2018failure of IAF\u2019 in an air battle against PAF.\n\nAnother Pakistani journalist Omar Quraishi also reiterated the same claim by saying , \u201cthe Govt of India has sacked Air Marshal C H Kumar, the Air Office Commanding-in-Chief of the Western Air Command\u201d.\n\nAlt News found that the information propagated about sacking of Air Marshal Chandrashekharan Hari Kumar after India lost one IAF aircraft is false. Air Marshal Kumar\u2019s departure from the army is because he\u2019s retiring, not because he was sacked. In a statement issued by the Ministry of Defence, it is clearly stated, \u201cWestern Air Command Indian Air Force retired on 28 February 2019 after an illustrious career spanning over 39 yrs.\u201d\n\nAccording to 7th Pay Commission News, an Air Marshal retires at the age of 60. In a statement issued by the MoD, it was also stated, \u201cThe Air Marshal celebrated his sixtieth on 26 February and remained a soldier till the last of his service\u201d.\n\nA tweet put out by ANI on the news also confirmed that the Air Marshal C Hari Kumar had retired on the due date of his retirement after 39 years of service.\n\nThe International News, a Pakistani English daily, published an article on March 1, 2019, which stated, \u201cThe Indian government has removed a senior air force officer reportedly after Pakistan\u2019s successful strikes and capturing of a pilot on February 27.\u201d\n\nWhile the report has been updated with a statement from the Ministry of Defence that the Air Marshal had retired, the headline remained, \u201cIndia removes senior IAF officer after Pakistan shoots down jets\u201d.\n\nMalayalam website Big News Live had also published an identical report on March 1, 2019, with the same title, \u201cIndia removes Air Marshal Hari Kumar after Pakistan shoot down jets\u201d. At the time of writing this article, the report has been deleted from the website.\n\nIn conclusion, Pakistani social media users and media outlets have propagated misinformation that the Western Air Command Air Marshal Chandrashekharan Hari Kumar was sacked after an IAF aircraft was shot down by PAF, while he had retired on the due date of his retirement.", "lang": "en"}
