He and others said that Mr. Trump appeared to be referring to a perennial and unrelated water dispute in California between farmers and environmentalists. Farmers have long argued for more water to be allocated to irrigating crops, while environmentalists counter that the state\u2019s rivers would suffer and fish stocks would die. [For the latest updates on the Mendocino Complex Fire, read this story.] The president first addressed the fires late Sunday, writing on Twitter, \u201cCalifornia wildfires are being magnified & made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren\u2019t allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized.\u201d He also referred to a debate in forest management about the effectiveness of removing trees and vegetation as a fire control method.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump expanded on his comments in another tweet, for a second time referring to water being diverted into the ocean. The remarks came hours after the White House declared the wildfires a \u201cmajor disaster\u201d and ordered that federal funding be made available to help recovery efforts. California does not lack water to fight the Carr Fire and others burning across the state, officials said. Mr. Berlant of Cal Fire declined to speculate on the meaning of Mr. Trump\u2019s statement that water was not being \u201cproperly utilized.\u201d Asked about that line and the president\u2019s claim that water was being diverted into the Pacific, a spokesman for Gov. Jerry Brown, Evan Westrup, said in an email, \u201cYour guess is as good as mine.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for clarification on Mr. Trump\u2019s statement. William Stewart, a forestry specialist at the University of California, Berkeley, said he believed Mr. Trump was referring to the battle over allocating water to irrigation versus providing river habitat for fish. That debate has no bearing on the availability of water for firefighting. Helicopters lower buckets into lakes and ponds to collect water that is then used to douse wildfires, and there is no shortage of water to do so, Cal Fire officials said. California water regulators are preparing to negotiate how much water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta should flow to California\u2019s farms and how much should flow down the river and to the ocean to ensure fish have enough fresh water to spawn and hatch. The issue has long pitted environmentalists against the state\u2019s farming communities.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump took on the farmers\u2019 grievances in language similar to his tweets this week. \u201cYou have a water problem that is so insane, it is so ridiculous, where they\u2019re taking the water and shoving it out to sea,\u201d he said during a May 2016 campaign rally in Fresno. \u201cThey have farms up here, and they don\u2019t get water.\u201d Recently, California Republicans encouraged the Trump administration to weigh in on the issue, inviting Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to the Central Valley to discuss water rights in the state\u2019s agricultural heartland.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty big story, but it\u2019s got nothing to do with the fires,\u201d Mr. Stewart said. Mr. Trump raised another issue when he wrote that officials \u201cmust also tree clear to stop fire spreading.\u201d Scientists and forest experts said the president was referring to a valid and continuing debate. Let Us Help You Understand Climate Change\n\u2022 None\n\u2022 This seven-part series will help you get a fuller understanding of the science of climate change, how government policies can make a difference and what you can do to help turn the tide.\n\u2022 Today, 1 percent of the world is too hot for humans to live. By 2070, that may increase to 19 percent. What will happen to the billions of people who currently live in those areas?\n\u2022 Want to go even deeper? Maybe it\u2019s time to pick up a book about climate change. We can help you find the right one.\n\u2022 Also, find out how much hotter your hometown has become. The engineering and land management that enabled California\u2019s tremendous growth have left it more vulnerable to climate shocks, which are getting worse. The timber industry has argued that \u201cthinning\u201d forests \u2014 removing certain trees to improve the health of the remaining ones and diminish the plants and underbrush that fuel fires \u2014 reduces the risk of wildfires. Republicans in Congress have sought to loosen environmental restrictions to allow more thinning. Democrats and environmentalists argue the practice will open the door to expanded commercial logging and threaten wildlife. California already has policies in place to address wildfire risk. LeRoy Westerling, a management professor at the University of California, Merced, who studies wildfires, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s statement about fire-control efforts hit on an important issue, but that he wrongly placed the blame on California. Professor Westerling noted that while federal funding for lowering wildfire risk has been tied up in budget negotiations, California has allocated $256 million this year. That money is coming from a source the Trump administration finds troublesome: revenues from California\u2019s program to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gases. Under its market-based approach for curbing carbon emissions, California sets a ceiling for the total amount of carbon that can be emitted. Companies are then required to obtain permits to release carbon into the atmosphere. California is \u201cspending millions and millions of dollars on this while the federal government is sitting on its hands,\u201d Professor Westerling said. \u201cAnd all that money is being raised because we\u2019re putting a price on carbon.\u201d Scientists noted that Mr. Trump\u2019s statement didn\u2019t address the role climate change has played in creating a hotter and drier fire season. The president in the past has dismissed climate change as a hoax and his top cabinet officials have questioned the established science that rising global temperatures are caused by human activity. Michael F. Wehner, a senior staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said it was not possible to quantify precisely the likelihood that climate change is having an impact on forest fires, as can now be done with other extreme-weather events such as heat waves.", "lang": "en"}
