The official Twitter account of All India Mahila Congress was among those who shared the image and wrote, \u201cUgly display of Gujarat Model \u2026..Teaching kids \u201cAdvantages of dowry\u201d Social science textbook excerpt is BJP\u2019s idea of women empowerment. We want to remind @CMOGuj about Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 and by IPC 498a, the offence is Cognizable, non-compoundable and non-bailable.\u201d The tweet is now deleted but an archived version can be accessed here.\n\nThe list of advantages in the paper include the marriage of ugly girls, attracting handsome and unwilling boys, affects the love and affection a husband shares for his wife, among others.\n\nAnother Twitter account @kunfaaya also shared a photograph of the excerpt.\n\nOther Twitter handles like @Deep4INDand @amanpreet9954tweeted the excerpt as well.\n\nThe claim has also been circulated on Facebook.\n\nA variant of the claim also suggests that the chapter on advantages of dowry was in a Maharashtra textbook.\n\nThe paper is not a part of Gujarat Education Board syllabus but was in news in 2017 when the excerpt was reported to be found in the sociology study material of Bangalore\u2019s St Josephs College. As reported by The Times of Indiain an October 21, 2017 report, the college had come under fire for distribution of the study material listing misogynistic \u2018advantages\u2019 of the dowry system.\n\nIn an earlier report, The News Minutehad said that the issue was brought to light by a young woman who claimed that \u201cstudents of Bachelor of Arts in St Joseph\u2019s College of Arts and Science in Bengaluru were given study material which endorses the system of dowry.\u201d The college had initially refuted that the paper was a part of the syllabus and later added that an investigation is being carried out to find the root cause of the problem as the college was unsupportive of oppressive views. Students of St Josephs maintained that the paper was handed out to them while the college claimed to have not distributed the paper.\n\nProfessors of St Josephs, Shanti Nagar, issued a statement on October 21, 2017, in solidarity with the sociology department of the college and lashed out at an \u201cirresponsible\u201d citizen journalist. The head of the department of English, Professor Cheriyan Alexander, stated that a \u201ccitizen-journalist-cum-engineering-student from Vellore\u201d got her hands on one page out of 60 odd pages and placed it out of context on social media. \u201cShe underlines selected sentences which obviously look politically incorrect to any educated Indian because they reiterate the old patriarchal ideology favouring dowry \u2013 obnoxious views, no doubt. What she doesn\u2019t underline are the beginning and ending sentences on the same page, the first saying that these are the views of a certain section of society, the second the author\u2019s warning that these arguments should not be left unquestioned,\u201d said Professor Alexander. Claiming that the paper meant to provide a perspective on dowry, he said that it is common for educators to list ideologies from different spectrums for students to compare, analyse and critique.\n\nThe college\u2019s statement was also reported by The Times of India.\n\nAn excerpt from the study material issued to students of St Josephs, Bangalore, which the college claimed was placed out of context, has resurfaced on social media as \u201cadvantages of dowry\u201d being taught to students of Gujarat state board.", "lang": "en"}
