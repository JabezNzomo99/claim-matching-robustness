This post has had over 2,800 shares, 15,000 reactions, and 3,400 comments as of writing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there were pan de sal. But I am sure there were (goods with) hard case \u2013 could be canned goods or tetra packs, I\u2019m not entirely sure.\u201d Leviste told Rappler in a phone interview.\n\nHe added that each pack of goods contained groceries, rice, a large bottle of water, and an N95 face mask. \u201cAko ang katulong sa pag-abot eh (I was the one who helped her distribute),\u201d he said.\n\nVince Liban, a volunteer who was at the relief operations, also contradicted Oallop and Uson\u2019s claims. \u201cThis is infuriating. I was at the Relief Ops. We packed rice, assorted canned goods, and noodles in each food pack. Mocha Uson is not only spreading fake news. She is disrespecting the people who volunteered and is sowing discord in a tragic time like this,\u201d he said.\n\nRobredo herself debunked the claims on January 16. \"Parang insulto naman ito sa dami ng taong nag-donate sa amin. In fact, noong Lunes na gabi, nagtawag kami ng volunteers. In less than an hour, ang daming dumating sa opisina na volunteers, at iyong mga volunteers iyong makakasabi kung ano iyong laman noong relief packs,\" she said. (READ: Robredo fact-checks Uson: Why let a fake news peddler get taxpayers' money?)\n\nThe Office of the Vice President said they were able to distribute 2,101 food packs and 1,000 face masks to the Taal victims through Angat Buhay and its partner organizations. Each food pack contained 1.5 kilos of rice, assorted canned goods, and two packs of noodles.", "lang": "en"}
