While the images are authentic scans, they aren\u2019t representative of most toddlers, as they show children suffering from a specific condition.\n\nExamples can be seen here , here and here .\n\nOne post includes the image of the x-ray and says: \u201cToddler skull X-rays are terrifying.

The article features the x-ray shown in the claim as well as other x-rays and photographs of the same child ( here ).\n\nHyperdontia is a condition where there are surplus teeth in the mouth ( here ). The article explains the photographs show \u201can unusual case of multiple hyperdontia in a girl aged 11 years 8 months with 31 supernumerary teeth.\u201d It provides an analysis and treatment suggestion for the condition.\n\nRobin Wright, Director of the Pediatric Oral Health Research and Policy Center at the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry confirmed to Reuters via email that the x-ray in this claim \u201cdoes not represent a typical human child.\u201d\n\nExamples of what pediatric dental x-rays look like can be found here , here and here .\n\nPartly false. This x-ray was taken from a research article about a 11-year-old patient with hyperodontia, a condition where a patient has more teeth than normal.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
