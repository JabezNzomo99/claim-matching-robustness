No, that's not true: This story was made up by a known network of satire websites. Articles from the site go viral when they are re-posted on social media by people claiming they are true. Articles from these sites also get copied by foreign fake news sites without the satire label.\n\nThe claim originated from an article (archived here) where it was published by bustatroll.org on March 25, 2020, under the title \"Trump Will Use Emergency Powers To Remove Pelosi From Congress.\" It opened:\n\nIt's no surprise that this article got attention. Speaker Pelosi and President Trump have one of the most publicly spiteful relationships in Washington. Although Trump tweeted in October of 2019 calling for Pelosi to be impeached in response to the formal impeachment inquiriry into the president, it never happened. What's more, it's not possible for a president to remove a member of Congress. Members of Congress may be expelled, but only after a two-thirds vote within the branch of Congress they're in.\n\nThe site this article appeared on is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run by self-professed liberal troll, Christopher Blair, along with a loose group of friends and allies. He runs several websites and Facebook pages with visible satire disclaimers everywhere. They mostly publish made-up stories with headlines specifically created to trick Republicans, conservatives and evangelical Christians into angrily sharing or commenting on the story on Facebook without actually reading the full article.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who omit the satire disclaimer and other hints the stories are fake. One of the most persistent networks of such sites is run by a man from Pakistan named Kashif Shahzad Khokhar (aka \"DashiKashi\") who has spammed hundreds of such stolen stories into conservative and right-wing Facebook pages.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes bustatroll.org as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
