The caption says, \"'Here he is in his gold toe socks, at a NYC mosque listening to Holocaust denier Sheikh Fadhel al Sahlani.' This is Little Mike, advocating for the Mosque to be built at Ground Zero.\" Several aspects of this claim are false.\u200b\n\nThe photo itself is real, taken of Bloomberg on March 28, 2003 at the Imam Al-Khoei Islamic Center in Queens, New York, by Getty Images ( here ). Getty\u2019s description of the photograph is: \u201cNew York Mayor Michael Bloomberg (C) sits with Imam Sheikh Fadhel Al-Sahlani (R) at the Iman Al-Khoei Islamic Center, as they listen to a speaker March 28, 2003 in the Queens borough of New York City.\" Bloomberg told the Islamic Center congregation that New York City will not tolerate any illegal or discriminating acts towards Muslims and reassured them that the war in Iraq is against the Saddam Hussein regime, not the religion of Islam (Photo by Stephen Chernin/Getty Images).\u201d Imam Sheikh Fadhel Al-Sahlani is in the photo (he is pictured to Bloomberg\u2019s left) and is therefore not the speaker to whom Bloomberg is listening.\u200b\n\nReuters reached out to Sheikh Fadhel Al-Sahlani to seek comment on the claim he is a \u201cHolocaust denier\u201d. He responded by calling the Holocaust \u201ca most horrific crime against our Jewish brothers and sisters in humanity.\u201d Disputing the way he had been portrayed in a 2006 article in the New York Sun, he said, \u201cAt no time and under no circumstances did I mention that the tragedy of [the] Holocaust is not true, nor did I ever question the historical facts relating to the number of Jews killed during the Second World War.\u201d\n\nThe claim that the photo shows Bloomberg \"advocating for the Mosque to be built at Ground Zero\" is false. The photo was taken in 2003, more than six years before the New York Times began reporting ( here ) on a group of Muslims' plans to rebuild a property two blocks north of where the World Trade Center once stood. While Bloomberg did defend ( here ) the controversial plans for a 15-storey Muslim community center, he could not have been doing so in this photo given the date. The cleric who led the now abandoned project was Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, not Imam Sheikh Fadhel al Sahlani(read more here ).\n\nPartly false: this is a photo of Mike Bloomberg at a mosque in New York City. However he is sitting by, not listening to, Sheikh Fadhel al Sahlani - who strongly rejects any suggestion he is a Holocaust denier. Bloomberg is not commenting on plans for a Muslim community center near Ground Zero, because this photo was taken six years before those plans were mooted.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
