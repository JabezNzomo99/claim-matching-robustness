The footage is of an earlier Lion Air flight landing safely at an airport thousands of kilometres away.\n\nLion Air flight JT 610 crashed shortly after taking off from Jakarta on October 29, killing all 189 people on board.\n\nThe misleading video was shared repeatedly over the next few days in several Facebook posts, and it has been viewed more than 5,000 times, according to an AFP tally.\n\nOne of the posts, which has been watched more than 2,000 times, has a caption that says: \u201cAmateur video showing seconds before the LION AIR JT-610 crashed in Karawang waters.\u201d\n\nThe video does not show a plane crashing into sea.\n\nUsing clip keyframes obtained from digital verification tool InVID, AFP used Google Reverse Image to trace the original source of the video to a YouTube channel called Raja Video Id.\n\nThe original clip was published on January 26, 2018 and shows a Lion Air plane landing at Sentani airport in Jayapura on Papua island, Indonesia\u2019s easternmost region.\n\nAirbus vs Boeing, a Facebook page about aviation issues, posted the same video on March 15, 2018, and said it was a video of a Lion Air flight landing at Sentani airport, which is situated next to a lake with the same name.\n\nContacted on November 2, Raja Video Id account owner Ardi La Madi told AFP that the clip purporting to show a Lion Air crash-landing was taken from his YouTube video.\n\nHe said he had filmed the video himself.\n\n\u201cYes the video is mine,\u201d La Madi, who lives in Sorong in Papua, said in an email.\n\nLa Madi said he had also uploaded several clips of plane landings at Sentani Airport on his YouTube page, such as this clip on a Garuda Indonesia plane arriving at the region\u2019s largest airport.", "lang": "en"}
