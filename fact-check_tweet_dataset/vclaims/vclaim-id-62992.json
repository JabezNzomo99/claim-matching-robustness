It has been documented by human rights organizations and the United Nations.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "May 23, 2020", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-62992", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-expert-denies-documented-repression-of-crimean-tatars-/30629280.html", "vclaim": "May 18 is the annual Day of Remembrance for the victims of the Soviet Union\u2019s mass deportation of Crimean Tatars (and other minorities) from the Crimean peninsula in 1944.\n\nThis year, the foreign ministers of Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, Georgia, Lithuania, and Poland issued a joint statement on the 76th anniversary of the deportations. The ministers connected the Crimean Tatars\u2019 treatment after 1944 with their treatment since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe tragedy of the Crimean Tatar people repeated in 2014, when the Russian Federation seized and illegally attempted to annex Crimea, which is an integral part of Ukraine,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cIt is no coincidence that Russia, which glorifies Stalin's totalitarian regime, continues its criminal policy in the 21st century in the temporarily occupied Crimea: ban [on] the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People, systemic repressions, persecution and violations of the rights of Crimean Tatars, who opposed Russia's armed aggression against the territorial integrity of Ukraine. It forced thousands of Crimean Tatars, indigenous people of Crimea, to leave their homes and move to mainland Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe Russian state news agency TASS quoted a response to the declaration by Vladimir Zharikhin, deputy head of the Institute of CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) countries, who said that the countries making the declaration were \u201cunreasonably claiming that the rights of Crimean Tatars have allegedly been violated.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis once again confirms that in Ukraine the name of the presidenthas changed, but the regime that came power in Ukraine after the coup has not changed,\u201d Zharikhin said, referring to Ukraine\u2019s 2014 Maidan Revolution, which was not a coup, and the two Ukrainian presidents who have been elected since then.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe actions are the same, the policy is the same, which is based on outright falsification, outright distortion of facts, outright labeling without any attempt to confirm them with any evidence.\u201d\n\nZharikhin\u2019s claims about \u201coutright falsification\u201d and no attempts to confirm instances of repression are false.\n\nPersecution of Crimean Tatars began when the Russian military moved to occupy and control the peninsula in late February 2014.\n\nOn March 16 of that year, the body of Crimean Tatar activist Reshat Ametov was discovered two weeks after he disappeared, with signs he had been tortured. Ametov had disappeared on March 3 after taking part in a demonstration against Russia\u2019s occupation of the peninsula. There is video evidence suggesting he was abducted by men in unmarked Russian military uniforms.\n\nBy September 2014, Human Rights Watch documented seven cases of \u201cenforced\u201d disappearances in Crimea. Five of the victims were Crimean Tatars.\n\nThe Day of Remembrance on May 18, 2014, followed Russia\u2019s formal annexation of the Crimean peninsula. Crimean Tatars found themselves under Moscow\u2019s de facto control for the first time since 1991. Still, the Crimean Tatar community held its 2014 memorial march in defiance of a ban on public events by the occupying authorities.\n\nThe following year, the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that 60 individuals who participated in an unsanctioned motorcade on May 18, 2015, were arrested, interrogated and fined. Authorities also tried to restrict celebration of the Crimean Tatar flag day on June 26.\n\nAn August 2014 report by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights\u2019 Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues noted that Crimean Tatars under Russian occupation had complained of \u201cgrowing anti-Tatar sentiment.\u201d\n\nIt quoted internally displaced Crimean Tatars who recounted incidents of physical and verbal abuse against members of their community during and after the annexation. Some reported that their houses had been marked or vandalized by unknown individuals, while others cited incidents of uniformed men trying to \u201cclaim\u201d land and property from Tatar owners.\n\nSince then, the Crimean Tatar community has seen a wave of persecution and mass arrests, often on dubious allegations of connections to a \u201cterrorist\u201d group. The group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir, was designated a terrorist group by Russia but is legal in Ukraine and many other countries. Many of the arrests of Tatars, typically carried out by Russia\u2019s FSB (Federal Security Service), are based on unsubstantiated and vague accusations of connections to \u201cterrorist\u201d groups.\n\nIn 2016, Russia banned the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People, the highest representative and executive body of the Crimean Tatars, which was founded in 1991. Mustafa Dzhemilev, a Soviet-era dissident who is the leader of the Crimean Tatar national movement and former chairman of the Mejlis, was banned from entering Crimea in April 2014, barely a month after Russia annexed it.\n\nIn 2016, Russia issued an arrest warrant for Dzhemilev. A survivor of the 1944 deportations, Dzhemilev has effectively been banished from his homeland twice in his lifetime. Russia also issued an arrest warrant for Refat Chubarov, the Mejlis\u2019 current chairman.\n\nSuch incidents show the accusations of repression targeting Crimean Tatars run counter to Zharikhin\u2019s claims of falsification or distortion.\n\nOn May 18, this year\u2019s Day of Remembrance, Sever Mustafayev, a Crimean Tatar activist, journalist, and Amnesty International-recognized prisoner of conscience, issued a statement from Russia, where he is currently imprisoned while on trial. During a court hearing that same day, some defendants held signs saying \u201cMay 18 Repeated\u201d and \u201cFree Prisoners of [the] Kremlin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese so-called \u2018trials\u2019 on this somber date, for me personally, and for my people, is an indicator of the Russian Federation\u2019s attitude to us, and of its generally formal words about our rights, about peace in Crimea, about justice and so forth,\u201d Mustafayev\u2019s statement read.\n\n\u201cSystematic pressure on the Crimean Tatar people, repression against Ukrainian citizens on religious and ethnic grounds; ethnic and political persecution of Crimean Tatars, of the Mejlis, of imams, human rights defenders, civic activists and journalists by the Russia authorities and enforcement agencies are deliberate policy of ethnocide of Crimeans and Crimean Tatars,\u201d it continued.\n\nThe Crimean Tatars are a Turkic people who have inhabited the Crimean peninsula \u2013 and, at one time, parts of southern Ukraine - since the Middle Ages. During the Second World War, the Soviet government dubiously accused the ethnic group of collaboration with the Nazi occupier and deported them en masse to settlements in Central Asia, a fate shared by several other nationalities under Soviet control at the time.\n\nIn 2013, a film was released depicting the deportations as well as the exploits of Ahmet-Khan Sultan, a highly decorated Crimean Tatar fighter who witnessed the deportation of his own people in 1944. In 2016, Crimean Tatar singer Jamala won the Eurovision Song Contest for Ukraine with her song \u201c1944,\u201d about the deportations.", "lang": "en"}
