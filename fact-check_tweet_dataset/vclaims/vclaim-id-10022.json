If she had really made these claims they would be all over the internet by now but we were unable to locate even a single recording of the supposed interview. So we are going to go ahead and rate this claim as fake.\n\nCannibalism by itself is not illegal according to Cornell's Legal Information Institute:\n\nCannibalism is the consumption of another human's body matter, whether consensual or not. In the United States, there are no laws against cannibalism per se, but most, if not all, states have enacted laws that indirectly make it impossible to legally obtain and consume the body matter. Murder, for instance, is a likely criminal charge, regardless of any consent. Further, even if someone consents to being eaten and kills himself, the cannibal may still be liable for criminal or civil actions based on laws governing the abuse or desecration of a corpse, which vary from state to state.\n\nThe story describes a dinner party where Perry supposedly ate human flesh so depending on the exact source of the meat and the location of the dinner party this could be construed as an accusation of breaking the law and so Perry's lawyers might have a case to go after the website for posting the story.\n\nYourNewsWire has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt. They don't even stand behind the truth of their own articles since the terms of service on the website explicitly say:\n\nThe site was recently profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.", "lang": "en"}
