And it\u2019s correct that the Metropolitan police officers taking part in the parade were in full uniform with equipment and radios and would technically have been on duty.\n\nA woman and her three children, including a child who is reportedly 11 years old, were stabbed in Palmers Green in London on Saturday. We think that must be what the post is referring to, as an early police report said all three children were under 12. According to the Metropolitan Police, as of Monday, all four were in \u201ca non-life threatening condition in hospital\u201d. A man was arrested and has been charged.\n\nTwo men were also stabbed in Hounslow in London on Saturday. At the time of writing, they were believed to be in a stable condition.\n\nAltogether, that means six people were stabbed in two incidents that were reported in London on the day of the Pride parade. We asked the Metropolitan police how many stabbings there were in total that day, but they were not able to confirm this to us.\n\nThere was a Metropolitan police presence at Pride, both in an active policing capacity (as you would expect at a large public event), and within the procession. One of the pictures used in the Facebook post was taken at last year\u2019s event and seems to be of a British Transport Police officer. The other was taken at the 2019 event.\n\nThe Metropolitan police told us: \u201cOfficers taking part in the parade for Pride London on Saturday, 6 July represented the [Metropolitan Police] in full uniform, including personal protection equipment and radios.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs such they could be deployed to deal with any incident, so it is regarded as a tour of duty.\u201d\n\nThe Metropolitan police reported that 150 officers and staff took part in 2017\u2019s London Pride parade.", "lang": "en"}
