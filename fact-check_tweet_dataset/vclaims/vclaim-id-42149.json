The incident occurred on November 21 in Hamilton County, Florida, and the video first emerged on Thursday after the boy\u2019s family retained attorney Foye B. Walker for possible legal action. The incident left the boy, identified only as Tyler, hospitalized with head contusions, according to his mother, a Trump supporter who tweets under the handle @AmericanDiaries. The attorney, Walker, verified in a tweet that the incident occurred on a school bus in Hamilton County, and that he was representing the family. The boy\u2019s mother explained on Twitter that she believed the attackers were motivated by a Trump 2020 campaign hat that her son had previously worn to school. She said that the boy stopped wearing the hat due to harassment, but that the bullying continued. To be clear, my son bought his #Trump2020 hat with his own money at the flea market a few weeks ago. He was proud to wear it. He wore it to School, but due to immediate bullying he put it away & didn't wear it to school again, sadly the damage was already done & was now a target.\n\nHowever, Hamilton County School Superintendent Rex L. Mitchell posted a statement in response declaring that during the course of an investigation, the district found \u201cno evidence\u201d that \u201cthe altercation occurred because one of the students involved was wearing a political hat showing support for President Trump\u201d or \u201cthat [the student\u2019s] wearing of such apparel on a prior occasion motivated the incident.\u201d\n\nAccording to the district\u2019s statement, \u201cThe incident began with a verbal altercation between two students that escalated when additional students became involved\u201d:\n\nOn Thursday, December 12th, a message was posted on Twitter along with a video showing an altercation between students on a Hamilton County School District school bus. The incident shown in this tweet actually occurred on Thursday, November 21st, 22 days ago. Since that time the school district has investigated the incident, taken action against the students involved, and turned the information over to the local Sheriff\u2019s office for criminal action. It is implied in the post that the altercation occurred because one of the students involved was wearing a political hat showing support for President Trump. There was no evidence found during the investigation that indicated the student was wearing any of this apparel at the time of the altercation or that his wearing of such apparel on a prior occasion motivated the incident. The incident began with a verbal altercation between two students that escalated when additional students became involved. In addition to the video that was posted online which was recorded by a student, the school district reviewed the bus video which depicted, not only the altercation, but all events prior to the altercation and its conclusion.\n\nAccording to a statement posted by the Hamilton County Sheriff\u2019s Office, \u201cmisinformation has been passed along with the video.\u201d The sheriff noted that the county has \u201cfiled charges on five juveniles for First Degree misdemeanor battery,\u201d and the State Attorney\u2019s Office has \u201cstated that this incident does not meet criteria for a hate crime\u201d:", "lang": "en"}
