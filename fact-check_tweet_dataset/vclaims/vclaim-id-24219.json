An RTI revealed that Rs 80 lakh is spent on Modi's makeup artist every month.\"Here is the post:On searching Facebook with the same caption, we found that a user \"Alok Tewari\" shared the same video with the exact same caption a month ago. His post has, by now, gotten shared more than 16,000 times and the video has garnered over 3,75,000 views.The video that is being shared widely to make the claim that Modi spends Rs 80 lakh on a makeup artist was taken when a team from Madame Tussauds wax museum met Modi in 2016 to take measurements to make his wax statue.Madam Tassauds wax museum follows a 200-year-old process to create realistic wax figures of celebrities. First step is a sitting with the celebrity during which more than 250 measurements are taken, including the colour of their hair, eyes and skin. A Business Insider report details the process.Here is a video they made on the process of making lifelike wax statues:The process is the same for every celebrity. Here is a video of Anushka Sharma's sitting for artists from Madame Tussauds:There are no news reports on any RTI that revealed how much Modi spends on makeup.Times Fact Check extracted key frames from the video and ran a reverse-image search on Google. The first result is the original video uploaded on YouTube by 'Madame Tussauds London' titled \"Narendra Modi's sitting\".The caption of the video that was uploaded in 2016 reads, \"Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has been involved in the creation of his figure and gave Madame Tussauds renowned artists a sitting at his residence in New Delhi earlier this year.\"Watch the video here:This is the same video that is being shared widely by many social media users with the false claim that Modi spends Rs 80 lakh on makeup artist every month. A photo of one of the artists from Madame Tussauds taking Modi's measurements to make his wax statue was shared by many social media users last year with a similar claim, but then, the amount they claimed Modi spent on makeup artist was Rs 15 lakh.Here's a longer version of Modi's sitting for Madame Tussauds:Since the caption said that an RTI revealed this information, we searched on Google using various keywords to find the RTI in question or any credible news report on it. We could not find any. We found a TOI report about an RTI that revealed that expenses of PM Modi's wardrobe is not borne by the government and an Economic Times report on an RTI that revealed that the Modi government spent over Rs 4,300 crore in publicity, but nothing on how much money is spent on Modi's makeup.Times Fact Check found that the video used to claim that PM Modi spends Rs 80 lakh on makeup artist is actually one taken when a team from Madame Tussauds wax museum met Modi in 2016 to take measurements to make his wax statue.", "lang": "en"}
