The claim recently resurfaced on Facebook, with one such post saying, \u201cLet\u2019s not forget he took his oath of office with his hand on the Quran!\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no truth to the claim. Multiple media reports about Obama\u2019s 2013 inauguration specifically mention that Obama took the oath of office using two Bibles. The book with the red binding in the photo is the Lincoln Bible, which former President Abraham Lincoln used at his inauguration in 1861. The one beneath it in the photo was King\u2019s \u201ctraveling Bible,\u201d per USA Today.\n\nDuring his first inauguration in 2009, Obama also took the oath of office using the Lincoln Bible, according to the Library of Congress.

That precedent appears to have been set by former President George Washington at his first inauguration.\n\nNot all presidents have used the Bible to take the oath of office. Former President John Quincy Adams was sworn in using a book of law, the Washington Post reported.", "lang": "en"}
