Police may take note. Those who see this video should make it viral so that teachers and students may be cautioned- translated).\n\nThe above message accompanies a disturbing video showing a young man being mercilessly beaten up by some youth. The video is 3:16 minutes long.\n\nSeveral individual Facebook users have shared the text and video on their timelines.\n\nThe video has also been posted on Twitter. It is circulating on WhatsApp as well. Alt News was asked by some readers and followers to ascertain the truth of this video.\n\nThe video in question is not from a Kendriya Vidhyalaya school as claimed. It is from a college in Andhra Pradesh. Alt News had fact-checked this video earlier and had found that the incident had occurred at a college in Anantpur.\n\nAccording to a local news publication Sakshi Post, the incident was the fallout of a love affair. The name of the victim is Shivayya, and he would occasionally go to Anantapur Arts College to meet a friend, where he reportedly fell in love with a female student. Upon hearing this, another student of the college, Bharat, allegedly called Shivayya to the campus on June 25 where he along with 25 others pounced on the victim.\n\nIn order to find out more about the incident, Alt News contacted SDPO of Anantpur, P N Babu who said, \u201cThe incident occurred outside the commerce wing of the Anantpur college campus, and we have arrested four people. The incident is not related to the college in any way and neither the aggressor nor the victim is from the college. This incident occurred due to a fight over a love affair.\u201d\n\nETV Andhra Pradesh had published a video report of the incident, in which the police\u2019s statement can be heard (posted below).\n\nIn conclusion, it may be reiterated that the said video is being circulated with a false claim. The incident is not from a Kendriya Vidhyalaya school but from a college in Andhra Pradesh, and was the fallout of personal rivalry over a love affair.", "lang": "en"}
