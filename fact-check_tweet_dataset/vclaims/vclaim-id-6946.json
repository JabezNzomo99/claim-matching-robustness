Eric Swalwell, who represents the San Francisco Bay area.\n\nYou may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization, we depend on \u2014 and answer to \u2014 you.

He wrote about the deadly outcomes of being fired at by such a weapon.\n\n\"Trauma surgeons and coroners will tell you the high-velocity bullet fired from a military-style, semiautomatic assault weapon moves almost three times as fast as a 9mm handgun bullet, delivering far more energy. The bullets create cavities through the victim, wrecking a wider swath of tissue, organs and blood vessels. And a low-recoil weapon with a higher-capacity magazine means more of these deadlier bullets can be fired accurately and quickly without reloading.\"\n\nSwalwell said that reinstating the federal assault weapons ban that was in effect from 1994 to 2004 would prohibit manufacture and sales, but it would still leave millions of assault weapons on the streets.\n\n\"Instead, we should ban possession of military-style semiautomatic assault weapons, we should buy back such weapons from all who choose to abide by the law, and we should criminally prosecute any who choose to defy it by keeping their weapons,\" he wrote. \"The ban would not apply to law enforcement agencies or shooting clubs.\"\n\nThe NaturalNews story said that Swalwell \"actually wants to see door-to-door gun confiscation teams engage in Nazi-style removal tactics in order to rid the streets of all firearms that he personally deems reckless and unnecessary.\"\n\nWe saw no evidence in Swalwell\u2019s op-ed that he wants law enforcement to use such a tactic. We asked his spokeswoman how he would envision law enforcement obtaining such assault weapons.\n\n\"The Congressman supports an assault weapon buy-back period, and then limiting any weapons not sold back to licensed clubs and ranges, with a ban on possession anywhere else,\" Caitlyn McNamee said in an email. \"He has never proposed and does not support door-to-door searches, which would be unworkable, unsafe, and \u2013 without a warrant \u2013 unconstitutional. But anyone found to be in possession of such a weapon after the buyback period has elapsed would be in violation of the law to possess and subject to prosecution.\"\n\nOn his congressional website, Swalwell doesn\u2019t propose any sort of widespread gun confiscation. While calling for more gun control measures, including improving background checks and an assault weapons ban, he has also stated support for the Second Amendment.\n\n\"I am the son and brother of hunters and gun owners,\" he wrote. I know that guns can be used responsibly and the Second Amendment provides individuals certain rights to own firearms.\"\n\nA headline said that \"Democrats go full tyranny: now demand nationwide gun confiscation from law-abiding Americans ... at gunpoint, of course.\" The story that followed wasn\u2019t broadly about Democrats, but rather about one Democrat: U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell. He proposed getting rid of assault weapons, but didn\u2019t call for confiscating all guns. We rate this claim False.", "lang": "en"}
