A spokesperson for the company said the claim is \u201cnot accurate.\u201d\n\nFollowing George Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis police custody in late May, a number of companies announced that they would be making large donations and pledges to organizations dedicated to combating racial inequality, according to Forbes.\n\nA viral Facebook post claims that Bank of America made a large pledge to the Black Lives Matter organization, saying, \u201cBank of America just pledged one billion dollars to BLM. That\u2019s war money ladies and gentleman. It\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nThis, however, is inaccurate. Had Bank of America pledged such a large sum of money to Black Lives Matter, major media outlets would have picked it up, yet none have. Rather, the company on June 2 pledged $1 billion over four years to \u201chelp local communities address economic and racial inequality accelerated by a global pandemic,\u201d focusing on programs \u201cassisting people and communities of color that have experienced a greater impact from the health crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderlying economic and social disparities that exist have accelerated and intensified during the global pandemic,\u201d Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said in a press release. \u201cThe events of the past week have created a sense of true urgency that has arisen across our nation, particularly in view of the racial injustices we have seen in the communities where we work and live. We all need to do more.\u201d\n\nThe funds will support \u201ceconomic mobility and workforce development programs\u201d that Bank of America already supports, with an emphasis on health services during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the press release. Focus areas include health, job training, housing assistance and skill building and retraining.\n\nBill Halldin, a spokesperson for Bank of America, confirmed to the Caller in an email the claim in the Facebook post is \u201cnot accurate.\u201d (RELATED: Do Donations Made Through A Link On The Black Lives Matter Website Go Directly To Democratic Candidates?)\n\nThe claim may have stemmed from a July 16 segment with Lou Dobbs on Fox Business, where he stated that businesses such as Bank of America were giving money to Black Lives Matter. Dobbs later issued a correction both during his broadcast and on Twitter.\n\n\u201cI reported to you that Bank of America, PepsiCo, Walmart, Apple and Comcast were pledging money to Black Lives Matter,\u201d Dobbs said during a broadcast the following day. \u201cThose large amounts of money, in fact, were not for Black Lives Matter but rather they\u2019re pledges by those companies of investments to address economic and racial inequality.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
