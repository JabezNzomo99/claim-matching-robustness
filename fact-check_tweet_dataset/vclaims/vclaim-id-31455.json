In season 11, for example, President Lisa Simpson has inherited a \"budget crunch from President Trump.\"\n\nBut what about the coronavirus? A Feb. 20 Facebook post appears to show stills from a 1993 episode of the show in which both Homer Simpson and Principal Skinner are sick; another image shows a broadcaster reading off a piece of paper while the words \"corona virus\" and a cat appear on a screen behind him.\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nMost of the images are actually from an episode about the \"Osaka flu\" \u2014 a factory employee coughs into a package bound for Homer back in Springfield and he gets sick.\n\nBut the image of the cat behind the broadcaster seems to have been altered from how it originally appeared in an episode about \"housecat flu.\" On the show, the text doesn\u2019t say \"corona virus\" but \"apocalypse meow.\"\n\nEat our shorts: We rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
