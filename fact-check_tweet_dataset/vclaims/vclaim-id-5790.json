This is partly false.\n\nIt is true that people over 75 do now have to pay for a TV licence, unless they are on a low income. Being a migrant, however, does not make a person exempt from paying this fee.\n\nThe post ( here ) makes an apparent reference to the soldiers who fought on the beaches of northern France in World War Two, and migrants who have crossed the English Channel from France.\n\n\u201cFunny that those who fought on the beaches of Northern France , now have to pay for their TV licence, but if you arrive from the beaches of Northern France today you get it free, along with a house to watch it in \u2013 Old People\u2019s Lives Matter,\u201d it reads.\n\nAs of August 1, people aged 75 or over have to start paying the annual fee of 157.50 pounds ($200) for their TV licence, unless they are on low income and receiving Pension Credit ( here ).\n\nThe licence will also remain free for people who live in Accommodation for Residential Care, while those who are registered blind only have to pay half the fee. However, it is not true that a person would be exempt from paying the licence fee based on their immigration status.\n\nA previous Reuters fact check debunked the claim that illegal immigrants - those who have entered the country illegally and do not have the right to stay - are entitled to benefits from the UK\u2019s welfare system (here ).\n\nPartly false. People over 75 do now have to pay for a TV licence, unless they are on a low income. Being a migrant, however, does not make a person exempt from paying this fee.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
