The Taliban is not fighting IS; it is the Afghan security forces that are taking the fight to ISISK, and we are working with our Afghan partners in order to make sure that we continue to keep the pressure on these terrorists groups,\u201d Salvin said.\n\nAccording to the U.S. military, there were roughly 3,000 ISISK members in some 12 districts in southern Nangarhar at the beginning of 2016. During that year, those numbers dropped to around 600 ISISK members in two or three districts in southern Nangarhar.\n\n\u201cTherefore, you can see the success that the Afghan security forces along with U.S. forces, contributing combat enabling support; you can see how we have had success taking the fight to ISISK,\u201d Salvin said.\n\nIn 2006, Russia\u2019s Supreme Court designated the Taliban as a terrorist movement along with 16 other groups and there has been no public announcement that the group has been removed from Russia\u2019s terrorist list. That means the Russian government is cooperating with a group they themselves designated as a terrorist movement.\n\nBrian Williams, a professor at UMASS Dartmouth and - author of the book \u201cCounter Jihad. The American Military Experience in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria,\u201d told Polygraph.info that Kabulov\u2019s comments are \u201cyet another example of Moscow engaging in Soviet-style dezinformatsiya (disinformation).\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reality is that the Taliban shura in Quetta and semi-independent Taliban commanders like the Haqqanis still proclaim they are in a holy war with the internationally recognized democratically elected government of Afghanistan,\u201d said Williams. \u201cThis terroristic jihad has the goal of overthrowing democracy in Afghanistan, enforcing harsh shariah Islamic law, and returning Afghanistan to the medieval time warp it was before the Taliban were overthrown in 2001 by the indigenous Afghan Northern Alliance and just 300 US special operators.\u201d\n\nIn fact, just last December, the Taliban \u2013 or, as it currently calls itself, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan \u2013 released a video in which the group\u2019s leaders rejected peace talks and vowed to wage jihad to the end.\n\nKabulov\u2019s claims that there has been no progress in UN-backed reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan, said Williams, are \u201cpatently absurd and an attempt to create an alternative reality.\u201d\n\nWilliams, who spent several years in Afghanistan, provided Polygraph.info with an eyewitness account of the changes in the country since the overthrow of the Taliban's harsh theocracy.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that millions of refugees have returned to Afghanistan; new roads have been built stretching from Uzbekistan to Pakistan; millions of girls who were banned from school are now getting an education; skyscrapers, beauty shops, DVD stores, malls\u2026 have sprung up in Kabul,\" said Williams. \"Fields across the county have been de-mined of landmines; thousands of wells have been dug. Women are in parliament and even the police force for the first time.\"\n\nWilliams added: \"There have been the first democratic elections in the country's history. Science, history, math, literature are taught in thousands of new schools. There are no more public executions of \u2018sinners\u2019 in Kabul's soccer stadium by the Taliban's moral police. The economy has grown in leaps and bounds. The non-ruling ethnic groups who make up the majority of the country now have a role in the government that was denied them by the ethnic Pashtun Taliban.\u201d\n\n\"To deny all these easily observed facts as the Kremlin is attempting to do is to construct an alternate-reality Potemkin village,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the Russians are not the first to engage with the Taliban in an effort to bring peace in Afghanistan, and there have been such attempts by the United States and other governments, these efforts have never resulted in the Taliban denouncing jihad or the use of terrorism.\n\nThe Taliban continues to use terror as a main strategy in Afghanistan. Explosions, including those conducted by suicide bombers, occur frequently, claiming hundreds of civilian lives, like the bombings that took place in Kabul March 1, killing 23 civilians. The Taliban officially took responsibility for that attack.\n\nMeanwhile, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, U.S. Army General Curtis Scaparrotti, suggested Thursday that Moscow may even be supplying the Taliban.\n\n\"I've seen the influence of Russia of late - increased influence in terms of association and perhaps even supply to the Taliban,\" he told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.", "lang": "en"}
