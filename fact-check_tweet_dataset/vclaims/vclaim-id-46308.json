The Logical Indian received the video on the fact check number. The claim attached to the video says this is an incident from Asalatpura area of Moradabad where a man was opposed and beaten by the people living in his street for putting tricolour, India's pride and dignity, on his house. A strict police action should be taken against those who are these treacherous people and sedition case should be filed against them.\n\nA man was harassed by his neighbours for installing the Indian flag in his house. On following the comments of one such viral post, it was found that a Twitter user had tagged the official account of the UP police.\n\nAccording to the statement, the Indian flag had been installed at that spot for several years now. It continues to be there still.\n\n The statement names a person called Shablu son Abul Kalam, who had originally posted the video. Shablu and his family used to tie their buffalos on the road. Shablu's cousin son Irshad faced issue while crossing the road and there was dispute between the two families with buffalos being kept on road. They also included a video where Abul Kalam himself states that he had put out a false notion because he was angry owing to a personal dispute. He also confesses that he himself had tattered his clothes and not his neighbours. Kalam reiterates that the Indian flag had been there for a while.\n\nA police case has been filed against both the parties for disturbing peace in the area. Therefore, the viral claims are false. The situation in the video occurred due to a personal dispute and has no communal claims.\n\n\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343 Also Read: Fact Check: Social Distancing Goes For A Toss In A Mumbai Bus?", "lang": "en"}
