NATO has been involved in counterterrorism since 1980, and especially since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. As for NATO\u2019s financing, Trump apparently still does not understand how it works. NATO\u2019s guideline, established in 2006, is that defense expenditures should amount to 2 percent of each country\u2019s gross domestic product by 2024. In 2016, only four countries besides the United States met that standard, but NATO documents also show that defense spending has increased about 3 percent from 2015 to 2016. In any case, the money would not be going to the United States or even necessarily to NATO; this is money that countries would spend to bolster their own military.\n\nTrump\u2019s timeline is off. Trump said in March 2016, three months before the June 23 vote on whether Britain should remain part of the European Union, that he thinks \u201cBritain will separate from the EU. I think that maybe it\u2019s time, especially in light of what\u2019s happened with the craziness that is going on with immigration, with people pouring in all over the place I think that Britain will end up separating from the EU.\u201d\n\nHe was less sure about it on June 22, the day before the vote: \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody should listen to me because I haven\u2019t really focused on it very much. \u2026 My inclination would be to get out, because you know, just go it alone. \u2026 I also tell people: \u2018Don\u2019t go with the recommendation, because it\u2019s a recommendation that I would make, but that\u2019s where I stand.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHere, headline, for the front page of the New York Times, \u2018Wiretapped data used in inquiry of Trump aides.\u2019 That\u2019s a headline. Now they then dropped that headline, I never saw this until this morning. They then dropped that headline, and they used another headline without the word wiretap, but they did mean wiretap. Wiretapped data used in inquiry. Then changed after that, they probably didn\u2019t like it. And they changed the title. They took the wiretap word out. \u2026 Front page, January 20th. Now in their second editions, they took it all down under the internet. They took that out. Ok? But that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d\n\nTrump is mixing up different headlines for the print and Internet editions. In print, the headline was: \u201cWiretapped data used in inquiry of Trump aides.\u201d Online, the headline read: \u201cIntercepted Russian Communications Part of Inquiry Into Trump Associates.\u201d The headlines were not changed as part of any stealth editing. In any case, the text of the New York Times article did not support in any way the claims made by Trump about Obama. Moreover, both the FBI director and the head of the National Security Agency say the claim is false.\n\nThis is yet another Four-Pinocchio claim that we have checked over and over. Trump claimed he saw on television thousands of Muslims cheer the collapse of the World Trade Center during the Sept. 11 attacks. There is no TV footage, no newspaper coverage, just scattered, unconfirmed reports of five or six people \u2014 not necessarily Muslim, probably teenagers \u2014 celebrating. There was a small reference buried deep in an article in The Post. When the reporter said it did not support Trump\u2019s claim, Trump mocked his disability.", "lang": "en"}
