Andrew M. Cuomo says women in New York state don\u2019t have to worry about new Trump administration rules ending a federal requirement that employers must include birth control coverage in their health insurance plans.\n\nThe new rules exempt employers from the Obama-era mandate if they have religious or moral reservations to the coverage.\n\nBut Cuomo said contraception will still be covered in New York state.\n\n\"This year, we ensured that whatever happens at the federal level, women in our state will continue to have cost-free access to reproductive health care,\" Cuomo said in a statement.\n\nStates can set certain insurance standards beyond what the federal government requires. New York state told insurance companies in January they are required to cover birth control and abortion services.\n\nThat condition still stands, but is Cuomo right that women in New York state are not affected by Trump\u2019s decision?\n\nState regulations, like the one from January, do not apply to all plans.\n\nThe state Department of Financial Services regulates everything sold on the state health exchange, called New York State of Health. That includes plans sold to individuals and companies with 100 or fewer employees. The agency says the state\u2019s birth control mandate covers 1.35 million residents in those plans.\n\nHealth care offered through companies with more than 100 employees is more complicated.\n\nCompanies that go the traditional route of buying health coverage through an insurance carrier must adhere to the rules. About 2.5 million people in that category are covered by the state\u2019s birth control mandate.\n\nBut companies that are self-insured, where the employer assumes a large part of the costs, are not regulated by the state, meaning they need not adhere to the state's birth control mandate.\n\nAbout 60 percent of private sector workers in the U.S. who get their health coverage through an employer were enrolled in a self-insured plan in 2015. That\u2019s up from 46 percent in 1996, according to research from the Employee Benefit Research Institute.\n\nIn New York state, about 54 percent of private sector employees who get health insurance through their employer had a self-insured plan last year, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.\n\nThe option is most popular for companies with at least 1,000 employees. Eighty percent of private sector employees at companies that size in New York state are enrolled in a self-insured plan.\n\nThe federal government sets the baseline for what services are covered under Medicaid. Government workers are covered under state regulation, but Medicaid and Medicare enrollees are not.States can add to that list.\n\nThe list of services covered by Medicaid in New York state goes well beyond the federal standard. New York is one of multiple states where Medicaid covers birth control and abortion services. About a third of the state\u2019s population alone is on Medicaid.\n\nCuomo said women in New York state \"will continue to have cost-free access to reproductive health care\" because of an action the state took earlier this year.\n\nBut not every woman is in an insurance plan regulated by the state.\n\nIt\u2019s possible a self-insured large employer in New York state could apply for an exemption from the federal birth control mandate. If granted the exemption, the company would not have to provide health coverage for birth control to its employees.\n\nThose exemptions are not expected to be widespread, but they are possible.\n\nCuomo\u2019s statement needs clarification.
