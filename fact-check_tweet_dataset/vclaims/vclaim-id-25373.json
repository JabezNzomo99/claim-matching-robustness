Mueller \u201ccan\u2019t provide evidence that his probe reached a conclusion.\u201d Mueller reached several conclusions, including that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to damage Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump.\n\nThe political world recast its gaze this week on the findings of Robert S. Mueller, the former special counsel who investigated Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMueller testified before two House committees on July 24, largely highlighting the findings in his report \u2014 a redacted version of which was made public by the Department of Justice in April.\n\nThe next day, the young conservatives group called Turning Point USA \u2014 a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump \u2014 shared a misleading claim on Facebook suggesting Mueller didn\u2019t reach any conclusions.\n\n\u201cSpent over two years and $25 million investigating Russia \u2026 can\u2019t provide evidence that his probe reached a conclusion,\u201d reads the meme.\n\nThe Russia probe did last about two years, and it cost $25.2 million as of Sept. 30, 2018, according to the special counsel\u2019s most recent expenditure statements. The final figure is certain to be higher since the probe lasted another six months.\n\nBut Mueller\u2019s 448-page report did reach conclusions, especially in regards to Russia\u2019s interference.\n\nFrom the introduction of the report\u2019s first volume: \u201c[T]he Special Counsel\u2019s investigation established that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election principally through two operations. First, a Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Second, a Russian intelligence service conducted computer-intrusion operations against entities, employees, and volunteers working on the Clinton Campaign and then released stolen documents.\u201d\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s office in February 2018 secured an indictment against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities for their role in that interference. In July of that year, 12 Russian military officers were also indicted.\n\nRegarding Mueller\u2019s inquiry into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russians, the report said that \u201cthe investigation established multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government. Those links included Russia offers of assistance to the Campaign. In some instances, the Campaign was receptive to the offer, while in other instances the Campaign officials shied away.\u201d\n\nIt continued: \u201cUltimately, the investigation did not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.\u201d\n\nWe reached out to Turning Point USA inquiring about the meme\u2019s claim but haven\u2019t yet received a response.\n\nIt may be a reference to the fact that Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether Trump committed obstruction of justice. Mueller\u2019s office explicitly declined to reach a conclusion on that front, instead detailing in the report\u2019s second volume several \u201ckey events\u201d regarding obstruction that were investigated.\n\nInvestigators \u201cfound multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations.\u201d But, the report said, \u201c[b]ecause we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President\u2019s conduct.\u201d\n\nFactoring into the decision to not weigh in on prosecution, according to the report (and as we\u2019ve written before), was an opinion issued by the Office of Legal Counsel that found that a sitting president cannot be indicted.\n\nAttorney General William P. Barr ultimately told Congress that the Justice Department wouldn\u2019t bring charges against Trump. In a March 24 letter, Barr wrote that \u201cthe evidence developed during the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
