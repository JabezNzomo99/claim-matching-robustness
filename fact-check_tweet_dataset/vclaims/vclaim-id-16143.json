Here we\u2019ll look what people mean when they say that the referendum was, or wasn\u2019t, advisory.\n\nThe referendum was not legally binding. There\u2019s no one source that can prove this statement true (although here\u2019s a respectable one). That follows from the fact that the European Union Referendum Act 2015 didn\u2019t say anything about implementing the result of the vote. It just provided that there should be one.\n\nIn other countries, referendums are often legally binding\u2014for example, because the vote is on whether to amend the constitution. The UK, famously, doesn\u2019t have a codified constitution.\n\nA UK referendum will only have the force of law if the Act setting it up says so. In practical terms this would mean someone would be able to go to court to make the government implement the result. The Alternative Vote referendum in 2011, for example, was legally binding in this way.\n\nOtherwise, as the High Court put it on 3 November:\n\nSo, purely as a matter of law, neither the government nor Parliament has to do anything about the referendum.\n\nSome people who oppose Brexit take the argument a step further. We see images like this one on social media, highlighting the non-binding nature of the vote:\n\n\u201cWhich bits of this [briefing] are MPs now acting as if they either did not read or did not understand?\u201d asks the philosopher AC Grayling.\n\nThe arguments aren\u2019t just legal\u2014there are political ones too\n\nThis is where the argument slides from legal into political. Former diplomat Brian Barder says that:\n\n\u201cmembers of parliament owe the electorate their own best judgement of the national interest\u2014taking into account the referendum result\u2014not their obedience to the opinions of a narrow majority in a referendum or otherwise\u201d.\n\nThe argument goes that, the referendum being \u201cadvisory\u201d and Brexit being bad, MPs should refuse to follow the result. Some MPs agree.\n\nBut some people who support leaving the EU say there\u2019s plenty of evidence that the referendum was politically binding. They say that the referendum process sent clear instructions to MPs that they should support the decision made by a majority of voters\u2014even if the formalities don\u2019t require them to.\n\nThey point to the fact that, during one of the debates on the referendum bill on 9 June 2015, the then Foreign Secretary said \u201cdecision about our membership should be taken by the British people, not by Whitehall bureaucrats, certainly not by Brussels Eurocrats; not even by Government Ministers or parliamentarians in this Chamber\u201d.\n\nSimilarly, the government\u2019s leaflet to all households advocating a Remain vote told voters that it would implement the result. This promise, too, does the rounds on social media.\n\nLeaflets are not law, and the High Court has since told the government that it can\u2019t keep this promise without the approval of Parliament. But that doesn\u2019t stop anyone from making the case that MPs delegated the Brexit decision to the voters, and have no right to unmake it now.\n\nIn the end, the argument comes down to different visions for democracy in the United Kingdom. The conventional view is that ultimate political power lies with Parliament. The High Court came to its conclusion that the referendum was not legally binding guided by \u201cbasic constitutional principles of parliamentary sovereignty and representative parliamentary democracy\u201d.\n\nIn a parliamentary democracy, as barrister Rupert Myers bluntly puts it, \u201cthe people are not sovereign\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s why Nigel Farage, for example, accepts that the referendum result was technically advisory only, but says that \u201cI would now wish to see constitutional change to make referendums binding\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
