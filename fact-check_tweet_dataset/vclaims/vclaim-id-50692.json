In 2015, for instance, the website True Activist published the following passage:\n\nSeveral other websites have published similar articles. In September 2019, more than four years after the True Activist article was published, the Yucatan Times wrote that Pepsi had \u201cjust admitted that the water they are using is just tap water.\u201d\n\nWhile these articles are based on a genuine news report, they are also outdated and exaggerated.\n\nThese articles are referring to a 2007 decision by PepsiCo Inc. to amend the label on bottles of Aquafina to clarify that the water came from a \u201cpublic water source.\u201d\n\nPepsiCo Inc. will spell out that its Aquafina bottled water is made with tap water, a concession to the growing environmental and political opposition to the bottled water industry. According to Corporate Accountability International, a U.S. watchdog group, the world\u2019s No. 2 beverage company will include the words \u201cPublic Water Source\u201d on Aquafina labels. \u201cIf this helps clarify the fact that the water originates from public sources, then it\u2019s a reasonable thing to do,\u201d said Michelle Naughton, a Pepsi-Cola North America spokeswoman.\n\nWhile the water used in Aquafina products comes from public water sources, that does not mean it is \u201cjust tap water.\u201d Before this tap water is bottled, it goes through various filtration and purification processes. In other words, Aquafina isn\u2019t simply turning on the faucet and filling up bottles.\n\nThe Aquafina website provides a little insight into how its water is purified:\n\nAquafina originates from public water sources and is then purified through a rigorous purification process. This purification process includes reverse osmosis and other filtering and purification methods. It removes things like chlorides, salts and other substances that can affect a water\u2019s taste. Every bottle of Aquafina is produced at one of our water purification centers. That\u2019s how you know you\u2019re getting pure water and perfect taste consistently every time you open an Aquafina. Anytime, anywhere.\n\nIt should also be noted that it isn\u2019t uncommon for bottled-water companies to use public water sources. Dasani, for instance, the bottled water produced by the Coca-Cola Company, also uses public water sources:\n\nA 2015 article from Mother Jones reported that 45% of bottled water in the United States originates with the municipal water supply. The other 55% comes from spring water:\n\nThe details of where and how bottling companies get their water are often quite murky, but generally speaking, bottled water falls into two categories. The first is \u201cspring water,\u201d or groundwater that\u2019s collected, according to the EPA, \u201cat the point where water flows naturally to the earth\u2019s surface or from a borehole that taps into the underground source.\u201d About 55 percent of bottled water in the United States is spring water, including Crystal Geyser and Arrowhead. The other 45 percent comes from the municipal water supply, meaning that companies, including Aquafina and Dasani, simply treat tap water \u2014 the same stuff that comes out of your faucet at home \u2014 and bottle it up. (Weird, right?)\n\nTo sum up: The water used in many bottled-water products, including Aquafina, comes from a public water source. This water then undergoes various filtration and purification processes before it is bottled and sold.", "lang": "en"}
