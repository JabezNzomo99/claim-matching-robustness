The text in the tweet is as follows \u2013 \u2018I am watching Ertugrul nowadays & I see narendra modi has similar leadership qualities as Ertugrul .His Strong belief in God, his Courage to not give up, His conviction to Stand on his principles even when everyone is against him. @narendramodi #Ertugrul\u2019. Let\u2019s verify if Sambit Patra has made that tweet.\n\nFact: There is no such tweet on the official twitter account of Sambit Patra comparing Narendra Modi with Ertugrul. When the tweet in the screenshot is compared with the formatting of an original tweet on Twitter, many differences can be seen. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nErtugrul was a 13th-century warrior. He is the father of Osman I, the founder of the Ottoman Empire. Ertugrul had established a principality centred at S\u00f6g\u00fct. With S\u00f6g\u00fct as their base, Osman and the Muslim frontier warriors (Ghazis) under his command waged a slow and stubborn conflict against the Byzantines, who sought to defend their territories in the hinterland of the Asiatic shore opposite Constantinople (now Istanbul).\n\nWhen we performed Twitter Advanced Search on the official Twitter account of Sambit Patra using keywords from the screenshot, no relevant result was obtained in the search process. But, when we compared the tweet in the screenshot with an actual tweet made by Sambit Patra on Twitter, many differences were found.\n\n1. \u2018Following\u2019 button is misplaced:\n\nIn a normal tweet, \u2018following\u2019 button will be shown on the right side of a tweet, below the heading \u2018relevant people\u2019. But, the tweet in the screenshot has the \u2018following\u2019 button inside the tweet.\n\n2. Differences in the timestamp portion of the tweet:\n\nIn a normal tweet, between \u2018time\u2019 and \u2018date\u2019, there will be a \u2018dot symbol (.)\u2019. But the tweet in the screenshot has \u2018hyphen symbol (-)\u2019 between \u2018time\u2019 and \u2018date\u2019.\n\n3. Tweet in the screenshot doesn\u2019t have information about the device used to post the tweet: \n\nFor every tweet on Twitter, information about the device used to post the tweet (like \u2018Twitter for iPhone\u2019, \u2018Twitter for Android\u2019 etc.,) is mentioned. But, the tweet in the screenshot does not have that information.\n\nTo sum it up, a tweet of Sambit Patra comparing Prime minister Narendra Modi with Ertugrul is photoshopped and is fake.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
