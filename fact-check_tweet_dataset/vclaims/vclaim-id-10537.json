Provisional data suggests that the increase in deaths from 2014 to 2015 was the largest annual rise since 1968. There were thought to be around 528,000 deaths last year in England and Wales, an increase of 5% from the 501,000 deaths in 2014.\n\nThe rate of death\u2014the number of deaths per 1,000 population\u2014is also thought to be up. This doesn\u2019t account for changes in the age profile of the population\u2014you\u2019d expect more deaths in a population that\u2019s getting older.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics told us that the flu is behind the higher number of deaths in 2015. Over the longer term mortality rates have been falling.\n\nThe figures for the numbers of deaths come from official provisional data, though in the past few years the final figures haven\u2019t been very different. For example, the monthly provisional data for 2014 suggested there were 500,122 deaths in England and Wales, while the final data reported there were 501,424 deaths.\n\nSo the actual rise in deaths from 2014 to 2015 may be a little higher when the revised figures for 2015 are released.\n\nOver the longer-term, the number of people dying each year has been falling.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to look at the rate of mortality, which accounts for the size of the population. These figures haven\u2019t been released for 2015 yet, but the Health Service Journal (HSJ) put together estimates for 2015 using separate population projections.\n\nThis suggests that there were around 9.1 deaths for every 1,000 people in 2015, an increase of 5% from the rate of 8.7 for every 1,000 in 2014.\n\nBut this still doesn\u2019t account for how the numbers in each different age group and the numbers of each gender have changed. For example, if a larger number of older people have returned to England from other countries in one year.\n\nWe need to use the \u201cage-standardised\u201d mortality rates to find this out. They haven\u2019t been published for 2015 yet, but the trend over the longer-term has shown a decline in the mortality rate.\n\nPublic Health England said last week that life expectancy at older ages in England had risen to its highest level on record in 2014.\n\nThere are localised factors at play here. It said that life expectancy varies quite a lot depending on where you live.\n\nFlu accounted for the higher number of deaths\n\nThe Telegraph said the rise could be due to a \u201ccrisis in care of the elderly\u201d, citing experts who referred to cuts to social services.\n\nAccording to official statisticians, the reason for the rise was people catching the flu, which led to a higher number of deaths in the first three months of 2015. There could be multiple reasons for this.\n\nDeaths among the elderly can show more short-term variation than deaths for younger people, due to factors such as extreme weather and bouts of flu, according to Public Health England.\n\nWe added 'in 2014' to make it clear that Public Health England's life expectancy analysis also only goes up to 2014.", "lang": "en"}
