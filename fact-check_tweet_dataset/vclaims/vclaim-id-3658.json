That includes timber and energy, the bureau told us.\n\nTrump made his remarks during a March 14 fundraising speech for Republican U.S. Senate candidate Josh Hawley in Missouri. At the event, Trump talked about the need to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and regaled GOP donors with a conversation he said he had with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nAs he tells it, Trump and Trudeau had a disagreement about the trade balance between the two countries. The president admitted that he didn\u2019t know the facts when he told Trudeau that the U.S. has a trade deficit with Canada \u2014 an admission that has gotten a fair amount of news coverage.\n\nHere is a transcript published by the Washington Post, which obtained an audio of the president\u2019s remarks:\n\nTrump, March 14: Trudeau came to see me, he\u2019s a good guy, Justin. He said, \u201cNo, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please.\u201d Nice guy, good-looking, comes in \u2014 \u201cDonald, we have no trade deficit\u201d \u2014 he was very proud, because everybody else you know were getting killed with our, so he\u2019s [unintelligible]. I said, \u201cWrong, Justin, you do.\u201d I didn\u2019t even know. Josh [Hawley], I had no idea. I just said, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d You know why? Because we\u2019re so stupid. [Unintelligible, laughter] And I thought they were smart. I said, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong, Justin.\u201d He said, \u201cNope, we have no trade deficit.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, in that case, I feel differently,\u201d I said, but I don\u2019t believe it. I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, \u201cCheck, because I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d \u201cWell sir you\u2019re actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn\u2019t include energy and timber. But when you do we lose $17 billion a year.\u201d It\u2019s incredible.\n\nThat\u2019s not accurate. The Census Bureau, which is within the U.S. Department of Commerce, said its trade figures do include timber and energy and referred us to two publications that show that the agency does include timber and energy for imports and exports:\n\u2022 Schedule B: Statistical Classification of Domestic and Foreign Commodities Exported from the United States. This book provides numerical codes for each commodity that is exported from the U.S. Section V of the book lists \u201cmineral products,\u201d which includes liquefied natural gas, petroleum and other mineral fuels. Section IX lists \u201cwood and articles of wood,\u201d including \u201clogs and timber.\u201d\n\u2022 Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. This is used by companies that import products to the U.S. It contains the same products and numerical codes, including mineral fuels and timber, but also provides duty rates.\n\nCanada also includes timber and energy in its trade data, as shown in that country\u2019s database of imports and exports between Canada and the United States.\n\nThe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said that mineral fuels were Canada\u2019s second largest export to the United States in 2016 at $54 billion.\n\nWe asked the White House what evidence the president had that the trade balance figures do not include timber and energy. We were referred to a tweet from White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders that she posted after her March 15 press briefing.\n\nBut that tweet addressed only U.S. trade in goods \u2014 not goods and services \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t at all address the president\u2019s false claim that the trade figures do not include timber and energy.\n\nAs we wrote earlier this month, Census Bureau figures show that the U.S. buys more in goods from Canada than it sends there, but it more than makes up for that deficit with an even bigger surplus in sales of services \u2014 chiefly travel, transportation and intellectual property (such as movies and software). On balance, the U.S. had a nearly $2.8 billion surplus in goods and services.\n\nThe president has a tendency to focus just on goods and ignore services when talking about trade deficits, as we have noted before. But the U.S. hasn\u2019t had a total trade deficit with Canada since 2014.\n\nAnd, while Trump attributes the trade deficit in goods to NAFTA, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in a 2017 report that it \u201cmay also be attributed to other economic factors, such as energy prices.\u201d\n\nWe should note that Canada reported that it had a $26.8 billion surplus in goods and services with the U.S. in 2017. That would be about $19.8 billion in U.S. dollars based on the 2017 annual exchange rate of $1.350 Canadian dollar to $1 U.S. dollar.\n\nWe asked the Census Bureau about this discrepancy between the two countries\u2019 data, and we were told that it is common to have differences because of the methodologies used by different countries.\n\nOne factor, we were told, is re-exports \u2014 which are products that Canada ships to the U.S. that originate in another country. Canada would know the origin of the product, but the U.S. may not \u2014 so re-exports are booked differently by each country. The same would go for re-exports from the U.S. to Canada.\n\nEither way, the trade imbalance with Canada \u2014 whether a $2.8 billion surplus or a $19.8 billion deficit \u2014 is relatively small compared with the total trade of $680.6 billion in goods and services last year between the two countries.", "lang": "en"}
