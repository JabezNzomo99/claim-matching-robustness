Mr Corbyn gives a fair account of its findings.\n\nThere\u2019s no single estimate of all people using food banks in the UK. Labour told us that Mr Corbyn\u2019s figures come from the Trussell Trust, a charity which gave out 1.1 million food packs last year. It was 40,000 in 2009/10.\n\nThe Trust\u2019s figures count the number of emergency food packs, not the number of people. It says that on average people need two packs per year, so the number of individual people using its services is likely around 550,000.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to compare these numbers over time because the number of food banks has also increased. More people have access to a food bank now than in 2010, so these figures alone can\u2019t tell us about demand.\n\nThe Trust says that the number of people they helped last year grew faster than the number of new food banks.\n\nTrussell Trust food banks account for around half of all food banks in the UK, according to a 2014 estimate. So their figures can\u2019t tell us how many people are receiving emergency food in total, but a million individuals is plausible if half of food banks served half a million people.", "lang": "en"}
