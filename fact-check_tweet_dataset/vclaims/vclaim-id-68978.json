(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe campaign contribution rests on Eastwood\u2019s imminent demise. That too is false.\n\nNot only is there no mention of it in any remotely reliable news source (we checked on the Lexis-Nexis news database), but Eastwood just started a new film that he will both direct and act in called Mule.\n\nShooting begins in the second half of July in Las Cruces, N.M. If Eastwood\u2019s health were precarious, a bolt of cash to the local economy would be at risk. The editors of the Las Cruces Sun News see no clouds on the horizon.\n\n\"We hope that as many local workers and businesses as possible apply for these jobs and services, allowing us to get the maximum economic impact from the production,\" they wrote July 13.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that Eastwood is ailing and he would be legally barred from donating millions to the Trump campaign.\n\nLights, camera, no action!
