It wasn\u2019t attributed to him until nearly 150 years after his death.\n\nJefferson\u2019s estate at Monticello debunked the quote in 2011, calling it a \u201cspurious quotation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not clear where the phrase originated from,\u201d writes Elizabeth Huff of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, \u201cbut there is no proof that Jefferson ever uttered these words.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the saying appears nowhere in the Papers of Thomas Jefferson. Searching collections of the third president\u2019s writings at the Library of Congress and the Massachusetts Historical Society also turned up no matches.\n\nAccording to etymologist Barry Popik, the first known appearance of the expression dates back to 1891. It wasn\u2019t attributed to Jefferson until 1973, nearly 150 years after the third president\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cIt is almost always attributed to him when quoted \u2014 usually in the context of homemaking or education,\u201d notes Huff.", "lang": "en"}
