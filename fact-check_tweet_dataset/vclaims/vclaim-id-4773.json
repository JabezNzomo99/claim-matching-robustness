We had wanted to lower the cabin windows to improve visibility; and even though such designs were already on the market, and even though there had been a horri\ufb01c spate of deaths, mainly of female cyclists, we were told that we had to wait for the EU to legislate on the matter\u2026 If a country cannot pass a law to save the lives of female cyclists - when that proposal is supported at every level of UK government - then I don't see how that country can truly be called independent.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson has made a variation of this claim\u2014most recently made in his letter resigning as Foreign Secretary\u2014several times in the past. It's correct that laws on lorry design standards are set at EU level.\n\nHowever, the EU did vote to amend its law on the matter in 2014, widening lorry design specifications to increase driver visibility and reduce the chance of serious injury in a low-speed collision. In the months prior to that vote, Mr Johnson criticised the British government for being opposed to the EU\u2019s reforms (it eventually voted in favour, as did all EU member states).\n\nThe new design is optional, not mandatory, and new-design lorries won\u2019t be allowed on the road until 2019 or 2020.\n\nThe EU legislated on lorry design in 2015\n\nEU rules on the maximum dimensions of lorries were set out in a directive from 1996. As an EU member, the UK has to follow this directive. It is the reason why today\u2019s lorries are \u201cbrick-shaped\u201d, according to the European Commission.\n\nIn 2014, the European Parliament voted to support an amendment to the directive, which allows lorries to exceed the legal dimensions if it makes them greener and safer. This change was first proposed in April 2013, the same year that Mr Johnson says he first wanted a change of law.\n\nThese rules became a new law, or \u201cdirective\u201d in 2015. The new rules allow manufacturers to produce lorry cabs that have a more rounded shape, which improves visibility for the driver and reduces the risk of serious injury in the event of a low-speed collision. The directive also aims to improve the environmental performance of lorries. These rules are not mandatory\u2014older lorry designs will still be allowed on the road.\n\nThe European Commission told us that the new-design trucks will appear on European roads as of 2020, and that the Commission has proposed to bring that date forward to 2019.\n\nIt was widely reported in 2014 and 2015 that the delay in the trucks being allowed on the road was as a result of a compromise agreement with the French and Swedish governments. France and Sweden were pushing for the implementation of the law to be delayed by ten years, in order to protect their domestic lorry manufacturers.\n\nThe UK government reportedly opposed these reforms to begin with\n\nWhen the amendments were being debated in January 2014, Mr Johnson was quoted as saying they could \u201csave literally hundreds of lives across the EU in years to come\u201d.\n\nAt the same time, he expressed concern that the UK government was not supportive of the EU amendments. \u201cI am deeply concerned at the position of the British government and urge them to embrace this vital issue.\u201d The government was quoted in response as confirming that it was not supporting the European Parliament\u2019s proposals at the time.\n\nThis runs counter to Mr Johnson\u2019s suggestion that that a proposal to change the law on lorry design was \u201csupported at every level of UK government\u201d while they \u201chad to wait for the EU to legislate\u201d. It appears that the government initially opposed the EU\u2019s attempt to legislate on the issue, only to later vote in favour of it.", "lang": "en"}
