It\u2019s not a challenge to the current approach, as judges can already ask women to remove veils.\n\nPrevious reports about this issue haven\u2019t been so accurate. The Times says (\u00a3) that these are Lord Neuberger\u2019s \u201cfirst comments\u201d on the subject\u2014but you\u2019ll find stories from last year about how the same judge supports women appearing in court under a veil.\n\nAs we pointed out at the time, Lord Neuberger didn\u2019t say that, and denied that he had. The speech that generated the headlines called for:\n\n\u201cunderstanding as to how people from different cultural, social, religious or other backgrounds think and behave and how they expect others to behave. Well known examples include... how some women find it inappropriate to appear in public with their face uncovered.\"\n\nThis didn\u2019t tell us what the President thought about whether veils should be allowed. Now we do know what he thinks:\n\n\u201cI can see serious difficulties with the idea that a witness should have her head covered where evidence is contested. If there is any question of credibility, it should be uncovered.\n\n\u201cThe jury system works in this country by contested evidence being decided by witnesses giving evidence before a jury and having credibility weighed\u2014and one factor taken into account is the impression the witness makes and that includes being able to see the witness\u2019s face.\u201d\n\nWe checked with the Supreme Court, which confirmed that Lord Neuberger made his comments in the course of an interview with the Times\u2019s legal editor.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t suggest that veils should be banned in court altogether. None of this affects people who want to watch a trial\u2014whether involved in it or not\u2014while wearing a veil. The issue is only when the focus of the judge or jury is on a veiled witness.\n\nLord Neuberger also backed the current \u201ccase-by-case system\u201d for deciding on veils, saying that guidance for judges that was promised in 2013 doesn\u2019t seem necessary. Judges have said in the past that they\u2019ll order veils to be removed if they have to.", "lang": "en"}
