The question is why havent the Islamic terrorists been arrested yet? (translation)\u201d tweeted a social media user, Ashutosh Snehsagar on September 21, 2018.\n\nAlong with the message, he has tweeted a video of a boy bleeding profusely. The video was originally posted by Breaking Tube, a twitter handle.\n\nAnother Twitter user Pooja Singh shared an article by Breaking Tube which said, \u201cVishal Ojha, a class 6th student\u2019s throat was slit by a pissful during #Muharram celebration in Deoria. His condition is critical now. By slitting the throats of Kafirs these people celebrate their festivals. Still festivals of Hindus are dangerous.\u201d Several other individual user have also tweeted the claim that the boy was hurt by sword (1,2,3,4).\n\nThe article published by Breaking Tube which we found to be the source of this claim interestingly contains a contradictory police statement saying, \u201c\u2026On this matter, police said that Vishal was injured by a tubelight explosion.\u201d\n\nDainik Bharat, a fake news website also wrote an article with a communal narrative.\n\nIn a statement given to Alt News, Circle Officer Varun Mishra of Deoria Police clarified, \u201cAmar Ujala has misreported. We had also tweeted the details about the incident. His principal who was also present at the spot said he was injured in a tubelight explosion. It was unintentional and an accident.\u201d When Alt News spoke to District Magistrate Amit Kishore, he also corroborated that the boy was injured in a tubelight explosion.\n\nDeoria police has tweeted on September 21 that the boy seen in the video, Vishal Ojha had been injured after tubelight shards had slit his throat during a Muharram procession.\n\nThe video posted below is illustrative, and shows young men playing with tubelights and shattering them on each other.\n\nAn article by AmarUjala with regard to the same incident was published with a misleading headline on September 21, 2018.\n\nIt stated, \u201cAt around 6:30 in the evening during a swordplay, a sword wielded by a young man slashed vishal\u2019s throat, who was standing across the street. -translated\u201d. Incidentally, Amar Ujala in its article did not report the statement by Deoria police.\n\nPatrika also reported that his throat was slit by a sword with a conflicting statement from the DM.\n\nThe reportage of Eenadu India also stated the same claim based on the accounts of local residents with a differing police statement.\n\nNews18 was also among those who misreported that the boy\u2019s throat was slit by a sword.\n\nSocial media users often endorse, wittingly or otherwise, hateful narratives woven around incidents which are sometimes exacerbated through misreporting by media organisations. An accident was sought to be communalised through a dubious portal like Breaking Tube and subsequently by certain users. Such attempts to vitiate inter-communal harmony are observed on social media time and again.", "lang": "en"}
