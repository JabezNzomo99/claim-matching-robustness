When a country becomes a NATO member, it is very hard for it to resist pressure from a big country \u2026 like the United States.\u201d\n\n \n\n That excerpt from Stone\u2019s interviews with the Russian leader was cited by the Russian website Lenta.ru in a June 3 report.\n\n \n\n Experts and officials from NATO, Germany and the United States told Polygraph.info that NATO is a consensus-based organization, in which every member, regardless of its size, has an equal say in decision-making. They also said NATO\u2019s political unity makes it the most successful alliance in history. \n\n \n\n From the time it was created in 1949, NATO has been based on the principle that consensus would be the sole basis for its decision-making. The alliance also draws power from the fact that membership in the organization is the free choice of sovereign nations. \n\n \n\n \u201cNATO is an Alliance based on common values and common interests. NATO Members decide freely to join the Alliance and participate in its actions,\u201d Germany\u2019s Ambassador to the United States Peter Wittig told Polygraph.info by email. \u201cBound by the mutual security guarantees, Allies understand that the strength of the Alliance is more than the sum of the individual strengths of its Member States. This bundling of military and political power has proven to be our main asset throughout the last decades.\u201d\n\n \n\n The United States is the largest country in the alliance, and currently accounts for about 72 percent of NATO\u2019s total defense expenditures. NATO members agree that \u201cthere is an over-reliance by the Alliance as a whole on the United States.\u201d \n\n \n\n However, the size of the American contribution to NATO\u2019s defense spending does not limit the rights of smaller members. \n\n \n\n \u201cThe United States is big \u2013 and so it contributes a lot and gets a lot of respect and authority \u2013 but that does not change the fundamental rule that every country gets an equal vote,\u201d wrote Kurt Volker, former U.S. Ambassador to NATO and current executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership, in an email to Polygraph.info. \n\n \n\n NATO decisions require unanimous consent. \u201cEvery country has to agree \u2013 even one dissenting voice means that NATO does not move an inch,\u201d said Volker. However, he added: \u201cNATO members are also realistic. If one country sends a substantial number of soldiers or money into an operation, other allies will naturally defer a bit to the views of that country.\u201d \n\n \n\n German Ambassador Wittig agrees. Even if one country leads a particular operation, he said, every NATO member has \u201cveto power.\u201d But he noted that since the decisions are made by consensus, a veto \u201cis only used very restrictively.\u201d \n\n \n\n The Kremlin has repeatedly claimed that NATO threatens Russia. The 2010 Russian Military Doctrine identified NATO enlargement as the number one threat to Russia\u2019s national security. \n\n \n\n Yet, since World War II, Russia is the only country that has unilaterally changed borders in Europe by military force. In 2008, Russia invaded Georgia and, after re-positioning its troops in the breakaway Georgian republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, it recognized these territories as independent states. In 2014, Russia used military force to annex Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula and to this day continues to support separatists in eastern Ukraine. \n\n \n\n \u201cToday, Europe and North America need one another as much as ever and our transatlantic bond is as essential as ever in keeping our nations safe,\u201d a NATO official told Polygraph.info via email. This is why NATO leaders agreed to continue a \u201cdual track approach\u201d toward Russia, consisting of \u201cmeaningful dialogue combined with strong defense and deterrence.\u201d \n\n \n\n \u201cAllies do not and will not recognize Russia's illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea,\u201d the NATO official wrote. \u201cAnd in direct response to Russia's actions, NATO has enhanced its presence in the eastern part of our Alliance. Not to provoke conflict, but to prevent conflict and preserve peace.\u201d\n\n \n\n Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty signed by all members of NATO says that an armed attack against one shall be considered an attack against them all.\n\n \n\n This is what makes NATO \u201cone of the most successful alliances in history,\u201d said German Ambassador Wittig. \u201cThe fact that now 29 allies come together to address collective defense and other common security policy challenges is an asset for each and every ally. We all value the strategic importance and long-term orientation of the alliance \u2013 with regard to current and future challenges.\u201d\n\n \n\n Volker also believes that NATO\u2019s greatest strength is its unity based on shared values and interests.\n\n \n\n \u201cThat is why Vladimir Putin spends so much effort trying to drive wedges between NATO countries,\u201d Volker said. \u201cA NATO that is divided is much weaker, and much more susceptible to Russian \u2018incentives\u2019 and \u2018punishments\u2019 than a NATO that is united.\u201d \n\n \n\n He added that \u201cwhen all NATO allies decide and act together, no-one in the world can seriously challenge that.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
