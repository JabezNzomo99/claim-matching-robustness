No, that's not true: The claim that the raid happened at 3:30 pm EST on October 26, 2019, when reporters saw the president leaving his Trump National Golf Club is wrong. It began after 5 p.m. EST, when President Trump was in the White House. The person who initially tweeted the claim has since deleted the tweet and acknowledged it was inaccurate. There is no supporting evidence to the claim that a photo showing Trump, Vice President Pence, and his military advisers in the Situation Room was \"clearly staged\" to cover up Trump's absence.\n\nThe claim originated in a tweet that has since been retracted, but a screenshot of the deleted tweet was turned into a meme (archived here) where it was posted on October 27, 2019. The orginal tweet read:\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nLead Stories rated this claim as false because while it is confirmed that President Trump was playing golf until 3:30 p.m. EST, the raid did not happen until after 5 p.m. EST, when the president was back at the White House. This is how Reuters reported it in an article titled \"Timeline: Anatomy of a raid - how the United States took out Baghdadi\":\n\nOn Saturday, Trump arrived back at the White House at around 4:30 p.m. local time (10:30pm in Syria) after a round of golf in Virginia, according to his official schedule. At around 5 pm, he gathered in the White House Situation Room with Vice President Mike Pence, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, national security adviser Robert O'Brien, and other intelligence officials. They watched the raid unfold live \"as if you were watching a movie,\" said Trump.\n\nThe person who initially tweeted that it happened at 3:30 p.m. EST deleted her tweet the next day and posted this tweet to explain:\n\nThe claim that Trump staged a situation room photo to cover up his absence has previously been debunked by Politifact.com in an article titled \"No evidence photo of Trump watching Baghdadi raid was staged.\"", "lang": "en"}
