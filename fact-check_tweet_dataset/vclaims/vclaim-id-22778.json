The images are old and unrelated to the claim. While two of the images are from an incident in Kanpur, the third image is from Gauhati. The first two images from Kanpur are when enraged protesters had attacked cops in 2017 after a patient was allegedly raped in a hospital. The third image is from Guwahati when hill settlers rose in a protest against eviction in 2011. You can access the archived version of the post here.", "lang": "en"}
