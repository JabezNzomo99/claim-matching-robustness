It goes by three names: Nasiriye Mosque, Hz Suleyman Mosque and Citadel Mosque. Next to the mosque, lay the remains of 27 Companions (of the Prophet), including Suleyman Ibn-i Halid, who were killed in this area during the conquest of Diyarbakir, and the remains of 13 Companions who were killed elsewhere in Sur. The conquest of Diyarbakir started during Umar's times from the area where the mosque now stands.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Evliyalar.net article:\n\nThe Turkish text on the photo translates to English as: \u201cHis Majesty Suleyman Ibn Halid (may Allah be pleased with him).\u201d\n\nThe metal plate on the photo reads: \u201cHis Majesty Suleyman Ibn-i Halid\n\n (May Allah be pleased with him \n\n Year of death: 639.\u201d\n\nHz Suleyman Mosque, or Hazrat Suleiman Mosque, is located in the Turkish town of Diyarbakir.\n\nThe image in the misleading post has been flipped.
