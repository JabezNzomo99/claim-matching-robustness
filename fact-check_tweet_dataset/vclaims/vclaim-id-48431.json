The decision suddenly reversed a policy in which American forces have been supporting Kurdish allies in a fight against Islamic State (ISIS) terrorists.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision precipitated a deadly invasion by Turkey days later and prompted accusations that the U.S. president betrayed America\u2019s Kurdish allies by \u201cgreen lighting\u201d the attack. But Trump pushed back, citing a letter he sent dated Oct. 9, 2019, to Erdogan urging him, \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool!\u201d in regards to military action.\n\nDuring an Oct. 16 press conference held at the White House, Trump referenced the letter and offered to make it public while responding to a reporter\u2019s question about whether he had given Erdogan the \u201cgreen light to invade\u201d by pulling U.S. forces out.\n\nHe did not give Turkey the green light, Trump responded. \u201cAnd if anybody saw the letter, which can be released very easily if you\u2019d like, I can certainly release it. But I wrote a letter right after that conversation [with Erdogan], a very powerful letter. There was never given a green light.\u201d\n\nThat letter was obtained by Trish Regan, host of the Fox Business show \u201cTrish Regan Primetime,\u201d who posted it on Twitter.\n\n\n\n After the letter was made public, many cited its informal tone and questioned whether it was real. (For example, CNN reporter Jake Tapper stated, \u201cI saw this letter and I thought it was a joke, I thought it was a hoax.\u201d) We reached out to the White House to confirm the letter\u2019s authenticity but received no response by the time of publication. However, the White House did confirm the veracity of the letter to several other media outlets.\n\nTurkish sources also confirmed the letter had been sent and received and indicated that Erdogan found it so insulting that he decided to promptly launch the invasion: London-based news outlet Middle East Eye quoted a Turkish official who said the letter from Trump essentially had the opposite effect Trump was seeking:\n\n\u201cWe just dumped his letter into the trash,\u201d one of them said. \u201cThe date on the letter is 9 October, the same day we began Operation Peace Spring. Our president gave the best response by launching the operation on the same day at 4pm,\u201d the official told MEE.\n\nThe BBC also spoke with Turkish officials who stated that Erdogan received the letter, threw it in the trash, and then launched the offensive against the Kurds, reporting, \u201cIn response, Turkish presidential sources told BBC Turkish: \u2018President Erdogan received the letter, thoroughly rejected it and put it in the bin.'\u201d\n\nAn analysis by BBC Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen noted, \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s mixture of threats and locker-room banter infuriated Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. His staff told the BBC that he threw the letter into the bin and launched the Syrian operation the same day. That could be proof there was no Trumpian green light.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, on Oct. 17, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu announced that they had reached an agreement for Turkey to pause in aggression in northern Syria in order to allow Kurdish forces to withdraw.\n\nLate night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel spoofed Trump\u2019s letter to Erdogan by reimagining it as a 1962 letter from President John Kennedy to Soviet premier Nikita Khruschev sent during the Cuban Missile Crisis. That spoof letter was subsequently tweeted by Hillary Clinton:", "lang": "en"}
