This post was shared on 7 July 2020 and has been shared over 50,000 times.\n\nThe person who posted it is not the original person who was being contacted by the elderly lady, whose name is Ethel. Another Facebook post, which contains exactly the same text, was shared several months before, on 28 March. (That post has just over 40,000 shares.)\n\n\u201cReally really ridiculously long shot this, but I\u2019m going to try anyway!! I keep getting phoned on my mobile by a lovely elderly lady called Ethel who lives in the Doncaster area (01302 code). She\u2019s trying to get in touch with her niece who\u2019s called Daphne and lives in Scotland.\u201d\n\nAccording to a comment from the original poster, under this earlier March post, Ethel called the woman again, and was \u201cok, didn\u2019t sound distressed, just a little confused.\u201d\n\nThe poster got the full name of the niece, looked her up on Facebook, and has sent her a message.\n\nSo while there\u2019s no reason to doubt that the original story happened, it took place months ago, and the niece in question has already been identified.", "lang": "en"}
