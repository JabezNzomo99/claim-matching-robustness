So I don't see Pakistan as a suitable negotiator regarding Kashmir. I don't think they have the right to speak. I believe it's Hinduland, that's very controversial, many will say no, they have the right to their opinion. My position is Kashmir is Hinduland, and I say this in front of everyone. I'm not just saying this because I'm in India, this has been my opinion for five years, even when I was an extremist this was my opinion, So nobody can say that I'm being paid by Modi.\"\n\nThe video is viral on Facebook and WhatsApp with many users sharing it with the same caption.\n\nThe person claimed to be a Saudi prince is actually Imam Mohamad Tawhidi, a Shia Muslim cleric.\n\nTawhidi, popularly known as the 'Imam of Peace' is an Australian based cleric, known for speaking against radical Islamic ideology.
