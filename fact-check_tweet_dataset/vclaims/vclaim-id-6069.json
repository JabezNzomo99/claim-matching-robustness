The post presumably refers to House Minority Leader, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, but Keith Olbermann is a political commentator, not a congressman. Also, bills originating in the House of Representatives are identified as \"H.R.\" not \"H.B.\" No such H.B. 2169-B bill has been introduced.\n\nA House bill bearing the numbers 2169 was introduced in April 2017 by Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., but it has nothing to do with removing the U.S. citizenship requirement to become U.S. president. That bill introduced by a Republican lawmaker seeks to improve information sharing among local and federal entities.\n\nThe fake news post claims Pelosi issued a statement saying her bill would allow someone to run for president if they have lived in the United States for two years.\n\n\"Asked if this would allow a foreign power to effectively take over the country or encourage terrorism, Pelosi explained that it would not because \u2018the embrace of the American people would be enough to ensure that the person does their very best,\u2019 \" said Americannews88.com\u2019s post.\n\nThe website quotes \"Rep.Olbermann\" making the argument that if people from other countries come to the United States to run corporations, \"\u2018Why can\u2019t we do that with the government? We can\u2019t do worse than Trump\u2019.\"\n\nAmericannews88.com does not have any identifying information noting who\u2019s behind it, its purpose or mission. Its Sept. 18 post also appears on TheLastLineofDefense.org, a website that says everything on it \"is a satirical work of fiction.\"\n\nAmericannews88.com\u2019s post about House Democrats introducing a bill to remove the U.S. citizenship requirement to become U.S. president is fake news. We rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
