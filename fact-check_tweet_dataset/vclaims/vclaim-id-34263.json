Kernion\u2019s Twitter account is no longer available, but many of the key tweets in question were archived and can be viewed here.\n\n\u201cThe need for affordable rural healthcare\u201d = \u201cThe need for people who decide to live in rural America to be subsidized by those who choose a more efficient way of life.\u201d Rural healthcare should be expensive! And that expense should be borne by those who choose rural America! Same goes for rural broadband. And gas taxes. It should be uncomfortable to live in rural America. It should be uncomfortable to not move. None of the replies I\u2019m getting even *try* to address the central point I\u2019m making: that we shouldn\u2019t make rural life *artificially* cheaper. That\u2019s how you know I\u2019m right.\n\nWhen another user responded to Kernion with a point about health care in rural America, Kernion replied: \u201cI\u2019m generally in favor of crushing rural America through market mechanisms \u2026\u201d\n\nAnother user asked ironically, \u201cIs this your campaign slogan?\u201d Kernion responded by declaring:\n\n\u201cI unironically embrace the bashing of rural Americans. They, as a group, are bad people who have made bad life decisions. Some, I assume, are good people. But this nostalgia for some imagined pastoral way of life is stupid and we should shame people who aren\u2019t pro-city.\u201d\n\nKernion certainly made the remarks attributed to him in various subsequent news reports. Although those news reports typically did not provide the full context of his Twitter thread and exchanges with other users, the reports did not substantively distort the meaning or sense of what Kernion wrote.\n\nThere was arguably a hint of irony to his remarks. For example, he wrote (of rural Americans) \u201csome, I assume, are good people\u201d \u2014 an apparent nod to Donald Trump\u2019s infamous description of Mexican people at his 2015 presidential campaign launch.\n\nIn a later tweet, Kernion reflected on the heavy backlash against his comments, writing \u201cwhat I thought would read as cheeky hyperbole did *not* read as such \u2026\u201d which suggests there may have been an element of humorous exaggeration behind what he wrote about rural Americans.\n\nHowever, these factors are counterbalanced by the obvious fact that Kernion stipulated \u201cI unironically embrace the bashing of rural Americans,\u201d and that he later articulated a measure of earnest contrition, writing, \u201cPretty sure I did a bad tweet here. Gonna delete it. I\u2019ll want to reflect on it more later, but my tone is way crasser and meaner than I like to think I am.\u201d\n\nIn an email, Kernion told Snopes \u201cThere\u2019s both a substantive aspect to my original tweets and a semi-humorous aspect to my original tweets\u2026but I\u2019m not sure I want to go down the rabbit hole of doing a line-by-line annotation of what I was thinking/wanting to communicate.\u201d\n\nHe added that his tweets had, until Nov. 5, typically reached only a small audience whom he \u201cexpected to understand\u201d what he was trying to convey. When the thread he published on that day was exposed to a much wider audience, Kernion said, \u201cthey read into it attitudes that I do not hold.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated that he had retracted and deleted his Twitter thread and would continue to \u201creflect on it.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
