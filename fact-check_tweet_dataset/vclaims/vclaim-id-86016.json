He also said that he would support a subpoena of Geithner: \u201cGet him in front of the committee and ask him under oath, did you know about this in June. If you did, why didn\u2019t you say something?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d obviously had not concluded the audit, so we did not have final determinations at that time. I\u2019m operating from memory here. And it was a while ago and I had no idea this issue would come up in this manner. But the bottom line is I cannot say with certainty that I said to him this was definitively happening. I said, this is the allegation, this is what we\u2019re looking at.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt some point in 2012, though I do not recall precisely when, Mr. George notified me, at his initiative, that he had undertaken an audit of the IRS\u2019s review of tax-exempt applications. He told me only of the fact that he had undertaken such an audit, and he did not provide any findings. That is my recollection, and that is what Mr. George testified before the House Ways and Means Committee last Friday and before the Senate Finance Committee yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. George told me that he was conducting an audit, and I told him to follow the facts wherever they lead. Our core principle is that we do not interfere in any way \u2013 or do anything to create the perception of interference \u2013 with the independent review of an inspector general. When an inspector general tells us he is conducting a review, we step back and leave him to do his work. That is how the process functions. That is how the process should function. And that is how the process functioned here.\u201d\n\nJordan appeared on television and suggested he had a smoking gun concerning the former Treasury secretary, with the slight caveat of \u201cwe think.\u201d But testimony and information already received by the committee shows there is much less here than meets the eye, and certainly little that suggests Geithner needs to be subpoenaed.\n\nAs the investigation continues, we can certainly update this ruling if more information emerges about a possible briefing for Geithner. But lawmakers should be careful about going on national television and making charges for which they have little evidence. It was known already that George told top Treasury officials \u2014but not Geithner \u2014 that an audit had been launched to examine the allegations, but that was it. The documents that Jordan breathlessly described on television have added little to that picture.\n\nWe wavered back and forth about whether this was worthy of Two or Three Pinocchios. Jordan\u2019s rush to judgment was unseemly; generally, an unsupported allegation, especially when prior information undermines it, should not be excused. But his comments do not quite rise to the same level as Rep. Mike Rogers\u2019s claim earlier this year that the White House engaged in criminal behavior.", "lang": "en"}
