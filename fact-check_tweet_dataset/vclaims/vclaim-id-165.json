The information in this post is false.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \u201cNo specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) approved\u201d ( here ).\n\nReuters recently debunked the claim that Vitamin C alone could cure or treat COVID-19, visible here . While the immune-boosting properties of Vitamin C might help people\u2019s bodies respond to infections and illness, to claim Vitamin C alone can cure or treat COVID-19 is medically unfounded. Studies on its effect on respiratory infections similar to COVID-19 are still under way.\n\n\u201cIn addition to its use as an antioxidant, vitamin E is involved in immune function,\u201d according to the National Institutes for Health (NIH) ( here ). However, Reuters could not corroborate the claim that Vitamin E was being administered or recommended to COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe post\u2019s recommendation that those recovering from COVID-19 expose themselves to sunlight for 15 to 20 minutes daily suggests that either heat or vitamin D helps the body fight the novel coronavirus. Reuters Fact Check has debunked the claim that heat kills the virus here .\n\nVitamin D does play a role in immune function, according to the NIH ( here ) but Reuters could not confirm that healthcare providers were administering doses of Vitamin D to COVID-19 patients.\n\nReuters could not corroborate that physicians were advising COVID-19 patients to consume eggs. Harvard Medical School says eggs \u201ccontain many healthy nutrients: lutein and zeaxanthin, which are good for the eyes; choline, which is good for the brain and nerves; and various vitamins (A, B, and D). In fact, just one large egg contains 270 international units (IU) of vitamin A and 41 IU of vitamin D. One large egg also contains about 6 g of protein and 72 calories\u201d ( here ).\n\nAccording to WebMD, \u201cEven when you aren\u2019t sick, you need protein to keep your body strong. Your body uses it to build strength and keep what you already have. Lean meat, poultry, fish, legumes, dairy, eggs, nuts, and seeds are good sources\u2026 Foods that have [protein] provide nutrients like vitamins B6 and B12, both of which keep your immune system working like it should\u201d ( here ).\n\nGetting plenty of rest is sound advice. According to Healthline, \u201csleeping when you\u2019re sick is essential. It\u2019s one way your body tells you to slow down and rest, so you can get healthy\u201d ( here ). The Mayo Clinic says that \u201clack of sleep can affect your immune system\u201d, and that \u201cstudies show that people who don't get quality sleep or enough sleep are more likely to get sick after being exposed to a virus, such as a common cold virus. Lack of sleep can also affect how fast you recover if you do get sick\u201d ( here ).\n\nIt is true that it is important to drink liquids when you are sick in order to replenish lost water. According to WebMD, \u201cWhen you're sick, it's easy to get dehydrated\u201d ( here ).\n\nThe Reuters Fact Check Team has debunked the claim that drinking water repels the new coronavirus here . In March 2020, Reuters spoke with Dr. Thomas Nash, an internist, pulmonologist, and infectious disease specialist at New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York City, who said, \u201cdrinking excessive amounts of water does not repel germs\u201d ( here ). With the major site of COVID-19 contraction being the nasopharyngeal area, or the nose and sinuses, \u201cdrinking water has no impact.\u201d Nash advised to \u201cdrink water if you\u2019re thirsty,\u201d but emphasized that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t have anything to do with boosting your immune system.\u201d\n\nAs stated in a Reuters fact check article in March, neither drinking hot liquids nor eating cold foods will have a bearing on the body\u2019s core temperature, so eating warm foods would not affect one\u2019s chances of fighting off the virus ( here ).\n\nThe Reuters Fact Check Team has debunked the claim that an alkaline diet helps prevent coronavirus infection here .\n\nThe post provides a list of \u201calkaline\u201d foods that are in fact acidic, not alkaline.\n\nWith the exception of turmeric, the pH levels given for the listed foods are inaccurate. Lemon is acidic, with a pH level of 2.00-2.60, not 9.9; lime is acidic, with a pH level of 2.00-2.80, not 8.2; mango is acidic, with a pH level of 5.80-6.00, not 8.7; pineapple is acidic, with a pH level of 3.20-4.00, not 12.7; garlic is acidic, with a pH level of 5.80, not 13.2; orange is acidic, with a pH level of 3.69-4.34, not 9.2; tangerine is acidic, with a pH level of 3.32 - 4.48, not 8.5. The pH of avocado is 6.27-6.58 (slightly acidic) ( here ; here ). The pH level given for dandelion, 22.7 is impossible (the highest number on the pH scale is 14).\n\nThe health benefits of turmeric are undetermined. As per the NIH, \u201cClaims that curcuminoids found in turmeric help to reduce inflammation aren\u2019t supported by strong studies. Preliminary studies found that curcuminoids may\u2026reduce the number of heart attacks bypass patients had after surgery,\u201d \u201ccontrol knee pain from osteoarthritis as well as ibuprofen did,\u201d and \u201creduce the skin irritation that often occurs after radiation treatments for breast cancer\u201d ( here ).\n\nWhile some of these tips might contribute to a healthy lifestyle and help the immune system, there is currently no known cure for COVID-19.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) explains on its website:\u200b \"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings are available.\"\u200b ( here )\n\nFalse: While some of these tips might provide immune-boosting properties, this is not a medically approved cure for COVID-19\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
