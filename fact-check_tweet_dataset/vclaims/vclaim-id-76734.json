Spicer, in his daily press briefing on Jan. 30, 2017, pushed back by claiming that the presidential memorandum announcing the makeup of the council hadn\u2019t really changed dramatically.\n\n\"The language that's part of the president's memo is identical to the language for Presidents Bush's 2001,\" Spicer said, holding up copies of the various memos (around the 6:55 mark of this video). \"The only thing that's changed in this is the addition of the Director of National Intelligence as a position that didn't exist in 2001. For what it's worth, it's the same as Obama's, save for the word \u2018also.\u2019 \"\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, the National Security Council was established in 1947 and gathers foreign and domestic policy and military officials to advise the president on national security.\n\nThe two issues with Trump\u2019s restructuring concern the makeup of the full council and its principals committee, a subset of senior officials that is also \"literally 100 percent the same,\" according to Spicer.\n\nSo is Spicer right that the Bush, Obama and Trump memos are nearly \"identical\"?\n\nWe read Bush\u2019s 2001 memo, Obama\u2019s 2009 memo and Trump\u2019s 2017 memo, and found that Spicer\u2019s claim is misleading.\n\nSpicer is right about the makeup of the full National Security Council, albeit in a limited way.\n\nThis sentence \u2014 \"The Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as statutory advisers to the NSC, shall also attend NSC meetings\" \u2014 appears pretty much verbatim in each president\u2019s memo. (The Director of National Intelligence was a position created in 2004, so Bush\u2019s memo says the CIA Director instead.)\n\nBut in a broader sense, Spicer is off the mark. Each president has invited different government officials to sit on the council, but neither Bush nor Obama added his chief strategist. Trump appears to be the only president since the establishment of the council to include his, Bannon, according to a Congressional Research Service report.\n\nBy statute, the members of the council are the president, vice president, secretary of state, secretary of defense and, as of 2007, secretary of energy. As noted in the memos, the chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff and National Security Advisor are statutory advisers.\n\nHere are the additional members each president has requested to join the council (positions unique to each president are bolded):\n\nSimilarly, Bannon\u2019s addition to the principals committee undercuts Spicer\u2019s claim that the senior interagency group, first established by former President George H.W. Bush in 1989, is \"literally 100 percent the same.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s memo reads: \"The Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall attend where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed.\"\n\nAgain, barring the inclusion of the Director of National Intelligence, that is verbatim the language of Bush\u2019s 2001 memo: \"The Director of Central Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall attend where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed.\"\n\nBut Obama\u2019s 2009 memo makes clear that Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are \"regular members\" of the committee.\n\nAnd again, the chief strategist was not a member in either Bush\u2019s or Obama\u2019s committees (or George H.W. Bush\u2019s or Bill Clinton\u2019s).\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the organization of the principals committee under each president (positions unique to each president are bolded):\n\nSpicer said, \"The language that's part of the president's memo (on the National Security Council) is identical to the language for Presidents Bush's 2001\" as well as President Obama\u2019s 2009.\n\nWe reached out to the Trump administration but did not hear back.\n\nSpicer is right in a limited sense: each memo specifies that the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Director of National Intelligence are statutory advisers to the regular council.\n\nWhile both the Bush and Trump memos stipulated they attend principals committee meetings when appropriate, both were regular members of the subcommittee under Obama.\n\nTrump also includes one major departure from both Bush and Obama: adding the position of chief strategist as a member of both the regular council and principals committee.\n\nSpicer\u2019s claim that the memos are identical rates Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
