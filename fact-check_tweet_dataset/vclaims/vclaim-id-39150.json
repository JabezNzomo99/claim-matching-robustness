The clips have been misleadingly edited; they omit Biden subsequently saying that will be the result if Democrats target each other in a negative campaign.\n\nOne of the videos was tweeted by the White House director of social media, Dan Scavino, and the other by Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, a conservative student organization.\n\nIn the clips, Biden says: \u201cTurn this primary from a campaign that\u2019s about negative attacks into one about what we\u2019re for, because we cannot get re-elect, we cannot win this re-election, excuse me, we can only re-elect Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree with Joe!\u201d Trump commented when he retweeted Scavino.\n\n\u201cSleepy Joe in St. Louis, Missouri today: \u2018We can only re-elect @realDonaldTrump,\u2019\u201d Scavino tweeted, while Kirk wrote: \u201cI finally agree with Joe Biden on something! He\u2019s exactly right\u2014If we don\u2019t want 4 years of this, we can only re-elect @realDonaldTrump.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign\u2019s official Twitter account tweeted a shorter version of the clip that ends as if it were an ad, with the president\u2019s voice saying: \u201cI\u2019m Donald J. Trump, and I approve this message.\u201d\n\nBut in this video of Biden's remarks -- which shows him speaking in Kansas City, Missouri, not St. Louis as Scavino claimed -- it is clear he is not admitting defeat.\n\n\u201cIf you want a nominee who will bring this party together, who will run a progressive, positive campaign and turn, turn this primary from a campaign that\u2019s about negative attacks into one about what we\u2019re for, because we cannot get re-elect, we cannot win this re-election, excuse me, we can only re-elect Donald Trump if in fact we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. It\u2019s gotta be a positive campaign, so join us,\u201d he says.\n\nTwitter has marked Scavino\u2019s tweet as \u201cmanipulated media,\u201d spokesperson Trenton Kennedy said.\n\n\u201cI can confirm... that this Tweet was labeled based on our Synthetic and Manipulated Media policy,\u201d Kennedy told AFP by email.\n\nIt is not the first misleading video about a Democratic presidential candidate to be spread by Trump: in January 2020, the president retweeted a misleadingly edited clip of Tom Steyer in which the now former candidate said Democrats would destroy the economy.\n\nBut Steyer\u2019s full remarks showed that he was characterizing Trump's position, not his own.\n\nAn account managed by Trump\u2019s campaign tweeted a video of Pete Buttigieg -- who has also since left the race -- the following month, falsely claiming that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t care\u201d if Americans lose health insurance they have through their employers.\n\nBut sections of Buttigieg\u2019s remarks that were not included in the clip made clear that he was speaking about giving people a choice between public and private insurance options, not expressing indifference about them losing existing coverage.\n\nMichael Bloomberg -- who has dropped out of the race for the Democratic nomination -- also tweeted a video in February that had been misleadingly edited to make it appear that his Democratic rivals were left speechless for a lengthy period by a comment that he made during a debate.\n\nIn reality, Bloomberg quickly resumed speaking following the remark.", "lang": "en"}
