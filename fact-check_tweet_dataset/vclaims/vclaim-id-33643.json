And, if so, is this dog suffering from a dangerous medical condition?\n\nThis is indeed a genuine photograph of a real-life puppy named Narwhal. While this 10-week-old golden retriever truly has a small tail growing from its forehead, an X-ray showed that this superfluous tail doesn\u2019t appear to be connected to anything. Still, Narwhal\u2019s caretakers at Mac\u2019s Mission for pets in Jackson, Missouri, are being cautious. The puppy won\u2019t be put up for adoption until they are sure \u201chis unicorn horn is not going to have a growth spurt and become an issue.\u201d\n\nMac\u2019s Mission focuses on \u201cspecial needs\u201d dogs who may need extra care due to abuse, injury, or birth defects. The Mission received Narwhal in early November after someone found him on the street. On Nov. 8, 2019, the group\u2019s Facebook page Mac the Pitbull posted an image of the new rescue:\n\nNarwhal exemplifies the rescue group\u2019s philosophy that their charges are all the more lovable for their abnormalities, [Rochelle Steffen, who founded the group] said. She\u2019s hopeful their \u201cmagical\u201d dog\u2019s splash of attention can do the same for other dogs in need. \u201cI am super excited for being the poster child for \u2018special is awesome,\u2019 \u201d says a post written in the voice of Narwhal on the Facebook page that propelled the unicorn puppy to fame. Mac\u2019s Mission took Narwhal in last weekend, Steffen said, after someone told her about the strange creature they\u2019d found on the street. The rest of Narwhal\u2019s litter quickly scattered, and staff are still trying to track them down. \u201cIt\u2019s snowed the last couple of days, so I\u2019m nervous,\u201d Steffen said. But Narwhal and an older dog whom they suspect may be his father are now safe. The puppy, whom rescue workers believe to be about 10 weeks old, was quickly named after the whale with a single, large tusk that\u2019s sometimes called the \u201cunicorn of the sea.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s Facebook page has posted several additional photographs and videos of Narwhal. The \u201cunicorn\u201d puppy has become a bit of an internet star and has drawn plenty of requests for adoption. Founder Rochelle Steffen said that while she doesn\u2019t believe the extra trail will cause any problems, the organization isn\u2019t quite ready to put Narwhal up for adoption. Here are a few more photographs the group has posted, including an X-ray of Narwhal\u2019s tail:\n\nHe was examined by our vet and had x-rays done and he does not believe there are any problems with leaving it there. As we learned with Bumble sometimes there are other genetic factors in cases like these so we are being super cautious and want to ensure he has everything he needs. We will do whatever is best for our little Narwhal.\n\nHere\u2019s a video of Narwhal playing with a toy. More videos and photographs can be seen on the Mac The Pitbull Facebook page:", "lang": "en"}
