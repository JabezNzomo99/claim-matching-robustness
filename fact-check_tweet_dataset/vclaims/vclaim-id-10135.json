The majority of households in the UK own their home, as opposed to renting. Households in the UK had 2.4 people on average in 2016. Most owner-occupiers in England only have one house.\n\n63% of English households own the home they live in, which may be a house or a flat. The last time the proportion was lower than this was in 1985. The number of owner-occupiers has been broadly the same since 2012/13.\n\nThe latest data on second home ownership in England is from 2013/14. 2.3 million households report having a second property, while 674,000 had a \u201csecond home\u201d (meaning they mainly used it as a holiday home or let it out to others). Second homes data will be collected again in the 2017-18 survey.\n\nThat would mean most English owner-occupiers only have one home.\n\nIn Scotland, 61% of households own the home they live in. And for Northern Ireland, it is 66%. We haven\u2019t been able yet to source this data for Wales, or second home data outside of England.", "lang": "en"}
