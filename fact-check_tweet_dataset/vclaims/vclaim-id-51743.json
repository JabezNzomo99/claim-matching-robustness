The poster in the picture questions the efficiency of Mumbai Police\u2019s investigation into actor Sushant Singh Rajput\u2019s death.\n\nEnglish Translation, \u201cIt is the same Mumbai police who is investigating the murder of Sushant Singh Rajput, who could not find out who was driving Salman Khan\u2019s car for last 18 years.\u201d\n\nMore such posts can be seen here, here and here.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found that the picture was edited.\n\nThere are many tell-tale signs that the picture being shared on social media is digitally altered. Firstly, the people in the picture are dressed up in winter clothes with scarfs, jackets, sweaters and woollen caps, which means this picture was clicked in winters. Secondly, in coronavirus pandemic, it is compulsory for every individual to wear masks, but when we look at the picture we found that no one is wearing masks.\n\nOn putting the picture through Google Reverse Image Search, we found the original picture on \u2018The Strife\u2018 showing a page with many pictures of protestors holding placards during CAA(Citizenship Amendment Act) and NRC (National Register of Citizen) protests in the gallery section of the page.\n\nWe also found this picture that was uploaded seven-months ago on Theinstaprofile.com.\n\nIn conclusion, the above information proves that the picture in question is manipulated using photo editing software and the original picture was clicked during CAA and NRC protests to make a misleading claim.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
