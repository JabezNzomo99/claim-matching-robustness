En caul deliveries are rare enough that some obstetricians may never attend one in their entire careers, though not so rare as to prevent multiple videos of such births from going viral on the Internet.\n\nThe example above was shot in the Santa Casa de Miseric\u00f3rdia de Barretos hospital, Sao Paulo, Brazil by a nurse, Giselinha Correa, who posted it to YouTube on 4 August 2016 and on her Facebook page two days later. The New York Times provided this translation of her caption (from the original Portuguese):\n\n\u201cLook what I had the honor of filming in my dear Santa House Mercy,\u201d the nurse, Gih Flor de Lis, wrote, explaining that the newborn was actually one of a set of twins, the first of whom was delivered vaginally. \u201cWe were waiting to stabilize the first baby and the second came softly, in fact, look there that beautiful!!! Historic moment! !!!\u201d she wrote in the post.\n\nOther online videos capturing en caul births include one comprising a series of photographs of an infant born prematurely at 26 weeks at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles:\n\nAnd another of a baby born in Spain who was sliced out of his amniotic sac as a cell phone camera rolled:", "lang": "en"}
