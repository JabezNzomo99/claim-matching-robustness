This is due to take place over three separate strikes between October and December. A five day strike in September has been postponed.\n\nAlthough the Department of Health, NHS Employers and the Secretary of State all seem to have announced slightly different figures, they now all agree that there are likely to be just over 125,000 operations cancelled.\n\nThey are based on a prediction based on figures from the past, so the length of the upcoming strikes and the different time of year may have an effect on the actual number of cancellations.\n\nThe figures were calculated before the dates of the junior doctors\u2019 strikes had been announced\n\nThe Department of Health has said to us that it had projected around 125,000 operations and one million outpatient appointments would be cancelled as a result of the junior doctors strikes from September to December. This projection was done before any of the specific dates for the strikes were announced.\n\nThe estimate was also made before the BMA announced that the strikes from 12 to 16 September were suspended. The Department of Health told us that the figure was still in this region as hospitals had already started cancelling operations and appointments in preparation for the strike. NHS Providers, the membership organisation for NHS service providers, agrees with this figure.\n\nIt was calculated by using the number of cancelled operations and appointments in the last junior doctors strike, 12,711 and 112,856 respectively. This was then multiplied to work out how many would occur on strikes over five days in each of the next four months. It works out at around 127,000 operations and 1,129,000 appointments.\n\nSo it assumes that the cancellations in the coming months will be similar to those in April, per day.\n\nOf course we don\u2019t know if this will turn out to be the case: the planned strikes are taking place at a different time of year and are happening in larger chunks than those earlier in the year. This could have an effect on cancellations.\n\nThe Secretary of State quoted 100,000 in a number of interviews, but the Department of Health told us that this was an approximation of the 125,000 figure.\n\nNHS Employers has said to us that its latest estimate is also 125,000 in line with the government and NHS Providers. Its earlier figure of 13,000 to 15,000 was based on the number of operations cancelled due to industrial action over two days last April and was reached without knowing the extent of the strikes planned by the BMA.\n\nNo exact figures for how many cancellations will be needed have been released yet.\n\nHow many operations were cancelled in the last strikes?\n\u2022 7,152 operations were cancelled in December 2015, but the strike was called off.\n\u2022 4,112 operations were cancelled as a result of the first strike in January\n\u2022 5,264 operations were cancelled for industrial action in March.\n\u2022 5,156 operations were cancelled for strikes on 6 and 7 April.\n\u2022 12,711 operations were cancelled during the second strike at the end of April. There were also 112,856 outpatient appointments cancelled.\n\nBoth sides say this is about patient care\n\nThe Secretary of State has said that \u201cthe remaining planned industrial action is unprecedented in length and severity and will be damaging to patients, some of whose operations will have already been cancelled.\u201d He added it would inflict \u201cunprecedented misery on millions of patients up and down the country.\u201d\n\nDr McCourt, the Chair of the British Medical Association Junior Doctors Committee, has said \u201cThis contract will be in place for many years, it will have a direct impact on patient care and whether we can attract and keep enough doctors in the NHS\u2026 This is not a situation junior doctors wanted to find themselves in. We want to resolve this dispute through talks, but in forcing through a contract that junior doctors have rejected and which they don\u2019t believe is good for their patients or themselves, the government has left them with no other choice.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve looked into the background of the contract dispute here.", "lang": "en"}
