These graphics have been shared by multiple Facebook users since, with some captions and comments showing support for the President.\n\nA Facebook user, for instance, collected 4 such graphics in a post on Tuesday, April 7, and lamented in her caption that Filipinos \"keep on criticizing Duterte\" and \"keep on complaining,\" unlike foreigners who \"appreciate what he's doing.\"\n\nFor world leaders and other influential figures used in these graphics, online users can check through Google search or check out official statements to see whether they really said the quote or not.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II and Kim Jong Un did not issue the quotes or statements about Duterte in these quote cards. On Tuesday, April 7, Rappler published a fact-check article debunking the quote attributed to Queen Elizabeth II in one of these graphics.\n\nAs for the graphic featuring Kim Jong Un, it appears to be satirical because the quote on it used \"Tatay Digong,\" which is a local nickname for Duterte, and the text \"Ur Mom's House\" at the upper right corner.\n\nFor instance, a Facebook user shared a graphic featuring \"King Jafari Bukaruti\" of Zimbabwe, who supposedly said that Duterte is \"leadership personified\" and \"will go down as one of the greatest presidents in history.\" In his caption written in Cebuano, the user criticized those who were against Duterte.\n\nAs Facebook's Claim Check dashboard shows, some users only focused on the quote on the memes when they shared it, and may not have recognized or did not check who the people on these graphics were.", "lang": "en"}
