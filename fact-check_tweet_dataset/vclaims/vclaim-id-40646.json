The story was first covered by the Intercept on Dec. 24 in an article that carried the headline \u201cMike Bloomberg Exploited Prison Labor to Make 2020 Presidential Campaign Phone Calls\u201d and reported that:\n\n\u201cFormer New York City mayor and multibillionaire Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg used prison labor to make campaign calls. Through a third-party vendor, the Mike Bloomberg 2020 campaign contracted New Jersey-based call center company ProCom, which runs calls centers in New Jersey and Oklahoma. Two of the call centers in Oklahoma are operated out of state prisons. In at least one of the two prisons, incarcerated people were contracted to make calls on behalf of the Bloomberg campaign.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the Bloomberg campaign acknowledged that those claims were \u201cfundamentally accurate,\u201d but emphasized that the campaign had been unaware of the sub-vendor\u2019s use of prison labor until the Intercept reached out for comment. The campaign said it immediately cut ties with ProCom:\n\n\u201cEarlier today, a news outlet reported that prison workers were being used by a subcontractor to make telephone calls on behalf of my campaign. I\u2019m not attacking the news: the story was fundamentally accurate. We only learned about this when the reporter called us, but as soon as we discovered which vendor\u2019s subcontractor had done this, we immediately ended our relationship with the company and the people who hired them. We do not support this practice and we are making sure our vendors more properly vet their subcontractors moving forward.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
