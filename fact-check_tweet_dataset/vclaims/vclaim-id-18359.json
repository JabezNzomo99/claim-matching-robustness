They\u2019re Europeans trying to get to North Africa during World War II. So next time you think of closing the borders you might want to check with your grandparents.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that the picture doesn\u2019t show Syrians, but the rest of the claim is false.\n\nThe picture is from Aug. 8, 1991, when 10,000 Albanians forced their way into the Italian port of Bari. They were among the hundreds of thousands who fled Albania starting in 1990, when the fall of communism left poor economic conditions in the country. Most of those who were on the boat in the picture were later sent back to Albania, according to a 1992 report from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.\n\nOriginal photos taken at the port of Bari were in color, but the photo used on Facebook was changed to black and white.\n\nThe false claim attached to the picture has been circulating since at least 2015, but it has had renewed interest in recent weeks as funding for President Donald Trump\u2019s promised border wall has been in the news.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
