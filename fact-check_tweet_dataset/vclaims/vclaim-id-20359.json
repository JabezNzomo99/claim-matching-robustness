That's about 3 billion for Wales, about 8 or 9 billion for Scotland.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how any deal which results in new funding for projects in Northern Ireland will affect the rest of the UK.\n\nThe Barnett formula aims to make changes to funding for services in England have the same pound-per-person effect on the money which goes to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for those services.\n\nIt\u2019s not set out in law, and in practice the Treasury decides how to apply it. It can also be bypassed if the Treasury decides certain spending is outside the formula. If the devolved governments disagree they can argue the case.\n\nThe formula itself is basically: any change to UK government department budget multiplied by the percentage of devolved services in that area multiplied by the percentage population in that country.\n\nSo, if the Barnett formula is used the result would depend on which departments are affected. It only applies changes in the fixed budget of a department to the \u2018block grant\u2019 paid to the devolved governments. It doesn\u2019t decide all funding.\n\nHow any additional funding for Northern Ireland might affect the rest of the UK will be decided by political negotiation.", "lang": "en"}
