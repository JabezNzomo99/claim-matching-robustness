No app no entry.\u201d\n\nIt then goes on to say: \u201cEmployer can ask you if you have downloaded the app before commencing work. No app no work.\u201d\n\nThe post then states: \u201cI\u2019d say that will more then (sic) likely happen to anything we walk into movies, footy, pub etc.\u201d\n\nThe post includes a screenshot of the COVIDsafe app Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) report by law firm Maddocks, which was commissioned to do the assessment by the federal Department of Health, the agency responsible for managing the app.\n\nThe image highlights paragraph 3.19.4 of the PIA, which reads:\n\n\u201cThe Australian Government has also given clear indications that it will not be mandatory for any person to install or to use the App,\n\n\u201cHowever, there may be a potential risk of circumstances in which a particular individual does feel pressured to download the App,\n\n\u201cE.g. a supermarket insisting on customers showing that they are using the App before being permitted to enter the store; or an employer insisting that their employees demonstrate that they are using the App before being permitted to start or continue work,\u201d reads the PIA.\n\nThe Facebook post has been viewed over 34,000 times, shared over 300 times and received over 100 comments.\n\nAs states and territories recorded decreased levels of coronavirus infections in April, the federal Department of Health released the COVIDSafe app to track potential transmissions of the virus.\n\nThe app uses the bluetooth functionality in phones to track contact between users. The app registers when a user is near other people who have the app on their device. If someone contracts COVID-19 they have to consent to the data being used by health officials for contact tracing.\n\nPrime Minister Morrison told radio station 2GB that he wants as many people as possible to download the app and that the sooner Australians download the app, the sooner they can go back to the pub.\n\nThe May 3 Facebook post claims the COVIDsafe app \u201ccomes with some hidden secret rules\u201d and says supermarkets and employers could potentially refuse entry or work to people who have not installed the app.\n\nThe post includes a screenshot of section 3.19.4 of the COVIDSafe app Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), described above.\n\nThe Department of Health engaged law firm Maddocks to conduct the PIA, with the report aiming to \u201caddress and mitigate any identified privacy risks for the COVIDSafe app,\u201d according to the Department of Health website.\n\nThe concerns raised in the PIA about the COVIDSafe app being used to deny someone entry to their work or a supermarket are directly addressed in the Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Emergency Requirements\u2014Public Health Contact Information) Determination 2020.\n\nAs part of the Biosecurity Act (2015), the federal Minister for Health can make determinations, that are necessary to prevent the spread of a disease during a biosecurity emergency period. The COVID-19 biosecurity emergency period is in force for three months from its declaration on March 18, 2020.\n\nThe minister\u2019s Biosecurity determination, in section 9(1)(a) states that a person \u201cmust not require\u201d that another person download the app, have it in operation or consent to their data being shared.\n\nThe determination, in section 9 (2)(c), prohibits a person from \u201crefusing to allow another person to enter premises,\u201d if that person has not downloaded the COVIDSafe app, isn\u2019t using the app, or has not consented to uploading their data to the COVIDSafe Data Store.\n\nThe determination also prohibits a person from refusing \u201cto enter into, or continue, a contract or arrangement with another person (including a contract of employment)\u201d or taking \u201cadverse action (within the meaning of the Fair Work Act 2009) against another person,\u201d if they have not downloaded the COVIDSafe app, aren\u2019t using the app, or have not consented to uploading their data to the COVIDSafe Data Store.\n\nIf someone doesn\u2019t comply with the Biosecurity determination they may be committing a criminal offence, punishable by a maximum of five years in prison. New draft legislation set to be introduced in to parliament will turn the determination into law, outside of the the three-month biosecurity emergency period, by amending the Privacy Act (1988).\n\nThe move to introduce the legislation that amends the Privacy Act (1988) comes after experts and politicians expressed concerns about how personal data is collected and stored by the COVIDSafe app.\n\nChair of the Australian Privacy Foundation and head of UNSW Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre, David Vaile, told AAP FactCheck in an email that there are \u201cstill unresolved issues about the application of this law to entities under state government jurisdiction\u201d . This includes state police forces, hospitals, emergency services and local governments.\n\nIn a recent development, the Department of Health is investigating a Sydney council after it reportedly ordered staff to install the COVIDSafe app on their work-issued phones.\n\nHealth Minister Greg Hunt said on Wednesday, May 6 that the reported behaviour of the council, if accurate, was unacceptable \u201cand further steps would be taken if it were not rectified immediately\u201d.\n\nEmployer group the NSW Chamber of Commerce has expressed disappointment that employers are not allowed to mandate downloading of the app for employees.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claim that there are \u201chidden secret rules\u201d for the COVIDSafe app is not supported. While experts have identified potential concerns with how the regulations around the COVIDSafe app might apply in some circumstances, the wording of the Minister\u2019s Biosecurity determination specifically prohibits someone being barred from entering a premises or participating in an activity based on whether they have installed the app. False \u2013 The primary claim of the content is factually inaccurate. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
