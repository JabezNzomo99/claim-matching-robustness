Some of the people marching ahead are also seen carrying swords with alleged blood stains on them.\n\nBOOM performed reverse image searches with several keyframes, and eventually came across an article by The Print dated October 20, 2019 that carried an image of the same procession, with the child's head on display.\n\nAccording to the article, SMHoaxSlayer had contacted Rajasthan Police in October 2018, who had refuted any claims of a real child sacrifice taking place and stated that the entire procession was staged, and was meant for entertainment.\n\nThe police also stated that such processions \"take place annually during Navaratri in the name of Mother Chamunda\".\n\nBOOM also found a report by The New Indian Express, which stated that child sacrifice was staged and the procession was meant as entertainment.\n\nIn October 2018, just after the incident happened, the video went viral with similar claims of real child sacrifice.\n\nFollowing this, Rajasthan Police gave out a statement on Twitter, to put to rest the viral rumours.", "lang": "en"}
