In fact, he often utters contradictory \u201cfacts\u201d depending on the venue. At Liberty University, he said that the real unemployment rate is \u201c22-23 percent,\u201d but in the past he has asserted it was as high as 42 percent.\n\nThe most commonly-reported unemployment rate from the Bureau of Labor Statistics is officially known as the \u201cU-3\u201d rate. This is one of six different \u201clabor utilization\u201d rates issued every month by the agency. The U-3 rate reflects people who are actively seeking jobs but cannot find one. As of December, that was 5.0 percent of the labor force above the age of 16.\n\nThe estimate of unemployment is based on a monthly sample survey of 60,000 households. The BLS did not come up with this definition of unemployment willy-nilly; it actually reflects an internationally-embraced definition set by the International Labour Organization \u2014 that the \u201cunemployed\u201d are people who are not working but have actively searched for work, are available to work and are willing and able to work for pay.\n\nWhile Trump claims that people who quit searching for a job are counted as having one, in reality they are simply not counted as being unemployed in the the U-3 rate. But the BLS has other measures that do count those people as unemployed.\n\nFor instance, there are people who are considered \u201cmarginally attached to the labor force.\u201d These are workers who are not looking for work, but would like a job; they may, for instance, be discouraged by the lack of apparent opportunities. If you add in those possible workers, you end up with what is known as the U-5 rate. That was 6.1 percent in December.\n\nSome economists might argue that the U-6 rate provides a more accurate picture of the unemployment rate, and we wouldn\u2019t necessarily dispute that. But one generally shouldn\u2019t fixate on month-by-month swings in a particular unemployment rate and instead should look at how it has performed over time.\n\nThe survey questions for the U-6 were revised in 1994 and so the data only goes back 21 years. But again, you can see that the trend line even for this higher rate has dramatically improved in recent years, though it still has room for improvement to hit a previous low of 7.0 percent.\n\nSo why does Trump claim 23 percent? We have no idea, since as usual his campaign refused to explain his reasoning. But a clue might stem from his comments on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d \u2014 that \u201cyou have 60, 70, 80 million people out there that want to work that aren\u2019t getting jobs.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a big range of 20 million people. But it\u2019s a bit of pullback for Trump, who a few months ago asserted that there were 93 million people out of work, or 42 percent unemployment. He appeared to be referring to the labor force participation rate, but that 93 million number (as of December, 94 million) mainly reflects the number of people who have chosen not to work, such as retirees, students and stay-at-home parents. (After all, 10,000 baby boomers retire every day.) Only a small portion of that number includes the officially unemployed, the discouraged workers and so forth.\n\nStill, if you take 60 million as a percentage of the entire civilian noninstitutional population, you end up with 23 percent. But only about 25 million are really unemployed, or discouraged from looking for work or marginally attached to the labor force. There\u2019s another 35 million \u201cunemployed\u201d who Trump has not accounted for.\n\nJohn Williams, an economic gadfly who runs a website called shadowstats, has argued that the rate is 22.9 percent \u2014 and has barely budged since 2011 \u2014 because, he argues, millions of Americans have simply given up looking for work and thus are not counted in the official statistics. That\u2019s a distinctly minority point of view.\n\nTrump\u2019s claims on the unemployment rate would not pass muster in an Economics 101 course. While he has apparently cut his estimate of the unemployment rate from 42 percent to 23 percent, his figure is still more than double the most expansive rate published by the government. Thus he once again earns Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
