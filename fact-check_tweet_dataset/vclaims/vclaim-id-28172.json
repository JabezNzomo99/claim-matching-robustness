An Amazon spokesman confirmed via an email to Snopes that the \u201cproducts in question have been removed.\u201d All third parties who use Amazon\u2019s website to sell products \u201cmust follow our selling guidelines and those who do not will be subject to action, including potential removal of their account,\u201d according to Amazon.\n\nThe Auschwitz Memorial subsequently posted more Holocaust-exploiting items sold on the Amazon platform.\n\n \n\n \n\n Amazon spokesman Patrick Graham told us all of the aforementioned items have been removed. According to the site, Amazon sellers must follow rules barring products that \u201cpromote, incite or glorify hatred, violence, racial, sexual or religious intolerance or promote organizations with such views. We\u2019ll also remove listings that graphically portray violence or victims of violence.\u201d Graham declined to say whether Amazon has a vetting process to ensure hateful products are not sold on the platform in the first place.\n\nIn 2018, Amazon came under scrutiny from two watchdog organizations that published a joint report criticizing the retail giant for \u201cweak and inadequately enforced policies\u201d that allowed hate groups to use the platform to \u201cgenerate revenue, propagate their ideas, and grow their movements.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
