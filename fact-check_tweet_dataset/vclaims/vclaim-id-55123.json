The tweet, which was a reply to a similar post stated that Nepal\u2019s flag was burnt by the members of the AIMIM party in protest after Nepal\u2019s parliament passed the amendment to include Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura in their new political map.\n\nThey also posted a clarification video by one of the men who were burning the flag.\n\nWe then ran keyword search and found several videos on the same incident on YouTube.\n\nHence, from the above information, we can conclude that the picture in question is being shared with a false narrative and are misleading.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
