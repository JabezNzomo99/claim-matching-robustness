These days, it is often used to describe a good custom that is rarely observed. But, originally in Hamlet, it referred to a bad custom that should be ignored.\n\nWe thought about that dual meaning as we contemplated Pelosi\u2019s repeated claim that she does not speak ill of a president while she is not on U.S. soil \u2014 while combing through her recent statements overseas in which she targeted President Trump or his policies.\n\nThis is also a phrase that has become unmoored from its original meaning. Vandenberg \u2014 who shifted from an isolationist stance to supporting President Harry Truman\u2019s internationalist polices, such as the Marshall Plan and the creation of NATO \u2014 was calling for a bipartisan foreign policy. He was not suggesting one should not speak ill of the commander in chief while abroad.\n\nBut Pelosi and others have interpreted the phrase as meaning that overseas, U.S. politicians should not engage in partisan attacks but show a united front. Pelosi is certainly not supportive of many of Trump\u2019s foreign policy moves, in the way that Vandenberg would understand.\n\nIn the 24-hour news cycle, with instantaneous communication, one might argue it\u2019s a quaint notion. What\u2019s the difference between bashing the president in a CNN interview from Washington vs. one in Ireland? Both interviews will be beamed instantly around the world. Viewers will probably care more about the words that are uttered, rather than where they are said.\n\nAt the London School of Economics, she said: \"You\u2019re getting me dangerously close to leaving the shores of the United States, but I would say I don\u2019t think any president of the United States should use the tragedy of 9/11 as a political tool. I think that is wrong, I think it\u2019s beneath the dignity of the office.\u201d\n\nPelosi was responding to an attack by Trump against Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), in which he shared a video on Twitter of the lawmaker spliced with footage of the burning twin towers from Sept. 11, 2001. Conservatives had been sharing a snippet of an Omar speech to suggest she had played down the significance of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nAt another point at the LSE session, Pelosi attacked Trump\u2019s trade policy but tried to sugarcoat it: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a criticism, just a difference of opinion,\u201d she said, arguing that the United States could have joined with the European Union to put pressure on China. \u201cI wasn\u2019t pleased when the president put tariffs on the E.U. It started to weaken that strength that could have been there, vis a vis China.\u201d\n\nIn her interview with Amanpour, Pelosi referred to Trump as \u201cthe president who\u2019s trying to usurp the power of the legislative branch of the government.\u201d When Amanpour asked Pelosi about Trump suggesting Democrats were anti-Semitic, she responded: \u201cI think the president is bankrupt of any ideas.\u201d\n\nThen Pelosi added: \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about the president here, because I\u2019m overseas. But come see me in Washington, D.C., and I\u2019ll tell you what I think about that, the president.\u201d\n\nPelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said that Pelosi does not want to engage in partisan attacks while overseas. He drew a contrast with Trump, who called Pelosi as \u201ca disaster\u201d during an interview in France that featured a backdrop of thousands of white grave markers at the Normandy American Cemetery. In this instance, Pelosi shrugged off Trump\u2019s attack and refused to comment.\n\nPelosi appears to be trying to have her cake and eat it, too. She says she does not want to talk about the president overseas, but then she slips in criticisms, including a sharp one: He\u2019s \u201cbankrupt of any ideas.\u201d The distinction between a policy difference and a partisan attack is especially hard to discern. It\u2019s certainly not in the spirit of the original meaning of Vandenberg\u2019s line.\n\nEither Pelosi needs to hold fast to her standard \u2014 that she does not talk about the president \u2014 or abandon it. She was restrained in Normandy. But other times, it appears to have been a principle honored in the breach.", "lang": "en"}
