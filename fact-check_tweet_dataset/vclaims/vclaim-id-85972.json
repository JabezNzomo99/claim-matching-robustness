{"title": "Analysis | Is there $200 billion in duplicative federal spending?", "subtitle": "Sen. Tom Coburn says the government is wasting $200 billion on duplicate programs. That so?", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-01T16:09:09Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85972", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2013/12/12/is-there-200-billion-in-duplicative-federal-spending/", "vclaim": "After all, the federal budget is nearly $4 trillion, with a good chunk of that being cash payments to Americans, and he\u2019s saying that, just like that, at least 5 percent could be eliminated?\n\nIn the Morning Joe conversation, the Oklahoma Republican also asserted that \u201cwe spend $31 billion a year on job training programs, of which all but three of those programs duplicate one another. In other words, do the same thing. That\u2019s 48 different job training programs.\u201d\n\nActually, he misspoke, according to a spokesman. The GAO\u2019s figure is $18 billion for 47 programs\u2014and GAO officials say no estimate has been made about how much could be saved if duplication is eliminated. The Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services have taken some preliminary steps to address administrative efficiencies in response to GAO\u2019s findings.\n\nThe reports certainly are interesting reading, detailing the myriad ways that the government has overlapping and duplicative programs. One culprit is Congress itself, as various committees frequently impose new programs on the executive branch, often narrowly tailored to the interests of that particular committee.\n\nThe GAO also has produced an \u201cAction Tracker\u201d that documents the progress that the executive branch and Congress have made in responding to the hundreds of recommendations. Nikki Clowers, a senior GAO official involved in the project, noted that a recommendation on ending ethanol tax subsidies will save $5.7 billion a year and a recommendation to complete a business-case analysis of the Defense Department\u2019s defense posture in the South Pacific will save $3.1 billion over four years.\n\nBut the reports themselves list few specific numbers. The numbers in the 2011 report only add up to about $25 billion in savings. Clowers said the GAO has avoided citing a grand total, in part because sometimes the agencies don\u2019t have enough information about program costs to provide an estimate. So GAO simply identifies problems that should be addressed.\n\nThe most expansive that GAO will get is that it has identified \u201ctens of billions\u201d of dollars in savings. During a congressional hearing earlier this year, a lawmaker asked: \u201cYou had 381 recommendations since 2011, I think. What\u2019s the total estimated ballpark of savings to the government if all 381 were implemented?\u201d\n\nSo where does Coburn come up with his figure? It\u2019s his own estimate, based on the reports. A standard chart put together by Coburn shows that $365 billion is spent on programs that are duplicated. Could all of that be cut in half if the programs were consolidated? That\u2019s really unclear, though certainly some of the other possible savings (such as reducing fraud) identified by GAO gets you in the ballpark.\n\n\u201cThe $200 billion figure is a very conservative low-ball estimate of potential savings that could be achieved in areas of duplication that have been identified by GAO. You\u2019re right that GAO doesn\u2019t declare a \u2018savings\u2019 number because that is a judgment they leave to legislators,\u201d said spokesman John Hart. \u201cThe bottom line: This isn\u2019t duplication according to Coburn. It\u2019s duplication according to GAO. GAO itself has identified program areas that account for far more than Dr. Coburn\u2019s estimate of savings Congress could achieve.\u201d\n\nBut it is going a bit far to say that these are GAO figures. We understand it might be difficult to be precise when speaking on Morning Joe, but Coburn should be more careful to attribute the estimates to his own calculations while saying he is drawing on the work done by GAO. He also should avoid leaving the impression that little is being done to address the issue because, according to the GAO\u2019s action tracker, some progress has been made.", "lang": "en"}
