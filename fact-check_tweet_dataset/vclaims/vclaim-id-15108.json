But it's not a standard calculation \u2014 and the reality is much less impressive.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2019-04-17T07:00:40.424Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-15108", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/17/trump-harris-campaigns-sketchy-boasts-about-small-dollar-contributions/", "vclaim": "Here\u2019s what it looks like when you measure Harris\u2019s and Trump\u2019s small-dollar hauls as a share of all their fundraising. He comes in seventh place and she comes in ninth when stacking them up against all the Democrats who filed first-quarter FEC reports. (For Trump, the number includes his campaign and the two joint fundraising committees.)\n\nHarris\u2019s news release is somewhat labyrinthine in saying \u201c98 percent\u201d of donations were under $100, while 99 percent of donors have yet to max out on the legal contribution limit. The limit, as we\u2019ve noted, is $2,800 per election. So there\u2019s a big pool of people between $100 and $2,800 that Harris is throwing into the mix here. The result is confusing. (Note: We previously said that we reached out to the Harris campaign and did not hear back before deadline on Tuesday. A Harris representative\u2019s emails got caught in The Fact Checker\u2019s spam filter.)\n\n\u201cYou cannot argue with President Trump\u2019s prolific support from small donors,\u201d a Trump campaign representative said. \u201cThis quarter, nearly 99 percent of all donations were $200 or less. There were 100,000 new individual donors in the quarter, bringing the total number of new donors to over a million since Inauguration Day. Counting actual people donating is the only true measure of grassroots support. Under any analysis, President Trump continues to set the standard for support from small dollar donors, just as he did in 2016 when he outraised Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton combined among small donors.\u201d\n\nAnother campaign finance expert, Ian Vandewalker of the Brennan Center for Justice, said it\u2019s useful to know how many campaign donations came in under $200. Federal law does not require candidates to itemize these donations in their FEC reports, so for many campaigns, it\u2019s a blank spot. Trump\u2019s campaign appears to be keeping track of all donations internally, no matter how small, Vandewalker said. (However, the president\u2019s campaign is not itemizing these small-dollar donations in FEC filings, so it\u2019s not possible to verify its numbers.)\n\n(Update, April 30): Former vice president Joe Biden has entered the race. In a fundraising email, his campaign said that it \u201craised $6.3 million in its first 24 hours\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s proof we are running a truly grassroots campaign.\u201d The Biden team noted that \u201c97% of online donations were under $200,\u201d but did not break down how much of the total $6.3 million came from donations of $200 or less. Representatives for Biden did not respond to emails seeking comment. Biden entered the race after the most recent FEC filing deadline, so we don\u2019t have a fundraising report for him yet like we do for all the other candidates. The next FEC filing deadline is July 15.", "lang": "en"}
