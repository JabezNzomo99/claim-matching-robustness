He was arrested from adjoining Sagardighi on October 15. Behra had reportedly bought two insurance policies from Pal, however, the latter refused to give any receipt for the same. He also allegedly insulted Behra following which he hatched a plan to kill Pal.\n\nBut the viral image is not of Utpal Behra.\n\nThe posts have been captioned as, \"Utpal Behra, the prime killer of Jiaganj school teacher, at an RSS meeting\".\n\n(Original text in Bengali: Rss \u098f\u09b0 \u09ae\u09bf\u099f\u09bf\u0982\u09af\u09bc\u09c7 \u099c\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09be\u0997\u099e\u09cd\u099c\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ae\u09be\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ae\u09c2\u09b2 \u0996\u09c1\u09a8\u09bf \u0989\u09ce\u09aa\u09b2 \u09ac\u09c7\u09b9\u09b0\u09be \u0964 ) Click here to view an archive version of the post.\n\nBOOM reached out to Anamika Ghosh, Berhampore BJP Mahila Morcha president and also a state BJP leader, who identified the man as Pulak Sarkar, Behra\u2019s brother-in-law.\n\nGhosh stated that Behra, a CPIM party worker, had only joined the BJP recently.\n\n\u201cThis is an image of Pulak Sarkar having tea at a local tea stall in Jiaganj\u2019s Baghdahar, Ghosh told BOOM. \"It is not an RSS meeting. Pulak Sarkar supports our political ideology but he isn't an active member in the party circuit.\u201d\n\nBOOM also spoke to Mukesh Kumar, SP, Murshidabad, who stated that the viral image is not of Behra.\n\nIt is however unclear whether Sarkar was questioned in connection with the case.\n\nThe narrative is among the many fake narratives doing the rounds post the gruesome murder of Bandhu Prakash Pal and his family.
