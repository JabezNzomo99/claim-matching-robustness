The worst part is all are Muslims and ROAMING freely with chappal inside the temple\u2019. Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: The Government of Andhra Pradesh has made Kanipakam temple a quarantine center for coronavirus suspects. Fact: The building in the video is not Kanipakam temple, it is a pilgrim lodge (\u2018Sri Ganesh Sadan\u2019) in Kanipakam that is being used as a quarantine center by the Andhra Pradesh government. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen one goes through the video carefully, a board with the name \u2018Sri Ganesh Sadan\u2019 can be seen on the building. \n\n\n\nSo, when searched on Google with the text \u2018Sri Ganesh Sadan Kanipakam\u2019, a pilgrim lodge is found to exist with that name in Kanipakam. When one goes through the photos of that lodge, the building in the video can be seen. So, it is not a temple as claimed in the post. As it is a lodge, people can be seen wearing footwear in Google photos too.\n\nAn article of \u2018Eenadu\u2019 with the news that \u2018Sri Ganesh Sadan\u2019 will be used as a quarantine center in Kanipakam can be read here.\n\nTo summarize, the quarantine center seen in the video is not Kanipakam \u2018temple\u2019; it\u2019s a \u2018pilgrim lodge\u2019 in Kanipakam.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
