But it included China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the European Union \u2014 not just the United States and Iran.\n\nThe deal resulted in Iran getting access to some of its own funds \u2014 assets that had been frozen \u2014 it wasn\u2019t cash given to Iran by the United States.\n\nAnd $150 billion is a high-end estimate and the one with the least evidence to support it. The high-end estimate from the U.S. Treasury Department in 2015 was $56 billion, and outside analysts believed the number could be lower.\n\nPer the deal, the United States and other countries lifted the sanctions and the funds were unfrozen after nuclear inspectors verified in January 2016 that Iran was doing enough to curb its nuclear program.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that it was not clear what became of the unfrozen funds.\n\nIn January 2016, then-Secretary of State John Kerry said he expected that some of the money ultimately would end up with organizations involved in terrorism.\n\nA Facebook post claimed: \"Iran will be shooting at our soldiers with bullets, etc., purchased with the $150 billion Obama gave them.\"\n\nThe 2015 Iran nuclear deal involved multiple nations, not just the United States under Obama, and did not involve the United States giving cash to Iran.\n\nIt\u2019s also debatable whether Iran ultimately got access to $150 billion of what were its own assets \u2014 which had been frozen in retaliation for its pursuit of a nuclear weapon \u2014 or whether the amount was much less.\n\nWhat is correct is that largely because of the U.S. involvement, the deal resulted Iran getting access to likely tens of billions of dollars of its own funds, and it\u2019s unclear how they might be spent.\n\nFor a statement that contains only an element of truth, our ruling is Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
