It will slow down, or stop, chain migration while protecting American workers and potentially saving taxpayers money.\"\n\nFacebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Americatb.com doesn\u2019t indicate who\u2019s behind the website or what its mission is, and it doesn\u2019t list contact information.\n\nTrump in June 2017 did say he wanted new immigration rules that would bar new immigrants from public benefits for a period of at least five years. But as we pointed out back then, there\u2019s already a federal law that does that.\n\nThe Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 said immigrants who entered the United States on or after Aug. 22, 1996, would not be eligible for federal \"means-tested\" public benefits for five years, starting on the date of their entry into the United States with a status meeting the definition of \"qualified alien,\" which includes lawful permanent residents.\n\nThe law did outline several exemptions and said certain groups were not subject to the five-year restriction, including refugees and asylees, military veterans and active-duty military members, along with their spouses and unmarried dependent children.\n\nThe americatb.com post accurately cited remarks Trump made in an August 2017 weekly address: \"Just this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based Green Card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy. As an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s weekly address alluded to the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act introduced by Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and David Perdue, R-Ga. Their bill does include a provision to prevent immigrants admitted under their proposed skills-based points system from receiving federal means-tested public benefits for five years.\n\nBut as fellow fact-checkers at Factcheck.org have noted, while the RAISE Act tightens eligibility requirements, many would still remain eligible.\n\nThe RAISE Act\u2019s provision also only applies to those admitted under the skills-based system, which as Cotton has said, currently represents a small fraction of immigrants legally admitted per year. (The RAISE Act also seeks to limit family-based immigration.)\n\nAmericatb.com\u2019s post mixes in opinions and hypotheticals (\"Let\u2019s say one million immigrants each get $30,000 worth of welfare benefits per year. That\u2019s $30,000,000,000 of free welfare money sucked out of the American budget for people who put NOTHING back into our society, culture, or anything at all\") but no evidence to back it\u2019s claim that Trump \"just ended welfare\" for immigrants.", "lang": "en"}
