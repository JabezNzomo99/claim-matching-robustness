A parody video turns into an opportunity for right-wingers to mock Muslims", "subtitle": "", "author": "www.altnews.in", "date": "2017-05-05T19:05:58+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-84452", "url": "https://www.altnews.in/shampoo-hijab-parody-video-turns-opportunity-right-wingers-mock-muslims/", "vclaim": "How silly would it be to rub shampoo over a hijab? That is the first thought that comes to mind when you see this short clip of what is being circulated on social media as a \u201cMalaysian shampoo advertisement\u201d. In the clip, a woman is seen putting shampoo on her hijab. It seems absurd and hilarious at the same time. An image apparently even found its way to 9gag and the video started going viral. For some, it soon turned into a chance to ridicule hijab and Muslims. And that is perhaps the reason why it has gone viral on social media. What is the real story behind this video? Read on.\n\nThe video started doing its rounds on social media with folks initially asking \u201cIs she shampooing her hijab?\u201d\n\nSoon it turned into \u201cCan it get any more stupid?\u201d\n\nRight-wing websites could not let go of this brilliant opportunity to display their prejudices and take a dig at Muslims and Islam. \u201cShampoo advt reveals deplorable condition of Muslim women!\u201c, screamed the headline at 99Wiki. The article went on to say, \u201cevery Bigot Libtard will relentlessly advocate liberal modern Islam. They all stand exposed now, by something as simple as a shampoo advertisement\u201d, followed by \u201cwhat kind of a medieval religion is this?\u201d\n\nA website called Indian Voice went on to highlight \u201cdraconian Sharia law\u201d and \u201csecond class status of women in the Muslim society\u201d. It was also a chance to hit out at feminists who the article said \u201cthese days can be seen repeating, how \u2018beautiful\u2019 and \u2018free\u2019 Hizab is\u201d.\n\nA Malaysian scarf company called \u201cEscarves\u201d and its advertising agency decided to make a parody of an old Sunsilk shampoo advertisement to promote their scarves. It was meant to be a satirical take on the original Sunsilk advertisement. The video recreated the cliched love scene of the past that was used in the 2006 Sunsilk advertisement. The parody video was titled \u2018Budak 90an Je Tahu Iklan-Iklan Macam Ni\u2019 (Translation: Only \u201990s Kids Will Understand This).\n\nThe original Sunsilk shampoo advertisement can be seen below.\n\nThe full Escarves video can be seen below. Much is lost in translation but as the Malaysian site explains, for Malaysians it was actually meant to be a funny video.\n\nThe founder of the Escarves, Eyda Sukiman, also stated on her Facebook profile that the video is just a parody video. We are posting a screenshot of her post in Malaysian with the Facebook provided translation.\n\nA representative of the company told Cilicos, \u201cOur headscarves are as comfy as how your hair would feel after shampooing. That was what we were trying to deliver in the video.\u201d\n\nWhen an extract from the video was shared without the full context, what was meant to be a funny video for Malaysians turned into a chance for the rest of the world to ridicule them. While for some it was nothing more than a good laugh at a seemingly absurd clip, for right-wing websites and right-wing social media users, it served their agenda of mocking at Muslims. These websites, which set out to expose their favourite targets, ie liberals, feminists and Muslims by writing articles based on this parody shampoo advertisement, will now find that it is their bigoted mindset that stands exposed.
