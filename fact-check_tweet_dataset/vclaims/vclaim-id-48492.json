These stories were aggregated selectively from an Oct. 14, 2019, New York Times report in which the term \u201chostage\u201d is used to describe the status of the weapons.\n\nThe report reflects new tensions at the border of Turkey and northern Syria after President Donald Trump abruptly pulled U.S. troops from their positions supporting Kurdish allies in that region, where troops had been fighting with Islamic State terrorists. Trump\u2019s actions precipitated a deadly attack by Turkey against the Kurds.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision also drew sharp bipartisan rebuke and resulted in a deterioration of U.S. relations with Turkey, including economic sanctions imposed by the Trump administration and reports that American troops came under Turkish fire.\n\nThe escalation drew attention to the long-standing concern that some 50 nuclear weapons are stored at the U.S. air base in Incirlik, just dozens of miles from the Syrian border. Some have for years expressed concerns about the security of those weapons, citing instability in the region. The Times reported:\n\nAnd over the weekend, State and Energy Department officials were quietly reviewing plans for evacuating roughly 50 tactical nuclear weapons that the United States had long stored, under American control, at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, about 250 miles from the Syrian border, according to two American officials. Those weapons, one senior official said, were now essentially Erdogan\u2019s hostages. To fly them out of Incirlik would be to mark the de facto end of the Turkish-American alliance. To keep them there, though, is to perpetuate a nuclear vulnerability that should have been eliminated years ago. \u201cI think this is a first \u2014 a country with U.S. nuclear weapons stationed in it literally firing artillery at US forces,\u201d Jeffrey Lewis of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies wrote last week. For his part, Mr. Erdogan claims nuclear ambitions of his own: Only a month ago, speaking to supporters, he said he \u201ccannot accept\u201d rules that keep Turkey from possessing nuclear weapons of its own.\n\nThe report, which came just after Turkey\u2019s invasion of northern Syria, raised the potentially disastrous specter of the Turkish government taking hold of American nukes.\n\nIt\u2019s not an impossible scenario, but it\u2019s unlikely, said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, a private graduate school in Vermont. And describing the weapons as \u201chostages\u201d is metaphorical. The weapons are not literally being held \u201chostage\u201d by Erdogan in that the U.S. can take them out of Incirlik any time it chooses.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. could take them out tomorrow if they wanted,\u201d Lewis said. But the problem is that \u201csome people don\u2019t want to take them out, because if they do, they\u2019ll never be able to put them back in.\u201d\n\nLewis added that he doesn\u2019t believe it would end diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Turkey if the U.S. decided to remove the weapons, although he noted it would be tricky amid the tense situation involving the Kurds.\n\nHe also raised doubts about how much the Turks prioritize the weapons, noting the weapons stored at Incirlik are gravity bombs \u2014 they can only be delivered via aircraft, and no Turkish aircraft certified to deliver nuclear weapons exist. The United States also doesn\u2019t keep an aircraft that can deliver nukes permanently parked at Incirlik, either. In other words, Lewis said, \u201cit\u2019s basically a storage depot.\u201d\n\nAlthough it\u2019s true there are about 50 American nuclear weapons being stored at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, the weapons are in the possession of the U.S. military. Erdogan is not literally holding them \u201chostage\u201d so much as new developments in Turkey have made it more complicated for the U.S. to move them out. However, the weapons remain under U.S. control, and as it stands, the U.S. retains the power to move them out of Turkey at will.", "lang": "en"}
