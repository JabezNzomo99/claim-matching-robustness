But here at The Fact Checker, we often are wary when politicians start to negatively quote other politicians, because all too frequently those quotes are taken out of context.\n\nHere, Clinton is referring to a quote from Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R), who in 2012 signed a repeal of a 2009 law that allowed equal-pay lawsuits to be filed in state court, in addition to federal courts. He argued that the law \u2014 which was crafted and passed when Democrats controlled the state government \u2014 was duplicative and \u201ccould clog up the legal system,\u201d given there were other administrative and federal options available.\n\nWalker said there was no attempt to hide anything, and the bill-signing did nothing harmful to women. \u201cIt\u2019s a bogus issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is against the law to discriminate against women for employment and to pay them less than you pay men, and it will continue to be.\u201d\n\nClinton claimed that Walker \u201cdismissed equal pay as \u2018a bogus issue.\u2019\u201d But in context, it appears that Walker is referring to debate over when he signed the repeal, or perhaps that he has a problem with women. It certainly does not appear that he said that concerns about equal pay are bogus.\n\nIn this sentence, Clinton attacks Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), who, like all Senate Republicans, opposed the Democratic-sponsored Paycheck Fairness Act. Again, the battle lines between the parties were drawn over whether the law would result in more litigation. (We obviously take no position on the legislation but trial lawyers tend to be major financial backers of Democrats, not Republicans.)\n\nIn a 2014 interview with Jake Tapper on CNN, Rubio was asked about executive actions that President Obama had taken to address the pay gap between men and women. \u201cI think it is a legitimate issue to focus on because of have millions of women trapped in low-paying jobs for a multiple of reasons,\u201d Rubio said, adding that he wanted to find ways to provide more educational opportunities and better career options for women.\n\nIn other words, he was concerned about the pay gap but objected, on substantive grounds, to the proposal before the Senate \u2014 which had no chance of getting any Republican votes. So the \u201cwasting time\u201d comment referred to debating a politically oriented bill that had no hope of passage. (In fact, by 2014, the bill had been rejected in the Senate several times.) Rubio did not say that Congress was wasting time worrying about it; in fact, he said it was a \u201clegitimate issue to focus on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree hundred million people get to vote everyday on what you should be paid or what the price of goods are. In the Soviet Union, the Politburo decided the price of bread, and they either had no bread or too much bread. So setting prices or wages by the government is always a bad idea. \u2026 The minute you set up a fairness czar to determine what wages are, you give away freedom. When you give that power to someone to make decisions, they may well discriminate in favor of whoever they want to discriminate in favor of. The market just makes decisions on your ability to do your job.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton spokesman said she was not \u201csaying that the Paycheck Fairness Act, something she believes is a piece of the solution, would solve the problem on its own.\u2026 She specifies several areas that contribute to the problem that could be fixed. Unfortunately, Republicans obstruct attempts to fix any of these problem areas, including repealing state legislation or blocking or dismissing federal legislation.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
