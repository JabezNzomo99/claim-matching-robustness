Not, that's not true: The claim was made in a post on a site clearly labeled as satire and part of a well-known network of satirical websites that trolls conservatives with fiction to rile up their base.\n\nThe claim appeared in an article (archived here) published by Daily World Update on March 18, 2020, titled \"Fox News Wins Pulitzer Prize for Reporting During Crisis\" which opened:\n\nHannity, Laura, and the whole gang over at Fox News are in for a MAGA surprise! It has just been announced that they are winning one of the most coveted awards in journalism -- the Pulitzer. Oh, the liberal media is going to be kicking dirt about this one. This accolade is specific to their \"fair and balanced\" coverage of the crisis. The network has been on the ball through this entire ordeal, making sure the public is educated on the dangers of the current crisis. Joe Barron, Chairman of the Pulitzer Committee had this to say about the nomination: \"We are pleased to announce that Pulitzer is awarding Fox News with the 'Illusory Reporting Award.' This is an honor we reserve only for them, as they have earned their place as leader in this category. Congratulations to the network and their viewership. You are America!\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nUnder the tagline \"Illusory Reporting Award!\" the post said:\n\nHannity, Laura, and the whole gang over at Fox News are in for a MAGA surprise! It has just been announced that they are winning one of the most coveted awards in journalism -- the Pulitzer. Oh, the liberal media is going to be kicking dirt about this one. This accolade is specific to their \"fair and balanced\" coverage of the crisis. The network has been on the ball through this entire ordeal, making sure the public is educated on the dangers of the current crisis.\n\nIn fact, none of the Pulitzer Prizes for 2020 have been announced. According to the Pulitzer Prize website, winners will be revealed in April, when the prizes traditionally are announced.\n\nAlso, there is no Pulitzer Prize category for \"illusory reporting.\"\n\nMerriam-Webster online dictionary defines illusory as \"based on or producing illusion,\" and the satirical article cites examples from Fox News and links to clips from Fox broadcasts. The story says this about host Sean Hannity:\n\nRegarding host Laura Ingraham, the article, misspelling her name, says:\n\nReaders are told upfront that the entire site for Daily World Update is satire, with the site's masthead carrying the slogan, \"SATIRE FOR FLATEARTHERS, TRUMPSTERS AND Y'ALL QAEDA.\" And, in its \"About\" section, the states: \"If you can seriously read this stuff and think it can be passed off as real to reasonable people, you need to go out, right now, and buy a sense of humor and a clue.\"\n\nDaily World Update is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run by self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies.\n\nBlair has been in a feud with fact-checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact-checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this, he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites that often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past, but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nHere is a video of Blair explaining how his process works:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer, it is, of course, also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalists to rank the reliability of websites, describes dailyworldupdate.us as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard, the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
