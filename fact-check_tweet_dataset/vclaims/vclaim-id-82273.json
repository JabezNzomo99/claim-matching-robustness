These are some of Scott Walker\u2019s favorite lines that he has repeated over and over for years. And they have been fact-checked repeatedly for years. He repeated these numbers during the recent GOP debate, and continues to do so on the campaign trail. So it\u2019s worth scrutinizing them again.\n\nWisconsin, like most states, has a statutory requirement to balance its budgets. So when governors talk about a \u201cbudget deficit,\u201d they often are referring to how much money the state would need in the upcoming budget year if the spending and revenue levels remain the same. This is also called a \u201cstructural deficit\u201d in Wisconsin budget-speak. Wisconsin state officials also use the word \u201cdeficit\u201d to describe the difference between the amount of money that agencies are asking to spend, and the amount of projected tax revenue.\n\nWisconsin has a two-year budget cycle. Walker took office in 2011, and his first two-year budget took effect that July. Walker\u2019s predecessor estimated the budget shortfall would be $1.5 billion to $2.2 billion. A month after Walker took office, his staff\u2019s new estimate increased that figure to $3.6 billion. Walker\u2019s spokeswoman Laurel Patrick said there were \u201cgaping holes\u201d in the budget because ongoing expenses were being paid with one-time stimulus money and by dipping into different funds.\n\nWalker enacted spending cuts and stopped using one-time money or raiding other funds to pay for ongoing expenses. For Walker\u2019s second biennium budget, the state general fund saw a surplus for the first time since at least 1997, according to Legislative Fiscal Bureau calculations.\n\n\u201cThe structural problem was persistent. It was biennium after biennium. One of the things they did with these cuts \u2014 especially for that one biennium [2011-13] \u2014 they got the state\u2019s fiscal health in order. Going into 2013-15, we were in better shape in terms of state finances than we had been for the last 15 years,\u201d said Dale Knapp, research director of at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a non-partisan research group.\n\nRelated: Earlier this year, PolitiFact Wisconsin gave a flip-flop rating to how Walker was portraying the current budget deficit. Instead of using the same measure he used when taking office in 2011 by adding agencies\u2019 increased spending requests to describe the shortfall, Walker used the structural deficit estimate that arrives at a lower figure.\n\nWe should note that although Walker juxtaposes the two statements about fixing the deficit and cutting taxes, voters should know that the two are not related, and they refer to two different time periods.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that there really could not have been a budget deficit because Wisconsin is required to balance its budget. When Walker talks about \u201cinheriting\u201d a $3.6 billion \u201cbudget deficit,\u201d he means that when his administration calculated the amount of revenues that would come in, and all the money that state agencies requested, he was left with a $3.6 billion hole to fill.\n\nIt\u2019s easy for state executives to use the state budget to make the point they want. Agencies tend to request for more money than the previous year (it is a wish list, after all) and it is the governor\u2019s job to prioritize their needs and match them to the amount of projected revenues. Including agency requests to describe the budget-balancing challenge he faced when he took office is fair, but it does skew the estimate upward.", "lang": "en"}
