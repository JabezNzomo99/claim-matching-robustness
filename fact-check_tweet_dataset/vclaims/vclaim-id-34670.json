The caption says, \"When covering President Trump\u2019s trip to England, why is it that every news channel is showing the same footage of Trump protesters but not one will show the Thousands who showed up in support? Well here is a photo of what English Trump Supporters look like.\"\n\nThe photo was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The BBC reported that police estimated more than 750,000 fans turned out to the victory parade.\n\nThe Liverpool Echo published an article on the miscaptioned photo.\n\nThe photo wasn\u2019t even snapped in London, where the president stayed during his 3-day visit. It took place in Liverpool, naturally, which is located more than 200 miles north of the country\u2019s capital. The team\u2019s predominant color is red and did not represent the red apparel that some of the president\u2019s supporters wear.\n\nThe claim comes as several outlets reported that tens of thousands of people gathered in the streets of London to protest Trump\u2019s visit. There were reportedly pockets of Trump supporters in those crowds, too, but this photo being captioned as \"thousands of English Trump supporters\" is incorrect.\n\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!\n\nCorrection, June 18, 2019: An earlier version of this story included a mistaken attribution for a story on the miscaptioned photo. The Liverpool Echo published the article. This correction does not change the rating.", "lang": "en"}
