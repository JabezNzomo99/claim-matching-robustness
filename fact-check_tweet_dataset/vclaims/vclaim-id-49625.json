The deficit was $101 billion for 2017, not $151 billion, as he repeatedly claims.\n\nTrump, for years, has been using the goods-only figures for the U.S. trade deficit, instead of the goods-and-services deficit, to justify his trade policies. Since the United States exports a lot of services \u2014 such as travel, transportation, finance and intellectual property \u2014 Trump skews the trade picture by completely discounting the service trade. The U.S., in fact, has an overall trade surplus in services.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump wrongly claimed again and again that the U.S. trade deficit was \u201cnearly $800 billion,\u201d a generous rounding-up of the goods-only deficit of $758.9 billion in 2015, the latest figure at the time. The overall goods-and-services deficit was $531.5 billion then. He repeatedly claimed the deficit with China was $500 billion \u2014 close to the overall deficit with all countries. (The latest figure for China is $335.7 billion for 2017, despite Trump\u2019s assertion on Feb. 15 that a \u201clot of people think it\u2019s $506 billion.\u201d)\n\nSimilarly, he has distorted the trade figures for Canada and Mexico.\n\nTrump continues to falsely claim the U.S. has \u201clarge trade deficits with Mexico and Canada,\u201d when there\u2019s a trade surplus with Canada ($2.8 billion in 2017), and the deficit with Mexico ($68.7 billion) amounts to 11 percent of the total two-way trade with the U.S.\n\nThe president made his latest false claim about U.S. trade with the EU during an appearance with the federal chancellor of Austria. A reporter asked about a potential tariff Trump has proposed on automobiles and auto parts from the EU. In his response, Trump said:\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of money, but the wrong figure. It\u2019s 50 percent higher than the actual trade deficit with the EU.\n\nAnd the trade deficit has been going up under Trump. It was $101.2 billion with the EU in 2017, up nearly 10 percent from $92.1 billion in 2016, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis figures published by the Census Bureau. In the last four quarters \u2014 from the fourth quarter of 2017 through the third quarter of 2018 \u2014 the deficit was $113 billion.\n\nTrump consistently uses the goods-only figure, which also has risen, from $146.8 billion in 2016 to $151.4 billion in 2017 and $154.2 billion in 2018.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post Fact Checker\u2019s database of Trump\u2019s claims, the president has repeated his false claim about the EU trade deficit 131 times.\n\nTotal trade between the EU and U.S. was $1.1 trillion in 2016, and the EU is the largest goods trading partner for the U.S., according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.\n\nEarly last summer, Trump threatened to put a 20 percent tariff on cars exported from the EU to the United States. At the time, the U.S. had added new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, including those from the EU, and the EU retaliated with tariffs on U.S. products. On July 27, the EU and the United States agreed to hold trade negotiations and to not impose further tariffs in the meantime.\n\nIn an Aug. 21 rally in West Virginia, the president said: \u201cWe are going to put a 25 percent tax on every car that comes from the European Union into the United States. And that\u2019ll take our loss and trade deficit of $151 billion dollars and give us a surplus of $151 billion.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 17, the Commerce Department submitted a study to Trump on how automobile and auto parts imports affect national security. Under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, the president can implement trade restrictions if the Commerce Department finds that imports harm national security. Such a finding was used by Trump to apply the steel and aluminum tariffs last year.\n\nThe president has 90 days after receiving the report from the Commerce Department to decide whether to act on the report\u2019s recommendations, as a Congressional Research Service report on Section 232 explains.", "lang": "en"}
