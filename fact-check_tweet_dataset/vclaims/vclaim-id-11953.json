The claim has been circulating online since at least 2017.\n\na similar claim that Gallo owned up to creating Aids, this time to \u201cdepopulate the world\u201d.\n\n\u201cDr Robert Gallo has never \u2018admitted that he created Aids in order to reduce the world\u2019s population,\u2019 or made any statement remotely to that effect,\u201d Snopes said. \u201cThis claim is entirely false and fabricated.\u201d\n\nSnopes found the claim on a number of websites known for hoaxes. In 2016 and 2017, stories claiming Gallo \u201cinvented\u201d HIV were published in\n\nThe reworked claim that Gallo confessed to inventing HIV to \u201cwipe out the African race\u201d is particularly jarring. Some 53% of people living with HIV globally are found in eastern and southern Africa, according to\n\n.
