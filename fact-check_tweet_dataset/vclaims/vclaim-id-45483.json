It is being claimed that the Indian Army Troops are being deployed at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above video and found that the claim attached to it is FAKE.\n\nWe began our investigation by putting the video through InVid tool and then putting the extracted keyframes through Reverse Image Search. The results led us to a YouTube video uploaded on July 29, 2019.\n\nThe title of the video read, \u2018This is amazing an indian army convoys traveling from #Ladakh to Srinagar'(sic).\n\nNewsMobile could not independently verify the origin of the video. But, the above information establishes the fact that the video in question is old as it was already in circulation on the internet much before the recent tensions between Indian and Chinese troops along the LAC, escalated.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
