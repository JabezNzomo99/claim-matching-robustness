While the original placard said \"Hindu Hoon, Chutiya Nahi\" (I'm a Hindu, not an Idiot), the placard in the image posted by Agnihotri said, \"Chutiya Hoon, Hindu Nahi\" (I'm an idiot, not a Hindu).\n\nAgnihotri posted the doctored photo with the caption: \"\u0932\u093f\u0916\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u091c\u093c\u0930\u0942\u0930\u0924 \u0925\u0940\u0964 \u0936\u0915\u094d\u0932 \u0932\u0947\u0902\u0917\u0940 \u0932\u093f\u0916\u093e \u0939\u0941\u0906 \u0939\u0948\u0964\", which roughly translates to, \"What was the point of writing it, it is written on your face.\"\n\nThe tweet carried an image of a man carrying a placard which said \"Chutiya Hoon, Hindu Nahi\", that translates to \"I'm an idiot, not a Hindu\". The tweet went viral in a matter of hours, with 1200 retweets and 4200 likes at the time of writing this article.\n\nThis tweet was shared in the backdrop of nationwide protests against the Citizenship Amendement Act and the violence carried out in Jawaharlal Nehru University.\n\n\n\nBOOM did a reverse image search and traced this image back to December 20, 2019, as part of compilation of images of anti-CAA protesters and placards. In the photos that we observed that the text on the placard read, \"Hindu Hoon, Chutiya Nahi\", that translates to, \"I'm a Hindu, not an idiot.\"\n\nWe placed the two images next to each other, to get a better idea of which picture is doctored.\n\nAlso Read Vivek Agnihotri Tweets Misleading Video Of Kanhaiya Kumar Speaking About Islam\n\nThe cardboard on the image on the left (posted by Agnihotri) appears unrealistic, with the area around the text appearing pixelated. Furthermore, the cardboard also lacks the marks from the folds, which can be clearly seen in the photo on the right. This revealed that the image on the left has been doctored, to switch two words on the placard - \"Hindu\" and \"Chutiya\".\n\nThe phrase \"Hindu Hoon, Chutiya Nahi\" has been frequently used by anti-CAA protesters, with the text appearing in placards across the country.\n\nFurthermore, BOOM reporters covering the anti-CAA protest in Mumbai on December 19, 2019 had come across this individual with the placard in person, who confirmed to us that the placard said, \"Hindu Hoon, Chutiya Nahi.\"", "lang": "en"}
