Though the page has since been deleted, it can be seen in cached form online.\n\nThe New York Daily News picked up on the quote and built a story around it, while noting that none of its four reporters covering the local version of the march saw \u201cany evidence\u201d of significant support for the new president. That story was also deleted, but it is also available in cached form.\n\nEven before being deleted, \u201cVPMikePence\u201d had tipped its hand regarding its nature with a series of politically-aggressive posts:\n\nPence does have his own certified Facebook page, as well as one he maintained while he was governor of Indiana.\n\nThough the statement and profile was bogus, we contacted organizers of the march seeking confirmation of any encounters with Trump supporters during the event. They have yet to respond.", "lang": "en"}
