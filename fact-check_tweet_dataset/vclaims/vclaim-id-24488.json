Mark Mezvinski is George Soro\u2019s (sic) nephew!!\"\n\nThis post, which includes the words @illuminati killers, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe claim isn\u2019t a new one, and it was amplified by the actress Roseanne Barr last year when she accused Clinton of being married to Soros\u2019 nephew and tweeted: \"Chelsea Soros Clinton.\"\n\nClinton retweeted Barr \u2014 Barr\u2019s tweet has since been deleted \u2014 and said: \"Good morning Roseanne - my given middle name is Victoria. I imagine George Soros\u2019s nephews are lovely people. I\u2019m just not married to one. I am grateful for the important work @OpenSociety does in the world. Have a great day!\"\n\nClinton married her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, whose name was misspelled in the Facebook post, in July 2010. Reuters reported that the only high profile guests seen in the town where they married other than former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were Madeleine Albright, who served as secretary of state under Bill Clinton, actors Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen, and fashion designer Vera Wang.\n\nMezvinsky is an investment banker and the son of Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Edward Mezvinsky, both former Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nSearching the Nexis database for anything involving the couple, George Soros, and the word \"nephew,\" we found 35 news stories. They were all about Roseanne Barr\u2019s allegation that Clinton is married to Soros\u2019s nephew. And they didn\u2019t corroborate her claim.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find any evidence to lend credence to this Facebook post. We rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
