He\u2019s comparing Labour\u2019s record since 2006/07 with that of the Coalition and Conservative governments.\n\nUsing these figures, the rate of growth in private providers is very similar under both governments, and is higher under Labour counting its spending up to 2010/11.\n\nWhen people refer to NHS \u2018privatisation\u2019, they\u2019re often talking about NHS services that are outsourced to private providers. The use of non-NHS providers to supply NHS-funded hospital care is something that divides public opinion.\n\n\u2018Non-NHS healthcare\u2019 isn\u2019t the same thing as \u2018private\u2019 healthcare. A small amount of the care we receive is also provided by local authorities and charities, purchased by the NHS.\n\nAbout 7.6% of NHS revenue spending in 2015/16 went on purchasing care just from private providers, according to Department of Health accounts. If you include all non-NHS providers then this goes up to 10.7%.\n\nThe government recently published figures on the proportion of the NHS budget spent just on private providers over the past five years and provided older figures to us at the last election in 2015. Using this we can reconstruct a rough picture of what\u2019s been happening since 2006.\n\n2.8% of NHS spending went to private providers in 2006/07, rising to 4.4% in Labour\u2019s last full year in government and 4.9% in the first year of the Coalition.\n\nThe rate of growth is actually very similar in Labour\u2019s last years in office compared to the Coalition and Conservative governments. Who is higher is different depending on whether you count 2010/11\u2019s spending as under Labour or the Coalition, which is ambiguous.\n\nThe proportion of spending on private providers under Labour rose by 75% if you include 2010/11, compared to 55% since then, those figures are roughly reversed if you look at Labour just up to 2009/10.\n\nPrevious research from the King\u2019s Fund has shown that the rate of use of private providers isn\u2019t the same across the NHS. Between 2011/12 and 2012/13 for instance, community health services saw increases in purchases of private care while spending in acute care fell between 2010/11 and 2012/13.\n\nSpending is just one way to measure the level of private involvement in the NHS, another is to look at the proportion of contracts for providing services that they hold. Looking at it this way, a larger proportion of contracts are in the hands of private providers because they tend to hold much smaller contracts than NHS providers.\n\nFor example, according to one estimate private providers only accounted for 5% of spending on community care contracts in England, they held 39% of them in 2016. that\u2019s according to Freedom of Information requests from 78% of CCGs gathered by the Health Foundation think tank.", "lang": "en"}
