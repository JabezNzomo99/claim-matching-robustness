In fact, during the March 30 interview, Blitzer asked, \u201cWell, is it accurate that if these steps had not been put in place, the stay at home orders, the social distancing orders, as the president said yesterday, it could have been 2 million people dead here in the United States?\u201d The ad gives no hint that the question was about social distancing, not travel restrictions.\n\nAnd while Gupta ultimately gave a positive response to Blitzer\u2019s question, it is much more nuanced than the ad suggests. Gupta answered, \u201cI mean, you know, these are all models, Wolf. It\u2019s a little tough to say, but, you know, if you talk about something that is spreading, you know, very robustly throughout a community. You know, two to three times more contagious than flu, and up to 10 times, perhaps even more than that, more deadly than flu, then yes. I mean, that\u2019s when you start to get those sorts of numbers. I mean, you know, this is a pathogen that obviously is, can cause a lot of disease and death.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for WarnerMedia, CNN\u2019s parent company, wrote a letter to the Trump campaign asking it to \u201ccease and desist\u201d from airing the ad.\n\n\u201cThe advertisement purposely and deceptively edits the clip to imply that Mr. Blitzer and Dr. Gupta were crediting the President\u2019s travel ban policy issued in January for saving millions of American lives, when in fact Mr. Blitzer and Dr. Gupta were discussing recently implemented social distancing guidelines and stay-at-home orders issued by state and local governments,\u201d said the letter written by WarnerMedia Senior Vice President and Associate General Counsel Rick McMurtry. \u201cSuch misuse of CNN content is false, misleading and deceptive.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to our request for comment. Trump campaign Communications Director Tim Murtaugh has defended the ad. He told CNN, \u201cNo discussion of efforts to prevent American deaths from the coronavirus can be had without the understanding that President Trump restricted travel from China in January. Based on that alone, the ad is accurate.\u201d\n\nThe novel coronavirus pandemic began in Wuhan, China, late last year. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced the China travel restrictions on Jan. 31. Trump has frequently referred to the action as a \u201ctravel ban,\u201d but as we have written, that is a misnomer.\n\nThe policy prohibits non-U.S. citizens who have traveled to China within the previous two weeks from entering the U.S. But the rules don\u2019t apply to U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents and their immediate family members. And they don\u2019t bar importing goods from China.\n\nA New York Times story on April 4 found that nearly 40,000 people had flown on direct flights from China to the United States in the two months after the travel restrictions went into effect.\n\nWithout evidence, in at least two briefings, the president claimed that his travel restrictions \u201csaved tens of thousands\u201d and even \u201chundreds of thousands of lives.\u201d We found no support for such figures, and the White House didn\u2019t provide any.\n\nThe few studies that have been done suggest that travel restrictions several countries enacted slowed the initial spread outside of China but did not contain the virus. Past studies also have found travel restrictions could delay the path of the spread of diseases but do little to contain them.\n\nThe ad, titled \u201cAmerican Comeback,\u201d also repeats an inaccurate claim on the U.S. economy that Trump has made many times before.\n\nIn the ad, Trump says, \u201cWe built the greatest economy the world has ever seen, and we\u2019re going to do it again.\u201d This echoes a line Trump used at least 11 times at coronavirus briefings in April: that America had \u201cthe greatest economy in the history of the world\u201d before the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe economy was in good shape before the coronavirus outbreak, with stocks soaring and unemployment low. But it was by no means the greatest economy in history. As we have written, the economy has gone through many periods of more robust growth than it has under the Trump administration. Over the last 39 years \u2014 dating to Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency \u2014 the nation\u2019s real economic growth has reached or exceeded Trump\u2019s peak year of 2.9% 19 times.\n\nThe ad features two Democratic governors praising federal efforts to help the states during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn one clip, the ad shows New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying, \u201cWhat the federal government did was a phenomenal accomplishment.\u201d The clip was edited from the original statement, which came during an April 19 press conference: \u201cLook, what the federal government did working with states, as I just said, was a phenomenal accomplishment.\u201d Cuomo did praise the federal government, along with others, in working to help flatten the curve.\n\n\u201cThe federal government stepped up and was a great partner and I\u2019m the first one to say it. We needed help and they were there,\u201d Cuomo went on to say. \u201cState and local governments were fantastic. The hospital system was fantastic. New Yorkers were fantastic. And that is an undeniable fact.\u201d\n\nIn another, California Gov. Gavin Newsom says, \u201cPromise made, promise kept.\u201d Newsom made that comment in connection with a shipment the federal government had sent California of 90,000 testing swabs, which Trump had promised in a conversation with Newsom.\n\nCuomo and Trump, who both come from Queens, have had an up and down relationship during the pandemic. Newsom, formerly a Trump critic, has said many positive things about the president of late. Trump has stressed the importance to him of governors expressing appreciation for his help.\n\nCNN said it learned about the ad on May 1 when it was submitted as part of a campaign ad buy. Television networks routinely review ads to make sure there is no problematic content. The Trump campaign said it is spending \u201cmid-seven figures\u201d on the ad, which is running nationally this week on broadcast and cable outlets. It debuted May 3 before Trump\u2019s Fox News virtual town hall. So far, the campaign has spent nearly $500,000 on the ad, according to Advertising Analytics.\n\nMcMurtry\u2019s letter said the cable news outlet contacted the Trump campaign\u2019s ad agency, Harris Sikes Media, asking that the ad be corrected. \u201cCNN was willing to accept the advertisement if the misuse had been corrected,\u201d McMurtry wrote. \u201cDespite this notice, you refused to correct the advertisement and knowingly proceeded with distributing the advertisement as is with the misleading claim.\u201d\n\nTo sum up, there is no doubt that the ad edited the exchange between Blitzer and Gupta in a way that was misleading.\n\nFactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
