The claim is false; the clip has been edited; the original video shows lawmaker Rahul Gandhi, the former president of the Indian National Congress (INC) political party, making a clear statement about the need for local control regarding COVID-19 classifications.\n\nThe six-second video has been viewed more than 2,000 times after it was published on Facebook here on May 9, 2020.\n\nGandhi can be seen in the video saying: \u201cRed zone is actually green zone and the green zone is actually red zone.\u201d\n\nThe post\u2019s Hindi-language caption translates to English as: \u201cPotato from behind and gold from the front, and now the red zone is green and green zone is red. What is this?\u201d\n\nThe comment on \u201cpotato from behind and gold from the front\u201d is a reference to another edited clip of Gandhi that was shared in April 2019. The video distorted his comments about political pledges to farmers, as AFP reported here.\n\n\u201cRed zone\u201d and \u201cgreen zone\u201d refers to the colour-coded classifications system that India uses to determine necessary lockdown measures in certain areas based on the level of COVID-19 infections.\n\nThe clip of Gandhi was also published alongside a similar claim on Facebook, here, here, here and here, and on Twitter here, here, here and here. It was also viewed more than 500,000 times after being published on Twitter here by a spokesperson for India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\nA reverse image search with video keyframes extracted using InVID-WeVerify, a digital verification tool, found the original video of Gandhi\u2019s full remarks published here on the INC\u2019s verified YouTube channel on May 7, 2020.\n\n\u201cConstructive Suggestions on Covid19: Press Briefing by Shri Rahul Gandhi via video conferencing,\u201d the video\u2019s caption reads.\n\nResponding to a journalist\u2019s question at the video\u2019s 19-minute 50-second mark, Gandhi makes a clear argument that colour classifications should be determined by state and district level authorities and not the central national government.\n\n\u201cThese zones - red, orange and green - have been determined on a national-level. It should be determined on a state level. Chief Ministers are telling us that at the national level what is red zone is actually green zone and green zone is actually red zone,\u201d Gandhi says.\n\nIn the edited clip that was shared in the misleading posts, the words \u201cat the national level\u201d have been omitted to make Gandhi\u2019s remarks seem unclear.", "lang": "en"}
