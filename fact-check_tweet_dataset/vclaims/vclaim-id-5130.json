The rate of prisoners escaping from prison has reached a record low. As I understand it, prisoners with a history of escaping or absconding while on temporary release are prevented from transferring to open conditions other than in the more exceptional cases.\"\n\nPhilip Davies is right that there were 363 offenders serving a murder sentence in open prisons on 31 December 2013 and that 179 offenders in open prisons as at 30 May 2014 had previously absconded from an open prison.\n\nAbsconds are when there isn't a physical barrier to prisoners' escapes, and overwhelmingly happen at open prisons.\n\nThere were 106 murderers who had absconded from open prisons in the ten years up until 2012/13. But these aren't the latest figures he has, which show that were 122 in the ten years up until 2013/14.\n\nThe Prime Minister's claim of a 39% drop in the number of prisoners who breach their temporary licence conditions is true. And it is right to say this is at a record low (53 failures per 100,000 incidents of release in 2014) with those who breach being returned to a closed prison. But breaches of temporary licence aren't the same as absconding, which is what Philip Davies was referring to.", "lang": "en"}
