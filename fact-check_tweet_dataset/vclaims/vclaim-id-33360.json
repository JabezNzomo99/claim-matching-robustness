No, that's not true, the story was made up by a Canadian website that publishes fictional tales of bizarre crimes and weird sex acts purely for entertainment purposes. It was later copied by a \"fauxtire\" site. But it is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on October 12, 2018 titled \"Woman arrested for trying out dozens of sex toys in the middle of a Walmart store\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUnion City, California | A woman was arrested this morning after stripping almost naked in a Walmart store to test various sex toys in front of dozens of shocked customers. The Union City Police Department received a call from the department store manager around 9:45 this morning, reporting that a customer was behaving indecently. Upon arriving on the site, the officers found 27-year old Laura Martinez lying almost naked on the floor and masturbating with a vibrator.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe story was later copied by 8shit:\n\nBut image of the woman in question is just an old mugshot picture floating around the internet:\n\nAnd the website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories. The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Pro-Choice Activist Did NOT Break World Record By Getting 27th Abortion\n\u2022 Fake News: Daughter NOT Kicked Out of Home After She Refused To Wash Hair For Six Years\n\u2022 Fake News: Obese Couple Did NOT Make Three-Story Fall After Floor Collapses During Sex\n\u2022 Fake News: Australian Police Officer NOT Beaten And Sexually Assaulted By Kangaroo\n\u2022 Fake News: Drunk Driver NOT Accused of Swallowing Breathalyzer To Avoid Arrest", "lang": "en"}
