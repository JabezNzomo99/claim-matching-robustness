The claim that is going viral with the video is that it shows the pathetic situation of a 90-year old man who is unable to bury his son\u2019s dead body since two days due to the existing conditions in Kashmir. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Video of an old man who is unable to bury his son\u2019s dead body for two days due to the existing conditions in Kashmir. Fact: Video is from Syria and it shows a father looking at his dead son who was killed in the attacks of the Russian Air Force. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen the video in the post was run through \u2018InVid\u2019 plugin, several keyframes of it were obtained. On subjecting these keyframes to reverse image search, many search results were obtained which make it clear that the video is of an old man looking at his son killed during the Russian airstrikes in Syria.\n\nWhen looked for news reports regarding this incident, a Ukranian news agency \u201cApostrophe\u201d has published an article with the same video that was posted on Facebook. From the article, it was found that nine civilians were killed and 20 were injured in Syria due to the attacks of the Russian Air Force. And, the video is that of a 90-year-old father saying goodbye to his son, who was killed during those attacks. The news regarding Russian Air Force attacks on Syria can be also seen in the article of Ukranian newspaper \u201c112\u201d.\n\nOwing to the virality of the claim going along with the video, \u201cPrasar Bharati News Services\u201d has put a tweet regarding the video saying that \u2018Old video from Syria presented as Kashmir on social media\u2019.\n\nTo conclude, a video from Syria is falsely shared as that of Kashmir.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Indian Rivers?", "lang": "en"}
