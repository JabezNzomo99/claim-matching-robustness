Fact: The man in the video is a former constable of Delhi Police who voluntarily retired in 2014. Also, the video is on social media at least since \u2018December 2019\u2019.

In the video, the man identifies himself as \u2018Rakesh Tyagi\u2019. So when searched with this information, a news video of \u2018ABP News\u2019 dated\u2013 \u201829 December 2019\u2019 was found. As per this video, an ex-cop of Delhi Police, \u2018Rakesh Tyagi\u2019, who took VRS in 2014, was arrested by the Cyber Cell of Delhi Police for making provocative speeches wearing a police uniform. The same information can also be found from the \u2018Scroll.in\u2019 article.\n\n\u2018DCP Cybercrime\u2019 has tweeted in this regard and it can be found here.\n\nTo sum it up, the man in police uniform threatening anti-CAA protestors is an ex-cop. Also, the video is an old one.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
