Rip ra pinarai (Kerala Government has arrested this girl, what\u2019s the reason? reason being she was fighting for Lord Ayappa \u2013 translated)\u201d\n\nThe above photograph has circulated on social media with the narrative that this little girl was arrested by the Kerala goverment. A Facebook page, \u0c39\u0c3f\u0c02\u0c26\u0c42 \u0c39\u0c3f\u0c02\u0c26\u0c41\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c35\u0c02 \u2013 Hindu Hindutvam has shared the photo with the aforementioned text. The message suggested that this young girl was \u2018fighting\u2019 against the Supreme court judgement allowing entry of women of menstruating age in the Sabarimala temple.\n\nSeveral other individuals on Facebook and Twitter have shared this image with this narrative. One more Facebook page, Wise Indian Tongue \u2013 WIThas also shared the photo with a message, \u201cBaby arrested. RIP PINNIYARI Commie govt.. be safe dear.\u201d\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nUsing the Google reverse image search tool, Alt News found the same photo posted on a website, Sharestills.com. According to her profile, Akshara Kishor is a child artist who has worked in several Malayalam television serials and films.\n\nThe same image which is now being shared on social media was also posted on the official Facebook page of Akshara Kishor on November 9, 2017.\n\nThe child artist can also be seen in a video posted on YouTube wearing the same attire. The get-up was part of a devotional song on Lord Ayyappa.\n\nAlt News couldn\u2019t find any media reports of her arrest by the Kerala government. Considering that she\u2019s a popular child artist, any such legal action would have made it to both local and national media. Moreover, her official Facebook page is active, with daily updates. There are no posts about her arrest on this page either as alleged on social media.\n\nThus, the narrative circulated on social media is fake. Of late, Sabarimala has become a focus of misinformation. Alt News has chronicled several instances of misinformation surrounding the Sabarimala issue which was circulated by mainstream media and social media after the Supreme Court verdict.", "lang": "en"}
