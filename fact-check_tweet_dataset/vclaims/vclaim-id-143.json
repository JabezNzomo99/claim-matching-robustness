The different posts include a quote attributed to Nostradamus describing the spread of a plague in Italy that will be the end of the global economy as we know it. Some iterations of the claim also reference Nostradamus\u2019 famous book \"Les Propheties\" (\u201cThe Prophecies\u201d). ( here , here , here , here )\n\nThe claims include a prophecy written out as follows: \u201cThere will be a twin year (2020) from which will arise a queen (corona) who will come from the east (China) and who will spread a plague (virus) in the darkness of night, on a country with 7 hills (Italy) and will transform the twilight of men into dust (death), to destroy and ruin the world. It will be the end of the world economy as you know it.\u201d\n\nThis claim is unfounded. Reuters found no evidence of this prophecy being written by Nostradamus. Stephane Gerson, Professor of French, French Studies, and History at New York University, told Reuters this text \u201cdoes not come from Nostradamus's \u2018Prophecies\u2019,\u201d nor from other prognostications made by Nostradamus ( here ).\n\nGerson told Reuters, \u201cOne should keep in mind that plagues were recurrent in 16th-century Europe, during his lifetime. They were one of the travails about which he wrote (indeed, there are at least 35 references to plagues in his \u2018Prophecies\u2019).\u201d\n\nA search for key words in \"Les Proph\u00e9ties\u201d online including \u201ctwin year\u201d, \u201cqueen\u201d and \u201ceast\u201d brought no results ( here ).\n\nThe text is also not written in Nostradamus\u2019 famous quatrains style, a type of poem that consists of four lines. Examples of Nostradamus quatrains can be seen here .\n\nIn his book \u201cNostradamus: How an Obscure Renaissance Astrologer Became the Modern Prophet of Doom\u201d ( here ), Professor Gerson says Nostradamus\u2019 lasting appeal relies on the fact that his \u201carcane predictions could mean anything\u201d. According to Gerson, past experts linked Nostradamus\u2019 success to \u201cthe \u201csheer number of quatrains and the Prophecies\u2019 dearth of categorical statements and references to specific times and places\u201d.\n\nGerson told Reuters why the timing of this claim during this outbreak doesn\u2019t come as a surprise. \u201cThere is nothing surprising about the reemergence of such false Nostradamian prophecies in the wake of a disaster. The same thing has happened for over 400 years: invented or altered predictions, endowed with the aura of Nostradamus, surface again and again, part of an economy of forgery, mass media circulation, and yearnings for order and design each time an unforeseen event threatens our material well-being and our conceptual frameworks.\u201d\n\nReuters Fact-Check team has debunked similar claims on alleged predictions of the COVID-19 outbreak. Some examples can be seen here and here .\n\nFalse: There is no evidence to support that Nostradamus prophesied the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
