They only show the number who are currently working in the UK. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is explicit about this in its figures.\n\nThere\u2019s no way to tell when current EU national or EU-born workers arrived in the UK. There have been increases since last year some of which will reflect higher levels of recent migration.\n\nThe actual figures for EU migration will be released next week.\n\nPeople in work, not people coming here\n\nEvery three months the ONS releases estimates for how many people born in different countries and with different nationalities are in work.\n\nThat\u2019s how we know, from estimates today, that there were over two million EU nationals in work at the end of last year, out of 31.5 million people in work in the UK.\n\nThat\u2019s up an estimated 200,000 since the end of 2014.\n\nBut the ONS is explicit:\n\n\u201cThese estimates should not be used as a proxy for flows of foreign migrants into the UK.\u201d\n\nWe don't know when these two million people will have arrived in the UK, and while a rise of 200,000 could include increased numbers coming here, these figures can\u2019t prove how many.\n\nThe latest we know on the migration side are figures from last year, which show net EU migration at an estimated 180,000 in the year to June 2015. This is among the highest recorded levels.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait until next Thursday to find out the latest estimates for EU migration to and from the UK, up to September last year.", "lang": "en"}
