Archived version can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this claim to be misleading.\n\nRahul Gandhi was standing all along when the nomination papers were filed.\n\nWe found the video of Rahul Gandhi filing his nomination.\n\nIt is clearly seen that Rahul, along with his family members, standing in front of the officer's dais. Full video can be seen here.\n\nActually, netizens mistook Rahul as sitting because the height of the dais matched to Rahul's chest, making it appear that he is sitting.\n\nIn one of the pictures of nomination filing, BJP candidate from Amethi Smriti Irani can also be seen standing at the same place, exactly the same way Rahul Gandhi had been standing.\n\nWe also checked the clips of Rahul Gandhi's nomination filing from Wayanad. In the video, Congress chief can be seen standing out of courtesy as he handed over his nomination documents to the official.\n\nBefore this, social media users also compared Rahul Gandhi's alleged disrespect towards the officer with BJP chief Amit Shah.\n\nAt that time also, India Today debunked this viral claim.", "lang": "en"}
