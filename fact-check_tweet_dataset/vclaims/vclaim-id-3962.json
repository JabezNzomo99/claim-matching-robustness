The cameras caught Mr. Monroe on Monday evening, opening the glass display case protecting the 2500-year old Egyptian mummy, lying down on top of it and sexually aggressing it. The Smithsonian fired the watchman and brought the images to the police, filing charges against their former employee for indecent exposure and destruction of property. \u201cThe security video that the Smithsonian has provided us is really disgusting,\u201d says D.C Police Chief, Cathy Lynn Lanier. \u201cI understand that the mummy is not really a victim of sex crimes, but his behavior certainly caused some damages to the property of the Smithsonian, therefore, his behavior is criminal. And let\u2019s be honest, I think he really needs help.\u201d\n\nAlthough the claim was reproduced widely on social media and by other web sites, there was no truth to it.
