He also tried to allay concerns about rising public debt.\n\nWe fact-checked some of the deputy president\u2019s key claims.\n\nKenya has been riveted by a saga revolving around the speed it took to import a shipment of much-needed maize. On 4 May 2017, the\n\nOn 12 May, a ship docked with maize allegedly purchased from Mexico, leading to speculation that\n\nhad prior knowledge of the waiver. An acute drought has seen prices of milled maize\n\n, catapulting the staple into a campaign issue.\n\nare in need of food relief, leading the government to\n\nwas that a duty waiver had already been announced last month and that the resulting window was enough for anybody to import maize into the country.\n\nto the national assembly, the minister in charge of the treasury Henry Rotich announced that he was suspending duty on maize imports in a bid to rein in prices.\n\n\u201c\u2026the importation of maize during the next 4 months will be duty-free. I expect, therefore to see a reduction of prices for these basic commodities which are enjoyed by the majority of our people,\u201d said Rotich.\n\n22 companies to import more than 400,000 tonnes of yellow maize (strictly for animal feed) duty-free until 31 August 2017. The cabinet secretary also allowed \u201cany person\u201d to import white maize without paying duty until 31 July 2017.\n\nThe first known import of such maize\n\nat the port of Mombasa on 12 May 2017.\n\ngives a timeline of 4 weeks to transport a container of maize from Mexico\u2019s busiest port of Lazaro Cardenas to Mombasa and shorter from South Africa, the other port of origin\n\nRuto is correct that the import duty waiver was issued a month ago and that this information has been in the public domain.\n\nWhen the ruling party took over in April 2013, the ratio of debt to Gross Domestic Product was 45.8%,\n\nthe revised budget policy statement from the\n\nThis is a rise in debt from KSh1.79 trillion (US$17.32 billion) to KSh4.05 trillion (US$39.2 billion) \u2013 an increase of 125.5% during the term of the current administration.\n\nThe questions about the country\u2019s public debt followed what President Uhuru Kenyatta said\n\nwere legitimate concerns that it may be too high.\n\nplaced Kenya\u2019s debt at 52.1% of its GDP in the 2015/16 financial year, which ended on 30 June 2016. This compared to a 2014/15 debt ratio of 48.7% of GDP.\n\nThe IMF projects Kenya\u2019s debt to be at 52.5% of GDP in the current financial year, rising to 53.3% in 2017/18.\n\nfor developing economies, a debt-to-GDP ratio of 64% was the \u201ctipping point\u201d at which public debt would begin to hurt economic growth.\n\nThe deputy president, therefore, downplayed the current debt level and we rate the claim understated.\n\nIn the final year of the previous government, some 2.23 million customers\n\n. In 2013/14, the first full financial year of the Kenyatta administration, the number of connections rose to 2.77 million.\n\nthat the number of people connected to the grid had increased to 5.98 million, or near 6 million.\n\nThe increase that is thus attributable to the current government is 3.75 million people, not 6 million as said by Ruto.\n\nWe, therefore, rate this claim as misleading, because while elements of it are accurate, they are presented in a way that it is misleading.\n\nWhen the current administration took office in 2013, there were 75,325 police officers in the country according to\n\nwhich hires police officers, put their number at\n\nthe police numbers had risen to 98,732.

Some 9,956 new officers were added, bringing the tally to 108,688.\n\nreleased in April 2017 estimates the Kenyan population at 45.4 million, leading to a ratio of 1 officer for every 418 people.(\n\nThe often cited UN ratio is said to be 1 policeman for every 450 people. However, the\n\nas \u201cthose whose principal functions are the prevention, detection and investigation of crime and the apprehension of alleged offenders\u201d.\n\nThe UN therefore only counts Kenya Police members, who are often referred to as the regular police, in its database. The economic survey, from which the UN derives its figures, puts the number of regular police at 53,844 officers.\n\nIf you add the 5,971 regular officers who graduated in March, the total Kenya Police Service (excluding APs) works out to 59,815 police officers. The ratio is then 1 police officer for every 759 Kenyans.\n\nBut the biggest problem with this claim is that Africa Check has so far not found proof that the UN has ever recommended a ratio of 1:450, or any other ratio, as a policing guideline. This number seems to date back to the\n\nshows that the success of that model at the time has tended to inform international policing.\n\nthat given the varying functions and abilities of police globally, it is unlikely that the UN would prescribe a recommended ratio.\n\nthe focus should be on the quality of policing, not absolute numbers.", "lang": "en"}
