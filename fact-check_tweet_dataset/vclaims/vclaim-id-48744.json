On 22-03-2020, any person found wandering outside, opening shop or moving out of Delhi without any major reason will be fined Rs 11000 because there is a danger of infection. On 22-03-2020, Indians should come together and support this. Thank you. Delhi Police. \u201c\n\nWe looked for this news on Google to check this post but nowhere did we find any such news. But after doing a social media search, we found a tweet from DCP South East Delhi as a reply to this fake notice. The tweet read \u201cWARNING. We have spotted this fake notice being circulated purportedly issued by Delhi Police. We have NOT issued any such advisory on imposition of a fine on March 22. Please tell your family and friends that this is FALSE & FAKE. Let\u2019s make #JanataCurfewMarch22 a success..\u201d\n\nTo confirm this, we also called DCP South East Delhi RP Meena, who confirmed to us that the viral message is indeed fake. He said, \u201cas I wrote in my tweet, the Delhi Police have NOT issued any such advisory on imposition of a fine on March 22.\u201d\n\nLet us tell you that on Thursday, March 19, Prime Minister Modi addressed the people of the country on the corona virus and said \u201cOn this Sunday, i.e. on 22 March, from 7 am to 9 pm, all the countrymen should obey the Janta Curfew. Do not get out of the houses if not necessary. Our efforts will be a symbol of our self-restraint, determination to perform duty in the national interest. The success of public curfew on March 22 will make us ready for the challenges.\u201d Nowhere in his address did the Prime Minister say that this public-curfew is mandatory.\n\nThis message is being spread on WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter. On Facebook, a user named Bholanath Debnath shared this message and wrote \u201d Please obey Delhi Police instructions for 22 March 2020 to avoid Corona Virus.\u201d According to the profile, user lives in Delhi, and he has a total of 1,306 friends on Facebook.\n\nVishvas News has done several fact checks regarding the corona virus.
