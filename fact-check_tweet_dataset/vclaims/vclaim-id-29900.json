The text on the picture reads, \u201c\u0915\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u092d\u0942\u0932 \u0938\u0915\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u094b\u0964 \u091c\u092c \u091b\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0940\u0938\u0917\u093c\u0922 \u092e\u0947\u0902 76 \u091c\u0935\u093e\u0928 \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u0939\u0941\u090f \u0925\u0947 \u0924\u092c \u0907\u0938\u0940 JNU \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u091c\u0936\u094d\u0928 \u092e\u0928\u093e\u092f\u093e \u0917\u092f\u093e \u0925\u093e\u0964 (How can you forget when 76 CRPF soldiers were killed in Chattisgarh, JNU had celebrated the day.)\u201d\n\nThe massacre of 76 security personnel took place in Chattisgarh on April 6, 2010. According to an April 12, 2010 report by NDTV, a group \u2018Forum Against War on People\u2019 had organised an event in JNU, opposing the killing of Maoists. The event was held on the day of the massacre which led to clashes within the varsity premises. Student wings of both BJP and Congress unitedly alleged that the event celebrated the Dantewada attack. \u2018Forum Against War on People\u2019 however claimed that the event was set to be held on April 5 but had to be delayed for some reasons.\n\nThe report also mentions, \u201cThe group [Forum Against War on People] that organised the function didn\u2019t seek prior permission from the university authorities, but it claims the event had nothing to do with the killings in Dantewada.\u201d\n\nAlt News ran a reverse image search and found the same picture used in a May 13, 2019 story by Outlook, crediting it to photojournalist Sanjay Rawat.\n\nAlt News contacted Rawat who confirmed that the photograph was shot by him on September 10, 2016. It shows students celebrating the victory of CPI (ML)-affiliated student body All India Students Association (AISA) and CPI\u2019s student wing Students\u2019 Federation of India (SFI) in the 2016 JNU students\u2019 union elections.\n\nFurthermore, Kanhaiya Kumar was a student at JNU between 2011 and 2019. The Dantewada massacre took place in 2010.\n\nA photograph from 2016 was falsely shared with the claim that that it shows JNU students, including Kanhaiya Kumar, celebrating the attack on CRPF jawans in 2010. This was when Kumar was not even a student at the university.", "lang": "en"}
