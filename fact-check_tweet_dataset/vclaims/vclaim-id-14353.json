The UKIP MEP for London, Gerard Batten, has suggested that the marchers could be met with water cannon when they arrive.\n\nThis is flatly untrue. The Metropolitan Police does not have any water cannon, and they are not currently authorised for use in England and Wales.\n\nThe Mayor of London\u2019s Office (which oversees policing in London) approved the purchase of three water cannon in 2014, but they were sold off again late last year without ever having been used.\n\nWe spoke to the Mayor\u2019s Office and it confirmed to us that no water cannon will be used in today\u2019s march.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has also stated today that: \u201cNo water cannons are owned or used by the Met Police. Any suggestion that we are intending to use water cannons or seeking to agitate any protestors is baseless and false.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
