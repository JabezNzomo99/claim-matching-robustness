This passage is not a direct quote from Goebbels, for being Minister of Propaganda in Nazi Germany prior to and during World War Two, although it is likely to represent his views.\n\nExamples of the claim can be seen here and here .\n\nAs Minister of Propaganda, Paul Joseph Goebbels was known for presenting the Nazi regime in the best possible light. He died in 1945 ( here ). The posts attribute the following quote to Goebbels: \u201cThere was no point in seeking to convert the intellectuals. For intellectuals would never be converted and would anyway always yield to the stronger, and this will always be \u201cthe man in the street.\u201d Arguments must therefore be crude, clear and forcible, and appeal to emotions and instincts, not the intellect. Truth was unimportant and entirely subordinate to tactics and psychology.\u201d\n\nThe quote stems from the introduction of the 1978 book \u201cFinal Entries, 1945: The Diaries of Joseph Goebbels\u201d which was edited, introduced and annotated by English historian Hugh Trevor-Roper. ( here )\n\nThe quote can be found in a similar edition published in 1979 called \u201cThe Goebbels Diaries: The Last Days\u201d, also edited, introduced and annotated by Trevor-Roper. On page 19, paragraph one (visible here ) Trevor-Roper wrote:\n\n\u201cOften he laid down his general rules. \u201cThe fundamental principle of all propaganda,\u201d he declared, was \u201cthe repetition of effective arguments\u201d; but those arguments must not be too refined \u2013 there was no point in seeking to convert the intellectuals. For intellectuals would never be converted and would anyway always yield to the stronger, \u201cand this will always be the man in the street\u201d.* Arguments must therefore be crude, clear and forcible, and appeal to emotions and instincts, not to the intellect. Truth was unimportant, and entirely subordinate to the tactics and psychology, but convenient lies (\u201cpoetic truth\u201d, as he once called them) must always be made credible.\u201d\n\nA blog called \u201cGoebbels Didn\u2019t Say It\u201d by Professor Randall Bytwerk of Calvin University addresses inaccurate quotes by the Nazi statesman that have been circulating online ( here ). Professor Bytwerk reached the same finding in his blog about the quote in these claims, sourcing it to the introduction to \u201cFinal Entries 1945: The Diaries of Joseph Goebbels.\u201d He adds that \u201cit is a reasonable summary of Goebbels\u2019s views\u2014 but he never would have put it in that way. As I\u2019ve observed before, in public he always maintained that propaganda had to be truthful.\u201d ( here )\n\nBritish historian Richard J. Evans told Reuters via email that indeed the words in the claim are not directly from Goebbels, adding the quote is \u201ca pr\u00e9cis of what Goebbels wrote, so not the exact words, though doubtless Trevor Roper accurately summed up what Goebbels wrote.\u201d\n\nPartly false. These words come from the introduction of a book about Goebbels and are likely to reflect his views but are not a direct quote.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
