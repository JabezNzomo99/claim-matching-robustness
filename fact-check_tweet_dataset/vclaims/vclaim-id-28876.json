A windmill could spin until it falls apart and never generate such energy as was invested in building it.\u201d\n\nIt credits the quote to \u201cThomas Homer-Dixon, Carbon Shift\u201d.\n\n. They are an important alternative to\n\nrenewable energy projects are all wind farms, which together contribute\n\nWind turbines have to be in windy places\n\nrated the quote as incorrect, saying it was \u201cbased on a selective quotation\u201d.\n\nIt was taken from an essay by\n\nIn the essay Hughes argues that wind turbines must be placed in the right location, with lots of wind, if they are to produce their full amount of energy.\n\nfrom the essay (with the selective quote in italics) reads: \u201c\n\nThe concept of net energy must also be applied to renewable sources of energy, such as windmills and photovoltaics.\n\nThe question is: how long must a windmill generate energy before it creates more energy than it took to build it? At a good wind site, the energy payback day could be in three years or less; in a poor location, energy payback may be never. That is,\n\nSo Hughes said a wind turbine placed in poor conditions might not generate enough energy to pay back what it took to make the turbine, but in a good wind site it could pay back the energy in under three years.\n\nAfter seeing many versions of the quote on social media, Homer-Dixon responded in 2018 with a\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t write the text, the text itself is selectively quoted, and the argument it makes, taken in isolation, is meaningless,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThis text is selectively excerpted from a chapter written by David Hughes in Carbon Shift (2009), a book I co-edited.\u201d\n\nHe concludes: \u201cSo, 1) I didn\u2019t write the text, 2) the text itself is selectively quoted, and 3) the argument it makes, taken in isolation, is meaningless. Three strikes.\u201d\n\nThe truth of the turbine\n\nIt is \u201cextraordinary that so many wind turbines would be bought and paid for by the industry if they actually consumed more energy than they produce\u201d, says a 2018 article by Stephen Hanley on\n\nOf course some energy is consumed in building a wind turbine and the pylon that supports it, Hanley says. But \u201cthe typical wind turbine will generate enough electricity to offset the energy consumed to create it in about 7.5 months or less\u201d.\n\nexamines the life cycle and environmental impact of two 2.0 MW wind turbines.\n\nIt analysed the energy payback based on the sum of energy demand and the energy produced by the wind turbines over 20 years. It found that the energy payback period for the two turbine models were \u201cfound to be 5.2 and 6.4 months, respectively\u201d.\n\nfound that in 50 separate studies, \u201cthe average wind turbine, over the course of its operational life, generated 20 times more energy than it took to produce\u201d.\n\nThis was \u201cfavourable\u201d in comparison to fossil fuels, and nuclear and solar power. \u2013", "lang": "en"}
