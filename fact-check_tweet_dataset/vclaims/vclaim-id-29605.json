Ilhan Omar.\n\nA handful of distorted quotes from the Quran have been circulating on blogs and anti-Islamic websites for years, but their exposure recently surged when they were paired with a picture of Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota in a meme.\n\nThat meme has been shared more than 50,000 times on Facebook alone.\n\nIt says that the Quran is Omar\u2019s \u201cdaily Bible,\u201d but the interpretations of the verses it quotes don\u2019t come from any translation of the Quran we could find. Rather, they appear to have come from a 2005 post on a website called Islam Watch, which explains on its \u201cAbout Us\u201d page that it was started by six former Muslims. The site says they \u201cfelt it incumbent upon us to make the non-Muslim world aware of the reality of Islam, and undertake timely precautionary measures against this religion of terror, hatred and mayhem.\u201d\n\nThe interpretations of nine verses from the Quran that the meme includes were made by one of the founders of the site, who describes himself as a freelance writer, not a religious scholar. In total, he had offered 36 reinterpretations of verses from the Quran. Several of them have been repeated in online publications since then, illustrating how misinformation persists for years and spreads online.\n\nThe writer, Abul Kasem, did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nOne of the problems with the meme is that the interpretations it gives lack historical and textual context. Joseph Lowry, an associate professor of Arabic and Islamic studies at the University of Pennsylvania, explained to us some of the history that helped to form the Quran and how the meaning of the verses can be distorted out of context. Muhammad, the founder of Islam, was persecuted, at least in part, for his religious message and had to flee his home in Mecca for the nearby town of Medina. There, he and his followers remained in conflict with the Meccans, and those struggles are referenced in the Quran.\n\nTwo chapters \u2014 called surahs in the Quran \u2014 out of a total of 114 discuss most directly this political and military conflict with the Meccans. They are surahs eight and nine, and two-thirds of the verses in the meme come from them.\n\nWe went through the nine interpretations that are included in the meme with Lowry and compared them with an online resource from the University of Leeds that draws from some common English translations of the Quran.\n\nHere\u2019s how the meme\u2019s language compares with those sources for each surah and verse it claims to quote:\n\u2022 The meme said: \u201cMuslims must not take the infidels as friends.\u201d\n\u2022 Lowry pointed out that it\u2019s only half of the verse, and the Arabic word translated as \u201cfriend\u201d is better translated as \u201ctribal allies.\u201d\n\u2022 The Sahih International translation featured on the University of Leeds website said: \u201cLet not believers take disbelievers as allies rather than believers. And whoever [of you] does that has nothing with Allah, except when taking precaution against them in prudence. And Allah warns you of Himself, and to Allah is the [final] destination.\u201d\n\u2022 The meme said: \u201cAny religion other than Islam is not acceptable.\u201d\n\u2022 Lowry said this passage poses a difficult translation problem since the Arabic word for Islam means something like \u201cto submit.\u201d This passage could refer to all monotheistic religions, as opposed to pagan religions. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that this doesn\u2019t include Jews and Christians,\u201d he said.\n\u2022 The Yusuf Ali translation featured on the University of Leeds website said: \u201cIf anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah), never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (All spiritual good).\u201d\n\u2022 The meme said: \u201cMaim and crucify the infidels if they criticize Islam.\u201d\n\u2022 Lowry said that interpretation is \u201ctotally inaccurate.\u201d The verse is understood to address robbery and mayhem and, importantly, the punishment for it applies to Muslims, as well. Also, it does not include the word \u201cinfidel\u201d or the word \u201ccriticize.\u201d\n\u2022 The Sahih International translation on the University of Leeds website said: \u201cIndeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land. That is for them a disgrace in this world; and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment.\u201d\n\u2022 The meme said: \u201cTerrorize and behead those who believe in scriptures other than the Qur\u2019an.\u201d\n\u2022 Lowry noted that this passage refers to a specific historical battle \u2014 the Battle of Badr, in which Muhammad made his first significant victory. In this verse, God is urging the angels, not Muhammad\u2019s followers directly, to help his followers during the fight, he said.\n\u2022 The Sahih International translation said: \u201c[Remember] when your Lord inspired to the angels, \u2018I am with you, so strengthen those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieved, so strike [them] upon the necks and strike from them every fingertip.'\u201d\n\u2022 The meme said: \u201cMuslims must muster all weapons to terrorize the infidels.\u201d\n\u2022 Lowry pointed out that this verse calls for military service and aid to Muhammad\u2019s followers. Generally, verses like this one are limited to the specific historical tension in Medina and Mecca at the time, he said.\n\u2022 The Muhammad Sarwar translation featured on the University of Leeds website said: \u201cMobilize your (defensive) force as much as you can to frighten the enemies of God and your own enemies. This also will frighten those who are behind them whom you do not know but God knows well. Whatever you spend for the cause of God, He will give you sufficient recompense with due justice.\u201d\n\u2022 The meme said: \u201cThe unbelievers are stupid; urge the Muslims to fight them.\u201d\n\u2022 Lowry said that there are, clearly, verses that urge Muslims to fight their enemies. But, in this one, he said, \u201cit doesn\u2019t say the unbelievers are stupid.\u201d\n\u2022 The Arberry translation featured on the University of Leeds website said: \u201cO Prophet, urge on the believers to fight. If there be twenty of you, patient men, they will overcome two hundred; if there be a hundred of you, they will overcome a thousand unbelievers, for they are a people who understand not.\u201d\n\u2022 The meme said: \u201cWhen opportunity arises kill the infidels wherever you catch them.\u201d\n\u2022 Lowry identified this verse as part of a treaty between Mecca and Medina. In its historical context, this verse refers to the Meccan pagans with whom Muhammad\u2019s followers were fighting.\n\u2022 The Sahih International translation said: \u201cAnd when the sacred months have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, let them [go] on their way. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\u201d\n\u2022 The meme said: \u201cThe Jews and the Christians are perverts; fight them.\u201d\n\u2022 Lowry said this verse did not call Jews and Christians \u201cperverts.\u201d He said, \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t say that.\u201d Also, the verse doesn\u2019t have an imperative verb urging Muhammad\u2019s followers to fight. Rather, it has an optative verb, one that expresses a wish; in this case, wishing that God would fight.\n\u2022 The Sahih International translation said: \u201cThe Jews say, \u2018Ezra is the son of Allah\u2019; and the Christians say, \u2018The Messiah is the son of Allah.\u2019 That is their statement from their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved [before them]. May Allah destroy them; how are they deluded?\u201d\n\u2022 The meme said: \u201cMake war on the infidels living in your neighborhood.\u201d\n\u2022 Lowry said that this verse is probably best understood as referring to the military situation around Medina.\n\u2022 The Shakir translation featured on the University of Leeds website said: \u201cO you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness; and know that Allah is with those who guard (against evil).\u201d\n\nAs with many historic texts, the Quran can be challenging to translate, and reasonable minds can differ about how best to do it. But Lowry concluded that some of the interpretations given in the meme are mistranslated, and all of them are taken out of context. \u201cIt\u2019s designed to be inflammatory when presented and translated like this,\u201d he said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "lang": "en"}
