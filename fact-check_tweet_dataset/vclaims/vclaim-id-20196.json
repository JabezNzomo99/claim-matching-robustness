The claim is false; the video is from a 2017 military operation in a northwestern Pakistani tribal district.\n\nThis Facebook video, which has been viewed more than 84,000 times since it was uploaded February 27, 2019, has a caption saying: \"Pakistani flag hoisted after capturing Indian checkpost. Live forever Pakistan army\".\n\nThe footage shows Pakistani soldiers removing a black militant flag from a pile of stones and hoisting Pakistan's national flag before saluting it and making victory signs.\n\nThe same video has been posted repeatedly on Facebook, for example here and here, and viewed ten of thousands of times with captions making similar claims that it shows Pakistani soldiers hoisting their flag at a captured Indian post.\n\nBelow is a screensnhot of one of the misleading posts.\n\nOn February 27, 2019, India and Pakistan claimed to have shot down each other's fighter planes in the disputed Kashmir region. Here is an AFP explainer on the issue.\n\nAn online search found that the video is not recent footage of Pakistan\u2019s border with India, but from a 2017 military operation against militants in the northwestern Khyber tribal district bordering Afghanistan.\n\nThe exact same footage as is used in the misleading posts can be seen here and here in these YouTube videos uploaded in 2017, which show Pakistani soldiers taking down a militant flag and raising the country\u2019s national flag.\n\nThe section of the misleading video showing soldiers saluting the flag can also be seen at 4:00 in this Facebook video of a press conference given by Pakistani military spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor on August 21, 2017.\n\nHere is a Dawn newspaper report on the August 21, 2017 press conference. The same clip as is used in the misleading footage can be seen in Dawn\u2019s embedded video at 5:28.", "lang": "en"}
