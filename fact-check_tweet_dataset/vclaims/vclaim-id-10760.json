Ryan Zinke, R-MT, has sent out an offer for a \"limited edition hunting tag\" for ISIS to people who donate to his campaign.\n\nOn 24 March 2016, a Facebook page purporting to be that of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke posted an offer for an \u201cISIS Hunting Tag\u201d:\n\nThe Facebook message redirected people to a campaign donation web site that further explained the message behind the tags:\n\nI\u2019m proud to put 23 years of military service to work for you every day in Congress. But the policies coming out of the \u201clead from behind\u201d Obama Administration are only making matters worse. Obama\u2019s foreign policy is a policy of retreat, which does nothing but create power vacuums and opportunities for emboldened terrorists. If you agree with me that we need to put an end to terrorists at home and abroad, then I need your support. Our campaign just printed a limited amount of these commemorative campaign stickers. If you donate $15 right now, I will send you a limited edition ISIS hunting tag.\n\nThe tags drew mixed reactions. While some applauded Zinke for his stance on ISIS and the fight against terrorism, others criticized him for attempting to capitalize on people\u2019s fears by posting his \u201cISIS Hunting Tags\u201d shortly after the terrorist attack in Brussels:\n\nWhile our allies and friends from across the world from Istanbul to Brussels are facing another wave of terrorist violence that has targeted civilians, many Americans and their leaders are calling for sober reflection on how we can help prevent future attacks and how we can help those affected. Others, like Montana\u2019s sole representative in Congress, Ryan Zinke, are more interested in cheap theatrical stunts that cheapen the lives lost in the attacks and turn them into opportunities to raise campaign cash.\n\nThe tags are real, in the sense that they exist and can be purchased. Whether or not these tags are an official part of Zinke\u2019s campaign is uncertain, as they originated with a Facebook page that wasn\u2019t verified (his official page is, but the tags don\u2019t show up on those, and there is a second campaign donation page that links from his official web site, as well). It\u2019s possible that Zinke created the pages and the \u201cISIS tag\u201d campaign separately. It\u2019s also possible that it was set up by someone unrelated to the campaign (this is the internet, after all).\n\nIn case the point was unclear, however, these tags do not provide anyone with an actual license to kill anyone, no matter how much is donated. The site, whether or not it belongs to Zinke\u2019s re-election campaign, does carry a disclaimer clarifying this point:\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Zinke\u2019s campaign for clarification and will update accordingly.", "lang": "en"}
