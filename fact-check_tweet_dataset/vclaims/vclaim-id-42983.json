This has since been changed into a question asking whether or not scientists knew about the new disease before the outbreak.\n\nThe subheading previously said: \u201cit has emerged that scientists knew about the deadly virus long ago\u201d. That now reads \u201cit has emerged that scientists warned about a new deadly virus long ago\u201d.\n\nBoth versions either state or heavily imply that the World Health Organisation (WHO) already knew about Covid-19 before the recent outbreak.\n\nIt didn\u2019t. As the article itself goes on to say (and as a previous Express article said last year) \u201cDisease X\u201d is not the name of a specific illness. It is simply a phrase that the WHO uses to represent \u201cthe knowledge that a serious international epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease\u201d. In other words, it\u2019s just a made-up name being used as a stand-in for any unknown disease.\n\nThe fact that the WHO was talking about \u201cDisease X\u201d in 2018 does not mean that it knew about Covid-19. It means they were aware that some kind of new disease might emerge in future, just as Covid-19 has.\n\nThe article quotes comments made in an Observer article by Dr Josie Golding, Epidemics Lead at the Wellcome Trust. Dr Golding told Full Fact, \u201cDisease X does not refer to a specific pathogen. It is a term given to any as-yet unknown disease with the potential to cause a serious epidemic.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
