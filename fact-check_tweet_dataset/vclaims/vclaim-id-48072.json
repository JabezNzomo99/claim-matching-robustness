The earliest post was shared last Friday, October 11, in Facebook group Typhoon Hagupit Advisory & Update with the caption: \"Typhoon Hagibis Photo taken October 11 at 4pm in Okinawa, Japan #prayforjapan #hagibis.\"\n\nThe combined Facebook engagements of these posts as of writing have reached over 4,100 shares, 20,100 reactions, and 900 comments.\n\nThe facts: A reverse image search of the photo shared by Bob Ong Quotes shows that the original photo was taken in Rehoboth Beach in Delaware in the United States. The Washington Post published an article about it on August 26 this year.\n\nThe Washington Post explained that the photo shows a shelf cloud, which usually indicates a looming storm. \"If you see a shelf cloud, it's time to dash. After all, they're the leading edge of strong to damaging wind gusts,\" wrote Matthew Cappucci of The Washington Post.\n\nThough the photo was not taken in Japan, the country did suffer from the powerful Typhoon Hagibis. Nearly 80 people have been confirmed dead as of Thursday, October 17.\n\nThe typhoon also destroyed properties and triggered landslides and flooding. Look here for actual photos of Japan after the onslaught of Typhoon Hagibis. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
