We\u2019re looking at an apex of 14 days. If we don\u2019t have the ventilators in 14 days, it does us no good. The federal Defense [Production] Act can actually help companies because the federal government can say: \u2018Look, I need you to go into this business. I will contract with you today for X number of ventilators. Here is the start-up capital you need. Here\u2019s the start-up capital you need to hire workers who\u2019ll do it around the clock, but I need the ventilators in 14 days.\u2019 Only the federal government has that power, and not to exercise that power is inexplicable to me. Volunteerism is nice, and it is a beautiful thing, and it\u2019s nice that these companies are coming forward and saying they want to help. That is not going to get us there.\u201d\n\nA Biden health-care adviser said using the full force of the Defense Production Act would yield more visibility into manufacturing and supply-chain capabilities. \u201cWe need the U.S. government to be able to have insight into that supply chain and insight into the distribution of those supplies to where they are most needed, and only the U.S. government, HHS and FEMA can do that,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the simple production that you need from the DPA, [it\u2019s] the extraordinary variety of the things we need: everything from sophisticated equipment like ventilators to nonsophisticated equipment like swabs and millions of tests.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
