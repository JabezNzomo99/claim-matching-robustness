But the edit \u2014 shared in some cases by social media accounts supportive of President Donald Trump \u2014 shows only 18 seconds of what Biden said during his hour-long rally.\n\nThe edited video shows Biden saying only: \u201cCulture, our culture, our culture. It\u2019s not imported from some African nation, or some Asian nation. It\u2019s our English jurisprudential culture, our European culture.\u201d It deceptively omits key words at the start and end of his remarks. In context, Biden was talking about longstanding cultural issues related to the treatment of women.\n\nBiden\u2019s full, relevant remarks \u2014 broadcast live on Facebook by ABC News \u2014 came in response to a woman\u2019s question (39:07) about his work regarding women, sexual assault and domestic violence. The former vice president called for \u201cfundamentally changing our culture\u201d (39:47), and spent about 10 minutes talking about related issues.\n\nSpecifically, Biden referenced the (debunked) notion that the phrase \u201crule of thumb\u201d dates to an English common law allowing a husband to beat his wife, so long as the object used was not bigger than the circumference of his thumb. We note that the Oxford English Dictionary says that that \u201csuggestion \u2026 cannot be substantiated,\u201d and academics have cast doubt that such a circumference rule was established by English common law.\n\nBiden, among other things, also spoke about the historical reluctance of Americans to talk about domestic violence, his work sponsoring the Violence Against Women Act of 1993, and the need to confront sexual assault on college campuses. And it was within that context that he made the remark in question (50:28):\n\nThe deceptive edit gave no indication Biden was discussing sexual assault and domestic violence. Captions on Twitter and Facebook further reinforced the false impression that he was rejecting the role of African or Asian nations in U.S. culture.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like Joe Biden is a Racist,\u201d wrote one Twitter user. A Facebook page said that \u201cBiden proclaims the \u2018European\u2019 identity of America.\u201d And on Instagram, an account supportive of Bernie Sanders, posted the clip and called Biden a \u201cwhite supremacist.\u201d\n\nIn a show of its reach on Twitter, the Biden clip was promoted in a now-deleted tweet from the conservative website the Daily Caller \u2014 a tweet that was shared by conservative TV host Graham Ledger, which was then retweeted by Trump.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
