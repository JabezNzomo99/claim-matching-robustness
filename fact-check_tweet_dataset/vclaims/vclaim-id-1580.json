W. Bush signed into law the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which extended federal civil rights protections to people with mental or physical impairments:\n\nThe ADA is one of America\u2019s most comprehensive pieces of civil rights legislation that prohibits discrimination and guarantees that people with disabilities have the same opportunities as everyone else to participate in the mainstream of American life \u2014 to enjoy employment opportunities, to purchase goods and services, and to participate in State and local government programs and services. Modeled after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin \u2013 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \u2014 the ADA is an \u201cequal opportunity\u201d law for people with disabilities.\n\nMore than a quarter-century on, and despite further work to be done, the ADA has so positively affected how people with disabilities are treated and perceived in America that the notion that laws once existed to keep physically and cognitively challenged people indoors and out of sight seems scarcely believable. But it was the case \u2014 and not so long ago.\n\nBeginning in the late 1800s, statutes known as \u201cunsightly beggar ordinances,\u201d aka \u201cugly laws,\u201d were enacted in some American cities to rid public spaces of what Chicago Alderman James Peevey euphemistically referred to as \u201cstreet obstructions\u201d:\n\nBy street obstructions, Peevey didn\u2019t mean food carts, construction materials, roadblocks or potholes. He meant beggars, such as the ones described in the Tribune as \u201cthe one-legged individual who, with drooping eye and painfully lugubrious countenance, holds forth his hat for pennies\u201d or \u201cthe fellows who yell \u2018ba-na-naas'\u201d and \u201cthe woman with two sick children who was drawn through the carding-machine in a woolen mill, and who grinds \u2018Mollie Darling\u2019 incessantly on a hurdy-gurdy on a street corner.\u201d\n\nFollowing the example of San Francisco, which had pioneered the legislation in 1867, Peevey helped pass a law in 1881 imposing fines (or stints in the poorhouse) on all who were \u201cdiseased, maimed, mutilated, or in any way deformed, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object,\u201d yet dared beg, panhandle, or otherwise make nuisances of themselves in public. Among other cities, Omaha, Columbus, Cleveland, and Portland, Oregon followed suit, all passing ugly laws using virtually identical language.\n\nIn a discussion of Susan M. Schweik\u2019s The Ugly Laws: Disability in Public (2009), reviewer Shannon Sommer encapsulates the social and economic developments leading up to these measures:\n\nSchweik discusses in detail several factors which combined to create the perfect storm for the emergence of ugly law in America at this time. These include: the formation of Charity Organization Societies, the rise or eugenics and state institutions, an increasing focus on using urban planning to create beautiful cities, increasing immigration at a time when there were few restrictions placed on immigration, the large number of soldiers injured in the Civil War which had ended just a few years earlier, temperance and prohibition, and the increasing industrialization of society with resulting industrial-related injuries.\n\nSchweik notes that though the passage of new ugly laws ceased by the beginning of World War I and enforcement of existing statutes dwindled thereafter, they remained on the books until well into the latter half of the 20th century:\n\nSchweik found that the last known arrest under an ugly law occurred in Omaha, NE in 1974 when a policeman wanted to arrest a homeless man but had no basis for arrest. After searching the city code and finding that Omaha\u2019s Ugly Law was still on the books he was able to take the man into custody on the basis that the man had \u201cmarks and scars on his body.\u201d Prosecutors refused to press charges in this case. Schweik recounts one prosecutor pointing out that \u201ccriminal prosecution under this law would require the impossible: courtroom proof \u201cthat someone is ugly.\u201d\n\nThat same year, 1974, saw the demise of ugly laws in America. The last city to repeal was Chicago. One of the alderman responsible for killing the law, Paul T. Wigoda, denounced it as \u201ccruel and insensitive,\u201d and \u201ca throwback to the Middle Ages.\u201d It had been in effect for 93 years.", "lang": "en"}
