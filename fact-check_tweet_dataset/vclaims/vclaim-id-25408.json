Instead, US warplanes provided air cover to allow the Philippine military to attack the rebels, but did not fire.\n\nThe same claim was made by asiancorrespondent.com, but the website has no date of publishing. As of writing, according to Crowdtangle, this article has 3,994 reactions, 714 comments, and shares 2,182 on Facebook. It was posted 50 times on social media, with posts dating as far back as January 2017, and has 36,352 interactions collectively from those posts.\n\nThe facts: The information in the declassified documents that Munda found \"alarming\" was not newly revealed to the public. They were the frontpage headlines of local and foreign newspapers way back December 2 and 3, 1989. The CIA document he posted was also not newly declassified. It was part of a batch of documents that the CIA declassified on September 25, 2013.\n\nThe CIA document is clear about the fact that Aquino's plea for help was reported in the news, specifically in the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post.\n\nThe Washington Post said that \"President [George HW] Bush approved a request for US military support made by Aquino.... Bush directed US planes to shoot down any rebel aircraft that might try to take off to attack Aquino's ground forces, but US officials said the American jets did not have to fire a shot.\"\n\nReports on the coup were splashed on the front page of each of these publications. All mentioned that the US military provided air cover and Manila Bulletin quoted Aquino as saying \"smash the mutiny with all forces at hand.\"", "lang": "en"}
