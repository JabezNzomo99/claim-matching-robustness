We called Bagh police station in Dhar district where a case has been registered. Town inspector Kamlesh Singhar told BOOM the following.\n\nThe incident is from Gatbori village. The girl, a tribal, was married but had an affair with a Dalit man called Vivek. Unhappy with her marriage, the girl eloped along with the Dalit youth on May 25. A missing report was registered by the girl's brother Mahesh at Bagh police station. She was found after a month on June 25 and reunited with her family -- Kamlesh Singhar, TI, Bagh police station\n\nThe TI further said that when the family members asked her to discontinue her relationship with Vivek, she refused. The disgruntled family members later, on pretext of taking her to Vivek, took the woman to an isolated place far from the house and brutally assaulted her. The victim's brother was one of the seven accused who assaulted the victim.\n\nSinghar said that as the video went viral, the police department sprung in action and identified all the seven people in the video and arrested them. The victim's brother Mahesh was also among those arrested. The accused were booked under IPC section 294, 323, 147, 148, 354 D and 307.
