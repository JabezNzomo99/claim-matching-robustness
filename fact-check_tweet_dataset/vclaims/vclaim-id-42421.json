It shows nine cities highlighted in Chinese text. Along with the viral image, users have claimed, \u201cStrange eerie coincidence that all worst affected Corona Virus [Covid 19] cases are along the same Latitude 40\u00b0 from left: France, Italy, Iran, Wuhan, South Korea, Japan, Seattle, Washington, NewYork\u2026 Isn\u2019t it quite ridiculous & mind-boggling?\u201d\n\nOn March 12, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, chairperson and managing director of Biocon, tweeted the viral image (archive link). She also added in her tweet that \u201csouthern hemisphere seems to be unaffected\u201d from the coronavirus so far.\n\nSeveral users have shared the on Twitter and Facebook. Alt News has received several requests to fact-check the images on WhatsApp (+91 76000 11160) and on our official Android application.\n\nThe viral claim lists four cities \u2013 Wuhan, Seattle, Washington and New York along with five countries \u2013 France, Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan while claiming that \u201call worst affected coronavirus [Covid 19] cases are along the same Latitude 40\u00b0.\u201d\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that, as per the US Geological Survey, at 38 degrees north latitude one degree of latitude is around 69 miles (111 kilometres). Therefore, large countries cannot be represented by a single latitude.\n\nMost affected cities in the above-listed countries.\n\nAlt News identified the most severely affected cities in the countries mentioned in the viral message using data from respective government websites.\n\nAs of March 13, data from Sant\u00e9 publique France, national public health agency, revealed that the Grand Est. anadministrative region in northeastern France, had the highest number of cases reported.\n\nSimilarly, Bergamo, a city in the Lombardy region, is the worst affected as per Ministero della salute, Italy\u2019s Ministry of Health.\n\nOn the same date, an infographic published by the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), the official news agency of the Islamic Republic of Iran, illustrated the national capital Tehran as the most severely affected.\n\nA March 12 report by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated that Daegu Metropolitan City, the third-largest after Seoul, and Busan is the worst affected region.\n\nNippo, a Japan-based media platform reported that Hokkaid\u014d was reported most numbers confirmed virus carriers as of March 12. Nippo\u2019s report was created based on data by Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare.\n\nAre these cities along Latitude 40\u00b0?\n\nThe latitude coordinates of every place mentioned in the viral post are as follows:\n\nChannel News Asia (CNA), Singapore-based news channel, has built an interactive map that is keeping a track of confirmed cases, reported deaths and patients recovered across the world. The 12 most affected countries as of March 16 doesn\u2019t include Japan, which is one of the places shown on the viral map image.\n\nWhile it is true that countries listed above are from the northern hemisphere, Shaw\u2019s statement that \u201csouthern hemisphere seems to be unaffected\u201d is false. The screenshot from CNA\u2019s interactive maps shows some of the countries affected in the southern hemisphere. Data for each country can be viewed by zooming in in the interactive map.\n\nTherefore the claim that the cities worst affected by coronavirus cases are along latitude 40\u00b0 is false.
