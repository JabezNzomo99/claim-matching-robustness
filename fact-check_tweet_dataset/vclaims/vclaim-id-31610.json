The clip is misleading; it has been edited to cast his rivals as dumbfounded during a lengthy silence after Bloomberg's comment, but he actually quickly resumed speaking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the only one here I think that\u2019s ever started a business, is that fair?\u201d Bloomberg says in the video posted on his Twitter and Instagram accounts, which has also been shared on Facebook here and here.\n\nIt then shows about 20 seconds of footage of the other candidates saying nothing as the sound of chirping crickets plays, presenting it as their reaction to his comment.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Bloomberg says as the clip ends.\n\nBut there was actually only a gap of about one second between Bloomberg\u2019s remark and him saying \u201cokay,\u201d after which he continued to speak.\n\nThat portion of the February 19, 2020 debate in Las Vegas can be viewed starting at the 1:13:30 minute mark in this video.\n\nBloomberg -- who has spent hundreds of millions of dollars of his own fortune on political advertising -- made the first debate appearance of his presidential run in Las Vegas.\n\nHe was heavily criticized by fellow Democratic candidates about his suitability for office given his record as New York mayor, for remarks he allegedly made about women, and other issues.\n\nThe debate clip is not the first misleading video associated with Bloomberg\u2019s candidacy: one of his campaign ads attacking President Donald Trump used footage that dated to his predecessor Barack Obama\u2019s time in office.", "lang": "en"}
