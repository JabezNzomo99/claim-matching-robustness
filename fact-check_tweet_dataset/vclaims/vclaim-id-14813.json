Ilhan Omar\u2019s reference to the 9/11 terrorist attacks continued to boil on the political talk shows on Sunday.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders claimed that Omar had spoken \u201cdismissively\u201d about the 9/11 attacks, while Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said her comments were being misconstrued. Nadler said Omar mentioned 9/11 \u201conly in passing\u201d while talking about \u201cdiscrimination against Muslim Americans.\u201d\n\nThe comments made by Omar, one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, have been widely dissected. We thought it would be helpful to our readers to provide the context for Omar\u2019s comments, which were made during a 20-minute speech she delivered at an annual Council on American-Islamic Relations event in California on March 23.\n\n\u201cMany people expect, expect our community to feel like it needs to hide every time something happens,\u201d Omar said, referring to the American Muslim community. \u201cBut repeatedly we have shown them that we are not to be bullied. We are not to be threatened. We are not to be terrorized. We are strong and resilient, and we will always show up to be ourselves because we know we have a right to a dignified existence and a dignified life.\u201d\n\nOmar\u2019s speech came a week after a gunman opened fire at two mosques in New Zealand on March 15, killing at least 50 people.\n\nOmar said many Muslims feared such a tragedy was coming, because they have heard threats at their mosques and in their schools or have witnessed acts of violence targeting Muslims. And she said, \u201cMany of us know that this is not a one-off incident.\u201d\n\nOmar said discrimination against Muslims has been exacerbated by President Donald Trump, who once said, \u201cI think Islam hates us.\u201d She went on to say that the president \u201cthinks it is OK, it is OK to speak about a faith and a whole community in a way that is dehumanizing, vilifying, and doesn\u2019t understand \u2014 or at least makes us want to think that he doesn\u2019t understand \u2014 the consequences that his words might have.\u201d\n\nOmar said that despite trying to be good neighbors, Muslim Americans are often made to feel like second-class citizens.\n\n\u201cMuslims for a really long time in this country have been told that there is a privilege, that there is a privilege that we are given and it might be taken away,\u201d Omar said. \u201cWe are told that we should be appropriate. We should go to school, get an education, raise our children, and not bother anyone, not make any kind of noise. Don\u2019t make anyone uncomfortable. Be a good Muslim. But no matter how much we have tried to be the best neighbor, people have always worked on finding a way to not allow for every single civil liberty to be extended to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how good you are,\u201d Omar said. \u201cIf you one day find yourself in a school where other religions are talked about, but when Islam is mentioned, we are only talking about terrorists. And if you say something, you are sent to the principal\u2019s office. So to me, I say, raise hell. Make people uncomfortable. Because here\u2019s the truth, here\u2019s the truth, far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen. And frankly, I\u2019m tired of it. And every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it.\u201d\n\nThat was immediately followed by the sentence with the phrase that is the subject of the recent controversy.\n\n\u201cCAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties. So you can\u2019t just say that today someone is looking at me strange, that I am going to try to make myself look pleasant. You have to say this person is looking at me strange, I am not comfortable with it. I am going to talk to them and ask them why. Because that is a right you have.\u201d\n\nSome seized on Omar\u2019s use of the phrase \u201csome people did something\u201d to refer to the terrorists and the 9/11 attacks, and suggested she was trivializing the attacks.\n\nTrump joined those critical of her comments with an April 12 tweet that said, \u201cWE WILL NEVER FORGET!\u201d His tweet included a video that starts with Omar\u2019s clipped comment \u2014 \u201cCAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something\u201d \u2014 followed by gruesome scenes of the 9/11 attacks. The 43-second video, which has been viewed more than 10 million times, repeats her phrase \u201csome people did something\u201d several times interspersed with footage of the attack and wreckage.\n\n\n\nOmar said that since the president\u2019s tweet, \u201cI have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life \u2014 many directly referencing or replying to the president\u2019s video.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d on April 14, host Chris Wallace asked White House Press Secretary Sanders if Trump worried \u201cat all about inciting violence against Muslims in general or Ilhan Omar in specific.\u201d\n\nSanders said the president \u201cis not trying to incite violence against anybody.\u201d She added, \u201cThat [9/11] was one of the most horrific moments in American history and for her to talk about it in such a dismissive way is frankly disgusting and abhorrent, and I\u2019m glad the president is calling her out and holding her accountable for it.\u201d\n\nWe could not find that Omar has commented directly on the accusation that her words trivialized the attack, but she retweeted several defenders who said her comments were being manipulated and used out of context. In one tweet, Mehdi Hasan, a columnist at the Intercept, wrote, \u201cShe didn\u2019t trivialize 9/11, she pointed out that Islamoohobes like yourself use 9/11 to smear all Muslims.\u201d In another, Rep. Ayanna Pressley wrote that Omar\u2019s \u201cfull comments clearly speak to post 9/11 #Islamophobia\u201d and that \u201cManipulating her remarks is defaming & dangerous for her & her family.\u201d And Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez noted that Omar is a cosponsor of H.R. 1327, a bill that seeks to fully fund the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund.\n\nOn CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on April 14, host Jake Tapper asked Rep. Nadler if he took \u201cany issue with the way Congresswoman Omar characterized 9/11.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I did not,\u201d Nadler said. \u201cShe characterized it only in passing. She was talking about discrimination against Muslim Americans. And she just said that, after that happened, it was used as an excuse for lots of discrimination and for withdrawal of civil liberties.\u201d\n\nIn the sentence in question, Omar pushes her hand away from her when she mentions \u201csome people\u201d \u2014 presumably to emphasize that it was a few Muslims who had \u201cdone something\u201d \u2014 and she then twirled her fingers in a circle when referring to \u201call of us\u201d losing \u201caccess to our civil liberties\u201d as a result.\n\nAgain, we will leave it up to readers to determine for themselves the appropriateness of her words.\n\nWe should also note that Omar was wrong when she said CAIR was founded after 9/11. As its website notes, CAIR was established in 1994 \u201cto promote a positive image of Islam and Muslims in America\u201d and to \u201cempower the American Muslim community and encourage their participation in political and social activism.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
