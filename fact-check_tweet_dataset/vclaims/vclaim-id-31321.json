The posts were published within days of new traffic rules and fines coming into force in India on September 1, 2019. The video is being used in a misleading context; the footage has circulated online since 2013 in media reports about a dispute over security arrangements at an event.\n\nThe 41-second clip was published in this Facebook post on September 6, 2019. It has been viewed more than 1.6 million times and shared more than 64,000 times.\n\nThe post's Hindi-language caption translates to English as: \u201cSee what happens when the cops could not distribute the money equally among themselves after collecting traffic fines.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe same video was shared on Facebook here and here; here on Twitter and here on YouTube with a similar claim.\n\nIndia\u2019s new Motor Vehicle Act and updated traffic fines came into effect on September 1, 2019. Here is a local media report explaining the fines, and here is a copy of the legislation.\n\nThe footage of the police officers fighting has nothing to do with the new traffic fines -- the video has circulated online since 2013. According to local media reports at the time, it shows police officers fighting over security arrangements at an event attended by the then-chief minister of the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav.\n\nA Hindi-speaking journalist in AFP's Delhi bureau analysed the video. At the 26 second mark in the clip, one of the policemen can be heard accusing the other of being absent from duty when the chief minister was due to arrive.\n\n\u201cWhen the chief minister was coming, he was missing from his security duty. I didn\u2019t have his number and asked a constable to call him, but he started abusing me. I told my senior, but abused me in front of him as well,\u201d he says in Hindi.\n\nA reverse image search on Google using the keyframes from the misleading footage found this footage posted on the official YouTube channel of Headlines Today on May 22, 2013.\n\nThe video\u2019s title states: \u2018Two UP cops thrash each other with lathis\u2019\n\nUP cops refer to Uttar Pradesh police, meanwhile \u2018Lathi\u2019 is a Hindi word for a stick or truncheon.\n\nBelow are three screenshot comparisons of the video shared in the misleading Facebook post (L) and the video published in the Headlines Today report (R ):\n\nThe original incident was also reported here by The Indian Express newspaper on May 23, 2013, which said the fight was due to an issue over security arrangements at an event.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the news report:\n\n\u201cTwo jawans of Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) clashed in full public view outside the Indira Gandhi Pratishthan soon after Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav left the venue after attending a business conference of the Indian Industries Association at Gomti Nagar area on Wednesday afternoon,\u201d a part of the report says.\n\nThe 2013 incident was also reported here by India TV and here by the Hindustan Times.", "lang": "en"}
