We took a look at several items on this list, as well as a few from House Republican Leader John Boehner to see if they were as billed.\n\nIn this item, we look at McConnell's claim that \"$100,000 in stimulus funds (were) used for a Martini Bar and Brazilian Steakhouse.\"\n\n\n\nThis one has made the rounds. It appears on Boehner's list as well and has been cited by several Republicans as an example of stimulus waste.\n\n\n\nThe short answer on this one is that it's true, or used to be. This claim refers to two projects in St. Joseph, Mo., that were awarded Community Development Block Grants by the city, with funds from the stimulus. The martini bar owner, who had been awarded $25,000 to expand his existing business, withdrew his application for the federal funds on Jan. 21, 2010, after it was discovered that the company had liens placed against it by the IRS and the state for failing to pay a little more than $8,000 in taxes, said St. Joseph's Community Development Manager Gerald McCush.\n\n\n\n\"You get no funds from the stimulus if you owe the IRS money, sorry,\" McCush said.\n\n\n\nSo, the martini bar is getting no stimulus.\n\n\n\nAs for the steakhouse, a city committee awarded $75,000 in Community Development Block Grant recovery money to ECBG LLC, a private company, to build a Brazilian steakhouse downtown.\n\n\n\n\"We are trying to revitalize the downtown,\" McCush explained. \"That is a priority for the City Council. We have a pretty blighted downtown.\"\n\n\n\nIn all, the city received $475,000 worth of Community Development Block Grant funds from the stimulus. A city committee that included two City Council members, two representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, a city planner and some other city residents decided on the projects from among $2 million worth of requests.\n\n\n\nThe steakhouse was selected not only because it met the city's priority for revitalizing the downtown, McCush said, but also because it would result in a number of new jobs. The steakhouse will anchor a downtown building that includes several other retail spaces. Construction of the building employed roughly 60 construction workers, McCush said, and the restaurant is expected to employ 30 people full time. \n\n\n\nThe restaurant is scheduled to open in April.\n\nMcConnell is largely on target with his claim about the projects and the money they were awarded in stimulus funds. The application for money related to the martini bar has since been withdrawn, though it did initially receive the award. And so we rate this claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
