The other image also shows the Reuters photographer Kim Kyung-Hoon taking his photo and that the scene was not staged.\n\nAfter a photograph of a Honduran migrant, named by Reuters as Maria Meza, fleeing tear gas with her young children was published by multiple news outlets, a widely shared tweet annotated the image to claim it was set-up. The main evidence that the photo is \"fake\" or \"staged,\" according to that tweet and others, is that the other migrants and cameramen in the background of the image appear to be neither running nor impacted by the tear gas.\n\nThe tweets were then shared in multiple articles questioning the veracity of the image. Each article was shared thousands of times on Facebook, according to data from CrowdTangle, a social media monitoring tool.\n\nAccording to an AFP report from November 25, at least 500 migrants from the Central American caravan, including women and children, had been taking part in a peaceful demonstration in Tijuana before rushing the border.\n\nThis AFP video shows how quickly the scene unfolded after the tear gas was fired by US Customs and Border Protection.\n\nBBC video and CTV video from the scene also shows tear gas being fired.\n\nA billboard seen in the distance of the AFP video shows two people with their arms raised. That same billboard is visible in the BBC and CTV footage and one of the Reuters photos of Meza and her daughters, showing that all of the footage depicts the same location.\n\nSergio Ortiz, a local Mexican photographer for the newspaper La Frontera in Tijuana, posted a picture on his Instagram account which shows Meza running from another angle. Kim can be seen working in the center of the photo.\n\nOther visual cues make it clear the photos are of the same scene:\n\n1. The distinctive blue of Meza\u2019s shirt and her black pants.\n\n2. Meza\u2019s five-year-old daughter wearing a purple tee-shirt and a diaper with no pants.\n\n4. The shadows coming off of Meza and her children are going in the same direction (toward the tear gas), proving they were taken at the same time of day.\n\nOrtiz, who said he does not know Kim, told AFP in Spanish, \"In that moment, everything went really fast.\"\n\nOrtiz said he wasn\u2019t wearing a helmet or gas mask, so he took only three pictures and then fled that area.\n\nBuzzFeed News later spoke with Meza about the scene.\n\n\u201cI thought my kids were going to die with me because of the gas we inhaled,\u201d she told the news website.\n\nUS Customs and Border Protection also confirmed that tear gas was used along the border in San Diego after agents were hit by \u201cprojectiles.\u201d\n\nKim has responded to the staging allegations in Reuters\u2019 Wider Image blog.\n\n\u201cSome social media users have called the photo \u2018staged,\u2019 which absolutely is not the case. At Reuters, we have strict photo guidelines. We are not allowed to mislead the viewer by making material alterations or staging scenes,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThis section of the Reuters Handbook of Journalism shows their policy on staging pictures.\n\nTheir policy aligns with the Society of Professional Journalists Code of Ethics which states, \u201cJournalists should never deliberately distort facts or context, including visual information. Clearly label illustrations and re-enactments.\u201d\n\nThe Central American migrant caravan has been a continual target of false or misleading reports and social media posts.", "lang": "en"}
