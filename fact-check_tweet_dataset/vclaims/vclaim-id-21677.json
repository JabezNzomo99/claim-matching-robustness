Or they can be legal powers that come with formal penalties, such as court orders under the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014.\n\nAround 4,100 people were sleeping rough in England on one sample night in 2016. Across the whole of 2016 almost 60,000 households were accepted as \u201chomeless\u201d by councils, although many will have a physical roof over their heads in the short term.\n\nHow widespread is this practice?\n\nThe Crisis report shows that at least some councils use formal enforcement powers against rough sleepers, although it\u2019s not entirely clear how many.\n\nAs the Canary reported, 36% of the 81 councils responding to an online survey said that they used enforcement powers of some kind to \u201cspecifically target rough sleeping\u201d. Crisis said that \u201cin the main\u201d these were formal powers.\n\nBut only 6% of the 305 councils replying to a separate Freedom of Information request said that they used formal powers under the 2014 Act. Crisis told us that the FOIs didn\u2019t cover informal enforcement actions, although there still seems like a big difference in the two results. We\u2019ve asked for more information.\n\nAs some of these powers are used by the police, it might be that some councils are reporting enforcement measures being used in their area, rather than by council officials themselves.\n\nWhatever the exact proportion now, other councils say they plan to use formal enforcement powers in the future.\n\nBut do they amount to making poverty a crime?\n\nAt least one of the formal \u201cenforcement measures\u201d used by councils relies directly on criminal law. The Vagrancy Act 1824 makes rough sleeping (\u201cwandering abroad and lodging \u2026 in the open air\u201d) a criminal offence in itself.\n\nThat said, only one person was sent to prison for \u201csleeping out\u201d between 2005 and 2015. The Crisis report refers to Vagrancy Act \u201carrests\u201d being used to tackle rough sleeping and begging, rather than actual prosecutions under the law.\n\nMore common is the use of powers in a law passed this century: the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014.\n\nThis allows for court orders aimed at curbing anti-social behaviour by threatening criminal penalties if the order is broken. They aren\u2019t in themselves a criminal conviction.\n\nThese orders include Injunctions to Prevents Nuisance and Annoyance (the new Anti-Social Behaviour Order); Community Protection Notices; Dispersal Orders; Public Spaces Protection Orders; and Criminal Behaviour Orders.\n\nThe circumstances in which these orders can be handed out, and who has the power to use them, vary. But the upshot in most cases is that not obeying the order is a criminal offence.\n\nThe exception is the Injunction to Prevent Nuisance and Annoyance, breaking which is dealt with as contempt of court. That\u2019s not a criminal offence but can still lead to a fine or imprisonment.\n\nAn example of a beggar being sent to prison for breaching a Criminal Behaviour Order\u2014which can only be given to someone convicted of a crime, at the prosecution\u2019s request\u2014was reported recently in Coventry.\n\nAs this highlights, these orders seem to be used more for \u201cbehaviour associated with rough sleeping\u201d than to ban the practice of rough sleeping itself.\n\nRough sleepers\u2019 behaviour is \u201coften perceived as anti-social\u201d, as Crisis puts it\u2014taking drugs or drinking outdoors, for instance.\n\nCouncils say that they offer support to rough sleepers when using formal enforcement measures\n\nComplaints about this behaviour are partly the driving force behind these enforcement measures. But Crisis notes that councils are also motivated by \u201cconcerns for the wellbeing of those engaged in rough sleeping and anti-social street activities\u201d.\n\nIts report found that \u201cwhere targeted at genuine anti-social behaviour, and when integrated with high quality tailored support and accom[m]odation, formal enforcement measures\u2014often used within a multi-agency setting\u2014can act as a catalyst to help rough sleepers move away from street lifestyles and also move into accommodation\u201d.\n\nIf not used properly, though, the use of court orders and powers of arrest \u201conly serves to displace rough sleepers geographically, leaving them at times marginalised and excluded from support services they rely on\u201d.\n\nIn practice, only one fifth of rough sleepers in Crisis\u2019s sample were actually offered support such as emergency accommodation or help with alcoholism during their most recent experience of \u201cenforcement measures\u201d.\n\nThis seems to be because they usually experience informal enforcement measures such as being moved on by a police officer, as opposed to a formal court order which is far more likely to be accompanied by an offer of official help.", "lang": "en"}
