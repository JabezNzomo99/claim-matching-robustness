That was assuming the UK left the EU on 31 October 2019.\n\nThe often-quoted figure of \u00a339 billion is what the bill used to be when the UK and EU first agreed on how the payment would be calculated. Since then it\u2019s been revised down, not least because the UK\u2019s exit from the EU was delayed until the 31 October. As the Brexit deadline has now been extended to 31 January 2020, we can probably expect a revised divorce bill figure in the future.\n\nBut while delays have reduced the amount the UK has agreed to pay upon leaving, \u201cit does not change the overall amount that the UK transfers to the EU\u201d, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. That\u2019s because part of the bill was always planned to include the UK\u2019s regular membership payments to the EU budget as if it were still a member until the end of 2020.\n\nSo while the amount the UK has agreed to pay upon leaving has reduced, it isn\u2019t currently set to pay any less money to the EU than it would have otherwise\u2014part of it is simply being paid while the UK remains an EU member.\n\nThe government has previously said it expects to update the divorce bill figure once the UK leaves the EU.\n\nWhat has been agreed?\n\nOn 11th December 2017, Theresa May confirmed that the UK and the EU had agreed \u201cthe scope of commitments, and methods for valuations and adjustments to those values.\u201d The calculations are an estimate of the UK\u2019s commitments to the EU, valued according to a set of agreed principles. The bill is made up of:\n\u2022 The UK\u2019s contribution to EU annual budgets up to 2020;\n\u2022 Financing liabilities up to the end of 2020.\n\nIn November 2018, UK government and EU negotiators reached agreement over the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU (the draft withdrawal agreement) which reaffirmed that the UK and EU have agreed that the UK will honour its commitments to the EU through a financial settlement.\n\nThat agreement was rejected three times by the UK parliament.\n\nBoris Johnson then renegotiated the withdrawal agreement with the EU, though the divorce bill aspect remains unchanged from Theresa May\u2019s deal. Mr Johnson\u2019s deal has so far not passed parliament.", "lang": "en"}
