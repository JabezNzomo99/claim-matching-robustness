Symbols associated with Nazi-era Germany, such as swastikas, striped uniforms, and yellow Stars of David are examples of such elements:\n\nIn August 2014, the Inditex Group\u2019s chain of Zara fashion stores was the focus of outrage and criticism for offering a set of striped children\u2019s pajamas adorned with yellow stars that many consumers found too reminiscent of Holocaust-era concentration camp uniforms worn by imprisoned Jews:\n\nZara responded to consumer complaints by asserting the pajama design was \u201cinspired by the sheriff\u2019s stars from the Classic Western films\u201d rather than concentration camp attire and was no longer available in its stores:\n\nAlthough a horizontal striped shirt design is more typically associated with prisoners than with law enforcement, the star featured on the Zara pajamas in question did bear a legend identifying it as a sheriff\u2019s badge:\n\nWith the uproar on Twitter in full throat, Zara\u2019s parent company, Inditex of Spain, announced that it had stopped selling the shirt. \u201cWe would not want any of our products or designs to be perceived as disrespectful or offensive,\u201d the company said in a statement.The \u201cSheriff\u201d shirt was produced in Turkey but designed in A Coru\u00f1a, where Inditex is based. It was ordered by a small number of customers and will not be delivered. Instead, the shirts will be destroyed, according to a person who had been briefed on the company\u2019s plans but would not speak for attribution. Company executives did not grant interviews. \u201cThe design of the T-shirt was only inspired by the sheriff\u2019s stars from the classic Western films, as the claim of the T-shirt says,\u201d the company said in its statement. But others saw it differently and were incredulous that a major retailer would have offered such an item. The shirt has a large six-pointed yellow star over dark horizontal stripes. It was strikingly similar to the appearance of uniforms that Jews were made to wear in concentration camps, which had a similar star and vertical stripes.\n\nThenoted of the controversy that:\n\nThis incident replicated a similar brouhaha involving Zara from back in 2007. Although the swastika is of ancient origin and the swastika motif has been used by many different cultures over thousands of years, the Nazi Party\u2019s adoption of the symbol as their iconic emblem has so stigmatized it that its display is now anathema throughout most of the western world. (The swastika remains an accepted symbol in Indian and eastern religious cultures.) It was no surprise, then, that when some UK Zara outlets began to offer a handbag adorned with green swastikas at each corner in September 2007, consumers soon voiced vociferous complaints about the item:\n\nRachel Hatton, 19, from Ashford, Kent, said she couldn\u2019t believe her eyes when she saw the symbol of the Nazi party on her bag. \u201cI really had to look twice. It\u2019s identical to the symbol Hitler used to cause fear throughout Europe. I took it back and got my money refunded.\u201d Denis Fernando, the national secretary of Unite Against Fascism said: \u201cIt is completely offensive and abhorrent to millions and millions of people.\u201d\n\nThe company quickly withdrew the bag from its stores, saying they had not noticed the inclusion of the symbol and that its use was not a part of the design it had originally approved:\n\nZara, owned by the world\u2019s second largest fashion retailer Inditex, said it did not know the 39\u00a3 ($78) handbag had green swastikas on its corners.The bags were made by a supplier in India and inspired by commonly used Hindu symbols, which include the swastika. The original design approved by Zara did not have swastikas on it, Inditex said. \u201cAfter the return of one bag we decided to withdraw the whole range,\u201d said a spokesman for Inditex, which has more than 3,330 stores in 66 countries.", "lang": "en"}
