In a tweet Sunday, Trump boasted of poll numbers that showed 52 percent of all Americans approved of his performance in office, in spite of the \"fake news media.\"\n\nNo known poll exists showing such high ratings.\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: \"Over 90% approval rating for your all time favorite (I hope) President within the Republican Party and 52% overall. This despite all of the made up stories by the Fake News Media trying endlessly to make me look as bad and evil as possible. Look at the real villains please!\" \u2014 tweet Sunday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He's wrong in regard to polls citing his overall job ratings.\n\nThe Associated Press couldn't find any evidence of a recent poll that put Trump's approval at 52 percent, and the White House and his re-election campaign didn't immediately respond to requests for specifics.\n\nPolls are a snapshot of public opinion at the moment they are taken, and job approval can \u2014 and has in recent history \u2014 vary during a president's term. George W. Bush, for example, had approval ratings that reached into the high 80s and low 90s in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, and dropped into the high 20s and low 30s toward the end of his time in office.\n\nSince his inauguration, however, Trump's job approval has been remarkably consistent \u2014 in the high 30s and low 40s \u2014 in polls from various media organizations and other pollsters.\n\nThe latest AP-NORC poll, taken this month, finds Trump's approval among American adults at 38 percent. Some other recent polls measure his approval in the low to mid-40s.\n\nOn his level of support among Republicans, Trump is correct that they broadly approve of his work as president. In the same AP-NORC poll that found 38 percent of adults approving of the president, 76 percent of Republicans and those who lean toward the GOP said they approved of Trump.\n\nThat fits with the pattern of his presidency, in which Trump has generally had widespread support from Republicans. Some polls have put that level of support as high as 90 percent.", "lang": "en"}
