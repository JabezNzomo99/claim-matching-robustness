If true, this would mean that Google Searches aren\u2019t objectively reflecting what the majority of Internet searches are actually looking for, possibly violating Google\u2019s algorithm. According to a research paper cited in this video, that kind of search result manipulation has the potential to substantially influence the outcome of actual elections.\n\nWhile the claims posited in the video displayed above may sound like the workings of a conspiracy theorist, SourceFed didn\u2019t fudge any of its evidence. We double checked the videos findings and confirmed that Google does return different results than Bing and Yahoo for searches such as \u201cHillary Clinton Cri\u201d and \u201cHillary Clinton Ind.\u201d For instance, Google completes the search \u201cHillary Clinton Cri\u201d as \u201cHillary Clinton Crime Reform\u201d, while Bing and Yahoo complete the search as \u201cHillary Clinton Criminal Charges\u201d and \u201cHillary Clinton Criminal.\u201d Google provides this result despite the fact that \u201cHillary Clinton Crime Reform\u201d is a less popular term on Google Trends.\n\nHowever, that does not mean that Google is manipulating search results in favor of the Democratic presidential candidate. Google\u2019s autocomplete function uses a variety of factors, including the popularity of a search term, to determine results. Furthermore, Google has also said in statements that its autocomplete does not provide offensive or disparaging results when partnered with a person\u2019s name:\n\nGoogle Autocomplete does not favor any candidate or cause. Claims to the contrary simply misunderstand how Autocomplete works. Our Autocomplete algorithm will not show a predicted query that is offensive or disparaging when displayed in conjunction with a person\u2019s name. More generally, our autocomplete predictions are produced based on a number of factors including the popularity of search terms.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that Google Autocomplete will not show \u201cHillary Clinton Criminal\u201d when searching for \u201cHillary Clinton Cri,\u201d we couldn\u2019t get Google Autocomplete to label anyone a criminal. When we searched for the names of various criminals along with the prefix \u201ccri,\u201d we received results for \u201ccricket,\u201d \u201ccriminology,\u201d \u201ccrisis communication,\u201d and in the case of recently convicted swimmer Brock Turner, no results:\n\nGoogle\u2019s search results also differ than Bing and Yahoo\u2019s when searching for disparaging remarks against other political candidates, such as Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. For instance, when searching for \u201cBernie Sanders Com\u201d on Google, you\u2019ll get results for \u201cBernie Sanders commercial,\u201d while Bing and Yahoo provide results related to communism. \u201cDonald Trump sex\u201d resulted in results about sexist remarks and sex scandals on Bing and Yahoo, while Google returned \u201cDonald Trump Sex And The City\u201d:\n\nWhile Google does offer different search results than its competitors Bing and Yahoo, this is not proof that the search engine is skewing its results in favor of Hillary Clinton \u2014 or anybody else.", "lang": "en"}
