The Senate\u2019s online archives showed no such bill was filed and representatives of both senators said the claim was false.\n\nThe Facebook posts, for example this one and this one, say the purported bill was filed by Ana Theresia \u201cRisa\u201d Hontiveros and Francis \u201cKiko\u201d Pangilinan.\n\nHere is a screenshot of one of the posts:\n\nThe photo shows Hontiveros on the left and Pangilinan on the right.\n\nThe post, when translated to English, says: \u201cThese two are really stupid as all voters want to receive 13th month pay as part of the reward from the companies or offices they work for. Some people even have a 14-16 month pay at the end of the year and these will just be removed. LP really adds burden to the country.\u201d\n\nLP refers to the Liberal Party, the main opposition party in the Philippines.\n\nPangilinan is the party\u2019s president, while Hontiveros is a member of one of its allies, the Akbayan political party.\n\nHontiveros won her first Senate term in 2016 and Pangilinan was elected again, having stepped down in 2013 after serving the maximum permitted two consecutive terms as senator.\n\nA search of the Senate\u2019s online archives shows no bill has been filed in the 17th congress to abolish 13th month pay.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the search results:\n\nA spokeswoman for Hontiveros, Lui Belmonte, told AFP on Facebook messenger: \u201cNope\u2026 no such bill filed.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the claims in the Facebook posts, Julie Laconico Tancio, a spokeswoman for Pangilinan, told AFP by text message: \u201cnot true\u201d.\n\nAn online search also revealed the false Facebook posts had the same headline and picture as an entry published December 9 on the satirical website Adobo Chronicles.\n\nThe false claim about Hontiveros and Pangilinan appeared on Facebook on December 11.\n\nThe false claim has been shared by multiple Facebook groups that support Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and have more than 300,000 followers, according to data from CrowdTangle.\n\nHontiveros and Pangilinan are critics of Duterte.", "lang": "en"}
