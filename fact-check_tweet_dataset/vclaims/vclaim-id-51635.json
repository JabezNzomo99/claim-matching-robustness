Kamala Harris\u2019 race was listed as \u201cCaucasian\u201d on her birth certificate. Harris is biracial, with an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, and she has faced a number of conspiracy theories and criticisms regarding her racial identity. The basis for this specific claim is an image of Harris\u2019 birth certificate:\n\nThe Dispatch Fact Check acquired a copy of Harris\u2019 birth certificate from Alameda County\u2019s Office of Clerk-Recorder, so we can verify the authenticity of the image.\n\nBirth certificates, death certificates, and marriage certificates can be purchased in a redacted form from the clerk-recorder\u2019s office, making it probable that the image currently circulating was obtained through this manner. It should be noted that the image is the first of two documents\u2014Harris\u2019 birth certificate was amended on February 18, 1965, to change her middle name, which explains why the birth certificate says her middle name is \u201cIyer\u201d instead of \u201cDevi.\u201d\n\nHowever, while the image might be real, the claims about Harris\u2019 race being listed as Caucasian are false. A close reading of the birth certificate (or any reading of it for that matter) shows that the circled section is \u201ccolor or race of mother.\u201d\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
