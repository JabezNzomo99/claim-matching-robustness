The two together made insurance affordable for people with, say, cancer. Before Obamacare, even minor health problems could have led an insurance company to deny coverage.\n\n\u201cEven though the guaranteed-issue and community rating provisions are constitutionally valid when standing on their own, it is evident that Congress would not \u2018have wanted\u2019 them to stand without the individual mandate,\u201d Francisco wrote. \u201cThat these provisions are inseverable is evident from the enacted text of the ACA, where Congress expressly found that the individual mandate is essential to the operation of the guaranteed-issue and community rating provisions.\u201d\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate health committee, said he was disappointed Trump decided to press the case. \u201cI thought the Justice Department argument was really flimsy,\u201d Alexander said last month on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cWhat they\u2019re arguing is that when we voted to get rid of the individual mandate, we voted to get rid of Obamacare. I don\u2019t know one single senator that thought that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ACA remains in effect while the litigation is pending,\u201d according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cHowever, if all or most of the law ultimately is struck down, it will have complex and far-reaching consequences for the nation\u2019s health care system, affecting nearly everyone in some way. A host of ACA provisions could be eliminated, including protections for people with preexisting conditions, subsidies to make individual health insurance more affordable, expanded eligibility for Medicaid, coverage of young adults up to age 26 under their parents\u2019 insurance policies, coverage of preventive care with no patient cost-sharing, closing of the doughnut hole under Medicare\u2019s drug benefit, and a series of tax increases to fund these initiatives.\u201d\n\nTrump told The Post days before his inauguration in January 2017 that he was nearly done with his plan to replace Obama\u2019s signature health-care law. Three and a half years later, no replacement plan has emerged from the administration. It would be an enormous undertaking. The health-care industry accounts for roughly one-sixth of the U.S. economy. The Affordable Care Act is a sprawling piece of legislation with deep roots after 10 years.\n\nRepublicans hardly agree on what a replacement for Obamacare would look like \u2014 or how to preserve the protections for preexisting health conditions. \u201cI spent 6 months of 2014 working on a replacement, every single day, with staff and the 4 committee chairs of jurisdiction. We could not even put together a white paper,\u201d Republican consultant Doug Heye wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe president threw his support behind House and Senate bills that would have weakened the guaranteed issue and community rating protections by allowing states to seek waivers and consider a person\u2019s health status when writing policies in the individual market. The theory was that removing sicker people from the markets and allowing policies with skimpier options would result in lower overall premiums.\n\nThe Trump administration also has issued new rules that promote the use of low-quality, short-term plans that were prohibited under Obamacare. These plans typically don\u2019t have the same protections for people with existing health conditions, allowing insurance companies to deny coverage or charge higher prices. (A number of states, mainly Democratic-leaning, have acted to prohibit or limit these Trump plans.)", "lang": "en"}
