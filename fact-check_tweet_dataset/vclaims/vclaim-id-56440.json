Gina Raimondo signed an executive order that would leave the second half of the name out of official state correspondence and henceforth only refer to it in an official capacity as the \u201cState of Rhode Island.\u201d\n\nThe announcement came amid a national discussion about institutional racism, sparked by nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died after being pinned under the knee of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Video of the incident went viral, sparking widespread outrage and demonstrations.\n\nIn a statement, Rhode Island General Treasurer Seth Magaziner noted that although the word \u201cPlantation\u201d in Rhode Island\u2019s name \u201cwas not necessarily connected with slavery,\u201d its connotation evokes an ugly, racist history.\n\nMagaziner stated, \u201cWords and symbols can take on new meanings over time. As a Rhode Islander with Jewish heritage, I know all too well that the swastika, originally a symbol of spirituality and peace, became a symbol of profound hatred and evil.\u201d\n\nThis was not the first time the state name has come under scrutiny.\n\nIn 2010, Rhode Island voters rejected a proposal to change the name to simply \u201cRhode Island.\u201d State legislators however are gearing up to put the question back to voters in November 2020.", "lang": "en"}
