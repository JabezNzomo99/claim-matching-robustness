Twitter labeled the tweet \u201cmanipulated media\u201d soon after it was posted \u2014 the fourth time the social media platform took action against the president\u2019s online output in a month.\n\nThe minute-long video starts with ominous music and a clip showing footage of a Black child running away from a white child with an edited banner purportedly from CNN, reading, \u201cTerrified todler [sic] runs from racist baby. Racist baby probably a Trump voter.\u201d At 11 seconds, a title card appears saying \u201cWhat actually happened,\u201d followed by a clip of the two children embracing. They then playfully chase each other around. The video ends with the card: \u201cAmerica is not the problem. Fake news is. If you see something, say something. Only you can prevent fake news dumpster fires.\u201d\n\nCNN covered the original real story in September 2019 with the title, \u201cThese two toddlers are showing us what real life besties look like.\u201d The viral video from New York City was originally posted on Facebook by the father of one of the toddlers, who said, \u201cWith all the racism and hate going on I just think it\u2019s a beautiful video.\u201d The two boys had been friends for more than a year.\n\nAfter Trump posted the doctored version, journalists took note of the fake chyron, with one saying,\u201dThis isn\u2019t even CNN\u2019s typeface.\u201d\n\nCNN responded to Trump by telling him to \u201cBe better\u201d:\n\nAs of writing this, the version of the video that Trump tweeted had almost 16 million views, and has been retweeted more than 180,000 times. The doctored video appears to be watermarked with \u201c@CarpeDonktum,\u201d the handle of a Twitter user and Trump supporter who describes himself as a \u201cmemesmith.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
