Twitter user Sanjay Gupta shared the photograph with the caption, \u201c\u091a\u092e\u091a\u094b\u0902 \u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u092a\u093f\u0924\u093e \u0915\u0930 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902? Bootlickers, what is your Father of the Nation doing?\u201d\n\nA reverse search of the image revealed to Alt News that the picture has been photoshopped. In the original image, Gandhi is with former Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. The image was found in the archives of Associated Presswhich said that it was clicked at the\u201cAll-India Congress committee meeting in Bombay, India, on July 6, 1946.\u201d\n\nA juxtaposition of the image shared on social media and the one uploaded on AP clearly shows that the former is a work of photoshop.\n\nAlt News found that the photoshopped image has been floating on social media in the past few years. It was used as a featured image for a 2013 YouTube video titled, \u201cDid Mahatma Gandhi sleep with virgins?\u201d\n\nWe were able to trace the image as far back as 2012 when it was featured on a blog post about Gandhi\u2019s sex life.\n\nThe image was debunked by Alt News in 2018 as well.", "lang": "en"}
