STAY ALIVE.\"\n\nPut in context, that\u2019s more than three deaths every day, by the 113th day of the year. The implication of the sign suggests that driver behavior is contributing to those fatalities.\n\nBut considering PolitiFact Georgia just fact-checked road fatalities in January, showing highway deaths appeared to be declining, could that trend already be reversing?\n\nAnd does driver behavior have anything to do with the trend?\n\nYes and yes, according to Terri Pope, spokeswoman for the Northeast DOT region, when asked about the signs and numbers behind them.\n\nSo far in 2015, traffic deaths are up 25 percent from last year, Pope said. The state is averaging 100 deaths a month on its roadways, putting it on track for 1,200 fatalities by year\u2019s end.\n\nIf that happens, it will be a 4.6 percent increase from 2014 numbers \u2013 and the first year-to-year increase in nine years.\n\nEven worse, of the year\u2019s roadway deaths so far, only 38 percent of drivers were wearing seat belts and 69 percent failed to maintain their lane \u2013 behaviors that experts say save lives behind the wheel, Pope said.\n\nAnd, 60 percent of the fatalities were single-car crashes where the vehicle hit a tree, culvert or bridge or drifted into another lane.\n\n\"Those statistics show that drivers, now more than ever, are driving distracted or are driving impaired,\" Pope wrote in an email.\n\nSo the number of roadway deaths in Georgia is definitely on the rise.\n\nBut has distracted driving \u2013 such as the use of a cell phone \u2013 also increased as a contributing factor in those crashes?\n\nThe state DOT does not have 2015 data with that information, since local law enforcement agencies would determine causes as part of investigations that will lag behind the actual accidents.\n\nBut the type of accidents \u2013 those single-car crashes into fixed objects or failing to maintain the lane \u2013 indicate the driver was distracted by something.\n\nThe Governor\u2019s Office of Highway Safety provided PolitiFact Georgia with statistics on distracted driving from 2009 to 2014.\n\nThe data, with last year\u2019s numbers still considered preliminary are:\n\n\n\n Looking at those numbers, it\u2019s clear the number of fatal crashes in which distracted driving was a factor jumped nearly 64 percent in five years.\n\nThe increase in the number of deaths was even worse: up nearly 73 percent in the five years (though down 17 percent from a high-water year in 2010).\n\nThe same factors that had been helping push down roadway deaths \u2013 safer cars, stepped up enforcement of drunken driving and roadway enhancements \u2013 are likely to have allowed for more injuries in crashes, said Harris Blackwood, director of the highway safety office.\n\nBut still, the number of people injured in distracted driving crashes jumped 181 percent in the five years.\n\n\"Driver error is a major factor in a lot of these crashes that have happened and in these increased fatal crashes,\" Blackwood said. \"You\u2019ve just got to get your focus on that road. The life you save is going to be yours.\"\n\nWith a busy summer season of driving ahead, that is the message transportation officials hope gets through the numbers.\n\nThe state DOT has begun flashing messages on Georgia roadways, indicating driver behavior is causing an increase in traffic fatalities.\n\nThe numbers bear out that increase. And the kind of crashes, and data from previous years, indicates driving while distracted with texting and phone use is likewise on the rise.", "lang": "en"}
