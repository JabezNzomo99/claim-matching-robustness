However, what explains a Twitter handle associated with a registered company deliberately defaming people and invoking acts of violence against people and yet Twitter doesn\u2019t seem to notice it at all. MyVoteToday, a mobile e-polling application, created by Apption Digital Technologies Pvt Ltd based in Bangalore and Apption Digial Inc. based in Palo Alto, California, is currently running a poll via their Twitter account which poses the following question:\n\n66 men and women have been chosen and their pictures are splashed over hundreds of posts urging people to vote in Twitter polls which is to eventually decide which #EnemiesOfIndia need to be silenced.\n\nThe 66 people who were declared #EnemiesOfIndia and some of whom need to be \u2018silenced\u2019 to #MakeIndiaGreatAgain are as follows:\n\nFrom Journalists to Professors to Artists to Students to Separatists to Politicians and 2 serving Chief Ministers namely West Bengal\u2019s Mamta Banerjee and Kerala\u2019s Pinari Vijayan, the list is quite extensive. Some of these people need to be silenced according to MyVoteToday. Consider that most of these people are not really the \u2018silent\u2019 kind, wonder what \u201cneed to be silenced\u201d really means? In any case, running a campaign by terming certain people as #EnemiesOfIndia is patently defamatory.\n\nIn February, this same handle ran a poll asking which person among the 96 chosen men and women would people like to #SLAP. The contest was called #MVTSlapBoard. Such polls promote a culture of violence and are especially dangerous in this day and age when mob lynching incidents happen almost every week.\n\nOther than MyVoteToday, the company also seems to runs a few more Twitter handles namely \u201cMVT_JustForFun\u201c, \u201cMyVotr\u201c, \u201cPollCourt\u201d and \u201cMVT_NEWS\u201c. These Twitter handles keep retweeting each other all the time and they are followed by the Company Twitter handle namely \u201capptiondigital\u201c.\n\nHere\u2019s a glimpse of the kind of polls MVT_JustForFun runs. In this one, they ask as to who among the four women in the picture would one like to spend a weekend with on a remote island.\n\nOr what is your favorite colour, and one has to choose a colour corresponding to bikini bottoms of the following women.\n\nThe results of the earlier poll were broadcast by the myVOTR Twitter handle.\n\nBoth the poll results as well as the poll questions were retweeted by the main MyVoteToday Twitter handle.\n\nMyVoteToday Twitter account is routinely abusive as well even when not running polls. When Congress spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi objected to MyVoteToday running a poll as to who is the \u2018hottest\u2019 spokesperson, MyVoteToday\u2019s response was anything but civil. They later deleted this abhorrent tweet.\n\nThere are many other examples of their abusive polls and tweets. In the following tweet, pretty sure they didn\u2019t want to call Omar Abdullah a \u2018bustard\u2019, considering \u2018bustard\u2019 is a bird. There are these other tweets where journalists have been polled for being the most #AntiModiPresstitute. Or who\u2019s the most #DirtyRottenScoundrel.\n\nThat is the sort of e-polling that MyVoteToday is doing, from asking who needs to be \u2018silenced\u2019 and \u2018slapped\u2019 to who do you want to spend a weekend with on a remote island. Who\u2019s behind this \u2018noble\u2019 idea? The two directors of the company Apption Digital Private Limited who created the MyVoteToday mobile application are Amit Bagaria and Samridh Agarwal. Amit Bagaria is the CEO.\n\nThe CEO of the company Amit Bagaria calls himself a \u2018nationalist\u2019. He\u2019s very active on Twitter and routinely retweets posts from the Twitter accounts MyVoteToday, MVT_JustForFun and MyVotR. Retweets include polls such as #EnemiesOfIndia. He seems to be an accomplished businessman based on the sheer number of companies he\u2019s a director of.\n\nWe also spoke to Mr BG Mahesh (Bhoopalam Gopalakrishna Mahesh) who was formerly on the board of Apption Digital Private Limited and he stated that he parted ways with the company due to professional differences more than year and a half ago.\n\nAt the time of writing, MyVoteToday has a Twitter following of 566,290 and 707,822 followers on Facebook. In their \u2018About Us\u2018 page, MyVoteToday\u2019s stated objective is to \u201ckeep the concept of \u2018democracy\u2019 alive by seeking public opinion on all crucial issues\u201d. While all of us want the Indian democracy to be healthy and thriving, will that be achieved by asking people who they want slapped or who they want silenced? If at all, they are actually against the very spirit of democracy. Even though they have been reported several times for the kind of content they promote and the kind of abuses that their Twitter handle heaps on others, Twitter continues to give it the distinction of an official \u2018blue tick\u2019 i.e. a verified account. Has Twitter as a platform completely abdicated its responsibility of maintaining any sort of sanity or civility?", "lang": "en"}
