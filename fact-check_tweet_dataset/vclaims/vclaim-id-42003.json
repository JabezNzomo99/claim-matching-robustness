The video is being shared in the context of the recent protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Video of women being beaten up by the Police in Assam. Fact: The video is related to a lathi-charge on Anganwadi workers by the Police in Jharkhand. It is not related to Assam and the recent protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, a video of \u2018The Times of India\u2019 with similar visuals was found in the search results. The video uploaded by \u2018The Times of India\u2019 had the following title: \u2018On cam: Brutal lathicharge on Anganwadi workers in Jharkhand\u2019 and was uploaded on 25h September 2019. The same video can be also found in an article by \u2018Dainik Bhaskar\u2019 regarding the lathi-charge by the Jharkhand Police on Anganwadi workers. So, the video is in no way related to Assam and the recent protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019.\n\n\n\nTo sum it up, an old video from Jharkhand is being falsely shared as \u2018Assam police beating women\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
