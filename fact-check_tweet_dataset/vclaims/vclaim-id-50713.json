They need to face the fact that I am in charge, this is my country and I will do as I please, they have no control over me. The people support me and will always support me.\"\n\nThere\u2019s a convincing-looking chyron underneath the quote that reads: \"President Trump goes ballistic on Fox and Friends.\"\n\nBut it didn\u2019t really happen. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe screenshot is photoshopped. We did not find an instance of Trump making such a statement in our search of news archives.\n\nThe graphics for the Fox screengrab come from an April 25, 2019, phone interview that Trump gave to Fox News host Sean Hannity when he was talking about the 2016 Democratic National Committee server hack. The video lines up with the Facebook post\u2019s image a little after the 10-minute mark with the real Fox caption saying, \"Trump: I want to see what was on the DNC server.\"\n\nThe Facebook post\u2019s \"Trump goes ballistic\" line in the chyron also doesn\u2019t match the font used by Fox News Channel.\n\nA Fox News spokesperson confirmed to PolitiFact that the post\u2019s image was doctored.\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
