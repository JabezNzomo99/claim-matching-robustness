A Jakarta hospital acknowledged treating the boy\u2019s eye condition, but said it was not caused by staring at his smartphone for too long. An ophthalmologist also said the relatively common condition is not caused by gadget use.\n\nOn July 9, 2018, website rancahpost.co.id published an article with a headline in Indonesian that read: \u201cA 15-year-old teenager ruptures blood vessels in his eyes allegedly because of too much smartphone use. His story has gone viral!\u201d\n\nThe article quoted an Instagram account that claimed the injury was from smartphone use.\n\nIt also posted a picture it said was of the teen with large red blotches on the whites of his eyes and a breathing tube in his nose.\n\nThe injury claim and picture have been shared thousands of times at least by multiple Facebook pages, two of which specialise in distributing health-related information.\n\nA Facebook page called \u201cDokter Keluarga\u201d (Family Doctor) said in a post on July 8, 2018 that the teen was a patient at Dr. Mintohardjo Naval Hospital in Jakarta. An English translation of the post, shared more than 1,000 times, reads: \u201c(BEWARE)\u2026 A patient of Mintohardjo Naval Hospital aged 15 has his eye blood vessels broken due to excessive gadget use. He also frequently uses a mobile phone while lying on bed for hours.\u201d\n\nThe hospital\u2019s director, Wiweka, told AFP the person in the image was a patient released on July 5, 2018.\n\nBut the teen was hospitalised for health problems including hypertension, which caused him to suffer from subconjunctival bleeding, or a burst blood vessel, said Wiweka, who like many Indonesian goes by one name.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not because of using gadgets,\u201d he said.\n\nFerdiriva Hamzah, one of Indonesia\u2019s top ophthalmologists, also said smartphones did not cause the type of bleeding shown in the widely shared image.\n\n\u201cThe claim saying bleeding in eyes is caused by gadget use is exaggerated,\u201d Hamzah said.\n\nExcessive gadget use can result in tired or dry eyes and may cause changes in the quality of a child\u2019s eyesight, said Hamzah, who debunked the claim to his own 66,000 followers on Twitter.", "lang": "en"}
