Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah along with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat can be seen in a viral picture on social media. In the picture, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah can be seen behind RSS chief Bhagwat.\n\nThis picture turned out to be fake in Vishvas News investigation. Actually, it is a poster of a film, edited and shared with false claims.\n\nFacebook user \u2018Ashvanipartap Nisadraj\u2019 shared the viral picture (archive link ). The picture reads, \u201cWill our BJP government return in 2024!!!\u201d\n\nMany other users have shared this picture with similar claims on different social media platforms.\n\nThe picture in the post is going viral. We used Google reverse image search to find out the truth behind the picture. In the search, we found the post of the film \u2018 Lucifer \u2018, which is very similar to the picture going viral.\n\nWe found the same post on the website of Amazon.com. We could arrive at conclusion that the film \u2018Lucifer poster was photoshopped. We could also identify that the picture of famous south Indian actor Mohanlal has been edited and replaced as Mohan Bhagwat.\n\nIt can also be seen in the official trailer. In the three minutes 21 seconds trailer, the scene with the film\u2019s poster can be seen at one minute 8 seconds.\n\nThe picture going viral is actually a fake photo edited using the film poster, in which the face of Mohan Bhagwat and two other actors standing behind him has been edited with pictures of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah.\n\nBharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga also denied the claims and called it fake.\n\nConclusion: The viral picture of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah along with RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat is edited. The edited picture of a film poster is being shared with the false claims.", "lang": "en"}
