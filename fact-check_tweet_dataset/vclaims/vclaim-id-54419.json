The viral video is of a family member of Ijaz being thrashed. The names of the accused in police records show that they too are Muslims Istekhar, Anwar Raja, Mohammed Kaleem and Haleem.\n\nPolice say the incident took place after a quarrel between kids of the families of the accused and victim. Cops have nabbed the four accused. Journalist Prashant had also tweeted a video in which Ijaz is seen telling the names of the men who thrashed him and his family.\n\nNews website Jagran had also covered the incident.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the claim along with the video showing a man being thrashed is false.
