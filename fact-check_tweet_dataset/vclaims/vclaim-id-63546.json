He said the 70 cases were across 40,000 schools that had opened since 11 May. As the coronavirus incubation period, which is how long it potentially takes between getting infected and first showing symptoms, is thought to be 14 days, this seems likely.\n\nThese cases also represent a very small proportion of the number of students who returned to school. About 1.4 million returned to school in France, with an unknown number of teaching staff. Obviously any coronavirus cases are worrying, but this is not a huge number of people with symptoms.\n\nIn a meeting of education ministers from across the EU, they were told that reopening schools in 22 countries had not led to a large increase in Covid-19 cases in children.\n\nHowever, it is very early in the process for French authorities to know the true effect of reopening schools.", "lang": "en"}
