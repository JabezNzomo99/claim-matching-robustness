No, Video\u2019s Old", "subtitle": "Fact Check: An old video in circulation since 2017 is being shared with a claim that it shows Congress workers distributing cash to anti-CAA protesters.", "author": "www.thequint.com", "date": "2020-01-18T17:16:42+05:30", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-51059", "url": "https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/cong-workers-giving-cash-to-anti-caa-protesters-fake-news-fact-check", "vclaim": "This is an old video and the claim with which it is being circulated in misleading. Also, the original video which could be traced back to 2017 does not have Rahul Gandhi\u2019s voice in it.\n\nWe fragmented the video into several key frames using the InVid google chrome extension and followed it up with a reverse image search. After that we were directed to the same video which was uploaded on YouTube in October 2017.\n\nA Google keyword search helped us trace the video back to March 2017 when it was uploaded on YouTube with a claim that it shows Congress workers bribing the voters in Manipur.\n\nFurther, these videos did not have Rahul Gandhi\u2019s voice in the background. A keyword search using terms \u2018Rahul Gandhi\u2019s comment on made in China or made in Gujarat\u2019, helped us identify the MP\u2019s speech from where the audio clip was picked. In a rally at Gujarat\u2019s Gandhinagar on 23 October 2017, Rahul Gandhi took a jibe on \u2018Make in India\u2019 programme by saying that the cameras we are using are made in China and not in Gujarat.\n\nAlthough, we weren\u2019t able to independently verify the video, it is clear that it has been in circulation way before the anti CAA protests started and is now being used to discredit the protests.", "lang": "en"}
