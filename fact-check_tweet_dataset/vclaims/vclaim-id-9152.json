The news comes after Obama launched a scathing attack on Trump, calling him \u201cwoefully unprepared\u201d and \u201cunfit to be president\u201d. The current U.S. president was speaking to the White House press corps when he expressed his \u201cdeep disappointment\u201d with the republican party\u2019s nominee, leading him and the First Lady to explore other options. \u201cIt\u2019s something Michelle, the kids and I have discussed as a potential solution to the Donald,\u201d he said. \u201cI have also spoken with Prime Minister Trudeau who outlined Canada\u2019s generous immigration policy for wealthy individuals, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nThis story was just a fabrication from the Burrard Street Journal (i.e., the BS Journal), a web site that exclusively publishes satire and parody:\n\nThe Burrard Street Journal is a satire, parody and comedy news site.
