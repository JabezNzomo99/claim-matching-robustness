The video had over 72,000 views at the time of reporting and was re-shared as many as 1,600 times.\n\nAn edited clip used to resemble 'Om' sound.\n\nGiven that claim is being attributed to NASA. A simple keyword search led us to a video of Sun producing a sound was uploaded on NASA's YouTube handle on July 25, 2018, but it never claimed that the sound is 'Om'\n\n\n\nA NASA report reveals that a group of scientists from NASA and ESA (The European Space Agency) studied the sun for more than 20 years in an attempt to document its movements and sounds.\n\nAccording to the report, the sun produces a sound resembling a low, pulsing \"heartbeat\". But nowhere in the report is it mentioned that the sound resembles that of Om.\n\n\n\nThe video released by Nasa says that the humming sound is produced because of the vibrations caused by activity inside the Sun. Scientists use these vibrations to look inside the Sun.\n\nNetizens were quick to point out that the claim is not true.\n\nActor Kabir Bedi, who had re-tweeted the claim, later apologised for the mistake.\n\nCreating or sharing fake news is never justified.
