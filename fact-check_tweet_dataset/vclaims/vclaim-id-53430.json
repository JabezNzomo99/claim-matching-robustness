No, that is not true: HR 6666 would not mandate that citizens be removed from their homes if they test positive for COVID-19. LeadStories.com has debunked the claim about the bill, reporting that it requests funding to improve Americans' health through mobile testing units in medically underserved areas.\n\nThe claim originated as a video published by YouTube on May 11, 2020, titled \"Dr. Rashid Buttar URGENT! Full Disclosure From INSIDE| HR 6666 IS COMING!\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nClick below to watch the video on YouTube:\n\nButtar uses information from an actual bill that was introduced in Congress to claim that the government is rolling out a plan to forcibly remove people from their homes if someone tests positive for coronavirus.\n\nButtar warns his viewers about HR 6666 with ominous music in the video.\n\n\"This is regarding a House resolution that was initiated on May 1st of this year. 6666. That is not an exaggeration I have no idea how that works.\"\n\nBills in both the House and Senate are generated automatically and this was just the next number in the sequence.\n\nButtar states in his video the name of the bill is for \"Covid-19 testing, reaching and contacting everyone act. The acronym is TRACE Act. Trace act stands for Testing, Reaching and Contacting Everyone.\" That is true and can be found in the language of the bill here.\n\nButtar describes what he believes to be the details of the bill:\n\nIt was introduced by Bobby Rush, a Democrat from the state of Illinois. \n\nThey have introduced this bill into the House, and they are going to roll this out from a testing standpoint in Ventura County, California, which happens to be where I am at right now. Basically, this act is to allow individuals to come into your house and if you have a cough or somebody in your family has a cough or you have a fever or anything that they determine that shows that you have COVID-19... They're going to use that to pull you or your loved ones, especially your children, away under pretense of public safety. They're going to say that your child has to be removed from you because you have COVID-19 and so to protect your child we are going to take that child. Or we're going to take your grandmother or your father or you and put you into quarantine. And put you into quarantine. Regardless if you've been tested or not, they will also test people but remember testing has already shown there to be a high rate of false positives.\"\n\nButtar's claims of the bill allowing people to be forcibly removed from their house are false.\n\nLeadStories.com debunked the claims that Ventura County, California, would be forcibly removing people from their homes.\n\nOn May 5, 2020, the Ventura County Department of Health Director Dr. Robert Levin spoke about the county's contact tracing plan.\n\nHis comments went viral with people furious after interpreting his remarks to mean infected residents would be forcibly removed from their home.\n\nThe Ventura County Health Department confirmed to LeadStories.com that Ventura County was not forcibly removing people from their homes.\n\n\"We can assure you that is not what is going to happen,\" the spokesperson explained on May 8, 2020. \"They are not going to be forcibly taking people out of their homes. The county has places available to quarantine but that is up to them.\"\n\nThe department clarified that the places the county has available would be \"hotels\" and there would be no cost to the people that choose to leave their homes and quarantine at an outside location.\n\n\"That is part of the process that the county is providing.\"\n\nThe Health Department issued a clarification on May 8, 2020.\n\nAs for Buttar, he describes his credentials on his own website:\n\n\n\nHowever, HuffingtonPost.com called Buttar a \"widely discredited osteopath,\" with a long list of reprimands he has received.\n\nThe North Carolina Medical Board formally reprimanded him in 2010.\n\nBUTTAR, Rashid Ali, DO Location: Huntersville, NC (Mecklenburg Co) License #: 0095-00528 | Specialty: General Prev.
