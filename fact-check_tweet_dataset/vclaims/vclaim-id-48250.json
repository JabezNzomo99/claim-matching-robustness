These posts also urge people to identify Chinese products through this method and boycott them.\n\nOne of such posts says that \u201cNowadays, Chinese businessmen know that consumers do not prefer products \u2018made in china\u2019, so they don\u2019t show from which country it is made. However, you may now refer to the barcode, remember if the first 3 digits are 690-695 then it is Made in China.\u201d It further states that the barcode for Indian products are 890.\n\nSuch claims have also been circulating in the United States in favour of American products.\n\nWe fact-checked these claims and found them to be false.\n\nWhile using keywords from these claims, we ran a search and found an article from 2011 showing that such rumours had circulated as early as 2008 in the U.S.\n\nOn reading further, we first understood through nationwidebarcodes.com \u2013 an agency that provides UPC and EAN barcodes to all-size businesses in the United States, Canada and throughout the world \u2013 that the barcodes in question in the posts are called EAN or European Article Number, now known as International Article Number used internationally whereas the UPC is used in the U.S and Canada.\n\nThe next step was to understand the components of the EAN barcodes and whether it signified where a product was made.\n\nWe went to the FAQ section of GS1 \u2013a not-for-profit organization that develops and maintains global standards for business communication.\n\nIn the FAQs, it is clearly stated that the first few digits of the EAN do not show the country of origin. It rather shows the prefix of the GS1 member organization that allocated the barcode number. The GS1 prefix does not indicate that the product was manufactured in a specific country or by a specific manufacturer; it may have been produced anywhere in the world.\n\nHence, it is clear that any barcode that begins with numbers ranging from 690 to 695 does not mean that the product was made in China.\n\nThe posts claiming this are fake.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
