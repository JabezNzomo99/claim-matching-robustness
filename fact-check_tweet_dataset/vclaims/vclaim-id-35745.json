BJP had issued a whip, on 10 February 2020, asking all its members to be present in Rajya Sabha on 11 February 2020 to \u2018support the government\u2019s stand\u2019. So, people started speculating that the government would be introducing a bill related to UCC. A photo of a \u2018list of bills\u2019 containing \u2018The Uniform Civil Code in India Bill, 2020\u2019 is also being shared to support their claim. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Government to introduce the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) bill in the Rajya Sabha on 11 February 2020. Fact: The UCC bill has not been introduced in the Rajya Sabha on 11 February 2020. The image going viral on social media relates to the business of private members bills on 07 February 2020 and has nothing to do with the government. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nIn the photo of \u2018list of bills\u2019 containing \u2018The Uniform Civil Code in India Bill, 2020\u2019, the date can be seen as \u20186 February 2020\u2019 and \u2018Bills: To be introduced in the Rajya Sabha\u2019 was written. When searched for the bills in the \u2018List of Business\u2019 documents of Rajya Sabha, in the revised \u2018List of Business\u2019 for Rajya Sabha proceedings on 7 February 2020, all the bills mentioned in the list can be found. It can be read that \u2018The Uniform Civil Code in India Bill,2020\u2019 was supposed to be introduced as a private member bill by Kirodi Lal Meena on 7 February 2020. More about the \u2018private members\u2019 bills\u2019 can be read here. All the bills mentioned in that image are private members bills that were to be introduced on 07 February 2020. \n\n\n\nBut, the \u2018The Uniform Civil Code in India Bill,2020\u2019 was not introduced in Rajya Sabha on 7 February 2020, as he was not present in the house when his name was called to introduce the bill. The proceedings of the Rajya Sabha can be read below. Also, it can be seen that \u2018The Uniform Civil Code in India Bill,2020\u2019 is absent from the list of bills introduced in the Rajya Sabha during this session. Kirodi Lal Meena cannot introduce the bill on 11 February 2020 (Tuesday) as private members\u2019 bills are generally introduced only on Fridays. Secondly, the government has nothing to do with a private members bill. Hence the image being shared on social media has nothing to do with government bills. \n\n\n\nIn the revised \u2018List of Business\u2019 for Rajya Sabha proceedings on 11 February 2020, it can be seen that there is no mention of the introduction of any bill. Also, it can be seen that Vice President has told the house today that \u2018nobody needs to have any apprehensions that the house is going to take any bill. No bill. Only budget\u2019. The Rajya Sabha has been adjourned till 2 March 2020 without introducing any bill on 11 February 2020.\n\nTo sum it up, an image that shows the business relating to private member bills in the Rajya Sabha for 07 February 2020 is being shared as proof for government\u2019s UCC bill to be introduced on 11 February 2020. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
