We have seen this quote attached to the famous playwright on blogs, social media posts, Spanish-language books about tarot cards, and, of course, dozens of memes:\n\nThe exact wording of this quote can change from post to post, but the following text seems to be the most prevalent version:\n\nI always feel happy, you know why? Because I don\u2019t expect anything from anyone; expectations always hurt. Life is short. So love your life. Be happy. And keep smiling. Just live for yourself and always remember: Before you speak\u2026 Listen\n\n Before you write\u2026 Think\n\n Before you spend\u2026 Earn\n\n Before you pray\u2026 Forgive\n\n Before you hurt\u2026 Feel\n\n Before you hate\u2026 Love\n\n Before you quit\u2026 Try\n\n Before you die\u2026 Live\n\nSince Shakespeare lived long before the age of audio and video recording, one would expect a written record of all of his quotes, yet in the dozens of postings that we encountered attributing this quote to Shakespeare, not one pointed to an actual source. Furthermore, when we started digging into the actual phrases used in this passage, we found that some portions could be attributed to another author named William \u2014 just not Shakespeare.\n\nThe portion of this quote, starting with \u201cbefore you write\u201d and ending with \u201cbefore you die\u201d appears to have been taken from a poem that was purportedly written by William Arthur Ward, an American author best known for his inspirational maxims. The one notable difference between the fake Shakespeare quote and the poem is that Ward (if it is indeed his poem) ended his text with a call to \u201cgive,\u201d not \u201clive\u201d:\n\nAlthough Ward most likely wrote this poem (it is certainly more aligned with his style than with Shakespeare\u2019s more florid prose) we have yet to uncover where it was first published. It was credited simply as a \u201cCatholic quote\u201d when it appeared in a Kansas newspaper in 1969:\n\nA much longer version of this quote contains several other curious pieces of text. The closing line, for instance, states that a \u201cstrong person\u201d should be able to hold back tears and smile:\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that Shakespeare wrote this, either. In fact, before this quote was attributed to him, it was part of a religious Facebook chain message, and was shared with no attribution.\n\nWe reached out to the Folger Shakespeare Library to find out more about this spurious quote and were told that there was no record of this passage in their archives. The Bard did, however, write that \u201clife is short\u201d at least once. From Henry IV, Part 1:\n\nI cannot read them now.\n\n O gentlemen, the time of life is short!\n\n To spend that shortness basely were too long,\n\n If life did ride upon a dial\u2019s point,\n\n Still ending at the arrival of an hour.\n\n An if we live, we live to tread on kings;\n\n If die, brave death, when princes die with us!\n\n Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair,\n\n When the intent of bearing them is just.\n\nShakespeare also touched on expectations in the play All\u2019s Well That Ends Well:\n\nThis viral Shakespeare \u201cquote,\u201d then, is merely a pastiche of general platitudes. Although it may have touched on some of the general ideas that William Shakespeare wrote about, the included prose was certainly not written by the Bard himself.", "lang": "en"}
