And the illegals get it all for free?\u201d\n\nFirst of all, Medicare isn\u2019t available for people living in the U.S. illegally. It is available only to citizens and lawful permanent residents who have lived in the U.S. continuously for at least five years and meet the other criteria, such as being at least 65 and having paid Medicare payroll taxes.\n\nSecondly, most seniors don\u2019t have to pay for basic Medicare coverage. There are four parts to Medicare \u2014 the most basic is Medicare Part A, which covers inpatient stays at hospitals and nursing facilities. It is funded largely through payroll taxes, and those who paid into the system for at least 10 years, or are married to someone who paid into the system, don\u2019t pay premiums.\n\nRecipients can purchase additional coverage for doctors\u2019 visits and outpatient care through Medicare Part B (which is priced on a sliding scale that depends on income) or through a private insurance provider. Most people who receive Social Security benefits and use Medicare Part B pay $130 per month, which is slightly less than the $135.50 monthly premium for the plan in 2019.\n\nNot only is the factual basis for the question posed in the meme incorrect, but its suggestion that people in the U.S. illegally are a drain on the Medicare system is backwards.\n\nAccording to a 2015 study in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, those living in the U.S. illegally provide a net contribution to the trust fund that largely pays for Medicare Part A. From 2000 to 2011, such immigrants contributed a net total of $35.1 billion to the trust fund, according to the study, which was led by Leah Zallman, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, for the Massachusetts-based nonprofit Institute for Community Health.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nU.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. \u201cHow is Medicare funded?\u201d Medicare.gov.
