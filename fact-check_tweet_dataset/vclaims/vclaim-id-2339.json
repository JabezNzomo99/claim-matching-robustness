But he got his job back after an arbitrator ruled he had been improperly fired. And that decision was upheld by two courts.\n\nThe Republicans contend, in effect, that even though the legal system returned the teacher to his job, Evers had the power to stop him from teaching at all -- anywhere in the state -- by revoking his teaching license.\n\nThey made essentially the same attack in a radio ad released Sept. 6, 2017.\n\nAs we\u2019ll see, this fact check turns largely on what state law said at the time about revoking a teacher\u2019s license for \"immoral behavior\" -- a law that was changed, in part, because of this case.\n\nRepublican Gov. Scott Walker has all but announced he will seek a third term in 2018.\n\nEvers, a Democrat, has won three statewide elections for state superintendent, a nonpartisan office, since 2009.\n\nThe other leading Democrats with gubernatorial campaigns up and running are Andy Gronik, a businessman who lives in the Milwaukee suburb of Fox Point, and state Rep. Dana Wachs of Eau Claire.\n\nThe Republican attack centers on Andy Harris, who started teaching in the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District, west of Madison, in 1993. He had no disciplinary history before his December 2010 firing. At the time, Harris taught seventh-grade science at one of the district\u2019s two middle schools; now he has the same job at the other middle school.\n\nHere are the major events in the case, based on news reports, the arbitrator\u2019s decision and a state appeals court decision:\n\nThe GOP says Harris was \"found guilty of spreading pornographic material at school,\" suggesting there was a criminal conviction.\n\nHarris did share images of nudity, and at least one instance forwarded an email containing such images, he received on his school computer.\n\nBut he was never accused of, or charged with, committing any crime.\n\nWhen Harris was fired in December 2010, state law defined immoral conduct, according to the Legislature\u2019s nonpartisan legal advisers, \"as conduct or behavior that is contrary to commonly accepted moral or ethical standards and that endangers the health, safety, welfare, or education of any pupil.\"\n\nAnd is the pivotal word there.\n\nEvers\u2019 department did have the discretion on whether to go through license revocation proceedings, which Harris could have challenged. But the department decided against it after concluding, separately from the arbitrator\u2019s decision, that his behavior didn\u2019t endanger kids as defined by the law at that time, spokesman Tom McCarthy told us. In other words, he said, in the department\u2019s view there was no legal basis to take away Harris\u2019 license.\n\nThat position appears to be supported by the fact that in November 2011, nearly a year after Harris\u2019 firing, Walker signed a measure that redefined immoral conduct to include \"the intentional use of an educational agency\u2019s equipment to download, view, solicit, seek, display, or distribute pornographic material.\"\n\nThat is, the new law, which Evers supported and which was prompted partly by the Harris case, specifies that what Harris did is legal cause for license revocation -- and that there doesn\u2019t have to be any endangerment of kids. The old law didn\u2019t.\n\nFinally, the GOP argues that there was one important fact Evers had that the arbitrator didn\u2019t: After there was outcry from parents about Harris\u2019 return, the school district allowed students to attend a study hall if they didn\u2019t feel comfortable in Harris\u2019 class. The GOP says that endangered students\u2019 education, since they were missing valuable instruction time.\n\nIn response, McCarthy told us that the law allows the state to revoke a teacher\u2019s license only based on the teacher\u2019s conduct -- not based on parents\u2019 objections to a teacher or a district\u2019s decision to provide an accommodation like the study hall.\n\nThe state Republican Party says Evers \"allowed a middle-school teacher found guilty of spreading pornographic material at school to keep teaching students.\"\n\nThe teacher was not found guilty of, or even charged with, any crime. Rather, he was fired for viewing pornographic material on his school computer. He got his job back, however, after an arbitrator ruled that the firing was not justified, in part because the arbitrator concluded that the behavior did not endanger any students.\n\nEvers, as the state schools superintendent, had the discretion to initiate license revocation proceedings. But state law at the time required the endangerment of kids in order to revoke a teacher\u2019s license and, like the arbitrator, Evers concluded that the teacher\u2019s conduct didn\u2019t endanger kids.\n\nFor a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
