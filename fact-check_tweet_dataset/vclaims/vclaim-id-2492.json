That information was accurate as far as it went but was nearly a year old at that point.\n\nDuring a town hall-style session on 17 September 2015, Donald Trump was asked about the generous healthcare and pension benefits given to members of Congress, and he responded (in part):\n\nThe first thing I\u2019m going to do is tell you that if I\u2019m elected president, I\u2019m accepting no salary, ok. That\u2019s not a big deal for me, but. The next thing is, when these guys go to Congress, as per your question, when they go to Congress, a couple of things happen. First of all, they get benefits that nobody else can even think about, ok. And they don\u2019t like to talk about it. But we\u2019ll work on that.\n\nAt the time the statement was made, Forbes listed Trump at No. 405 on their list of the world\u2019s billionaires, with his net worth estimated at $4.1 billion. By the following, Trump\u2019s net worth had slid $800 million to a total of $3.7 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nIf Trump were to win the election on 8 November 2016 and keep his word that he wouldn\u2019t accept any of the $400,000 annual salary offered, he would be in the company of other such as John F. Kennedy, who was also born into wealth and donated his entire presidential salary to charity, and Herbert Hoover, who was also independently wealthy and donated his presidential salary to charitable causes.", "lang": "en"}
