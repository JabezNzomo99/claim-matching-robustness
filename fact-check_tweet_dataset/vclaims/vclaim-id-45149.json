It was published on the MMEA\u2019s Facebook page on December 26, 2018.\n\nPart of the Malay statement translates to English as: \u201cKOTA TINGGI, December 25 - The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency, Maritime Rescue Sub Center (MRSC JOHOR) has activated a search and rescue (SAR) operation as soon as it received reports of MV Amanda overturning and eventually sinking at the position of about 3.3 nautical miles east of Tanjung Sepang, Kota Tinggi at 2pm.\n\n\u201cThe reported number of crew on MV Amanda is as follows: a.
