These types are \u201cassault without injury on a constable\u201d and \u201cassault with injury on a constable\u201d.\n\nIn 2018/19, there were 20,578 recorded incidents of the first type, a rise of 13% compared to the previous year, and 10,399 of the second type, up 27% on the year before.\n\nTogether, this meant there were 30,977 recorded crimes involving assaults on a police constable, an 18% increase on the 26,295 that were recorded in 2017/18.\n\nHowever, the Express story based its headline claim on a comparison of this year\u2019s data with that of 2015/16, claiming assaults had \u201crisen by a third in just four years\u201d.\n\nSpecifically, the newspaper claimed that: \u201cBobbies were victims of 10,399 assaults that caused injuries last year \u2013 up 32 per cent from 7,903 recorded in 2015/16.\u201d\n\nBut you can\u2019t compare those two numbers.\n\nBefore April 2017, \u201cassault with injury on a constable\u201d was not a crime category, and data on these incidents was collected via officers self-reporting their injuries to their forces\u2019 HR or health and safety systems.\n\nSince April 2017, a separate crime category for these incidents was set up, and so the last two years have seen the assaults recorded as specific crimes.\n\nThere are differences between what was reported in the health and safety systems and what is now recorded as a crime\u2014particularly because it was usually not compulsory for officers to self-report cases. That means it was likely to be under-counting the number of assaults, which would make the rise between then and now look bigger.\n\nThe same problem applies to comparing all recorded assaults, including those that did and didn\u2019t result in injuries.\n\nThere\u2019s actually another way of arriving at the Express\u2019s figure, which is to track the change in the number of assaults without injury on a constable. This can be reliably compared across the last four years, because there have been no changes to the way incidents are recorded.\n\nThe number of these assaults has risen by 33% since 2015/16. The problem, though, is that this comparison does not include all recorded assaults, and excludes the most serious ones.\n\nThe only meaningful comparison we can make for measuring recorded assaults on police officers is between 2017/18 and 2018/19.\n\nAnother claim made by the Express in its coverage was to estimate an average of 28 attacks per day resulting in injuries to police officers. The Daily Mail repeated this claim.\n\nAs there were 10,399 recorded assaults with injury to a constable in the year to March 2019, and that equates to 28 per day, this is a reasonable claim. But it doesn\u2019t give a complete picture.\n\nThe most serious assaults can be categorised under such crime categories as \u201cattempted murder\u201d, which means the victim\u2019s status as a police officer is not recorded for these cases and so they\u2019re not included in the police officer assault statistics.\n\nThis means the \u201828 injuries per day\u2019 figure is likely to be an underestimate.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting the Express\u2019 claim that officers are being injured at a rate of 28 assaults a day while \u201con duty\u201d isn\u2019t quite right, because the available data does not distinguish whether or not an officer was on duty when the assault occurred.", "lang": "en"}
