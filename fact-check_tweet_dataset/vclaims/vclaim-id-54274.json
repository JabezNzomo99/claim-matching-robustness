But one part omits a quote from the infectious diseases expert in which he supports masks, Fauci directly urges their use in another, and a third perpetuates outdated advice that was changed after fears of a mask shortage subsided and understanding of COVID-19 evolved.\n\nThe video -- titled \u201cFLIP FLOP FAUCI\u201d -- was posted multiple times in July 2020 by the Facebook page of Diamond and Silk, two well-known supporters of US President Donald Trump.\n\nIt features Fauci at times discouraging mask use, and text that says: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t 100% Effective in March 2020, how is it 100% Effective now?\u201d\n\nSimilar posts with some of the same footage appear on Facebook here, here and here.\n\nThe video is part of a trend of misleading social media posts about mask use and Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has been increasingly drawn into conflict with Trump and is a popular target for disinformation.\n\nIn the early days of the coronavirus pandemic -- which, as of July 22, 2020 has killed more than 617,000 people worldwide, nearly a quarter of them in the US -- health authorities recommended mask use for people who were sick or those caring for them.\n\nThat recommendation has since been expanded to the general population due to the risk of asymptomatic carriers transmitting the virus, sparking a backlash from those who balk at the inconvenience of wearing masks or view them as an impingement on personal freedom.\n\nBut illustrating the US government\u2019s chaotic coronavirus response, Trump refused to wear a mask long after American health authorities were recommending their general use, only relenting and later recommending them this month.\n\nContrary to what the text in the video says, two of the three clips of Fauci that it features were not from March. One, the very first short section, is from a June interview with TheStreet website.\n\n\u201cMasks are not 100 percent protective,\u201d Fauci says, but the video misleadingly cuts out his subsequent remark: \u201cHowever, they certainly are better than not wearing a mask.\u201d\n\nAnother is from a May interview with CNN in which Fauci says of mask use: \u201cI believe it is effective,\u201d though not \u201c100 percent effective.\u201d\n\nThe March footage -- which appears second in the video -- is from an interview of Fauci by CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in which he says \u201cthere's no reason to be walking around with a mask.\u201d\n\nAt that time, Fauci\u2019s remarks reflected the consensus among US health experts, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the surgeon general, America\u2019s leading public health spokesman.\n\nBut that has since changed -- the CDC now emphasizes the danger of asymptomatic transmission and recommends cloth face coverings as a means to reduce risk.\n\n\u201cYou could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick,\u201d it says. \u201cThe cloth face cover is meant to protect other people in case you are infected.\u201d\n\nUS Surgeon General Jerome Adams tweeted in late June: \u201cOriginally most health experts thought those who were asymptomatic (e.g. no fever or cough), had low risk of having/spreading #coronavirus. @CDCgov now estimates 35% or more with #COVID19 DO NOT have symptoms.\u201d\n\nFauci made the same point during a July conversation with Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg when describing the reason for the change in advice.\n\n\u201cEarly on, when we were in a situation in which there was a real concern about the lack of personal protective equipment on the part of the health providers\u2026 we were thinking we would run out of masks and other things for them. So the recommendation was not to wear a mask because of the shortage,\u201d Fauci says.\n\nBut it later \u201cbecame clear that we had enough of the equipment, so there was no shortage. It became clear that cloth coverings that you didn\u2019t have to buy in a store, that you could make yourself, were adequate,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd it \u201cbecame very clear that anywhere from 20 to 45 percent of people who were infected didn\u2019t have any symptoms,\u201d meaning that people could be spreading disease asymptomatically, says Fauci.\n\nIn the interview with TheStreet, Fauci also cited concern about a shortage of protective equipment for health care workers as a reason for the previous recommendation against widespread face mask use, saying that \u201cnow, we have masks.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough there appear to be some contradiction of, \u2018You were saying this then, then why are you saying this now?\u2019 -- actually the circumstances have changed, that\u2019s the reason why,\u201d Fauci says.\n\nBut he admitted in a July interview with NPR\u2019s \u201cAll Things Considered\u201d that the \u201cmixed message in the beginning\u201d on masks has been \u201cdetrimental in getting the message across.\u201d\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 560 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus crisis.
