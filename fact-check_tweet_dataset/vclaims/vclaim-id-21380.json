Posting the video on September 3, 2019, just as a wave of deadly xenophobic violence was gripping South Africa, Fani-Kayode accused the politician in the video of \u201csubtly trying to justify the killing of Nigerians\u201d. In fact, this video was filmed back in 2017; the comments were not made in relation to the current violence. It shows Bongani Mkongi, who was South Africa\u2019s deputy police minister at the time but has since stepped down. He is not, as claimed by Fani-Kayode, the current \u201cSouth African Minister of Police Affairs\u201d.\n\nThe video shows Mkongi complaining about the influx of immigrants to South Africa.\n\n\u201cHow can a city in South Africa be 80 percent foreign nationals? That is dangerous,\u201d he can be seen saying in the video.\n\n\u201cSouth Africans have surrendered their own city to the foreign nationals. The nation should discuss that particular question. You won\u2019t find South Africans in other countries dominating a city into 80 percent,\u201d he says.\n\nFani-Kayode posted the video on September 3, calling Mkongi \u201can ignorant and xenophobic little racist\u201d. His post has been shared over 2,600 times and viewed more than 53,000 times. We\u2019ve archived it here.\n\nAt the time of posting, as reported by AFP, the South African city of Johannesburg had been hit by a wave of deadly xenophobic unrest.\n\nThe popular Nigerian Instagram account @Instablog9ja shared the same video, racking up more than 350,000 views since September 3. \u201cS.A\u2019s Dep. Minister of Police justifies the attacks on foreigners,\u201d reads the caption.\n\nNumerous Twitter accounts have also shared the video this week, with emotions running high over the violence in South Africa.\n\nWhile Fani-Kayode spoke of \u201cthe mass murder of Nigerians\u201d, for the moment it's unknown how many Nigerians have lost their lives in the unrest of recent days in South Africa. The death toll currently stands at five, with South African nationals accounting for most of the dead, according to the government.\n\nIt\u2019s an old video and the minister has been replaced\n\nThe video of Mkongi was in fact filmed back in July 2017 -- you can find it on YouTube uploaded two years ago:\n\nMkongi was South Africa\u2019s deputy police minister at the time, but he stepped down from the role in May 2019 and was replaced by Cassel Mathale. Mkongi is no longer a serving minister and he did not make these comments in the context of the current xenophobic violence in South Africa.\n\nData does not back up the claim about a South African city that is 80 percent immigrants\n\nIn the 2017 video, Mkongi is seen talking about Hillbrow, an inner-city neighbourhood of Johannesburg. He claims that 80 percent of its residents are immigrants.\n\nWhile the area is known for its large immigrant population, research by Africa Check showed that publicly available data does not support the claim, \u201cwith more and better data needed\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
