The full text of the hoax read:\n\nOf course the news is false and Kaepernick remains unsigned following the controversy around him taking a knee during the national anthem before several games last season in protest against racial injustice.\n\nTrend-news.com is a prank website where users can submit their own headline, description and photo to create realistic looking prank news articles.\n\nUsers don't even need to upload their own image, there is a built-in search function that will pull an appropriate image from Google image search.\n\nThe site is part of a larger network of prank sites all using the same basic layout but sometimes in different languages. It appears to be run by a Belgian company named Mediavibes or Media Vibes which is managed by a man named Nicolas Gouriou according to registration records.\n\nThere is no need to get upset or contact the New Orleans Saints to voice your displeasure or support, the story is a hoax.", "lang": "en"}
