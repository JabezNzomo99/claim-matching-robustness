According to a chapter published in Shodhganga titled: \u2018Administration of Devaswom Boards and Temples in Kerala,\u2019 all the temples are either administered by Government controlled Devaswoms which are socio-religious trusts, or by private bodies/families. There are five different Devaswom boards in Kerala. Regarding the claim being made in the viral image, Chairman of Devaswom Recruitment Board Rajagopalan Nair told The Quint, \u201cThere are three laws that govern the temples in Kerala. In all these acts there is a specific provision that the employees, and also the management must be from Hindu religion.\u201d All the five Devaswom boards follow these rules and have Hindu members, he added. Photo of 2013 Rally in Bangladesh Passed Off as Muslims in Kerala While we couldn\u2019t find any recent order or any news report related to the matter, we found a 2018 article by The Hindu titled as \u2018Only Hindus will head Devaswom boards: govt.\u201d According to The Hindu article, the Kerala government had informed the Kerala High Court that the Travancore Devaswom Board, which is an autonomous body constituted under the Travancore-Cochin Hindu Religious Institutions Act XV of 1950 (TCHRI), and the Cochin Devaswom Board will appoint only Hindus as the commissioners of the board. The court was then hearing a writ filed by BJP leader PS Sreedharan Pillai wherein he had challenged the amendments to the Travancore-Cochin Hindu Religious Institutions Act, 1950, that allowed non-Hindus to be appointed as Devaswom commissioners.\n\nRegarding the 2018 controversy, Rajagopalan said, \u201cIn that amendment there was a confusion, some people deliberately created a confusion, but the board had specifically said that all the employees including the commissioner must be Hindus and in the provisions made for appointing the commissioner, such a wording was omitted. Though it is absolutely unnecessary because the main provisions had mentioned all the employees which takes care of commissioner also.\u201d A judgment held by the Kerala High Court on 26 October 2018 mentioned, \u201cIn the afore perspective, we feel fully justified in declaring that the post of Devaswom Commissioner, under the TCHRI Act, is a part of the Devaswom Department under it and axiomatically that, under the rigor of Section 29(1), such an officer will always have to be a person professing the Hindu religion. It is so declared.\u201d The Kerala High Court judgment pronounced in PS Sreedharan Pillai vs State of Kerala. Another source close to the Board told The Quint that the claim being made in the viral image is false and that all the temples in Kerala are controlled by Hindus only. Talking about Devaswom commissioner in particular, the source said that even the present commissioner is a Hindu. Section 29 (1) of the Travancore Cochin Hindu Religious Institutions Act 1950 said that the Devaswom department shall consist of Hindu officers. \u201cThe Devaswom Department constituted in 1097 shall continue and shall consist of such number of Hindu officers and other servants as may be determined from time to time by the Board,\u201d it said. Further, regarding the qualification for nomination, Section 6 of the Act says, \u201cA person shall not be qualified for nomination or election as a member of the Board unless he is a permanent resident of the State of Travancore-Cochin and professes the Hindu religion and has attained thirty five years of age.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
