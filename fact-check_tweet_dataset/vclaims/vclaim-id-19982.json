Labour said it won\u2019t raise income tax for those earning less than \u00a380,000.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-19982", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/are-conservatives-right-about-labours-tax-plans/", "vclaim": "Are the Conservatives right about Labour\u2019s tax plans?\n\nThe Labour manifesto 2017 says that \u201ca Labour government will guarantee no rises in income tax for those earning below \u00a380,000 a year\u201d.\n\nThis means that the Labour Party wouldn\u2019t increase the basic rate of income tax, as doing so makes anyone earning more than \u00a311,500 pay more tax.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked the Conservative Party for more information about its tweet.\n\nDuring the Labour leadership campaign in 2015 Jeremy Corbyn did reference the fact that \u201cthe basic rate of income tax was 25 per cent a generation ago\u201d in an article about the UK\u2019s aging population. He added \u201cif we want dignity for all in old age, then it has to be paid for\u2026 with funding options that can be discussed throughout the country in advance of 2020.\u201d\n\nThis seems to be what the Conservatives were thinking of. But we\u2019ve not seen anything to suggest that Mr Corbyn has called for income tax to be raised to 25p then or since.\n\nDifferent bits of your income are taxed at different rates. These bits are called \u201cbands\u201d, and each band has a name. So for example, the first band applies to your income from \u00a30 to \u00a311,500 and is called the \u201cpersonal allowance\u201d. Income that falls in the personal allowance band isn\u2019t subject to income tax.\n\nThe next band goes from \u00a311,501 to \u00a345,000 and is called the \u201cbasic rate\u201d. This is taxed at 20%. Between \u00a345,001 and \u00a3150,000 income tax is set at 40% and anything over \u00a3150,000 is taxed at 45%.\n\nLabour\u2019s plan is to increase income tax for those earning more than \u00a380,000 a year.\n\nThe Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) has looked at Labour\u2019s income tax plans.\n\nLabour plans to increase income tax on earnings between \u00a380,000 and \u00a3123,000 to 45%. For income of more than \u00a3123,000 it would be set at 50%.\n\nBecause of the way the tax system is constructed this would mean that income tax \u00a3100,000 and \u00a3123,000 would go up to 67.5%, according to the IFS.\n\nThe red line in the IFS graph below shows the rate at which different bands of income would be taxed under the Labour proposals. There are no differences with the current system for the 98% of people earning less than \u00a380,000.", "lang": "en"}
