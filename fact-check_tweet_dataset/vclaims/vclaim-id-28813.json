[1]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined the premier\u2019s claims her government had created \u201chundreds of thousands of new jobs\u201d and that she\u2019d delivered the \u201clowest unemployment in NSW - ever\u201d.\n\nAAP FactCheck found both the premier\u2019s claims to be true.\n\nAccording to seasonally-adjusted Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures, there were 3,484,900 people employed in NSW in April 2011 when the NSW Liberal-National coalition came to power. By January 2019 after eight years in office, that figure had grown to 4,096,200, representing an increase of 611,300 jobs. The ABS figures show the premier\u2019s claim is true that her government has created \u201chundreds of thousands of new jobs\u201d. [2]\n\nThe seasonally-adjusted ABS figures match a February 21 media release from the Premier and Treasurer Dominic Perrottet which states 611,300 jobs had been created by the coalition from 2011 to January 2019. Seasonally-adjusted data removes periodic swings in statistics in supply and demand related to changing seasons. [3]\n\nRegarding the premier\u2019s claim about record unemployment, the jobless rate in NSW fell 0.4 per cent to 3.9 per cent in January 2019, the lowest since monthly records began in February 1978, according ABS data. NSW was well below the national unemployment rate of five per cent and better than all other states with Victoria at 4.5 per cent, Queensland six per cent, South Australia on 6.3, West Australia 6.8 and Tasmania the worst at seven per cent. [4] [5]\n\nThe evidence shows both the premier\u2019s claims about job creation and record unemployment rates for NSW are true.", "lang": "en"}
