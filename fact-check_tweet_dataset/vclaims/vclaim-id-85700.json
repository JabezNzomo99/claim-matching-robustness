Back in September, Trump claimed he would not benefit from the tax plan, twice in offhand remarks with reporters and once in a speech. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for me,\u201d he claimed. It seemed so silly that it was not worthy of a full fact check.\n\nOh wait, we don\u2019t have Trump\u2019s tax returns because he reneged on a promise to release them. He is the first president in four decades who has refused to release his taxes. Obviously, it would be easier to verify his claims if we had a current tax return to review. But a portion of his 2005 tax return was leaked \u2014 and the White House confirmed the bottom-line numbers were correct. So we will have to do our analysis based on that return.\n\nIn any case, it should not be a surprise that someone with Trump\u2019s wealth would benefit from the tax plan. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that more than 70 percent of the taxpayers in the top 0.1 percent would get a tax cut under either the House or Senate versions of the tax plan.\n\nBoth bills would repeal the alternative minimum tax, which is designed to make sure that the wealthy pay at least some tax. The 2005 return shows that the AMT increased Trump\u2019s tax bill from about $5.3 million to $36.5 million. So at least in that tax year, he potentially could have saved as much as $31 million. (The capital gains tax for people in Trump\u2019s income bracket has been increased since then, so the savings would be lower now. If Trump\u2019s AMT bill is the result of have large net operating loss deductions, that could limit the benefit of AMT repeal because net operating loss carrybacks would be repealed.)\n\nSo the House version of the tax bill in theory could cut the taxes on that much pass-through income by as much as $16 million, though in 2005 a lot of that income was offset by business losses. The Senate version of the bill could have cut the tax bill by about $10 million.\n\nWhile the bills purport to close some loopholes, such as concerning net operating loses, there are some provisions that offer better deals for real estate investors. The impact of these provisions on Trump\u2019s taxes is unclear, but it certainly raises an eyebrow. For instance, rent, royalties and licensing fees are eligible for reduced pass-through rates. The Senate bill would shorten the depreciation schedule for commercial property, another possible boon for a real-estate investor like Trump.\n\nThe House bill does not reduce the top income tax rate, but the Senate offers a small reduction to 38.5 percent. The other rate changes would make only a modest difference to Trump, who at least in 2005 earned relatively little (about $10.8 million) from wages, interest and dividends. Under the Senate bill, he would see a reduction of about $100,000.\n\nIn 2005, Trump had itemized deductions worth $17 million, but we do not know how much represented state and local taxes and how much represented mortgage and charitable contributions. (The mortgage and charitable deductions are relatively untouched, but the House would reduce the cap on the size of new mortgages from $1 million to $500,000.)\n\nWhen you add it up, Trump would have saved as much as $42 million on his 2005 taxes under the House bill and $35.1 million under the Senate bill. (Update, Dec. 2: The revised Senate bill, which retains a version of the AMT, would only save Trump about $5 million.) A big part of the savings in the House bill is from elimination of the alternative minimum tax, and of course we do not know how often he was subject to it or how much was due to net operating losses that could be limited under the legislation.", "lang": "en"}
