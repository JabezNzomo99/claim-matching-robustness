However, the Ministry of Health denied the claims and Capital Ethiopia, which published the story, has corrected its Facebook post.\n\nThe article was published on March 27, 2020 on the website of Capital Ethiopia, an English-language financial newspaper.\n\nThe article\u2019s headline reads: \u201cEthiopia announced that it found traditional medicine for Covid 19\". Capital Ethiopa's Facebook post linking to the article was shared more than 260 times.\n\nThe article was quickly picked up by Facebook users, and shared in groups with more than 500,000 followers, including here and here.\n\nIt was also shared in Somali with the same caption here.\n\nThe short article claims: \u201cMinistry of Innovation and Technology, Ministry of Health and traditional medicinal practitioners announced that they have approved a traditional medicine that was tested on humans and animals since the covid 19 outbreak was in December 2019 (sic).\u201d\n\nAccording to the article, Abraham Belay, Minister of Innovation and Technology, told the newspaper via text that \u201cthe country traditional medicine experts developed the medication for the virus\u201d.\n\nHowever, the article is misleading, as the Ministry of Health has only announced the beginning of a research study concerning the impact of traditional medicine in the fight against COVID-19.\n\nShortly after posting the article on Facebook, Capital Ethiopia published a new post, clarifying that \u201ctests will soon begin on animals and humans\u201d.\n\nEthiopia's Health Minister Lia Tadesse said on Twitter on March 27 that experts had completed a \"first phase\" of research involving traditional medicine to treat COVID-19.\n\nSenait Fisseha, chief advisor to the World Health Organization\u2019s director-general, tweeted shortly after the publication of Capital Ethiopia\u2019s article, explaining that the Ministry of Health was announcing \u201cthe start of a research study\u201d. She stressed that \u201cthere is no cure for COVID-19 and that prevention\u201d remains the most effective step towards slowing down the pandemic.\n\nContacted by AFP, Tagu Zergaw, spokesman of the Ministry of Health, told AFP that the study is in fact in its initial stage, and that \u201cno testing on humans have been made\u201d.\n\nAFP also contacted the minister of innovation and technology, who declined to comment.", "lang": "en"}
