Authorities have arrested Esteban Santiago, 26, for that shooting. Palin is quoted by Newslo of saying about the incident:\n\n\u201cIt is Barack Obama\u2019s policy of allowing Mexican Muslims to walk freely on our streets that has caused so much death and destruction recently, including this latest incident which has taken 5 innocent lives,\u201d she continued. \u201cThink about that for a second. Why were Mexican Muslims even allowed to walk our streets in the first place, I ask you? They\u2019re, like, double the threat \u2013 they\u2019re half Muslim, which means that they hate all of America by default, and the other half is Mexican, which means they can be very hard-working, but at the same time, they\u2019re also very jealous of white people. And if, by some miracle, you were to add just an ounce of Germanic heritage to that, you\u2019d have Hitler in the mix as well. That means they\u2019d be the ultimate killing machine. They should have been incarcerated from the beginning. Instead, we\u2019re left with this situation.\u201d\n\nNewslo is a web site the combines facts with fiction in their stories. The site\u2019s \u201cAbout\u201d page states that it is a \u201chybrid News/Satire platform\u201d:\n\nJUST ENOUGH NEWS \u2026 Newslo is the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web. Readers come to us for a unique brand of entertainment and information that is enhanced by features like our fact-button, which allows readers to find what is fact and what is satire.\n\nUnlike many sites that proffer false information, Newslo displays buttons above their stories that allow readers to visually filter the parts that are true and false. Most of this story, including all of Palin\u2019s alleged quotes, is false. The only factual part of the article is the opening paragraph, which provides details of the airport shooting incident.", "lang": "en"}
