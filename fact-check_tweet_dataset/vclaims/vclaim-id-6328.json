A few days later the government announced that it would change to a freephone number, and all other Department for Work and Pensions phone lines would follow.\n\nNumbers starting with 0345 cost up to 9p a minute if you\u2019re phoning from a landline. If you\u2019re phoning from a mobile it can cost anything from 3p to 55p a minute.\n\nOfcom says that numbers beginning with 03 can be included in free call packages from landlines and mobiles if a person is signed up to this. Mr Corbyn called for the helpline to be made free for all.\n\nSince Jeremy Corbyn spoke at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions the Department for Work and Pensions has said that \u201cThe #UniversalCredit hotline is charged at local rates, so calls are free for many people as part of their call packages\u2026 People can ask for free call backs from DWP\u201d.\n\nThe government recommends that people should use the helpline if they want to ask any questions about applying for Universal Credit or need help with their online application.", "lang": "en"}
