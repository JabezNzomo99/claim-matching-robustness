And were 13000 cars torched? No, that's an exaggeration by a satirical Belgian website that posted several stories about the actual riots that were taking place during the night following France winning the World Cup.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on July 16, 2018 titled \"Emeutes en France: D\u00e9j\u00e0 12 morts, 240 voitures br\u00fbl\u00e9es, 870 bless\u00e9s\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe social media summary of that story looked like thisl:\n\nLater on it followed with:\n\nIn reality there were riots but the numbers were much lower. Le Parisien reported:\n\nThe two people killed were accident victims, the deaths did not have to do with the riots.\n\nOver the weekend about 850 cars were torched as well according to The Local:\n\nNordpresse, the site putting out the headlines with the faked numbers, carries following disclaimer at the bottom:\n\nNordpresse is a quite known satire website but the story about the Paris riots was also being spread via the domain name \"nicesoir.press\", presumably in order to fool people who only saw the summary, title and images on Facebook. The site is hosted on the same IP address as nordpresse.be (176.31.110.25) and was used in the past to spread stories from Nordpresse as well.", "lang": "en"}
