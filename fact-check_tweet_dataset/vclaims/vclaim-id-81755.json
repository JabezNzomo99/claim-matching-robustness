Mark Warner joined the ranks of Wall Street critics during a recent radio interview, by complaining that investors increasingly are focused on reaping quick profits from companies at the expense of long-term value.\n\n\"The average time someone used to hold a share of stock back in the \u201960s was eight years. Now, the average time is four months,\" he said during an on \"Cat\u2019s Roundtable,\" a New York City radio talk show hosted by John Catsimatidis, a billionaire businessman.\n\nWe wondered whether Warner, D-Va., is right about the plunge in share-holding time.\n\nWarner\u2019s office sent us a variety of articles by academics, investment strategists, newspapers and magazines that contained similar statistics to the ones cited by the senator.\n\nThe source of the is the New York Stock Exchange which, for most of the 20th century, was the dominant U.S. stock-trading venue.\n\nHere\u2019s the NYSE\u2019s average holding period for stocks at the start of each new decade, beginning at Warner\u2019s mark in 1960:\n\u20221990, two years, two months; and\n\nBut many new trading venues have opened and expanded in recent decades - E*Trade and NASDAQ, for example - and the New York Stock Exchange\u2019s dominance has diminished.\n\nAbout 25 percent of all U.S. trading now occurs on the NYSE, which has high financial requirements for the companies it lists and generally deals with large, stable stocks.\n\nIn 2004, the NYSE changed its formula for calculating average share-holding periods to focus on its own listings. Credit Suisse that year began computing share-holding data that reflect the broader U.S. stock market.\n\nCredit Suisse figures show that in 2008 and 2009, when the nation was mired in the Great Recession, shares turned over an average almost five times a year. That\u2019s slowed to about three times a year since 2013 or, as Warner put it, once every four months.\n\nThe World Bank offers more conservative figures, saying U.S. shares, on average, turned over four times a year during the Great Recession and that slowed to 1.65 times a year in 2015 - or about once every eight months.\n\nStock market analysts and academics note a variety of reasons for the quickening turnover of shares. Many say the days of small ma-and-pa investors have given way to an era of mutual funds and hedge funds that exert strong pressure of companies to produce short-term profits.\n\nThe growth of e-trading also is cited; so are federal laws passed in 1993 that tied the bonuses of executives to their achievement of measurable performance goals in order for the bonuses to be tax-deductible for their companies.\n\nWarner said the consequence of \"activist investors\" is that corporations pay less attention to training workers and to research and development. He said Congress should explore offering tax incentives to companies that embrace those long-range goals.\n\nMany activist investors, to the contrary, say their actions have been beneficial and note that the stock market has continued to rise over the decades.\n\nWarner said, \"The average time someone used to hold a share of stock back in the \u201960s was eight years. Now, the average time is four months.\"\n\nThe gist of Warner\u2019s statement is undeniable: The average holding period for stocks has eroded greatly during the past 56 years.\n\nThe specifics of Warner\u2019s statement, however, need a little elaboration. Estimates by Credit Suisse jibe with Warner\u2019s claim that shares, on average, now are held for four months. The World Bank estimates the holding period now is about eight months.\n\nSo we rate Warner\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
