It is safe to use hand sanitizers around pets.\n\nHand sanitizer has been flying off the shelves as consumers seek methods to protect themselves from the new coronavirus. The image, posted March 18, warns pet owners about hand sanitizer allegedly containing a toxic compound found in antifreeze.\n\n\u201cPlease DO NOT pet your dog or any other pet after using hand sanitizer,\u201d reads the post. \u201cIt contains ethanol glycol that\u2019s also found in anti-freeze that\u2019s toxic to them!! They might lick the area you\u2019ve touched them.\u201d\n\nThe three most common active ingredients in hand sanitizers are ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol and benzalkonium chloride. Approximately 97 percent of over-the-counter hand sanitizers use one of those three ingredients, per the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nEthyl alcohol, the most common of the three active ingredients, is the same ethanol found in beer and wine, according to USA Today.

Ethylene glycol has a sweet taste that makes ingesting it attractive to pets, according to the VCA Hospitals website. It is not used in hand sanitizer.\n\nSavee Dalgo, a spokesperson for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), told the Daily Caller that it is safe for pet owners to use hand sanitizer. The Pet Poison Hotline does note, however, that an animal that ingests large amounts of hand sanitizer may experience lethargy, vomiting and weak respiration, among other issues.\n\n\u201cWhen using hand sanitizers, refrain from petting your dog or cat until your hands are completely dry,\u201d Dr. Tina Wismer, senior director of the ASPCA\u2019s Animal Poison Control Center, advised in a statement to the Caller. \u201cOnce it has evaporated it is safe to touch your pets.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
