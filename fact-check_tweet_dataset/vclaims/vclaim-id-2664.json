It said they were too complex and too stressful for people taking them, with outcomes that were too simplistic.\n\nThat\u2019s not quite true, and it depends on what you count as an appeal.\n\nIf you make a formal \u201cappeal\u201d on a Work Capability Assessment decision, it's right that you're more likely to win than lose. The most recent data suggests that about three-fifths of appeals are successful.\n\nThe number of cases that actually make it to appeal has fallen substantially over the past few years. A higher proportion of appeals are successfully overturning the initial decision, but fewer cases are making it to that stage.\n\nIf you include \u201cmandatory reconsiderations\u201d, the stage required before formal appeals can be made and where the case is looked at again, the chances of overturning an initial decision look less good.\n\nBefore they can formally appeal a WCA decision, people have to apply for what\u2019s called a \u2018mandatory reconsideration\u2019, where the Department for Work and Pensions looks at their case again.\n\nOut of all Work Capability Assessments that were completed and had an outcome recorded between October 2013 and December 2015, 13% were disputed and went to mandatory reconsideration.\n\nOut of all the cases that got a mandatory reconsideration, about 10% got revised. A small number of these went on to appeal, thought to be because claimants don\u2019t agree with the revised group they are put in.\n\n66% weren\u2019t revised and didn\u2019t go any further.\n\nAbout 22% weren\u2019t revised and went on to complete an appeal (DWP told us that they don't know the number that went on to appeal, only the number that completed their appeal).\n\nSo if we look at all challenges to WCA decisions, including mandatory reconsiderations and appeals, the chances of overturning an initial decision look less good, according to these figures.\n\nAbout 23% of initial decisions that were challenged eventually led to a decision being overturned\u2014so just under a quarter\u2014compared to the three-fifths of those that make it to the appeal stage.\n\nIt seems that, based on current trends, appeals are more likely to overturn a decision than mandatory reconsiderations.\n\nThis data only counts appeals completed, so it may exclude ones still in progress.\n\nThe number of appeals against \u2018Fit for Work\u2019 judgements fell significantly in around 2013. Numbers of appeals have remained low since then.\n\nVarious reasons have been offered as to why this is, and we\u2019re still looking for a definitive answer.\n\nMandatory reconsiderations were introduced in October 2013 and are thought to have contributed at least in part to the low number of appeals since 2013.\n\nA range of respondents to an independent advisory committee to the government said that they were concerned that extra waiting time and additional complexity introduced by mandatory considerations was discouraging people from appealing a \u2018fit for work\u2019 decision. They said this was particularly the case for \u201cvulnerable claimants\u201d.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t seem to explain the decline before mandatory reconsiderations came into place.\n\nThe committee\u2019s report suggested that the decline beforehand may have been \u201cdriven by a decline in the number of people who have been determined as fit for work\u201d.\n\nDisability Rights UK told us that the interpretation of test regulations also became stricter and was likely to have made a difference to the number of fit for work assessments, challenges and appeals that were made.\n\nInformation on how to appeal a decision is available from Disability Rights UK, or the government\u2019s online guide to Employment and Support Allowance.\n\nWe have removed the graphs from this article. The fourth graph contained an error. It said that it showed the proportion of all fit for work assessments that were successfully appealed. In fact, it showed the proportion of all fit for work assessments that led to an appeal outcome. We also felt the graphs created confusion, given the complexity of the system.\n\nWe also incorrectly concluded that the number of appeals (measured by the date the claim for ESA was made) had started to fall in the start of 2013, which didn\u2019t account for the time lag between the start of an ESA claim, the 13 week assessment period (which can sometimes take longer) and the time when the appeal was made. The bulk of the fall came in the spring and summer of 2013.\n\nWe also added in more detail about the outcomes of mandatory reconsiderations.", "lang": "en"}
