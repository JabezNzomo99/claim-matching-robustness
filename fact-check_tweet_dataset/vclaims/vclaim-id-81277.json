Honor. Loyalty. Unity. Respect. Courage. And more. On this page, you can read more about the storied history of the Redskins identity.\u201d\n\nEventually, the phrase appeared in English, of which the first known occurrence was in 1812 during a meeting between President James Madison and an Indian delegation, Goddard writes. Madison referred to \u201cred people,\u201d \u201cred tribes\u201d and \u201cmy red children;\u201d the chiefs replied and called themselves \u201cred skins.\u201d For instance, Little Osage chief Sans Oreilles (No Ears) said, \u201cI know the manners of the whites and of the red skins;\u201d Sioux chief French Crow declared, \u201cI am a red-skin.\u201d\n\nGoddard adamantly rejects the contention of some that \u201credskins\u201d referred in that period to the taking of scalps in order to earn a bounty. \u201cThere is no evidence for this,\u201d he says, though scalp bounties were publicized, most famously in the 1755 Phips Proclamation, in which prices were listed for \u201ccaptivating, killing and Destroying all and every of the aforesaid Indians.\u201d\n\nBut there is no mention of the term \u201credskins\u201d for scalps in that or other early documents; the earliest reference we could find tying \u201cred-skin\u201d to scalp bounties was in an announcement in 1863 in the Winona (Minnesota) Daily Republican, which noted that the reward had been increased to $200 for \u201cevery red-skin sent to Purgatory.\u201d\n\nNote that this notice appeared in the late 19th century. The RedskinsFacts Web site thus artfully tries to skate past the change in how \u201credskins\u201d was used and perceived. While the earliest references may have been benign, and Indian leaders at one point may have referred to themselves as \u201cred,\u201d \u201cred men,\u201d or \u201cred-skins,\u201d the phrase increasingly acquired unfavorable meanings by the late 19th century.\n\nThe proud spirit of the original owners of these vast prairies inherited through centuries of fierce and bloody wars for their possession, lingered last in the bosom of Sitting Bull. With his fall the nobility of the Redskin is extinguished, and what few are left are a pack of whining curs who lick the hand that smites them. The Whites, by law of conquest, by justice of civilization, are masters of the American continent, and the best safety of the frontier settlements will be secured by the total annihilation of the few remaining Indians. Why not annihilation? Their glory has fled, their spirit broken, their manhood effaced; better that they die than live the miserable wretches that they are.\n\nRecently, the discovery of a July 6, 1933 news article in the Hartford Courant cast doubt on that claim. In the article, an Associated Press dispatch, then-owner George Preston Marshall is quoted as saying that he changed the name from \u201cBraves\u201d because he did not want it to be confused with Boston\u2019s baseball team. He added: \u201cThe fact that we have in our head coach, Lone Star Dietz, an Indian, together with several Indian players, has not, as may be suspected, inspired me to select the name Redskins.\u201d\n\nThe other problem with Dietz is that, it turns out, he was likely an imposter\u2014who even went to prison for trying to dodge military service by falsely registering as an Indian. So the Web site neatly sidesteps that messy problem by simply saying that he \u201cidentified\u201d himself as a Native American.\n\nFor a Web site that claims to be devoted to \u201cthe facts,\u201d the history section leaves out a lot of them, in particular the highly negative connotations \u2014 instead of \u201cnoble qualities\u201d \u2014 that the phrase \u201credskin\u201d had acquired in the decades before the name was adopted by the football team. Instead, the Web site dwells on the pre-19th century usage, and skips over the fact that one of the team\u2019s longtime assertions \u2014 that the name was chosen in honor of the \u201cIndian\u201d coach \u2014 now appears to be wrong.\n\nThis is one of those cases where individual assertions might have a factual basis, but so much information is missing that a false impression is left in the mind of the reader. We wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios, but ultimately tipped toward Three. If you are going to have a Web site supposedly devoted to the facts, you can\u2019t leave out the inconvenient ones.", "lang": "en"}
