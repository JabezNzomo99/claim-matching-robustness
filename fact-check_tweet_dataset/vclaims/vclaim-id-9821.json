That report also was published more than a month before the invitations were sent out the week of March 23.\n\nThe royal family has not made the guest list public, and a spokesman for the family told us that he doesn\u2019t expect it will be released before the wedding.\n\nThe story claiming that Trump \u201cis beside himself with anger\u201d was posted on a network of sites called The Political Voice, and it was shared more than 87,000 times on Facebook. We\u2019ve written about made-up claims from that group of websites before. The sites recently posted a story with a headline wrongly claiming that Ivanka Trump had been fired from the White House.\n\nThe Political Voice\u2019s wedding story was also copied by several other dubious websites.\n\nAs for the expectation that an American president would be invited to a royal wedding, we wrote about that in 2011 when Harry\u2019s older brother, Prince William, was about to marry Kate Middleton. Obama, who was in office at the time, was not invited to the ceremony.\n\nIn fact, the only instance we found of a sitting president being invited to a royal wedding in the last 75 years was when Ronald Reagan was invited to the wedding of Prince Charles and Diana Spencer in 1981. He did not attend, but Nancy Reagan did.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cWhite House Erupting In RAGE After Obama Gets Invited To Royal Wedding \u2013 Trump Got DENIED.\u201d The Political Voice. 14 Feb 2018.\n\n\u201cRoyal wedding: the Prince William and Kate Middleton guest list as open data.\u201d The Guardian. 26 Apr 2011.\n\nJensen, Gregory. \u201cWho\u2019s in and who\u2019s out at the royal wedding.\u201d United Press International. 11 Jul 1981.", "lang": "en"}
