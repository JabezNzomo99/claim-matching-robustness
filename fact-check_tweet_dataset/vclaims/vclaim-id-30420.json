Samples From Earlier Sarin Attacks, But Was Ignored", "subtitle": "The president of the Moscow-based Institute of the Middle East, Yevgeny Satanovsky, accused the United Nations of ignoring samples of the chemical weapon sarin used in earlier incidents in Syria\u2019s Aleppo province that the Russian military supposedly handed over to the U.N., suggesting the world body would ignore evidence of a sarin poisoning incident in Idlib province on April 4. However, Russia did not hand over samples from the earlier incidents.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "April 18, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-30420", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-syria-assad-chemical-weapons/28436964.html", "vclaim": "Evidence suggests Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime used chemical weapons in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in Syria\u2019s Idlib province on April 4. In response to that attack, the U.S. carried out a cruise missile strike on a Syrian air base.\n\nIn an article dated April 7, the president of the Institute of the Middle East, Yevgeny Satanovsky, was quoted as saying the U.S.-led coalition \u201cdoesn\u2019t care where the chemical weapons are coming from\u201d since \u201ctheir only goal is to overthrow Assad.\u201d\n\nSatanovsky told \u201cParlamentskaya Gazeta,\u201d the official newspaper of Russia\u2019s parliament, that the Russian military had given the U.N. \u201dsoil samples, fragments and shells\u201d containing sarin used in Aleppo (in an August 2015 incident), but that the U.N. ignored this evidence because \u201cno one intended or intends to test them or investigate the details of the case.\u201d\n\nSatanovsky referred to the Russian Defense Ministry\u2019s claim that the April 4 incident in Idlib province was accidently caused by a Syrian air force strike on a terrorist-held facility where sarin was being stored or manufactured. Polygraph.info previously found that Defense Ministry claim to be false.\n\nSatanovsky said the April 4 incident is being blamed on Assad as part of a campaign to overthrow him.\n\nThe public affairs office of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), an intergovernmental organization based in The Hague, told Polygraph.info in an email that Satanovsky\u2019s claim that Russia turned over to the U.N. soil samples, fragments and shells with sarin from the earlier incidents in Aleppo \u201cis incorrect.\u201d\n\nThe Fact Finding Mission (FFM) is a joint body of the United Nations and the OPCW established in 2015 to investigate any recorded incidents involving the suspected use of chemical weapons in Syria.\n\nThe United Nations press office in New York City told Polygraph.info via email that the FFM is \u201cconducting an investigation\u201d into the April 4 incident as well as into the earlier incidents, including one in Aleppo.\n\nAccording to the OPCW, the Russians offered to provide the FFM with the samples and other materials from Aleppo. In response, the FFM contacted the Russian Foreign Ministry by telephone to arrange where the samples should be delivered, proposing two options \u2013 Damascus or The Hague. The Russian side, however, never responded to the proposal and never delivered the samples.", "lang": "en"}
