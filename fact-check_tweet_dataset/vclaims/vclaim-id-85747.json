The Wall Street Journal reported that the head of the Justice Department\u2019s national-security division objected that it would look like a ransom payment. State Department officials insisted the negotiations over the claims and detainees were not connected but came together at the same time, with the cash payment used as \u201cleverage\u201d to ensure the release of detainees.\n\nBefore the 1979 revolution, Iran under the shah was reputedly the biggest buyer of U.S. military equipment, depositing funds for potential deals in a Defense Department account. When Iran seized U.S. Embassy staffers as hostages, the military sales account was frozen. The issue \u2014 and other outstanding claims \u2014 has been litigated ever since through a claims tribunal established in The Hague. Some of the money in the account was used to pay American companies whose contracts were canceled, but by 2000, about $400 million was left in what was known as the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Trust Fund account.\n\nCongress passed a law in 2000 under which the U.S. Treasury could pay compensatory judgments (plus a portion of punitive damages) issued for claims against Iran (as well as Cuba). All told, about $400 million was paid out in relation to court judgments against Iran covered by the law and subsequent legislation in 2002 \u2014 about the equivalent of what was in the FMS trust fund. That is because the amount in the FMS trust fund essentially provided a cap on what would be paid out to those judgment holders who were eligible for compensation under the law. (The family of Alisa Flatow, for instance, received $26 million, which was used to establish a scholarship fund.)\n\n\u201c(c) SUBROGATION. \u2014 Upon payment under subsection (a) with respect to payments in connection with a Foreign Military Sales Program account, the United States shall be fully subrogated, to the extent of the payments, to all rights of the person paid under that subsection against the debtor foreign state. The President shall pursue these subrogated rights as claims or offsets of the United States in appropriate ways, including any negotiation process which precedes the normalization of relations between the foreign state designated as a state sponsor of terrorism and the United States, except that no funds shall be paid to Iran, or released to Iran, from property blocked under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act or from the Foreign Military Sales Fund, until such subrogated claims have been dealt with to the satisfaction of the United States.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the explanation: Just because there are $400 million in subrogated claims, it does not mean that Iran actually must return that money to the United States. The text of the law provides for a lot of wiggle room: U.S. officials \u201cshall pursue these subrogated rights as claims or offsets of the United States in appropriate ways, including any negotiation process \u2026 until such subrogated claims have been dealt with to the satisfaction of the United States.\u201d Obama officials say that is what happened, with the final amount of the settlement \u2014 $400 million plus $1.3 billion in interest \u2014 taking into account the subrogated claims.\n\n\u201cThe VTVPA does not say that the USG could never release the FMS funds to Iran; it says the funds could not be released to Iran \u2018until such subrogated claims have been dealt with to the satisfaction of the United States,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI assume that when the Obama administration paid the FMS funds plus interest to Iran, they concluded that this VTVPA provision was satisfied.\u201d\n\nThe Tablet article raised questions about the size of the interest penalty \u2014 $1.3 billion \u2014 and called on Treasury to release all documents related to the payment of the claim, such as the computation of the amount of interest allegedly owed. (The Treasury IG report indicated that the State Department relied on a calculation involving the annual prime lending rate and simple interest method, which seems out of the ordinary.) We made a request to Treasury for the information, but a Treasury spokesman declined to provide it because of the ongoing litigation between the United States and Iran.\n\nBellinger agreed that that was a concern. \u201cThere was a significant risk, based on its judgments in recent years, the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal would have issued a decision awarding a larger amount to Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the tribunal had done that, and the U.S. government was then unwilling or unable to pay the award, the U.S. would have violated its obligations under the Algiers Accords.\u201d He said \u201cit was prudent to settle the claims, even if it required the U.S. to take the highly unpalatable action of making a payment to Iran.\u201d (The Algiers Accords were agreements signed by the United States and Iran in January 1981 to resolve the Iran hostage crisis.)\n\nThe State Department has noted that under The Hague process, Iran has paid out more than $2.5 billion in awards to U.S. nationals and companies. With a few exceptions, the major outstanding claims concern Iran against the United States, heightening the sensitivity of U.S. officials about discussing the issue. Much as Trump dislikes Obama\u2019s dealings with Iran, releasing the documents now might raise the cost to U.S. taxpayers later.\n\nRegular readers know we have been willing to award ourselves Pinocchios if we get something incorrect. But that\u2019s not the case here. One can certainly disagree with the Obama administration\u2019s decision to send a jet with cash to Tehran on the same day that American detainees were released, but the action taken did not violate the law passed by Congress.
