We wrote about it briefly during our live fact-check of the first GOP debate. But there is more to unpack about this figure, and he continues to use it on the campaign trail. So we dug further.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s fact sheet lists $19.3 billion as the total \u201crevenue changes that occurred during Governor Bush\u2019s tenure.\u201d Yet Bush takes sole credit for the $19 billion: \u201cI cut taxes.\u201d This is misleading, especially since a portion of that figure comes from revenues lost when the state estate tax credit was repealed under his brother George W. Bush\u2019s administration.\n\nThe estate tax credit was a revenue-sharing scheme between states and the federal government. A portion of the federal estate tax, levied on assets held when a person dies, was credited for state estate taxes. So states levied an estate tax up to the amount of the federal credit, allowing states to raise revenue without increasing the total tax burden on residents.\n\nLet\u2019s say a Floridian owed $100 in federal estate taxes. The estate would receive a dollar-for-dollar state estate tax credit of a portion of that \u2014 say, $16 (the maximum rate is 16 percent). That $16 would then be paid in state estate taxes. The tax paid is still $100 but the federal government receives $84, and the state receives $16.\n\nWhen the phase-out began in 2002, that Floridian would still pay $100, but the amount in state estate tax credit decreased. So out of $100, they\u2019d get a credit of $12, and owe $12 to the state the first year of the phase-out. The second year, they\u2019d get a credit of $8 out of $100, and owe $8 to the state. And so on, until the state tax credit \u2014 and therefore, the state tax \u2014 was gone starting Jan. 1, 2005.\n\nIn the $19.3 billion figure, the campaign included the reductions in state estate tax revenues as a result of the phase-out. Bush supported the phase-out, saying he supports Congress\u2019s efforts to \u201calleviate the tax burden on all Americans, even when those reductions directly affect our state budget.\u201d His campaign said Bush should get credit for supporting the repeal of the estate tax and refraining from circumventing the cut, like some other states did.\n\nFlorida\u2019s state constitution prohibits a stand-alone estate tax, so the state would not have been able to \u201cdecouple\u201d without a constitutional amendment. Bush\u2019s campaign noted Florida\u2019s state constitution is relatively easy to amend and has the seventh highest amendment rate among states, meaning he could have pushed for a constitutional change if he wanted to.\n\nBush repeatedly says that he cut $19 billion in taxes. But the figure he uses is cumulative state revenue changes as a result of state and federal decisions, adjusted into 2007 dollars. (Economists say it\u2019s fair to use 2007 dollars.) The majority of the figure represents revenue changes from tax and non-tax legislative actions during his tenure as governor. He then adds revenues the state would have received if the federal estate tax credit had not been phased out. His campaign says he should get credit for not fighting the repeal like other states did. But Bush did not enact this cut in state tax revenues.\n\nWe wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios. By saying \u201cI cut taxes\u201d he suggests he played an active role in reducing the $19 billion in state revenues. Yet in reality, he decided not to do anything to fight the repeal. He is saying that by doing nothing (i.e., not fighting the repeal), he did something (i.e., cut taxes). His taking sole credit for all $19 billion tipped the rating to Three.", "lang": "en"}
