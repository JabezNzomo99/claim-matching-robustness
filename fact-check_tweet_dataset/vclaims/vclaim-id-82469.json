A distant second was pro-BJD ads at Rs 15.2 lakh, followed by pro-YSR Congress ads (Rs 12.7 lakh), ads by the Karnataka government (Rs 5 lakh) and pro-Congress pages (Rs 1.68 lakh).\n\nThe table below shows the expenditure by the top 20 pages between March 2 to 16. This is reflected in Column C, which is the difference between total expenditure till March 16 (Column D) and total expenditure up to March 2 (Column E).\n\nAmong the highest spenders, the Facebook page dedicated to BJP\u2019s election campaign \u2018Bharat Ke Mann Ki Baat\u2019 invested the maximum \u2013 Rs 87.3 lakh. The second in line was a pro-BJP page \u2018Nation with NaMo\u2019 with an expenditure of over Rs 43 lakh. Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik was placed third with a total ad spending of Rs 15.2 lakh between March 2 to 16. At the fourth place was pro-YSR Congress advertisements by \u2018Indian Political Action Committee\u2019, amounting to nearly Rs 13 lakh, up from Rs 53,992 two weeks earlier. I-PAC is a political advocacy group that provides strategies for election campaigns. Placing fifth was the central government page \u2018MyGov India\u2019 that spent over Rs 8.3 lakh.\n\nAt the 6th place among the top 20 advertisers was a Facebook page named \u2018My First Vote For Modi\u2019 which spent a little over Rs 11,000 till March 2, however, pumped-up the expenditure to nearly Rs 7.5 lakh in just two weeks (Column D).\n\n\u2018My First Vote For Modi\u2019 is a recently-developed Facebook page. It was introduced in January this year and has only 45,000 followers, yet the page invested more on political ads than the BJP\u2019s official page. As seen in Column E of the table, the BJP\u2019s official Facebook page spent Rs 6.6 lakh on political ads till March 2 \u2013 a figure that remained constant till March 16 (Column D).\n\nUpon accessing the ad library data of \u2018My First Vote For Modi\u2019, Alt News found that the address of BJP headquarters in Delhi \u2013 \u20186-A, Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Marg, Near ITO, Minto Bridge Colony, Barakhamba, New Delhi 110002\u2032 \u2013 is provided in the disclaimer information of the page.\n\nAnother aspect that came to our notice was the page\u2019s corresponding website \u2013 https://nationwithnamo.com/MyFirstVoteForModi.\n\n\u2018Nation with NaMo\u2019is also a pro-BJP Facebook page that made higher investments on political ads than the BJP\u2019s official Facebook page \u2013 Rs 43 lakh \u2013 and stood second only to \u2018Bharat Ke Mann Ki Baat\u2019.\n\nIncidentally, \u2018Nation with NaMo\u2019 also provides the address of BJP headquarters in the disclaimer information.\n\nIn the past, Alt News had found \u2018Nation with NaMo\u2019circulating misinformation to depict positive changes brought about by the Modi government since it came to power in 2014. The page had also put out job applications last year, calling IIT and IIM graduates to drive Prime Minister Modi\u2019s campaign.\n\nFacebook\u2019s ad policies require pages to reveal advertiser details in case they are sponsoring ads related to politics, yet the two pages discussed in this report provided names of websites as \u2018disclaimer\u2019. A website is not an individual and it is nearly impossible for social media users to trace the people behind it.\n\nSummarily, the disclaimer information does not necessarily disclose the names of the individuals or organisations pumping lakhs of money to shape public opinion online.\n\nUsers also cannot rely on the contact information provided by these pages. The phone numbers given by \u2018My First Vote For Modi\u2019 and \u2018Nation With NaMo\u2019 are 6372802105 and 6372802059 respectively. Apart from the last three digits, the numbers match. Searching for both the numbers on Treucaller throws up the identical result \u2013 \u201cnot yet available\u201d. Calling up the numbers is also fruitless because both are switched off.\n\nThe sole lead that we have is the address provided by the pages, which matches BJP headquarters in Delhi. This raises two pertinent questions \u2013 one, does the BJP fund these pages to sponsor political ads favouring the party?; two, if the BJP is, in fact, responsible, has the investment been disclosed to the Election Commission?\n\nUPDATE: Some of the figures in an earlier version of the article were incorrect, and have now been corrected.", "lang": "en"}
