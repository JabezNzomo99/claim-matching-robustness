Gandhi was addressing party workers belonging to the Other Backward Class or the OBC community during a public meeting at Delhi's Talkatora Stadium.\n\nTo establish this point, Gandhi had this to say -\n\nShikanji is a close cousin of the humble neembu paani and is a staple drink during the summers in North India. Shikanji can be made at home using lemon or lime juice, ginger juice, salt, jeera powder, ice and water.\n\nBut did the founder of Coca-Cola start as a lemonade salesman? History does not support that claim going by details of how the beverage was invented when the company was founded in the 1880s with the product going through several changes that initially had alcohol and even small doses of cocaine in the original formulation.\n\nThe founder of Coca-Cola John Pemberton was a pharmacist who had emerged from the Civil War with a morphine addiction. The Coca-Cola history documentary available on Youtube calls him a failed pharmacist who tried his hand at making various products since 1870 but never managed to make a success of any of them.\n\nAccording to Time magazine, Pemberton hoping to cure his ailment created Pemberton\u2019s French Wine Coca, a brew that included kola nut and coca wine. But in 1886, as Atlanta passed prohibition legislation, he reformulated the drink without alcohol, renamed it Coca-Cola, and began selling it in Georgia pharmacies like Jacobs Pharmacy, who at that point sold soda drinks as well.\n\nWhile the company's own historians have sanitised the original formulation's experimentation with alcohol and cocaine, several reports over the century have documented that Pemberton replaced the wine in the formula with sugar syrup but kept coca. His new product debuted in 1886: \"Coca-Cola: The temperance drink.\" keeping it in line with the changing regulations in Atlanta that frowned on alcohol consumption.\n\nCoca-Cola was also marketed as a nerve tonic that relieves exhaustion when it was first launched in 1886 according to advertisements published that year.\n\nSo while Pemberton was making different formulations and in search of his money spinner, it was his accountant Frank M. Robinson, a brilliant advertising brain, who suggested the name and penned the now famous trademark \"Coca-Cola\" in his unique script.\n\nUnlike Rahul Gandhi who wanted his followers to believe that the lemonade seller thrived when he formed the company and made money, in the first year of operation Coca-Cola sold only 25 gallons of Coca-Cola syrup and made $50 while incurring expenses of $76. Subsequently, Pemberton's health confined him to the bed due to severe stomach ailments and the company made serious losses. John Pemberton died a disappointed man at the age of 57 in August 1888.\n\nThis account is also confirmed in an article published in 2012 in the history section of Coca-Cola's website.\n\nWith Pemberton's untimely death within a short time after he created the product, it was left to a smart businessman Asa Candler, who began to acquire The Coca\u2010Cola Company in 1888 and incorporated The Coca\u2010Cola Company as a Georgia Corporation.\n\nWhile modern America would not have had a success story called Coca-Cola without Pemberton, Phillip Mooney, the company's own Archivist has been dismissive of his contribution to the 125-year old company's success.\n\nRahul Gandhi may have used the term Shikanji to make his point of a small entrepreneur making it big in America. But the example of Coca-Cola's humble origins appears misplaced as John Pemberton never managed to see his invention become a global behemoth decades later.\n\nThe events of the mid-1880s also show that far from America's pro-entrepreneur policies, it was the 'Temperance movement' in Atlanta that encouraged Pemberton to reformulate his original product to make it a successful soda drink as it is known today, irrespective of what the company's own historians may now want the world to believe.", "lang": "en"}
