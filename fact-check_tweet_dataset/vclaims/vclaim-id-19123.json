Also, the timing of the post indicated that it is a recent event. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Video of Indian Army burning the Kashmiri people houses at Bandipora. Fact: The houses in the video were burnt last year in a fire incident at Uri. They were not burnt by the Indian Army and it\u2019s not a recent incident. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe video in the post was divided into keyframes using Invid tool and the frames were then run through the Google Reverse Image Search using keywords related to Kashmir. Then, it can be found that a similar video was uploaded on YouTube by \u2018ATV News Kashmir\u2019 in March-2018 with a description: \u2018Four residential houses were gutted in a massive fire incident at Lachipora Uri\u2019.\n\nWhen searched on Google with the keywords found in the video description, the news reports published on this incident can be found. None of the reports found indicates any involvement of the Indian Army. Also, the incident happened at Lachipora, not at Bandipora. More details about the incident can be read in the articles published by the \u2018Kashmir Pen\u2019 and \u2018Rising Kashmir\u2019.\n\nTo sum it up, the houses in the video were not burnt by the Indian Army. It\u2019s a fire incident at Uri which happened last year.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
