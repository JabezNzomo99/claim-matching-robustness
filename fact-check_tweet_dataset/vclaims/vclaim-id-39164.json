Health workers and people taking care of someone with the virus in close settings should also wear masks, according to the CDC website.\n\n\u201cCDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a face mask to protect themselves from respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19,\u201d Dorigo told the DCNF.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
