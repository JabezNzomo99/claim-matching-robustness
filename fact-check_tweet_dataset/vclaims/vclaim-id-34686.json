That\u2019s against international protocol of lending a hand to ship in distress, absolute distress. Mali iyon (that's wrong) by whatever angle you look at,\" Panelo said in a DWFM radio interview on June 13.\n\n\"Kagaya ng sinabi ko, you have to investigate first. Like for instance, kung may binangga rin iyong ating \u2026 isang Filipino ship, eh kung private naman iyon, ano bang kinalaman din natin doon, \u2018di ba? But we will also investigate, do something. Tingnan muna natin. But definitely, we are denouncing it already. That fact alone should initiate some actions on the part of the Chinese government,\" Panelo said.\n\n\"I strongly dismiss the attached social media card, where I have been purportedly quoted, as hoax. This meme puts me, as well as the Office of the President, in a bad light as we are placed in a position which suggests that we are siding with the Chinese anent the incident of allision in the West Philippine Sea,\" Panelo said in an official statement released to the press on June 17.\n\nThe Facebook meme of Panelo may be an allusion to Panelo's statement in March 2019 against Jude Sabio, the lawyer who sued President Rodrigo Duterte last year before the International Criminal Court. Panelo said that the lawyer was only \"hallucinating and publicizing\" himself.", "lang": "en"}
