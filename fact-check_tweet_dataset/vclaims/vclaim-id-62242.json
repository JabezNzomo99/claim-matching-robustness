Corley\u2019s original post was shared on May 6 along with a message to the \u201cconspiracy theorists\u201d who were refusing to wear masks during the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\nWe note that many social media users who encountered this photograph made some incorrect assumptions about what it showed. For example, many people seemed to think that the petri dish on the right showed SARS-CoV-2, the strain of coronavirus at the center of the current pandemic, and that this photograph demonstrated just how effective masks were at stopping the spread of COVID-19. This photograph, however, simply shows \u201cnormal oral flora.\u201d\n\nIn an edit to her post, Corley explained that the petri dish on the right contained \u201cnormal oral flora,\u201d such as staph species, neisseria species, and corynebacterium. Corley also noted that viruses are much smaller than the bacterium shown in the petri dish, but noted that this small experiment demonstrated how masks can lessen droplet spread that can carry viruses.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of questions regarding this experiment, so here\u2019s some answers:\n\n 1. I used a cloth mask I made myself with disposable lab coat material.\n\n 2. I used blood agar.\n\n 3. The plate on the right looks \u201cold\u201d or \u201cstale\u201d because of the growth. Some of the organisms on this plate are alpha hemolytic, meaning they partially hemolyze blood. The agar itself is made with 5% sheep\u2019s blood, so when it\u2019s partially hemolyzed, it turns a dark green color.\n\n 4. As for the growth, it\u2019s mostly viridans strep, staph species (not staph aureus), neisseria species, and corynebacterium. Pretty normal oral flora.\n\n 5. I realize that viruses are 1,000 times smaller than bacteria. The point of the masks is to prevent droplet spread, which carry bacteria as well as viruses.\n\nCorley, of course, was not the first person to notice how face masks lessened droplet transmission. Similar images showing bacteria from a person\u2019s cough growing in a petri dish can also be seen in this article from the Microbiology Society. Rich Davis, the Clinical Microbiology Lab Directory at Providence Sacred Heart, posted a series of images of a similar demonstration:\n\nDavis, like Corley, emphasized that this was not an experiment showing the efficacy of masks against the spread of COVID-19. Rather, it was a simple demonstration to show how masks lessened the spread of respiratory droplets, which can carry the disease.\n\nThe British children\u2019s television show \u201cOperation Ouch!\u201d also took a look at how much bacteria gets disseminated when a person coughs. While that episode did not include masks, it did compare a petri dish that was coughed on by a man with no mouth covering and a petri dish that was coughed on by a man who covered his mouth with an elbow.\n\nHere\u2019s how the petri dish looked after it was coughed on by the man who covered his mouth (left) and the petri dish coughed on by the man who didn\u2019t (right). As you can see, the results from \u201cOperation Ouch!\u201d are very similar to the results seen in Corley\u2019s post:\n\nHere\u2019s the clip from \u201cOperation Ouch!\u201d (The cough experiment starts around the 50-second mark):\n\nA 2005 study published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology noted that more than 700 bacterial species have been detected in the oral cavity. Covering your mouth when you cough (either with an elbow or a mask) can reduce droplet transmission and lessen the spread of potentially harmful germs.\n\nProfessor Lindsay Grayson, director of infectious diseases at Melbourne\u2019s Austin Hospital, said as much during a presentation at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy in San Francisco in 2009 concerning research on the effectiveness of masks in slowing the spread of influenza.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re wearing a mask to prevent yourself from catching it, they\u2019re not so effective,\u201d said Dr. M. Lindsay Grayson, professor of medicine at the University of Melbourne and one of the study\u2019s co-authors. \u201cBut if you\u2019re sick with the flu and coughing and sputtering, those masks do prevent you from spraying those bugs everywhere.\u201d The researchers asked nine study subjects with documented cases of influenza type A or B to test two different types of masks \u2014 the standard, disposable surgical masks and a more costly, respirator-style mask. The flu patients coughed into a petri dish while wearing both types of mask as well as without the mask. The dish was then tested for the presence of flu virus. When either type of mask was worn, no virus was detected on the petri dish.\n\nBut how effective are masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19?\n\nWhile the exact efficacy of masks on the spread of COVID-19 is still undetermined, health officials do recommend that people wear masks in public because these face coverings can prevent droplet transmission.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told us:\n\n\u201cAs we study the virus, CDC has learned that a good proportion of individuals who have COVID-19 spread virus before they become symptomatic and a few people never have symptoms at all but are still infected and infectious. That means, that people who are not coughing or sneezing can be a source of infection for others. Something simple like speaking is enough to generate aerosols that can spread the infection to other people. A simple cloth mask is a way to contain respiratory secretions right at the source and not put other people at risk. The mask traps the droplets before they spread into the environment. Therefore, \u201cmy mask protects you, and your mask protects me!\u201d It\u2019s a way of strengthening the social distancing that we are already doing.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note, however, that wearing a mask is only one of several preventative measures that people should be taking during this pandemic, such as frequently washing their hands and maintaining a safe social distance (6 feet apart) while in public. Or, as Tedros Adhanom, the director-general of the World Health Organization, said: \u201cMasks alone cannot stop the pandemic.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
