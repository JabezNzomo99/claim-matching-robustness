Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte saw her poll numbers drop after she voted against the Senate proposal, and a sympathetic PAC launched an ad in her defense. Do Ayotte\u2019s constituents support expanded background checks?\n\nWhat the polls say\n\nGiffords\u2019 op-ed relies on polling conducted on behalf of her advocacy group, Americans for Responsible Solutions.\n\nThe question: \"Do you favor or oppose requiring background checks on all gun sales including those sold on the Internet and at gun shows?\"\n\nRegistered voters in New Hampshire who participated in the poll, done May 21-23, 2013, by progressive polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, answered the way Giffords described.\n\nOur general policy is to give some credence to polls paid for by an organization affiliated with the individual or group making the claim, but also to look for confirmation with polls taken independently of the organization.\n\nNo recent New Hampshire poll we found broke out respondents in all of those categories: by party, gun ownership and \"NRA households.\"\n\nBut a smattering of polls from this year generally back up pieces of her claim.\n\nThe findings for New Hampshire Democrats in the Giffords poll were generally in tune with the other polls we found. But the Republican numbers, while still a majority, were significantly lower in two New Hampshire polls than the 79 percent Giffords cited \u2014 63 percent in a Dartmouth College poll and 56 percent in a Public Policy Polling survey.\n\nMeanwhile, we\u2019re not aware of any recent independent polls of New Hampshire NRA members. Two polls we have reviewed in previous fact-checks have looked at this issue nationally. But both were conducted by groups associated to one degree or another with the pro-gun-control position \u2014 one was sponsored by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, and the other was conducted by the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, which is named for and supported financially by the founder of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\nHowever, at least one independent poll this year, by CBS News and the New York Times found that nationally, 85 percent of respondents living in a household with an NRA member supported universal background checks.\n\nMeanwhile, a May report from Pew Research Center shows it\u2019s a mistake to assume support for expanded background checks is the same as support for background check legislation.\n\nSupport among Republicans and gun owners for expanding background checks in that national survey \u2014 in the 80 percent range \u2014 fell to around 60 percent when they were asked about the Senate bill.\n\nAnd while 79 percent of Republican gun owners favored background checks, just 43 percent wanted the Senate\u2019s background checks legislation to pass.\n\nGiffords, seeking common ground for gun control legislation, said \"in New Hampshire, 93 percent of Democrats, 79 percent of Republicans, 82 percent of gun owners and 60 percent of NRA households support background checks.\"\n\nThe numbers came from polling on behalf of her own advocacy group. We found some independent evidence that New Hampshire voters support expanded background checks, through the support is weaker among Republicans.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that support for background checks doesn\u2019t translate directly to support for the Senate bill Giffords mentioned in her op-ed. Support for the bill itself commands smaller majorities, and a minority of gun-owning Republicans nationally.\n\nGiffords\u2019 claim requires clarification and additional information. We rate it Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
