Her condition remains critical.\n\nWe also sent across image used in the viral post to the doctor to confirm whether she was the Unnao rape survivor, as sharing of the picture clearly violates media ethics. The doctor confirmed that the picture was not of the Unnao rape survivor.\n\nThe post concerns the Unnao rape survivor who has been fighting for justice for two years now. The girl was allegedly raped by the local BJP MLA Kuldip Singh Sengar at his residence in Unnao where she had gone seeking employment. Sengar was expelled from the party on Thursday.\n\nIn course of two year from the alleged incident, the girl's father died in judicial custody. On July 28, two of her aunts died in a road accident near Rae Bareli. The victim and her lawyer were critically injured in the same accident.\n\nSince the accident, social media is rife with the news of her death.\n\nA caption with the viral post reads 'Farewell. Unnao rape victim no more. No one would have imagined that a family will have to die along their daughter just to get justice. Operation Truck was successful...now a new narrative will be created...lectures would be delivered about women empowerment. Congratulations to the MLA. And in the end, who can change the fate! May you never be born in this country, beloved one. Farewell. Operation Truck was successful.'\n\nYou can view the viral posts below and access their archived versions here and here.\n\nMeanwhile, news reports stated the girl might airlifted to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (Delhi) for further treatment if feasible.
