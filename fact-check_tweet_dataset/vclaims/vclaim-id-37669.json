Most of us also know Anil Kapoor. But do we know Majnu Bhai? If no, here's a little background. But first, take a look at this viral post which has brought Majnu bhai back in the limelight after almost four years.\n\nActor Anil Kapoor met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi \n\non January 16, 2019. The actor later tweeted the picture of their meeting and also shared it on Instagram.\n\nWithin hours of the actor posting the picture, the Internet was flooded with a photoshopped version of the same image.\n\nSome even went a step further and came up with this.\n\nSo who is Majnu bhai?\n\nThe viral Majnu bhai these posts are referring to is a character from Anil Kapoor-starrer Welcome series. The last movie in the series was released back in 2015.\n\nThe character Kapoor portrays in the movie i.e. Majnu bhai,is an underworld don who aspires to be a painter. The painting that we see in the viral posts is one of those painted by Kapoor's character in the movie.\n\nThe original artwork, as we see in the posts shared by Kapoor on his Twitter and Instagram handles, is that of a tree. We can see the same artwork in these images where the prime minister is seen greeting other visitors.\n\nMeanwhile, here's a clip from the film Welcome where we can see Majnu Bhai with his now-viral painting.", "lang": "en"}
