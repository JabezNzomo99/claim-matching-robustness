According to KOAT Albuquerque, several anonymous men allowed a microbiologist to swab their beards for bacterial testing. A few of the beards contained standard stuff while others revealed fecal matter. While the microbiologist recommended a good beard scrubbing and regular hand-washing to diminish the amount of germs, he didn\u2019t explain how a man\u2019s beard could end up with poop in the first place.\n\nBut that underlying \u201cstudy\u201d was actually merely a brief local news report by Albuquerque station KOAT that consisted of a newsperson and a Quest Diagnostics lab in Albuquerque taking swabs from the beards of a small handful of volunteers, analyzing them for microbes, finding a few seemingly yucky results, and discussing the outcome with a single microbiologist \u2014 from whom a few very short, sensational-sounding, out-of-context sound bites were excerpted.\n\nThis tenuous \u201cstudy\u201d was soon the subject of a multiplicity of sensationalized headlines comparing men\u2019s beards to everything fecal:\n\no New York Post: \u201cBearded men have poop on their faces\u201d\n\no Canada Journal: \u201cYour filthy beard contains more s\u2014 than a toilet, study shows\u201d\n\no Daily Mirror: \u201cSome beards contain more poo than a toilet shocking study reveals\u201d\n\no News.com.au: \u201cShock new research reveals some beards contain more poo than a toilet\u201d\n\no WSB-TV: \u201cBeards are filled with bacteria and \u2018as dirty as toilets\u2019\u201d\n\nHowever, as the Guardian observed, KOAT\u2019s process fell far short of what constitutes a rigorous study and didn\u2019t actually detect the presence of fecal material in men\u2019s beards:\n\nAs far as I can tell there was no proper study, no team of microbiologists and no poo in beards. The origin of the story appears to be this segment from a TV news network in New Mexico, which involved a reporter swabbing a \u201chandful\u201d of men\u2019s beards and then sending the swabs to a microbiologist in a lab to culture any microbes present. The reporter then interviewed the microbiologist, John Golobic, who identified a few of the bacteria present as \u201centerics\u201d, that is they are bacteria that normally live in the intestines. \u201cThose are the types of things you\u2019d find in faeces,\u201d he said. And that\u2019s all. Somehow, from this story other media organisations have managed to get poo in beards. While it is true that human faeces are partially composed of gut bacteria, it\u2019s not accurate to describe those bacteria on their own as faeces.\n\nSimilarly, the Washington Post noted that \u201cgut bacteria\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily the same thing as \u201cpoop,\u201d not is its presence either alarming or harmful:\n\nThe problem with this is that bacteria known to associate poop is not necessarily literal poop. In fact it\u2019s probably not. And saying that something is gross for being covered in bacteria is pretty ridiculous, because anything that exists in our physical realm is definitely going to be covered in bacteria. I have bad news for y\u2019all: You\u2019re covered in poo bacteria. COVERED. Look to your left, look to your right. There\u2019s probably poo bacteria on both sides and also in front of you. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s really fine. Embrace the poo bacteria, it is a part of you because you are a multitude of microorganisms, each more special than the last. But unless you\u2019ve put it there intentionally, you almost certainly don\u2019t have poop on your face. No matter how thick your beard is.\n\nThe Guardian concurred in that assessment:\n\nIt may be true that some beards may be less than rigorously hygienic, but proclaiming them to be \u201cfilthy\u201d and \u201cdirty as a toilet\u201d based on a scant TV news survey is an alarmist exaggeration.", "lang": "en"}
