Col. Alexander S. Vindman. Vindman listened to the July 25 call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nCommentators, primarily on Fox News, have questioned Vindman\u2019s motives. One Fox News guest said the word \"espionage\" might apply. Donald Trump, Jr. cast him as \"a leftist.\"\n\nIn a text of his prepared remarks to the House Intelligence Committee, Vindman wrote that he found Trump\u2019s and Zelensky\u2019s conversation concerning.\n\n\"I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\" Vindman wrote.\n\nHe wrote that he thought that Trump\u2019s request would politicize aid to Ukraine and \"undermine U.S. national security.\" Vindman wrote that he reported his concern to the top lawyer for the National Security Council.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about Vindman, his connection to the Ukraine investigation, and the criticisms about his motives.\n\nWhy was Vindman listening to the call?\n\nVindman joined the National Security Council in July 2018 to implement the administration\u2019s policy on Ukraine. He reported to Fiona Hill, who in turn reported to John Bolton, Trump\u2019s then-National Security Adviser. A Ukrainian speaker, Vindman listened to the call from the White House Situation Room, along with other security officials and members of the vice president\u2019s staff.\n\nIs there any evidence that Vindman opposes Trump?\n\nNone has emerged. The White House has provided none, and several top Republicans have defended his integrity. The third ranking House Repulican Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., decried attacks on Vindman\u2019s motives.\n\n\"We're talking about decorated veterans who have served this nation, who have put their lives on the line,\" Cheney said Oct. 29. \"It is shameful to question their patriotism, their love of this nation, and we should not be involved in that process.\"\n\nVindman speaks Ukrainian because he was born there. After his mother died, his father left Kiev with him, his twin brother and an older brother. In 1979, they arrived in New York. Vindman was 4 years old. He and his twin went to college through the Reserve Officers Training Corps.\n\nVindman and his brother are career Army officers, and both rose to become lieutenant colonels.\n\nVindman served in South Korea, Germany and Iraq. In 2004, he was awarded the Purple Heart after being wounded by a roadside bomb.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Army, he has served for over 20 years. In addition to the Purple Heart, his medals include two Defense Meritorious Service awards, and an Army Commendation Medal \u2014 more than 10 in total.\n\n\"Since 2008, I have been a Foreign Area Officer specializing in Eurasia,\" Vindman said in his committee statement. \"In this role, I have served in the United States\u2019 embassies in Kiev, Ukraine and Moscow, Russia. In Washington, D.C., I was a politico-military affairs officer for Russia for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs where I authored the principle strategy for managing competition with Russia.\"\n\nHe said he has served both Democrats and Republicans in a \"nonpartisan manner.\"\n\nHow have Trump supporters tried to undermine Vindman?\n\nThe strongest criticism came on Fox News Oct. 28. Host Laura Ingraham used conversations between Vindman and Ukrainian officials to say he was \"advising Ukraine, apparently against the president\u2019s interests.\"\n\nIngraham\u2019s guest, John Yoo, the former White House lawyer who in 2003 gave the legal justification for torture during the Iraq War, said \"some people might call that espionage.\"\n\nOn \"Fox and Friends,\" host Brian Kilmeade said Oct. 29 \"he tends to feel simpatico with the Ukraine.\"\n\nFormer Republican congressman Sean Duffy said Oct. 29 on CNN, \"It seems very clear that he is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense. I don't know that he's concerned about American policy.\"\n\nIn short, Vindman\u2019s critics suggest that he is more interested in helping Ukraine than advancing American interests. But these arguments are speculative, and we found no objective evidence to support them.", "lang": "en"}
