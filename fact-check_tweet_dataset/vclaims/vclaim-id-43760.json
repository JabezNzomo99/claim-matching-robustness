No. That's not true. There have been no cases resembling this in recent years in the area, and this appears to be a hoax to scare people that has spread on social media.\n\nThe claim can be found in a post (archived here) where it was published on Facebook on November 9, 2019. It read:\n\nUsers on social media saw a picture like this:\n\n\n\nWhile sex trafficking is a large - and growing - problem in the United States and across the world, this post is just a rumor. It has been circulating since at least the November 2019 post. This specific meme was debunked by Snopes on December 11, 2019.

He assured us that no incidents even remotely similar to this have happened in Florence, across Northern Kentucky or in the Greater Cincinnati region.\n\nWe will update this story with information from hotlines that monitor sex-trafficking claims and crimes.", "lang": "en"}
