The concocted statement that 10 million COVID-19 cases in the country \u201cwill not be a loss\u201d even if 10,000 people die, was also being passed off as a post by the Manila Bulletin. \n\n\n\nBoth Roque and the national daily have denied making the statement and publishing the graphic.\n\nRoque debunked the claim in a virtual presser on Aug. 11, saying it was \u201cvery different\u201d from his statement. He reminded the public to get updates only from his official FB page or the FB page of his office.\n\nOn Aug. 8, Manila Bulletin\u2019s official FB page also said they \u201cnever published\u201d the graphic.\n\nThe spurious post first surfaced on Aug. 8, a day after Roque took note of news that the Philippines has become \u201cSoutheast Asia\u2019s COVID-19 hotspot,\u201d taking over Indonesia with more than 119,000 cases at the time. He said the higher numbers reflect the country\u2019s \u201cintensified\u201d testing capacity.\n\nA closer inspection shows the quote card is a manipulated version of an Aug. 7 FB post by the Bulletin, which quoted another statement by Roque about Indonesia. Manila Bulletin\u2019s original text was covered with black paint and replaced with the concocted quote.\n\nThe earliest traceable copy of the post was published by a netizen on Aug. 8, which has gained over 7,700 reactions, most of which are Angry FB reacts, and more than 11,000 shares. A look at the comments and captions in shares of the netizen\u2019s fake graphic shows many believed the fake quote to be true, and even cursed Roque for making such remarks.", "lang": "en"}
