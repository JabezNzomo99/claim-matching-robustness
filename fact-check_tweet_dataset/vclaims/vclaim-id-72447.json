Brown\u2019s death became a focus for both peaceful protests and rioting in Ferguson, and it attracted attention around the nation and the world. On Nov. 25, a grand jury decided not to indict, setting off a new wave of demonstrations.\n\nThe phrase \"every time he robs a store\" refers to surveillance footage showing Brown earlier that day robbing a store of cigarillos and assaulting a store employee. Supporters of Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot Brown, have said the robbery is an important piece of context in explaining Wilson\u2019s shooting of Brown.\n\nStill, the PolitiFact reader asked us whether the photo was real or manufactured, so we decided to take a look.\n\nThe version we received is cropped to focus on the African-American man holding the sign, with a partial view of a woman standing to his left. Other versions, such as one , include a fuller view of the woman, holding a sign that says, \"Shame on Ferguson Police,\" as well as another man, an African-American, holding a sign that says, \"We the People.\"\n\nThe starkly divergent messages of the three signs provide a clue that something is amiss. And indeed, something is amiss.\n\nIn the original photograph -- published on the Riverfront Times\u2019 on Oct. 1 -- the sign read, \"No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he leaves home\" (emphasis added). It also includes the hashtags #blacklivesmatter and #stayhuman.\n\nBut words on the sign were doctored by a of the social media site Imgur. Initially, the user posted this statement with the retouched photograph: \"The black community has every reason to be angry with the police, and the brutality they inflict. But making a martyr out of the kid that robbed a store and attacked a police officer is just mind boggling. Micheal (sic) Brown is one of the worst things to happen to race relations in a long time.\"\n\nAt some point after the doctored version of the image began , the user acknowledged that he had changed the picture: \"Edit: Yes, I shopped this. It captured mine, and many others, frustration with this whole situation.\"\n\nA photograph that went viral purports to show a protester in Ferguson, holding a sign that said, \"No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he robs a store.\" However, the photo was manipulated by a social media user, who later acknowledged the alteration. The change in wording turns the sign\u2019s message completely on its head, so we rate the claim Pants On Fire.", "lang": "en"}
