The images have been highlighted with red and blue circles to draw the viewer's attention to the PM's sandals.\n\nA caption accompanying the photographs in Hindi falsely claims the prime minister has insulted Hinduism by wearing sandals during the bhumi pujan ceremony.\n\n\n\nThe posts can be seen below and their archived versions are available here and here.\n\nThe false claim is viral on Twitter as well with the same set of images.\n\nAlso read: Former CJI Ranjan Gogoi Denies Reports Of Testing Positive For COVID-19\n\nBOOM found that the claim is false as the viral photos were taken before the ceremony.\n\n\n\nWe ran a reverse image search and found an article published by NDTV. The article reads: \"Before laying the foundation stone of the temple, PM Modi planted a Parijat sapling in the temple premises,\" where it clearly mentions in the premises of the yet to be built temple.\n\nMoreover, we traced the movement of the prime minister from his arrival at the temple site, prostrating before the makeshift Ram temple (as seen in the photo below) and till the end of the bhumi pujan - and found that he did not wear sandals during the religious event.\n\n\n\nBOOM compiled a series of screenshots from the live coverage of the ceremony. One can clearly see him wearing only socks and not sandals, as claimed by viral Facebook posts.\n\n\n\nTo watch the live coverage of the stone-laying ceremony, watch the video below.", "lang": "en"}
