The video has been misleadingly edited. Steyer is characterizing Trump\u2019s position, not his own.\n\n\u201cI agree with him on this, 100%. But why would anyone vote Democrat? We are setting all time records with the economy!\u201d Trump wrote early on January 15 in a comment accompanying the retweet, which has been \u201cliked\u201d more than 70,000 times.\n\nThe four-second clip that Trump retweeted was posted by Sarah Dolan Schneider, the executive director of the conservative America Rising PAC, the previous night.\n\nThe clip is cut to show billionaire California activist Steyer saying: \u201cDemocrats are gonna destroy the economy in 15 minutes if they get in control.\u201d\n\nHowever, Steyer\u2019s full quote, which can be viewed below starting at the 18:19 minute mark, makes clear that is not his position.\n\nIn the Iowa debate, Steyer said: \u201cWe know how Donald Trump is gonna run for president. He's gonna run on the economy. He's already told Americans last month in Florida, \u2018You don\u2019t like me, and I don\u2019t like you, but you\u2019re all gonna vote for me because the Democrats are gonna destroy the economy in 15 minutes if they get in control.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump has touted the state of the US economy as a key part of his bid for a second term in office, and Steyer said the Democrat who takes on the president in November will have to be able to speak to that point.\n\n\u201cWhoever is gonna beat Mr. Trump is gonna have to beat him on the economy, and I have the experience and the expertise to show that he\u2019s a fake there and a fraud,\u201d Steyer said.\n\nSteyer responded to Trump's tweet: \u201cRead the transcript. It's actually perfect. I said you're a fraud and a failure -- and I'll expose you\u201d -- a reference to the president frequently urging people to read the transcript of the phone call that sparked his impeachment by the US House of Representatives.", "lang": "en"}
