They were trying to bring visibility to what \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t want people to see,\u201d according to one user. That portrait is pictured below:\n\nOne social media user wrote: \u201cThe unveiling of the official portrait of former President Barack Obama at the White House has not taken place because President Trump refused to take part in the ceremony. Please share the portrait that Trump doesn\u2019t want people to see.\u201d\n\nBut the above-displayed image does not show Obama\u2019s official White House portrait. It is actually a painting by Dutch artist Edwin van den Dikkenberg and has no official connections to the White House or Obama.\n\nDikkenberg\u2019s painting first went viral in 2017. That was when it was again shared as if it were an official portrait of Obama. At the time, Dikkenberg told BuzzFeed News that he was excited his painting received so much attention, but confirmed that this was not Obama\u2019s official portrait:\n\nDikkenberg was also asked about why he chose to paint Obama in a tan suit, given that this suit color once caused considerable outrage among the president\u2019s critics. Dikkenberg said that he had to paint Obama from a photograph since he didn\u2019t have access to the president (again, this is not an official White House painting), and that he found the color of Obama\u2019s suit in his source image, blue, to be a bit boring. So he switched colors:\n\nAnother portrait of Obama was also shared on social media as if it were the portrait scheduled to be unveiled at the White House in 2020.\n\nThis painting of Obama was done by Kehinde Wiley and was unveiled at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Portrait Gallery in February 2018. While this an official portrait of Obama, it is not the official White House portrait that would have been unveiled at the White House ceremony in 2020.\n\nThe official White House portraits are commissioned by the White House Historical Association, and are distinct from the portraits hanging in the National Portrait Gallery. Official White House portraits are traditionally unveiled by the president\u2019s successor near the end of their first term, and end up displayed (or stored) at the White House.\n\nIt\u2019s been a White House tradition for decades: A first-term president hosts a ceremony in the East Room for the unveiling of the official portrait of his immediate predecessor that will hang in the halls of the White House for posterity. Official White House portraits are separate from the presidential portraits that hang in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, where the Obamas\u2019 were unveiled in February 2018. The process for the White House portraits begins near the end of a president\u2019s term or soon after, and it takes a few years to complete.\n\nFor context, here\u2019s a video from May 2012 of Obama unveiling the portraits of former President George Bush and first lady Laura Bush.", "lang": "en"}
