Only it\u2019s not much of a story.\n\nThe headline is dramatic: \"Congress files charges against Nancy Pelosi - she may have broken federal law with her speech rip.\"\n\nBut the five-sentence post offers no details about the allegation, saying only that \"it looks like Nancy Pelosi made a big mistake at the State of the Union \u2014 bigger than she could have expected.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe\u2019ve already debunked several claims about the speech. There\u2019s no evidence Pelosi planned to rip the speech at the start of the president\u2019s address, for example. Her actions weren\u2019t illegal. And she wasn\u2019t arrested for them.\n\nPelosi defended her behavior, saying in a press conference that she \"tore up a manifesto of mistruths.\"\n\n\"It was necessary to get the attention of the American people to say, \u2018This is not true. And this is how it affects you,\u2019\" she said.\n\nU.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., filed an ethics complaint against Pelosi for ripping up the speech, but we found no evidence that charges have been filed against her, as this blog claims.\n\nThe Feb. 25 blog post repeats claims that have already been debunked.\n\nWe rate it Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
