The minister claimed Australians had taken to renewables \u201cwith open arms\u201d and her government should be congratulated for its costed climate change policy. [1]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined Senator McKenzie\u2019s claim that every second person has solar panels on their roof.\n\nAccording to analysis from the government\u2019s Clean Energy Regulator, an independent statutory authority which operates under the environment portfolio, 20 per cent of Australian households had installed rooftop solar as of December 2018. [2]\n\nA December 2018 report from the Clean Energy Council (CEC), the peak clean energy industry body which represents 600 leading renewable energy businesses, stated 20.3 per cent of Australian households had solar panels. [3]\n\nTwenty per cent is one in five households, not \u201cevery second person\u201d as the minister stated.\n\nThe CEC report said South Australia and Queensland were the two leading states for the highest number with rooftop solar in Australia with around a one in three take-up. South Australia boasted 31 per cent of households while Queensland had 30 per cent. They were followed by Western Australia with 26 per cent, Victoria and NSW on 15 per cent, Tasmania with 14 per cent and the Northern Territory last on 13 per cent.
