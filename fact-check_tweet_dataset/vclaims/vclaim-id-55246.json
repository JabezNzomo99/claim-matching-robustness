This is regarding a shocking incident from Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh, wherein a khap panchayat ordered two Dalit sisters to be raped and paraded naked around the village.\n\nNetizens are sharing the image, claiming the incident took place under the Yogi Adityanath government. The clipping says the khap panchayat issued the order after the brother of the Dalit sisters eloped with a married woman from the Jat community.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the photo to be misleading. The incident was indeed reported in UP, but in 2015 when the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party was in power in the state.\n\nThe newspaper clipping is being widely shared on Facebook.\n\nWith the help of related keywords, we found several news articles from 2015 on the incident. As per Hindustan Times, the incident took place in August 2015.\n\nAt that time, the sisters had moved the Supreme Court seeking protection for themselves and their family. The court also issued a notice to UP Police, who were accused of not taking necessary action in the matter.\n\nHowever, another report by Hindustan Times says Jat leaders of the village have denied the allegation. Jats say that a khap panchayat was not even convened for the matter, leave alone issuing a decree. The report also said a Dalit and police have seconded the same.\n\nReplying to a query on Twitter, Baghpat police also clarified that the incident is from 2015.\n\nAFWA scanned the Internet thoroughly but could not find any such recent incident from UP. Therefore, it is clear that the viral clipping is five years old and the incident took place under the Akhilesh Yadav government in UP and not in the Yogi Adityanath regime.", "lang": "en"}
