However, it does not show him \u201ccaught on hot mic\u201d admitting that he just delivered a bunch of empty boxes to a health care facility. This video actually shows Pence making a humorous quip after delivering boxes that were truly filled with PPE.\n\nThe full video from C-Span shows Pence transporting several boxes from a truck to the door of the health care center. After unloading the boxes from his dolly, Pence returns to the truck to grab another round of boxes but is informed by someone that the remaining boxes are empty. Pence then jokes that he should carry one of the empty boxes for the cameras. The man replies with a quip of his own, saying that the empty ones are much easier to carry than the full ones, which draws laughter from the crowd. Pence then closes the van door.\n\nYou can see this exchange around the 9-minute mark of the following video from C-Span:\n\nWe reached out to the Woodbine Rehabilitation Center to confirm that it had received PPE from the vice president. While we have yet to receive a response, the facility did post a message on Facebook to thank Pence and his team:\n\nJon Thompson, a spokesperson for the vice president, called the claim that Pence was delivering empty boxes \u201cabsolute garbage\u201d in a tweet:", "lang": "en"}
