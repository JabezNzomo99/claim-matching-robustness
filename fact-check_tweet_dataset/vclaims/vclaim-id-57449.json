In reality, both administrations declared public health emergencies before the first reported deaths.\n\nWe\u2019ve previously dissected President Donald Trump\u2019s faulty comparisons between his response to the novel coronavirus pandemic and former President Barack Obama\u2019s handling of the H1N1 \u201cswine flu\u201d pandemic.\n\nBut misleading comparisons persist, and recent social media posts twist the facts about the timing of emergency declarations for the two outbreaks.\n\n\u201c[I]t took Obama \u2018millions infected and over 1,000 deaths\u2019 to declare the H1N1 flu a health emergency,\u201d read a March 29 meme on the verified page of Charlie Kirk, the founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA. But under Trump, \u201ccoronavirus was declared a health emergency and public safety measures were in place before a single U.S. death occurred.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s wrong. Both the Obama and Trump administrations declared public health emergencies before the first reported deaths relating to the novel coronavirus and H1N1.\n\nThe meme actually compares the point at which Trump declared a public health emergency and the point at which Obama issued a national emergency \u2014 two distinct processes. A spokesman for Turning Point USA acknowledged in an email that its \u201csocial media team confused the two different types of emergency declarations.\u201d\n\nA public health emergency, declared by the secretary of Department of Health and Human Services, gives the federal government and states certain flexibilities, such as temporarily reassigning personnel, to respond to a major health issue. A national emergency declared by the president is more substantial and can provide access to significant sums of federal money and resources.\n\nTurning Point USA deleted the image after our inquiry, but other posts of the same meme are still on Facebook, and the claim also migrated to Twitter (and back to Facebook).\n\nHere\u2019s an actual (albeit abridged) timeline for the emergency declarations for each pandemic.\n\u2022 The first U.S. infection of the novel type of influenza was identified in California on April 15, 2009.\n\u2022 On April 25, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern.\n\u2022 The next day, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency. (It was repeatedly renewed.)\n\u2022 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the first fatality from the outbreak days later, on April 29.\n\u2022 By Oct. 5, an H1N1 vaccine was ready and the first doses were given in the U.S.\n\u2022 Obama weeks later declared a national emergency on Oct. 24, 2009. The CDC director, Dr. Thomas Frieden, said at the time that millions of people had been infected in the U.S. and more than 1,000 had died.\n\u2022 The CDC confirmed the first case of the novel coronavirus in the U.S., in Washington state, on Jan. 21.\n\u2022 WHO declared a global public health emergency of international concern days later on Jan. 30.\n\u2022 The next day, on Jan. 31, HHS declared a public health emergency for the U.S. in response to the novel coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease.\n\u2022 Weeks later, on Feb. 29, the first U.S. death attributed to the virus was reported.\n\u2022 On March 13, Trump declared a national emergency. As of March 12, there had been 40 reported deaths in the U.S.\n\nIn addition to being wrong, the posts misleadingly suggest that while Trump took decisive action on the coronavirus outbreak and put \u201cpublic safety measures\u201d in place, Obama failed to do the same when it came to H1N1.\n\nAs we\u2019ve previously explained, the CDC began releasing antiviral drugs to treat the H1N1 flu on April 26, the same day of Obama\u2019s public health emergency declaration, and two days later the FDA approved a new CDC test for the disease. By April 30, Obama formally requested $1.5 billion from Congress to address the outbreak (the Obama administration later asked for nearly $9 billion). And a vaccine was made available in about six months.\n\nMore than 12,000 people are estimated to have died from H1N1 between April 2009 and April 2010, according to the CDC. There have been more than 3,400 deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the U.S. as of early March 31.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
