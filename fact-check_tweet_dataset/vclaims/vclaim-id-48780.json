Let\u2019s check the authenticity of the claim about the video. \n\n\n\nClaim: Video of Canada PM Justin Trudeau\u2019s wife pleading people to take COVID-19 seriously. Fact: The woman in the video is not Canada Prime Minister\u2019s wife (Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau). She is Tara Jane Langston, a waitress who contracted COVID-19 and undergoing treatment at Hillingdon Hospital in London. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s wife Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau was tested positive for Coronavirus and is in isolation since then.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were subjected to reverse image search, an article of \u2018Dailymail\u2019 was obtained in the search results. As per this article, the woman in the video is Tara Jane Langston, a waitress who contracted COVID-19 and is undergoing treatment at Hillingdon Hospital in London. She has filmed the video in an intensive care unit of the hospital pleading people to take COVID-19 seriously. Tara Jane Langston was admitted to the hospital on 15 March and was later diagnosed with COVID-19. Since then, she is undergoing treatment and is now recovering well.\n\nAlso, the same video is being falsely shared (archived post) as \u2018Rita Bachkaniwala.
