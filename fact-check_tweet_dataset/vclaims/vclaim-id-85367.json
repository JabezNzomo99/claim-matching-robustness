Let\u2019s look at several examples.\n\nWe assumed the coal miner was married, with two children, but the spouse did not work. Then we did a quick calculation using the H&R Block tax calculator.\n\nHow much of that went to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting? Less than a dollar.\n\nThe CPB is such a tiny part of federal outlays \u2014 less than 1/7,300th \u2014 that the machine operator paid about 20 cents of his taxes to the CPB, while the supervisor paid 60 cents.\n\n[Correction: Mea culpa, we messed up with the decimal point. An earlier version of this article said the miner paid a percentage of a penny, when in fact it is a percentage of a dollar.]\n\nThe biggest part of the federal budget is entitlement programs \u2014 especially Social Security and Medicare \u2014 but President Trump has pledged to leave those untouched. That\u2019s where the real money is, whereas programs like the CPB are a relative pittance.", "lang": "en"}
