That\u2019s the percentage of ninth-grade students who graduated within four years.\n\nBut the overall number of people enrolled in college declined for four straight years, from 2010 to 2014, and the latest rate of enrollment for 2015 is not a record, either.\n\nThe immediate college enrollment rate was 69.2 percent in 2015, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. That\u2019s down from a high of 70.1 percent in 2009, and only 0.6 percentage points higher than the 68.6 percent in 2008 before Obama took office.\n\nThe immediate college enrollment rate is defined as the percentage of those ages 16 to 24 who complete high school (including GED recipients) and enroll in two- or four-year colleges in the fall immediately following graduation.\n\nThe percentage of 18- to 24-year-olds enrolled in degree-granting colleges or universities also wasn\u2019t a record as of 2014.\n\nThat year, 40 percent of individuals in that age group were attending a two- or four-year college. However, the percentage was higher \u2014 42 percent \u2014 in 2011, and the 39.6 percent enrolled in 2008 was only 0.4 percentage points lower than the most recent enrollment rate.\n\nAt the fundraising event, Obama also commented on the improvement of the U.S. economy, which experts say has contributed to the decline in college enrollments.\n\n\u201cHistorically, as the economy improves and Americans get back to work, college enrollment declines,\u201d Under Secretary of Education Ted Mitchell told CNN Money in May.\n\nSo a record percentage of students are now graduating from high school on time, but the rate at which those same students are enrolling in college \u2014 even compared with 2008 \u2014 isn\u2019t quite record-breaking, nor has it improved much.", "lang": "en"}
