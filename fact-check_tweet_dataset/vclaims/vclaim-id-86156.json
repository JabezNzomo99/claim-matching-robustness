That right covers \u201call children here born of resident aliens, with the exceptions or qualifications (as old as the rule itself) of children of foreign sovereigns or their ministers, or born on foreign public ships, or of enemies within and during a hostile occupation of part of our territory, and with the single additional exception of children of members of the Indian tribes owing direct allegiance to their several tribes.\n\n\u201cThe 14th Amendment provides for birthright citizenship,\u201d Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said in a 2011 interview when he first ran for Senate. \u201cI\u2019ve looked at the legal arguments against it, and I will tell you, as a Supreme Court litigator, those arguments are not very good. As much as someone may dislike the policy of birthright citizenship, it\u2019s in the U.S. Constitution. And I don\u2019t like it when federal judges set aside the Constitution because their policy preferences are different. And so, my view: I think it\u2019s a mistake for conservatives to be focusing on trying to fight what the Constitution says on birthright citizenship. I think we are far better off focusing on securing the border.\u201d (Cruz had flip-flopped by 2015, and Trump took credit for it on Twitter.)", "lang": "en"}
