His office has further debunked the claim.\n\nFollowing the coronavirus pandemic and its related impact, President Addo Akufo-Addo in April announced a three-week partial lockdown of Accra and Kumasi associated with the closure of the country\u2019s borders and other entry points in a bid to stop the spread of the virus.\n\nHowever, on May 1, 2020, the president announced an extension of the border closure to May 31, 2020. Now, there is an indefinite closure of the country\u2019s borders to international and human traffic as a result of the persistent spread of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn his 14th address to the nation, President Akufo-Addo declared a further easing of COVID-19 induced restrictions indicating a path towards returning to normalcy in order to revive social and economic livelihood.\n\n\u201cLife cannot be put on hold indefinitely, and Ghana cannot remain in a never-ending crisis management situation. That is why we have been putting measures in place to gradually restore some normalcy in our social and economic lives, as we learn to cope with the reality of the virus,\u201d Mr Akufo-Addo noted.\n\nAlthough the president revealed that Ghana\u2019s borders will remain closed until further notice, a special dispensation was granted to Ghanaian nationals who seek to return home from abroad. Such persons will be made to undergo mandatory quarantine.\n\nThe newly-issued orders also allowed for re-opening of some tourist centres and open-air drinking spots as well as the easing of restrictions for domestic flights and transportation services.\n\nA Facebook post, however, claims the Minister for Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda, said the government is considering reopening borders next week.\n\nThe post also claimed that the Minister said this while speaking on Accra based radio station JoyFM.\n\nThe claim was posted on Facebook by a user; \u201cJM BA Kwadwo\u201d and has since been shared on other social media platforms.\n\nWhen contacted, the Public Relations Officer at the aviation ministry, Madeleine Insaidoo, said Minister Adda did not grant any interview or issued a press release announcing the reopening of the country\u2019s borders.\n\nMrs Insaidoo labelled the claim as false and urged the public to disregard it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be any reopening of borders as of yet as it has been claimed on Facebook and the minister [Joseph Kofi Adda] has not granted an interview to that effect either, so these claims that are going around are indeed false. We are going to issue a statement to that effect soon,\u201d she said.\n\nThe official Facebook account of the ministry of aviation later published a circular debunking the claims that Ghana\u2019s border entry points will be reopened next week.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry wishes to inform the general public that the above news item is false and that at no point in time, has Hon. Joseph Kofi Adda, Minister for Aviation, stated this in any interview or press release. So, it should be disregarded,\u201d the circular read.\n\nCONCLUSION: The Facebook post\u2019s claim should, therefore, be viewed as twisting of information to misinform the general public. We, therefore, find the claim to be false and urge people to disregard it.\n\nThe reporter produced this fact-check under the auspices of the Dubawa 2020 Fellowship in partnership with Ghanaweb to facilitate the ethos of \u201ctruth\u201d in journalism and to enhance media literacy in the country.", "lang": "en"}
