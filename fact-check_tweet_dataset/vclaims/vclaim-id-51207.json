On Nov. 22, Wiles dedicated an entire 97-minute episode on his online channel TruNews to what the episode billed as \u201cJew Coup: Seditious Jews Orchestrating Trump Impeachment Lynching.\u201d\n\nWiles has repeatedly indulged and promoted anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and tropes on his channel, as documented by the Anti-Defamation League. The president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., drew criticism in March for agreeing to be interviewed by TruNews, despite its record of promoting conspiracy theories and inflammatory misinformation, and the channel has been given access to White House press conferences, and been allowed to put questions to President Trump.\n\nIn his Nov. 22 episode, Wiles continued that pattern of anti-Semitic attacks on perceived opponents of Trump, hitting on virtually every age-old myth and trope about Jewish people and targeting named, individual members of Congress, deploying false, outrageous, and at times downright bizarre slurs against them.\n\nThe episode was removed by YouTube for violating its rules on hate speech, but as of Nov. 27, the video remained on the TruNews website and Facebook page, and was still available through iTunes as an audio-only podcast. This fact check contains, by necessity, virulently anti-Semitic language that some readers might find offensive.\n\nTowards the beginning of the episode, Wiles set out his thesis statement:\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Impeach Trump\u2019 movement is a Jew coup, plain and simple. The men and women who are the driving forces to remove Donald J. Trump from the White House are Jews. America is in the throes of a political coup led by Jews. President Trump is surrounded by a rabid pack of seditious, treacherous Jews who are intent on overthrowing the votes of millions of Christians who elected him in 2016.\u201d\n\nAt several points, Wiles used language that suggested civil war was inevitable in the United States, as a result of the fictional \u201cJew coup,\u201d and in one instance appeared to encourage a violent \u201cbacklash\u201d against a non-existent Jewish plan to \u201ckill millions of Christians.\u201d\n\nIn one instance, his co-host Doc Burkhart parsed a campaign ad by U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., suggesting that a reference in the ad to \u201call enemies, foreign and domestic\u201d (from the congressional oath of office) meant she was accusing Trump of being such a domestic enemy. Wiles shot back \u201cI consider these Jews to be domestic enemies! These are seditious, treacherous Jews who are undermining the president of the United States and pushing this country to civil war.\u201d\n\nHe later mused: \u201cThis country could be in civil war at Christmas time. Members of the U.S. military are going to have to take a stand, just like they did in the 1860s with the Civil War \u2026 People are going to be forced, possibly by this Christmas, to take a stand, because of this Jew coup in the United States. We have weeks to stop it.\u201d\n\nTowards the end of the broadcast, Wiles urged his viewers: \u201cThere is going to be a backlash. If there isn\u2019t a backlash, the country is over, you have been taken over by a Jewish cabal, a Bolshevik revolution \u2026 Get it through your head! They\u2019re coming for you! There will be a purge, that\u2019s the next thing that happens when Jews take over a country \u2014 they kill millions of Christians!\u201d\n\nWiles labeled Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a \u201clying, Jewish congressman,\u201d adding: \u201cThat\u2019s the way the Jews work. They are deceivers, they plot, they lie, they do whatever they have to do to accomplish their political agenda.\u201d\n\nWiles parroted Trump\u2019s epithet of choice for the influential chair of the House intelligence committee, calling him \u201cShifty Schiff\u201d and launching a bizarre, personal attack on him:\n\n\u201cHis eyes \u2014 he freaks me out, Doc, there\u2019s something wrong with that man. Seriously, mentally there\u2019s something mentally wrong with that man \u2026 He looks demon-possessed. Honestly, Adam Schiff looks like a mental psycho. He creeps me out.\u201d\n\nWiles then deployed yet another age-old calumny against Jewish people, implying that Schiff\u2019s true loyalties did not lie with the United States: \u201cAnd he\u2019s chairman of the House intelligence committee? Oh boy, I wonder how much intelligence is flowing to Israel.\u201d\n\nThe Florida-based pastor labeled Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union and a key witness in impeachment hearings, a \u201ctreacherous, lying, deceiving Jewish operative.\u201d On more than one occasion, Wiles likened Jews to animals and carriers of disease \u2014 a notorious, anti-Semitic rhetorical device that was used most damagingly during the rise to power of the Nazis in 1930s Germany.\n\nHe said the list of participants and witnesses involved in the Ukrainian controversy, which has been a key focus of impeachment hearings so far, was \u201cinfested with Jews\u201d (Congress is investigating whether Trump asked Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and family in exchange for military aid). Wiles also claimed that a group of \u201ctreacherous, seditious Jews\u201d were \u201csurrounding the president like a pack of wolves.\u201d He described Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, another key witness in the impeachment hearings and a Purple Heart recipient, as a \u201ctreacherous snake.\u201d\n\nThe depths of anti-Semitism to which the program sank was perhaps best summed up in a moment when Burkhart referred to the \u201cProtocols of the Elders of Zion,\u201d an early 20th century fabricated document that purported to be a record of a Jewish conspiracy for global domination, but was later definitively shown to be a hoax.\n\n\u201cProtocols\u201d is a quintessential example of deliberately inflammatory, anti-Semitic disinformation, and was widely deployed by the Nazis as propaganda in order to vindicate the annihilation of the Jewish people. Burkhart mused: \u201cSome say it\u2019s fake, I believe there\u2019s a lot of truth to it.\u201d Wiles added: \u201cWhoever wrote it back in the 1800s, they accurately predicted what was going to happen in the world.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
