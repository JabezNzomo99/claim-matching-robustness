She apparently meant to say \u201cevery undocumented immigrant.\u201d Now, regular readers know that we don\u2019t like to play gotcha here at The Fact Checker, so ordinarily that might be the end of it. But take a look at this tweet issued under Clinton\u2019s name on Aug. 25:\n\nThe tweet says that \u201cin 2015, Trump launched his own campaign for president by describing Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals.\u201d The accompanying video, which starts by saying \u201cDonald Trump built his candidacy on demonizing immigrants,\u201d has various clips of tough talk from Trump, mainly about illegal immigrants. Then the video ends with this warning: \u201cTrump has made his plans for immigrants and their families clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States has become a dumping ground for Mexico and, in fact, for many other parts of the world. On the other hand, many fabulous people come in from Mexico, and our country is better for it. But these people are here legally and are severely hurt by those coming in illegally. I am proud to say that I know many hardworking Mexicans \u2014 many of them are working for and with me\u2026and, just like our country, my organization is better for it.\u201d\n\nThe Wall. Trump told The Washington Post in April that he would force Mexico to pay for the wall (which could cost as much as $25 billion) by threatening to cut off the flow of billions of dollars in payments that immigrants send back to the country. Mexican immigrants make up 28 percent of 42 million foreign-born population in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute. At the time, Trump said the threat would be withdrawn if Mexico made a $5 billion to $10 billion payment to the United States to help fund the wall.\n\nBirthright citizenship. Trump not only has said that he believes it is wrong for the children of illegal immigrants to automatically receive citizenship if they are born in the United States (\u201canchor babies\u201d) but in interviews in August 2015, he also indicated that he would seek to deport children of illegal immigrants who are U.S. citizens by virtue of their birth. In his words, he would \u201ctest it out in the courts\u201d because he thought he could make a case that \u201cthey do not have American citizenship.\u201d (He said he might make an exception if a child had parents who are \u201cvery bad people.\u201d) In theory, that could affect about 4.5 million people born in the United States to parents who were undocumented immigrants. But most scholars believe any change in birthright citizenship would require a constitutional amendment.\n\nDACA. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals is an Obama administration policy that allows qualified undocumented immigrants who entered the country before their 16th birthday and before June 2007 to receive a renewable two-year work permit and exemption from deportation. More than 650,000 applications have been approved, and presumably these people would be subject to deportation under a Trump presidency. Of course, some might argue that these individuals do not fall under the category of \u201cimmigrants.\u201d But the Clinton campaign says that people approved under DACA now have documents.\n\nThe tweet was accompanied by a video that included clips of Trump speaking about deporting undocumented immigrants, ending birthright citizenship and building a wall along the border of Mexico. A campaign official said that the \u201cmillions of immigrants\u201d referred mostly to undocumented immigrants, but he also pointed to Trump\u2019s plan to revoke DACA as something that would affect people who currently have legal documents.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign has been centered on the threat that he claims is posed by illegal immigrants. His announcement speech was interpreted as an attack on Mexican immigrants, but he eventually clarified that he was talking about undocumented immigrants. His plan for a wall on the border, his denial of birthright citizenship and his pledge to rescind DACA are all part of his proposed efforts to thwart illegal immigration.\n\nStill, the Clinton campaign is using slippery language to suggest that Trump\u2019s attacks on illegal immigrants are actually a broader assault on all immigrants. If Clinton misspoke, she did so in a way that conveniently mirrored her campaign\u2019s video. The video itself stretches the truth, leaving the impression that Trump is broadly attacking even legal immigrants. It\u2019s quite possible that the Clinton campaign does not want to appear as if it is endorsing illegal immigration. But it goes too far in claiming that Trump\u2019s \u201cplans for immigrants\u201d are clear.", "lang": "en"}
