It is being claimed that the video was shot inside an Air India flight from Chicago-Delhi, where passengers were charged three times for one seat to maintain social distancing but the flight was packed and no seat was left idle.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim with the viral video is misleading. The video has been shot inside a Karachi-Toronto flight of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and not Chicago-Delhi bound Air India flight.\n\nThe archived versions of the posts can be seen here.\n\nIn the viral video, some of the passengers can be seen arguing with flight pursers for not maintaining social distancing. They claimed that at the time of booking the tickets, they were assured that the seats next to them would remain vacant but the airline packed the flight.\n\nAccording to media reports published on April 29, this incident took place inside the Karachi-Toronto flight of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA).\n\nWe also found similarities in the interior of the PIA flight and the interior of the flight shown in the viral video.\n\nPIB also tweeted clarifying that the flight in the viral video is from a neighbouring country's airline.\n\nAccording to the latest data available, the total positive cases reported in Pakistan have crossed the 25,500 mark with 594 deaths.\n\nHence, it is clear that the viral video has nothing to do with Air India and is from Pakistan.", "lang": "en"}
