Then it shows a clip from a 2010 McCain campaign ad \u2014 he says, \u201cComplete the danged fence\u201d \u2014 that indicated his commitment to border security over legalizing immigrants. Then it shows that McCain again supports \u201clegalization process, especially with the so-called dreamers,\u201d in 2016 \u2014 and argues that McCain has been \u201con every side of immigration.\u201d\n\nHost John King: I would expect the president tonight, I\u2019m told, to say that maybe we can bring back the Dream Act, which would help illegal immigrants who came into this country at a very young age, if they join the military, if they\u2019re on the college track, that they could be granted a path to citizenship. You would not work with the president on that in the lame-duck session. The White House would very much like your help. Can they get it? McCain: If we secure the borders and we can secure the borders. We have not secured our borders. If we don\u2019t have secure borders, John, then five, 10, 15 years from now we\u2019re dealing with another group of young Americans who were brought here illegally by their parents. So it\u2019s foolish to move forward with something like the Dream Act until we get the borders secured, and we can. And with people and surveillance and with fences, we can do it.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s tried a lot of different ways to get this legislation [the Dream Act] passed \u2014 a lot. Being a legislator, that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got to do. You have to get creative, you have to respond to the political realities of the time,\u201d a McCain spokesman said. \u201cHe consistently has been supportive of the idea of giving children that were brought here by their parents a pathway to citizenship \u2014 throughout his entire career. At different points, there were different ways that that could be politically achieved. But he\u2019s never shied away from that.\u201d\n\nThe ad uses two clips from 2008 and 2011 to show that McCain had supported the Dream Act in 2008, then opposed in 2011. By using McCain\u2019s words \u2014 \u201cYes, yes\u201d in 2008 and \u201cit\u2019s foolish to move forward\u201d in 2011 \u2014 the ad makes it seem as though McCain clearly flip-flopped within three years. But using these snippets lack context and do not show that both times, McCain said that his support for the Dream Act is conditional upon border security.\n\nIn 2008, he did tell a questioner that he would support the Dream Act being passed \u2014 but he added the caveat that he also supports strong border-security laws. He did oppose the Dream Act in 2010, when he thought it would not pass without a border-security component. But McCain continued to show that he is open to pursuing further reform measures \u2014 such as providing a pathway to legalization for dreamers \u2014 down the line.", "lang": "en"}
