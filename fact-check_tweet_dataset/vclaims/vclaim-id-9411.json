We sit down, y\u2019all mad. We speak up, y\u2019all mad. We die, y\u2019all silent.\"\n\nThe post is ubiquitous on Facebook posts from across the country. The same goes for Twitter, where one tweet that used the photo was liked 291,000 times as of this writing.\n\nBut the image is fake. James wasn\u2019t wearing that shirt in that photo (although you can buy it from scads of online retailers).\n\nHe actually was wearing a completely different tee with a message about social injustice.\n\nThe photo was from warmups for James\u2019 Dec. 8, 2014, game in Brooklyn. His teammate Kyrie Irving also wore the shirt, as did four members of the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nThis Icon Sportswire photo from Dec. 8, 2014, had been altered and posted on the Internet.\n\nThe players wore the shirts to pay tribute to 43-year-old Eric Garner, a black man who died while being choked by a New York police officer on Staten Island. His last words, \"I can\u2019t breathe,\" became a slogan at protests across the country.\n\n\"I've been quoted over and over about what's going on as far as it's more of a notion to the family, more than anything. Obviously, as a society we have to do better. We have to be better for one another,\" James said in 2014. \"It doesn't matter what race you are. It's more of a shout out to the family more than anything, because they're the ones that should be getting all the energy and effort.\"\n\nMore recently, James chided President Donald Trump, who lashed out at the Golden State Warriors\u2019 Stephen Curry for refusing to visit the White House with his championship team. James called Trump a \"bum\"on Twitter and later added that Trump \"doesn't understand the power that he has\" as president.\n\nThe older photo of James has been altered to make it look like he was wearing something he wasn\u2019t. That earns this photo of a shirt a False.", "lang": "en"}
