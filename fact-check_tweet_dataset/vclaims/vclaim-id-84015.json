The scheme was to run for over 100 days and Union ministers Arun Jaitley and Ravi Shankar Prasad inaugurated the first draw of lots in Delhi on December 25, 2017. A website (digidhanlucky.mygov.in) was created so that consumers and merchants could check if they are the lucky winners by inputting their mobile numbers and an OTP code.\n\nHowever, the website of Lucky Grahak Yojana and Digi-\u0927\u0928 Vyapar Yojana (https://digidhanlucky.mygov.in/) has been down for over 40 hours since Alt News started monitoring it and continues to be non-functional. We used uptimerobot.com, a service that monitors the uptime status of various websites, and the monitor setup for digidhanlucky.mygov.in shows that the website has been down for over 40 hours since the time we setup the monitor.\n\nCoincidentally, PM Modi in his Mann Ki Baat monologue today encouraged those who won prizes in Lucky Grahak Yojana and Digi-\u0927\u0928 Vyapar Yojana to become ambassadors of these schemes.\n\nDoesn\u2019t the Govt utilise basic services such as the aforementioned uptimerobot to monitor the status of their websites? How does a website go down for over 40 hours without anyone in the Government noticing it? Digital India?", "lang": "en"}
