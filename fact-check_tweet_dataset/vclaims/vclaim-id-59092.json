That\u2019s in spite of widespread mitigation efforts to reduce the spread. So how deadly is it?\n\nEstimating the lethality of COVID-19 has been a key question for epidemiologists. In the middle of a pandemic, moving targets make the death rate difficult to pin down.\n\nBut experts told us Carlson\u2019s statement is off-track. Many early mortality estimates were based on official counts of confirmed cases, but epidemiologists were consistent in saying those raw numbers didn\u2019t reflect the virus\u2019s deadliness with complete precision.\n\nThe numbers can be confusing\n\nIdeally, epidemiologists could divide the number of deaths by the number of infections to calculate what\u2019s known as the \"infection fatality rate.\" But there\u2019s no way to get a complete count of the number of infected individuals, largely because so many mild cases go unreported.\n\nJeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, said there could be as many as 12.5 COVID-19 infections for every confirmed case in the U.S.\n\nStill, scientists work with the data they have, even if it\u2019s evolving and varies with patient demographics and location. Some of the first widely reported death rates were what are called \"case fatality rates,\" which are calculated by dividing the number of known deaths by the number of reported cases.\n\nOn March 3, for example, the World Health Organization announced that 3.4% of confirmed coronavirus patients around the world had died \u2014 a case fatality rate.\n\nExperts told us at the time that the 3.4% was only a snapshot, and one that likely undercounted people with mild symptoms. A WHO spokesperson said it would \"change over time.\"\n\nThe global case fatality rate has actually risen since then. As of May 3, the WHO had tallied 3,349,786 confirmed cases worldwide and 238,628 deaths, for a case fatality rate of about 7%.\n\nNow, tests for antibodies in the blood of people exposed to the coronavirus are offering the first glimpses at what the infection fatality rate could be in states such as New York and California.\n\nThe tests haven\u2019t all been as accurate as many experts would like, and the studies of them haven\u2019t all been peer-reviewed. \"It remains very clear that we do not know the precise mortality of COVID-19 infection,\" said the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\u2019s Myron Cohen.\n\nBut their preliminary results suggested the infection fatality rate may be below 1%, handing fodder to some who say the COVID-19 threat is overblown.\n\nCarlson said the new information shows COVID-19 is less deadly than expected.\n\nOn his show, he cited widely disputed findings from two California doctors. A Fox News spokesperson also pointed to a White House press conference, a JP Morgan chart, and recent antibody studies in California and New York to support it.\n\nBut Shaman, the epidemiologist, said Carlson was \"cherry-picking evidence.\"\n\nMany early figures were case fatality rates, while the estimates reported as a result of recent antibody studies are infection fatality rates. They shouldn\u2019t be conflated, Shaman said.\n\nSeemingly small infection fatality rates can also cause mounting deaths. The New York study showed the state\u2019s infection fatality rate to be around 0.5%, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.\n\nThat matches estimates from a model Shaman constructed, which he said put the U.S. infection fatality rate at 0.56%. But in a worst-case scenario where 70% of Americans are infected, a 0.5% rate could amount to 1.2 million U.S. deaths, Shaman said.\n\nAnd as we\u2019ve reported, the death toll may be higher than we know.\n\nThe infection fatality rate for the flu, which kills thousands of Americans annually, hovers under 0.1% and is calculated annually using a mathematical model that estimates the disease burden.\n\nThere are other problems with Carlson\u2019s sources, including the clip he played of one of two California physicians who gained national attention for calling to end the shutdowns.\n\nThe doctors, who own an urgent care clinic, used the infection rate among patients tested at their clinic to extrapolate to the entire state and put the death rate at a tiny 0.03%.\n\nThe University of Washington\u2019s Carl Bergstrom wrote on Twitter that this amounts to \"sampling bias\" because patients at an urgent care clinic likely think they\u2019re sick. The doctors\u2019 calculations are like \"estimating the average height of Americans from the players on an NBA court,\" he said.\n\nThe video was \"emphatically condemn(ed)\" by the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine; it was also removed from YouTube.\n\nAnother report cited by the Fox News spokesperson, from the University of Southern California, followed a controversial study from Stanford University.\n\nA number of experts have since warned that both studies used antibody tests known to yield false positive results. (A USC spokesperson said results were adjusted to account for that.)\n\nMany epidemiologists said the infection fatality rate would be lower\n\nCarlson\u2019s claim that COVID-19 was projected to be deadlier for infected patients also discounts what many experts said months ago.\n\n\"No one knowledgeable thought it was as deadly as known deaths divided by known cases,\" said Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\n\"Every responsible epidemiologist has been saying that the number of cases is certainly more than those we know about, especially in the U.S., where testing has been inadequate.\"\n\nMany experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said preliminary case fatality rates could be inflated. The WHO said early on, including in mid- February, that the infection fatality rate would be lower than the initial case fatality rates.\n\nThe Imperial College of London, which projected in March that the U.S. could see 2.2 million deaths if it had no response, estimated that 0.9% of infected COVID-19 patients would die.\n\n\"It is surprisingly mild only to those who were not listening to competent epidemiologists, and it is in fact considerably worse than seasonal flu,\" Lipsitch said.\n\nCarlson said the coronavirus \"just isn\u2019t nearly as deadly as we thought it was.\"\n\nScientists warned early in the outbreak that the raw number of confirmed cases didn\u2019t give a fully accurate picture of mortality.\n\nIt\u2019s misleading for Carlson to compare early case fatality rates \u2014 which divide the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases \u2014 with newer estimates of the infection fatality rate. The infection fatality rate should be lower, as experts have said for months.\n\nIt\u2019s premature to say as a matter of fact that a far rosier picture has emerged.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
