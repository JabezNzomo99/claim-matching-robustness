Among them was Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity, who played a tape of Clinton vigorously shaking her head in a manner he deemed \u201cseizure-esque\u201d (although neither of the medical experts on his program agreed).\n\nThe doctored documents play off Clinton\u2019s very real concussion in December 2012 \u2014 which caused her to suffer double vision for nearly two months starting in late 2012. But her longtime physician, Lisa Bardack, director of internal medicine, Mount Sinai Health System at CareMount Medical, says follow-up medical exams in 2013 \u201crevealed complete resolution of the effects of the concussion.\u201d\n\nThe fake documents, dated Feb. 5, 2014, which appear to have originated from a since-deleted Twitter account, purport to come from Dr. Bardack. But her title is wrong on the letterhead.\n\nThe letter purports to indicate that Clinton suffered complications from a 2012 concussion including \u201cblacking out,\u201d \u201cuncontrollable twitching\u201d and \u201cmemory loss.\u201d It says Clinton has previously been diagnosed as having \u201cComplex Partial Seizures\u201d and \u201cearly-onset Subcortical Vascular Dementia.\u201d The images were shared and discussed on numerous websites and in social media. But again, we can\u2019t stress this enough: It\u2019s a fake document.\n\nThe same Twitter user later posted what was purported to be a magnetic resonance angiogram of Clinton\u2019s brain showing a significant \u201cabnormality\u201d in the brain tissue. This is also a bogus image.\n\nIn a statement provided to FactCheck.org by the Clinton campaign, Bardack dismissed the authenticity of these documents, saying they are \u201cfalse, were not written by me and are not based on any medical facts.\u201d\n\nBardack, who has served as Clinton\u2019s personal physician since 2001, did publicly release a summary of Clinton\u2019s health history and a medical evaluation in a letter dated July 28, 2015. It paints a much different picture than the fake documents.\n\nAccording to Bardack\u2019s letter, Clinton \u201cis a healthy 67-year-old female whose current medical conditions include hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies.\u201d\n\nThe letter discusses Clinton\u2019s concussion \u2014 well-documented in the media at the time \u2014 and some of the lingering effects she suffered from it. As the New York Times noted in December 2012, Clinton suffered a concussion after fainting and striking her head. Bardack\u2019s letter said Clinton suffered a stomach virus after traveling, and became dehydrated, which caused her to faint.\n\nHere\u2019s Clinton in those much-discussed glasses, which her aide acknowledged at the time was \u201cbecause of lingering issues stemming from her concussion.\u201d\n\nBardack said Clinton\u2019s symptoms, including the double vision, went away within two months.\n\nBardack said Clinton\u2019s most recent physical examination on March 21, 2015, \u201crevealed a healthy-appearing female.\u201d Bardack said Clinton has a healthy diet and exercises regularly, including yoga, swimming, walking and weight training.\n\nDespite the public release of Bardack\u2019s medical evaluation, some conservative pundits have questioned Clinton\u2019s health and ability to serve as president.\n\nOn Fox News, Sean Hannity repeatedly speculated about serious health issues for Clinton. Hannity showed clips of Clinton in the midst of a coughing fit in February, stumbling while boarding a plane in 2011, and dramatically shaking her head during a press scrum in June (which Hannity said \u201calmost looks seizure-esque to me\u201d). Never mind that two medical experts on the program said the video did not appear to show seizures, though both called for a disclosure of medical records for both presidential candidates.\n\nHannity, Aug. 10: That last one in particular is so odd to me. What was your take? Dr. Fiona Gupta, neurologist, North Shore Brain and Spine Center: You know, it\u2019s just so hard to speculate based on snippets of the clips that, you know, what is going on without having a full examination and workup. Hannity: Look at this video right here. Watch her reaction, because I\u2019m not \u2014 it almost seems seizure-esque to me. Gupta: There are different types of seizures, local seizures that sometimes can cause just one body part, but it would be very rare. I mean, typically seizures will generalize, so I can\u2019t say that\u2019s a seizure. Hannity: Aren\u2019t there many seizures like that, Dr. Siegel? Dr. Marc Siegel, Fox News medical contributor: I\u2019m not a neurologist, and I don\u2019t think that necessarily looks like a seizure, but I will say this \u2026\n\nAn Associated Press reporter who was among those shouting questions to Clinton during the press scrum inside a muffin shop called it an \u201cinnocuous exchange\u201d that has \u201cbecome the fodder for one of some Trump supporters\u2019 most popular conspiracy theories: her failing health.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps eager to avoid answering or maybe just taken aback by our volume, Clinton responded with an exaggerated motion, shaking her head vigorously for a few seconds,\u201d AP reporter Lisa Lerer later wrote. \u201cVideo of the moment shows me holding out my recorder in front of her, laughing and stepping back in surprise. After the exchange, she took a few more photos, exited the shop and greeted supporters waiting outside.\u201d\n\nAn opinion writer for Newsweek, who has epilepsy, wrote that Clinton\u2019s movements looked \u201cnothing like\u201d a seizure. The writer called Hannity\u2019s speculation degrading to people with epilepsy, and he demanded an apology.\n\nBut Hannity isn\u2019t the only one questioning Clinton\u2019s physical fitness to be president. Though he was vague, Clinton\u2019s Republican opponent, Donald Trump, said in a speech on foreign policy on Aug. 15 that Clinton \u201clacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS, and all of the many adversaries we face \u2013 not only in terrorism, but in trade and every other challenge we must confront to turn our great country around.\u201d\n\nNeither Trump nor Hannity referenced the fake medical documents purporting to be from Dr. Bardack. But their baseless speculation is also refuted by the public statements and medical evaluation released by Clinton\u2019s longtime doctor.", "lang": "en"}
