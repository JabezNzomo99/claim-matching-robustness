The image is being used in a misleading context; it was actually taken in August 2018 and shows an unrelated incident.\n\nMultiple Facebook posts, for example this one \u2013 published June 13, 2019, and shared more than 4,600 times since \u2013 contain the photo, which shows a sinking boat with people clinging on to plastic containers floating in the water around it.\n\nWhen translated, the post\u2019s caption, written in a mixture of Tagalog and English, says:\n\n\u201cTHIS IS HOW SHAMELESS THE CHINESE ARE after their ship hit the small fishing vessel of the Filipinos they left them as if nothing happened. Thanks to our Vietnamese friends who helped the Filipino fishermen.\n\n\u201cUPDATE: The crew of the Filipino vessel that sank after being hit by a Chinese fishing vessel in Recto Bank were sleeping when the incident happened over the weekend, according to a relative of the Filipino boat's captain.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe caption is referring to to a collision that took place in the South China Sea on June 9, 2019, in which a Chinese trawler hit a Filipino fishing boat.\n\nAfter the crash, the Chinese boat sailed away without rescuing the Filipino crew, who were eventually picked up by a Vietnamese boat. Here is an AFP report about the incident.\n\nThe same photo was also shared elsewhere on Facebook with a similar claim, for example here and here.\n\nBut the photo in the posts does not show the aftermath of the June 9, 2019 collision.\n\nA reverse image search on Google traced the photo back to this August 2018 report on local news site Sunstar.com, dated August 3, 2018.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo as it appears in the report:\n\nThe report is about the Philippine Navy\u2019s rescue of 37 Filipino fishermen from a sinking boat found in the waters off the island of Palawan.\n\nIt does not mention China and includes this paragraph about the cause of the incident:\n\n\u201cAccording to the rescued fishermen, they departed Occidental Mindoro on July 31 but their boat was battered by strong winds and big waves in the early morning of August 2, resulting in the mishap.\u201d\n\nThe photo in the report is credited to the Philippine Navy. A search of one of the navy\u2019s Facebook pages found this post about the rescue that contains the same image.\n\nThe Navy Facebook post, dated August 3, 2018, is embedded below:\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading post (L) and the photo from the Philippine Navy\u2019s Facebook account (R):", "lang": "en"}
