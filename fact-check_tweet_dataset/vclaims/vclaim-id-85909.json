Rand Paul\u2019s remarks on the Social Security disability insurance (DI) program \u2014 that \u201cover half of the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurt\u201d \u2014 but it\u2019s an important issue that will have a central role in the political debates this year as the program faces a serious funding crunch. If Congress does not act soon to fix the program\u2019s financing, then the disability insurance trust fund will be depleted by 2016 and benefits would be cut 19 percent.\n\nAs can be seen from Paul\u2019s comments, he was being a bit jocular but he also framed his answer as a legitimate statistic that indicated there were many \u201cmalingerers\u201d who are \u201ctaking money\u201d from more deserving individuals. So what do the data show?\n\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA) runs the disability program, which is financed through a portion of the 12.4-percent Social Security payroll tax effectively deducted from the paychecks of nearly every worker. (Technically, half is deducted from paychecks but economists say the employer takes its share out of the employee\u2019s pay.) As noted in The Fact Checker\u2019s Guide to Social Security, disability insurance is an integral part of Social Security; about 18.5 percent of Social Security beneficiaries are disabled workers and dependents.\n\nBetween 1980 and 2010, the number of disabled worker beneficiaries rose 187 percent. The reasons for the sudden rise in costs are complex, but the Social Security Chief Actuary Stephen C. Goss says a key factor is that the baby boom generation is aging and suddenly passing through the period of life (45-64) when disability spikes. In other words, the main part of Social Security will face financial stress when the baby boomers retire \u2014 and the disability crisis is a harbinger.\n\nAnother factor is that women began working in greater numbers and thus began to qualify more often for disability insurance, though that trend was mitigated by the fact that the undocumented population also grew substantially in this period \u2014 and illegal immigrants don\u2019t qualify for coverage. The Great Recession, like all economic downturns, also boosted the number of beneficiaries.\n\nSo a large part of the increase in beneficiaries stems from demographic factors, not more people scamming the system. The Government Accountability Office, in a 2013 report on the $128 billion program, documented $1.29 billion in potential overpayments to 36,000 people in 2011 \u2013 but these were people who were working and had earnings in excess of $1,000 a month. So it\u2019s hard to call them \u201cmalingerers.\u201d The number of people who received overpayments represented just 0.4 percent of beneficiaries, GAO said.\n\nIndeed, it is not easy to qualify for disability. According to SSA, between 2003 and 2012, only 24 percent of disability applicants were initially granted benefits; an average of two and 11 percent were awarded benefits after either reconsideration or a hearing, respectively. Thus an average of 59 percent of applicants were denied benefits, even after appeals. This chart shows the trend over the ten-year period:\n\nPaul spokesman Brian Darling pointed to two data points \u2014 27.7 percent of disabled beneficiaries are diagnosed as having ailments related to \u201cMusculoskeletal system and connective tissue\u201d and that 14 percent have \u201cmood disorders.\u201d That adds up to 42 percent, he noted. (There\u2019s also nearly 4 percent who cite injuries, which presumably could cover back injuries.)\n\nBut William Jarrett, an SSA spokesman, says that anxiety disorders is covered in the \u201cother\u201d category, not under \u201cmood disorders.\u201d The \u201cother\u201d category is just 3.8 percent of beneficiaries; Jarrett said there was no further breakdown. Under the SSA\u2019s definition, anxiety-related disorders is more than just being \u201canxious for work,\u201d as Paul put it, but includes \u201crecurrent and intrusive recollections of a traumatic experience\u201d and \u201crecurrent severe panic attacks.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s another problem\u2014the SSA definition for musculoskeletal category covers far more than back pain, such amputations, all sorts of fractures, burns and spine disorders. So it\u2019s a bit silly to assume that \u201cback pain\u201d is all of those cases. (A 2013 study by Mathematica Policy Research suggests 18.8 percent of DI-only recipients reported back disorders as a primary impairment; \u201canxiety disorders\u201d represented 3.2 percent of claims. That adds up to 22 percent.)\n\n\u201cIt should be factored into any analysis that this was a spontaneous response to a question from a New Hampshire resident at an event \u2014 not prepared remarks,\u201d Darling said. \u201cSenator Paul never said that people who had back problems and mood disorders are not deserving of help. He never indicated that 50 percent of claims were fraudulent.\u201d\n\nBut not only is the rate of fraud relatively low, but it mostly involves people who are working who should not be getting payments, rather than people who are getting paid and not working. Moreover, even a generous interpretation of the data does not generate a figure close to more than half of beneficiaries getting paid for simply back pain and anxiety.", "lang": "en"}
