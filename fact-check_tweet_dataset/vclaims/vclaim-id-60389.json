This claim is false; the photo has circulated in blogs about Thai military training since 2016.\n\nThe photo was published in this Facebook post on June 20, 2020. It has been shared hundreds of times since.\n\nThe caption of the Facebook post states, in part: \u201cHe was also in that face-off of Galwan Valley. He said there were 300\u2013400 men from India and 2000\u20132500 people from China. They did not know how the Chinese got in their circle. He said those people had rods, poles and stones with which they attacked\u201d.\n\nRenewed tensions between China and India at Galwan Valley near India-administered Ladakh led to a deadly clash that killed at least 20 Indian soldiers on June 15. The confrontation marked the first deadly incident in a long-running border dispute between the two Asian nuclear powers in nearly half a century, as reported by AFP here.\n\nThe photo was also shared alongside a similar claim here and here on Facebook, and here on Twitter.\n\nHowever, the claim is false; this photo has circulated online since 2016 on Thai-language blogs.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the photo published here on a Thai blog in 2016. The photo was described as showing a training session for a special combat unit in the Thai army.\n\nOne of the other photographs published in the same blog post has a May 2011 date stamp.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo in the misleading post in the 2016 Thai blog post:\n\n\n\nThe photo was also shared here in 2016 on another Thai-language blog alongside descriptions that say it was taken during a Thai military exercise.", "lang": "en"}
