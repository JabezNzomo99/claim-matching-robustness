A short biography of the author, Andy Borowitz, notes that his report is a \u201csatirical column on the news.\u201d And a tag beneath each story again labels it as satire. He is a well-known satirist.\n\nNevertheless, an invented quote attributed to President Donald Trump that appeared in a recent Borowitz piece has surfaced in a number of popular Facebook posts, and on Twitter, that present the comment as real.\n\n\u201cI can do my job without any intelligence whatsoever,\u201d the made-up quote reads.\n\nThe Facebook posts in question not only share it without context or a disclaimer, but erroneously claim that it\u2019s \u201chis actual quote.\u201d It\u2019s not.\n\nThough Trump has at times taken issue with, or offered mixed messages on, the findings of the U.S. intelligence community, he has not \u201cstopped taking intelligence briefings,\u201d as the Facebook posts claim. That part was also included in the Borowitz column.\n\nThe president\u2019s private schedules from November 2018 through January 2019, recently obtained by Axios and confirmed by White House officials, show frequent half-hour intelligence briefings were scheduled.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nBorowitz, Andy. \u201cTrump Comes Out Strongly Against Intelligence.\u201d The New Yorker. 30 Jan 2019.\n\nTrump, Donald (@realDonaldTrump). \u201cThe Intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran.
