If that sounds just a little too crazy to be true you would be right, the story comes from a satirical website.\n\nIt was published on March 27, 2018 by The Daily Mash under the headline \"Trump expels 60 Russian porn stars\" (archived here). The spoof opened:\n\nDONALD Trump has expelled 60 top Russian adult movie stars from the US in response to the Stormy Daniels TV interview. The White House confirmed the move saying that Trump had hand-picked the actors to be repatriated from a list that just happened to be on his computer.\n\nThe article as it would be visible on social media was clearly a spoof on the real news that Trump expelled 60 Russian diplomats over a nerve gas attack in the U.K.\n\nWe wrote about thedailymash.co.uk and their satirical articles before, here is an overview of our earlier coverage:\n\u2022 Hoax Alert: Beyonce DID NOT Announce Collaboration With Greggs\n\u2022 Hoax Alert: Women NOT Paid Less Because They're Smaller\n\u2022 'Dry January' Campaign Over In U.K., Beginning Of 'Wet February'?\n\nThe Daily Mash is a satirical website from the U.K. which sports following disclaimer on its about page:\n\nThe Daily Mash is a satirical website which publishes spoof articles, i.e. it is all made-up and is not intended, in any way whatsoever, to be taken as factual. Glad we've got that sorted.\n\nTheir articles are generally quite funny but now and then they get interpreted as real news by people who don't know better.", "lang": "en"}
