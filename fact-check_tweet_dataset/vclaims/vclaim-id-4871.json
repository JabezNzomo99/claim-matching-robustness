But she was incorrect to say Australia is \u201cthe highest-growing country in the world\u201d.\n\nAccording to the most accurate international data, the country with the fastest-growing population is Oman, on the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nHanson said Australia\u2019s 1.6% population growth was \u201cdouble than a lot of other countries\u201d. It is fair to say Australia\u2019s population growth rate is double that of many other countries, including the United States (0.7%) and United Kingdom (0.7%), for example.\n\nSince Hanson\u2019s statement, Australia\u2019s population growth rate for the period ending June 2017 has been revised upwards to 1.7%. But Hanson\u2019s number was correct at the time of her statement, and the revision doesn\u2019t change the outcome of this FactCheck.\n\nIn terms of the 35 countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Luxembourg was the fastest-growing country in 2016, with Australia coming in fifth.\n\nCaution must be used when making international population comparisons. It\u2019s important to put the growth rates in the context of the total size, density and demographic makeup of the population, and the economic stage of the country.\n\nHow do we calculate population growth?\n\nA country\u2019s population growth, or decline, is determined by the change in the estimated number of residents. Those changes include the number of births and deaths (known as natural increase), and net overseas migration.\n\nIn Australia, both temporary and permanent overseas migrants are included in the calculation of population size.\n\nAccording to Australian Bureau of Statistics data, Australia\u2019s population grew by 1.6% in the year to June 2017 \u2013 as Hanson said.\n\nSince Hanson\u2019s statement, Australia\u2019s population growth rate for the period ending June 2017 has been revised upwards to 1.7%. But, as said in the verdict, Hanson\u2019s number was correct at the time of her statement, and the revision doesn\u2019t change any of the other outcomes of this FactCheck.\n\nThat\u2019s an increase of 407,000 people in a population of 24.6 million.\n\nAll states and territories recorded positive population growth in the year to June 2017. Victoria had the fastest growth rate (2.4%) and South Australia recorded the slowest growth rate (0.6%).\n\nRead more: FactCheck: is South Australia's youth population rising or falling?\n\nIs Australia\u2019s population the \u2018highest-growing in the world\u2019?\n\nThere are different ways of reporting population data.\n\nPopulation projections are statements about future populations based on certain assumptions regarding the future of births, deaths and migration.\n\nPopulation estimates are statistics based on data from a population for a previous time period. Population estimates provide a more accurate representation of actual dynamics.\n\nWorld Bank data for 2016 (based on population estimates) provide us with the most accurate international comparison.\n\nAccording to those data, Australia\u2019s growth rate \u2013 1.5% for 2016 \u2013 placed it at 86th in the world. The top 10 countries grew by between 3% and 5%.\n\nHow does Australia\u2019s growth compare to other OECD countries?\n\nComparison of Australia\u2019s average annual population growth with other OECD countries shows Australia\u2019s rate of population growth is among the highest in the OECD, but not the highest.\n\nThis is true whether we look at annual averages for five-year bands between 1990 and 2015, or single-year data.\n\nLooking again at the World Bank data, Australia\u2019s rate of population growth for 2016, at 1.5%, was double that of many other OECD countries, including the United Kingdom (0.7%) and United States (0.7%).\n\nHanson has proposed a national vote on what she describes as Australia\u2019s \u201crunaway rates of immigration\u201d.\n\nThe senator has suggested reducing Australia\u2019s Migration Program cap from the current level of 190,000 people per year to 75,000-100,000 people per year. The expected intake of 190,000 permanent migrants was not met over the last few years. Permanent migration for 2017-18 has dropped to 162,400 people, due to changes in vetting processes.\n\nThe greatest contribution to the growth of the Australian population (63%) comes from overseas migration, as Hanson\u2019s office noted in their response to The Conversation.\n\nThe origin countries of migrants are becoming more diverse, posing socioeconomic benefits and infrastructure challenges for Australia.\n\nSometimes people confuse net overseas migration (the total of all people moving in and out of Australia in a certain time frame), with permanent migration (the number of people who come to Australia to live). They are not the same thing.\n\nNet overseas migration includes temporary migration. And net overseas migration is included in population data. This means our population growth reflects our permanent population, plus more.\n\nTemporary migrants are a major contributor to population growth in Australia \u2013 in particular, international students.\n\nIn the most recent data (2014-15), net temporary migrants numbered just under 132,000, a figure that included just over 77,000 net temporary students.\n\nPopulation changes track the history of the nation. This includes events like post-war rebuilding \u2013 including the baby boom and resettlement of displaced European nationals \u2013 to subsequent fluctuations in birth rates and net overseas migration.\n\nWe can see these events reflected in the rates of growth from 1945 to the present.\n\nThe rate of population growth in Australia increased markedly in 2007, before peaking at 2.1% in 2009 (after the height of the global financial crisis, in which the Australian economy fared better than many others).\n\nSince 2009, annual population growth has bounced around between a low of 1.4% and a high of 1.8%.\n\nThe longer-term average for population growth rates since 1947 is 1.6% (the same as it is now).\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that a higher annual growth rate coming from a lower population base is usually still lower growth in terms of actual numbers of people, when compared to a lower growth rate on a higher population base.\n\nThere can also be significant fluctuations in population growth rates from year to year. So we need to use caution when making assessments based on changes in annual rates.\n\nEconomic factors, government policies, and special events are just some of the things that can influence year-on-year population movements.\n\nOther factors we should consider when making international comparisons include the:\n\u2022 demographic composition, or age distribution, of the population\n\u2022 economic stage of the country (for example, post-industrialisation or otherwise).\n\nAny changes to the Migration Program should be considered alongside the best available research. \u2013 Liz Allen\n\nThe FactCheck is fair and correct.\n\nThe statement about Australia\u2019s population growth rate over the year to June 30 2017 is correct. The preliminary growth rate published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics at the time of Hanson\u2019s statement was 1.60%; the rate was subsequently revised to 1.68%.\n\nIt is also true that many developed countries have lower population growth rates than Australia, but some have higher rates. According to United Nations Population Division estimates, Oman had the fastest-growing population between 2014 and 2015 (the latest data available).\n\nWith regard to misinterpretations of net overseas migration, it should also be stated that some people think this refers to the number of people migrating to Australia. It is actually immigration minus emigration \u2013 the difference between the number arriving and the number leaving. \u2013 Tom Wilson\n\nThe Conversation\u2019s FactCheck unit was the first fact-checking team in Australia and one of the first worldwide to be accredited by the International Fact-Checking Network, an alliance of fact-checkers hosted at the Poynter Institute in the US.
