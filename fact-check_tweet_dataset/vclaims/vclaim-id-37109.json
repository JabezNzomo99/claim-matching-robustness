The image has been doctored from a photo in which the banner endorses peace and human rights.\n\nA group of men, some of whom are wearing clerical collars, appear in the image holding a banner that purports to say, in capital letters: \u201cImpeach Leni Robredo for vice president\u201d.\n\nRobredo has been vice president of the Philippines since 2016. Here is her verified Twitter account.\n\nThe misleading image is contained in this Facebook post published May 23, 2019, and shared more than 700 times since.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Facebook post:\n\nThe image has been doctored; a Google reverse image search led to a similar photo in this article on the website of United Methodist News service, the news agency of the United Methodist Church.\n\nThe article is dated September 22, 2017 \u2013 a day after marches were held to mark the anniversary of the 1972 proclamation of martial law in the Philippines. Here is an AFP article about those 2017 rallies.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the misleading Facebook post (L) and the United Methodist News article (R):\n\nThe text on the banner in the photo says, in capital letters: \u201cStand up for justice, human rights and just peace! Ecumenical Bishops Forum\u201d.\n\nThe photo in the United Methodist News article is credited to Ofelia A. Cantor, who posted the same image to Facebook here on September 21, 2017. Cantor\u2019s Facebook page states that she once worked at the Ecumenical Bishops Forum.\n\nThe same banner can be seen in other photos online, for example here on the website of the National Council of Churches in the Philippines in an article dated October 13, 2017.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of that article:\n\nThe same photo can also be seen in a different image in this Facebook post dated September 21, 2017.\n\nThat post is embedded below:\n\nIn the Philippines, the president and vice president are elected independently of one another, as detailed on this government website.\n\nRobredo has publicly criticised Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte for his deadly war on drugs.\n\nHere is a YouTube video showing her message to the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs convention in 2017, where she raised the subject.\n\nThe misleading Facebook post has been shared in groups which support President Duterte, according to CrowdTangle data.", "lang": "en"}
