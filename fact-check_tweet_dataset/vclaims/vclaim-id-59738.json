Twelve sisters from Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary Convent in Livonia, Michigan, died within 30 days of each other during an outbreak of the coronavirus disease between April 10 and May 10. Another sister died on June 27.\n\nSuzanne English, executive director of mission advancement for the Felician Sisters of North America \u2014 the congregation that the sisters belonged to \u2014 told us in a statement that although not all 13 sisters were tested, their symptoms were \u201cinline with COVID\u201d amid the outbreak at the convent.\n\nIn the case of the final fatality on June 27, English said, \u201cthe Sister had been COVID-positive and while she had passed the 28-day quarantine, we believe it was the lingering effects that caused her death.\u201d\n\nAlthough some news reports referred to the women as \u201cnuns,\u201d English pointed out that because the Felicians are monastic (living under religious vows), they are correctly referred to as \u201csisters.\u201d\n\nA total of 30 sisters at the Livonia convent \u2014 of the 57 then living there \u2014 were infected. Seventeen recovered, English said in an email, citing Sister Noel Marie Gabriel, director of clinical health services for the Felicians.\n\nAccording to Global Sisters Report, a news publication focusing on Catholic sisters and current events, the 13 sisters who passed were heavily involved in their community, performing services like working as nurses, educators, and librarians.\n\n\u201cThat was our most tragic time,\u201d Sister Gabriel told the publication. \u201cIt was a month of tragedy and sorrow and mourning and grieving.\u201d\n\nOfficially known as the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Felix of Cantalice, the convent in Livonia is one of 60 Felician convents in North America.", "lang": "en"}
