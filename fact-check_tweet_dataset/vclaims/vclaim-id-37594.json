Our first stop was the White House, where we requested permission to watch a video of the Situation Room meeting. We were told it was a classified setting, so that simply was not possible. There was no confirmation that a video even existed.\n\nSo that leaves us with the commentary made by the participants themselves, all fierce partisans who may not be accurately reflecting what was said. But we can parse the rhetoric to get a sense of what happened. We will look at two questions:\n\nThere is only one on-the-record source for the so-called slam, and that is Schumer. He initially did not say \u201cslam.\u201d He emerged from the White House and said: \u201cHe sort of slammed the table and when Leader Pelosi said she didn\u2019t agree with the wall, he just walked out and said we have nothing to discuss.\u201d\n\nImmediately after the meeting on Jan. 9, Pelosi did not echo Schumer\u2019s description. Pelosi on Jan. 10 made this comment, but it could be viewed as metaphorical: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be a backdrop for the president to stomp the table and get up and walk out. I think he thought we were going to stay there when he left. He got up, we got up.\u201d\n\nPence: \u201cThe president called the question in the meeting, he asked Speaker Pelosi that if he opened things up quickly, if he reopened the government quickly would she be willing to agree to funding for a wall, or a barrier on the southern border? And when she said no, the president said goodbye.\u201d\n\nScalise: \u201cWhen the president looks at Nancy Pelosi and says if I give you another 30 days, will you be willing to support some funding for a wall to secure the border and she says no, not, well, maybe a little bit more than a dollar, not some serious counter-offer, just flat out no, that\u2019s not an acceptable answer to a serious crisis on our border.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.): \u201cThat is exactly how it was phrased, and that is that Speaker Pelosi, if I were to open up the government today, three days from now, would you support any funding for border security, for a wall, and she said, \u2018No.\u2019 \"\n\nIt appears unlikely that Trump requested Pelosi\u2019s support only for border security, as McCarthy frames it. That would have been an opening for a possible compromise she could have exploited, since Democrats say they are for border security \u2014 or even a barrier such as the fencing that Congress approved earlier in the Trump administration. It\u2019s pretty clear that Trump\u2019s request was framed around a wall, though he may have said something along the lines of \u201ca wall to secure the border\u201d or \u201cborder security that includes a wall.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
