Rand Paul's statements on his college degree.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2015-02-16T20:51:30Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-81285", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/16/readers-respond-to-fact-check-on-rand-pauls-statements-on-college-degree/", "vclaim": "A degree in biology \u2014 whether it is a B.A., M.A., or Ph.D., is a degree in biology. It is not a medical degree, an M.D. The reverse is also true. That is a matter of fact. Physicians must study biology, and they study various aspects of it in medical school, but it is not correct to say that an M.D. is a biology degree. It\u2019s much more complicated than that. Rand Paul may have studied biology as an undergraduate, but he did not earn a degree in biology. Other people have, and do. He lied.\n\nLike Senator Paul I have an M.D. (University of Iowa, 1984). Unlike Senator Paul I also have a bachelor\u2019s degree in biology (B.S. in Biology from Wheaton College, 1979). I can tell you that my studies toward the B.S. were very different than my studies in medical school. Needless to say, my studies in medical school focused almost exclusively on human biology and clinical medicine. However, with respect to my biology degree, I took two quarters of human physiology, otherwise I studied the broad range of life science, from zoology to botany to cellular biology to ecology and more. I can\u2019t imagine claiming to have a degree in biology based on having gone to medical school.\n\nI am also a graduate of Duke Medical School. I went much earlier than Dr. Paul, but at least in the 1950-60s, Duke did indeed accept people after three years of college.\n\n And this is what hasn\u2019t been said: The first two years of the medical school basic science courses were considered the completion of an earned bachelor\u2019s degree. That may not have been true when Dr. Paul attended, but it was when I did.\n\nRand Paul\u2019s biology degree claim is simply dishonest and their spokesman\u2019s explanation is shameful. Simply put if he had made that aversion in a job interview he would not be considered further for the job, plain and simple. I have a masters in Chemical Engineering. I wouldn\u2019t claim to be a Chemist unless I actually had a Chemistry degree (which I also have). Anybody that when to college should no better. Paul should get more than 3 Pinocchios!\n\nI neither like nor agree with Senator Paul but in this case I give him a pass. And I\u2019m not inclined to ever give anyone a pass on saying they graduated from somewhere they didn\u2019t. His matriculations are on the unusual and highly creditable side of things and in an exchange like the one described I think explaining it would be pretentious and interruptive to the point at hand. No, he doesn\u2019t have an undergrad or other degree with biology on it but it\u2019s not a stretch to me to equate an MD with \u201chave studied biology extensively\u201d which is connotation of \u201chave a biology degree\u201d. And he does have a degree \u2013 an MD which is a higher and harder to get degree than an undergrad biology degree. I would have given him maybe One Pinocchio for \u201cMine\u2019s in biology and English.\u201d\n\nA medical degree from Duke University so far exceeds some college bachelor\u2019s degree based on a major in biology that it is absurd to be designating \u201cthree Pinocchio\u2019s\u201d for Rand Paul\u2019s statements. You may not agree with his politics, but one has to concede that he is sufficiently grounded in biology to make informed statements on the subject. This is \u201cgotcha journalism\u201d carried to its most ridiculous extreme.\n\nI think you are caught up a bit too much in semantics here. No Rand Paul does not have an undergraduate biology degree. But an MD is a graduate degree in a biological science and would a sufficient credential for any job that requires a BS in biology, in fact leaving you overqualified for anything but graduate school. To contend Paul is \u201cinflating his resume\u201d by saying he\u2019s got a biology degree is ignorant.\n\nI don\u2019t usually give the politicians much slack, and I am by no means a fan of Rand Paul, but I\u2019m inclined to give him considerable slack on claiming a biology degree. Even claiming an English degree doesn\u2019t seem totally out of line, though that would depend on how far he got with it.\n\nThere are many merged degrees that don\u2019t fit the norm, such as the 6-year MD programs that have fallen out of favor. Rand went through college and completed a medical degree. While it may not be 100% accurate, it\u2019s still totally reasonable for him to say that he has a degree in biology.\n\nI sometimes think that you go too easy on these guys, but in this case, for someone I don\u2019t care for at all, I think you\u2019re going way too hard on him. The reasonable range in my perspective is 1 to 1.5 Pinochios at most, and only for mentioning the English degree.", "lang": "en"}
