The picture is a doctored copy of a 1946 Associated Press photograph taken during Gandhi's talks with the man who would become India\u2019s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nThe black-and-white image was posted on January 15 by a Facebook page with more than 11,000 followers. It is a close-up shot that appears to show a topless Gandhi face-to-face with an attractive woman in profile, who is also smiling.\n\nThere are typed words above and below the photograph saying \u201cMe with my gf\u201d, short for girlfriend, and \u201cMahatma gandhi\u201d.\n\nThe doctored image has been shared repeatedly since at least 2015, for example here and here, and has been posted in multiple languages, including Spanish and Indonesian.\n\nA reverse image search found the photograph had been doctored. The original picture, widely used in online reports including by the BBC and the New York Times, shows Gandhi -- in exactly the same position -- laughing with Nehru at a meeting in Bombay, now known as Mumbai.\n\nThe picture was taken by Max Desfor, an American Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer who worked for the Associated Press.\n\nHere is the image in the news agency's online image database.\n\nThe picture's caption says: \u201cA bespectacled Mohandas Gandhi, the Mahatma, who eventually led India to its independence, laughs with the man who was to be the nation's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, at the All-India Congress committee meeting in Bombay, India, on July 6, 1946.\"\n\nA comparison of the misleading Facebook post and the original AP image shows that the part of the photograph containing Gandhi\u2019s face has been edited together with a closely cropped picture of a smiling woman.\n\nIn the original image, there is a uniform dark background behind the top of Nehru and Gandhi\u2019s heads. But in the doctored version, the background behind the woman appears lighter than that behind Gandhi, and a dividing line can be seen between the two shades.\n\nPart of Nehru\u2019s white sleeve is also visible next to the woman\u2019s neck in the doctored image.\n\nSome of the comments on Meme_bazi\u2019s post say the image is disrespectful, but the owner of the page has replied to them saying the picture shows India\u2019s \u201creal history\u201d.\n\nDesfor won the Pulitzer Prize for photography in 1951 for his photographic coverage of the Korean war, the prize's website says. He died in February 2018 aged 104, according to the AP.", "lang": "en"}
