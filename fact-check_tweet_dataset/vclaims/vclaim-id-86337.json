The plan, which might be described as \u201cGreen New Deal-lite,\u201d would end fossil fuel subsidies while continuing to rely on these energy sources during the 30-year transition period.\n\nFracking, short for \u201chydraulic fracturing,\u201d is a drilling technique that uses high-pressure water and chemical blasts to access natural gas and oil reserves underground. The technique has facilitated a boom in U.S. energy production over the past decade, but it has been controversial, the target of climate-change activists and many Democrats.\n\nFor Biden, it\u2019s a fine line to straddle. Pushing for a total ban could hurt his general election chances in the swing states where fracking has propped up the economy, such as Ohio and Pennsylvania. Anything less than a total ban could detract from Biden\u2019s appeal among liberals and climate-change activists in the Democratic base.\n\nThat may be why his remarks at the debate caught so much attention. Biden seemed to be staking out a new position. When Sanders said, \u201cI\u2019m talking about stopping fracking as soon as we possibly can,\u201d Biden said, \u201cSo am I.\u201d A few beats later, Biden said \u201cno more \u2014 no new fracking.\u201d\n\nSome folks didn\u2019t get the message. McDaniel, the RNC chairwoman, tweeted a video of Biden\u2019s remarks and claimed that his policy would shut down all the fracking jobs in the country. The Trump campaign also used a Biden video snippet from the debate in a tweet claiming he would \u201cban fracking.\u201d Right-wing media outlets including the Washington Free Beacon, the Daily Caller and Fox News all reported on Biden\u2019s remarks as though he had adopted a tougher line.\n\nThe National Republican Campaign Committee, the GOP\u2019s campaign arm for House races, took aim at Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.), a Biden supporter in one of the most closely contested swing districts. The NRCC claimed that \u201cone day after Joe Biden proudly pronounced there would be \u2018no new fracking\u2019 in his administration, Conor Lamb went on the record to praise Biden\u2019s job-killing policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertain Democratic presidential candidates have promised to \u2018ban fracking,\u2019 and I\u2019ve publicly criticized them for doing so,\u201d Lamb wrote in a separate Wall Street Journal letter to the editor in February. \u201cVice President Biden has criticized them, too. He has explicitly promised not to ban fracking, and when confronted by an activist who was upset with his position, Mr. Biden told him plainly: \u2018You ought to vote for someone else.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAt a campaign stop in December, Biden was asked: \u201cI\u2019ve looked at your climate plan. Why doesn\u2019t it ban fracking?\u201d He responded, \u201cBecause you can\u2019t ban fracking right now; you\u2019ve got to transition away from it.\u201d When challenged, Biden said, \u201cYou ought to vote for somebody else.\u201d\n\nBiden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said Republicans were resorting to \u201cembarrassing smears.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s heartening to us that Donald Trump keeps admitting, through his reliance on outright lies, that he himself knows he could only beat Joe Biden in an alternate universe,\u201d Bates said. \u201cAs president, Joe Biden will mobilize the nation to overcome the climate emergency that Donald Trump denies, creating jobs and standing up for American workers.\u201d\n\nBiden described his fracking stance inaccurately. He supports a ban only on new permits for federal lands and waters. The Biden campaign quickly retracted his remarks on debate night. That seemed to reach enough reporters, and Biden\u2019s remarks attracted scant attention in the mainstream media.\n\nOn the right, a different version of reality took hold. Biden\u2019s videotaped remarks took on a life of their own, feeding the incorrect notion that he now supports a total ban on fracking. His position is the same as it ever was. We will be keeping a close watch on whether his position is mischaracterized in the future \u2014 or whether Biden appears to adjust his stance yet again.", "lang": "en"}
