How is it possible to have the slowest economic recovery ever \u2014 and replace jobs faster than the historical average? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nBush\u2019s statement about the slowest economic recovery ever is based on the fact that it took so long for the United States to replace the jobs lost in the Great Recession that began in December of 2007. The Bush campaign pointed to a 2013 blog post from the Pew Research Center that noted this was the slowest job recovery since Harry S Truman was president, in that all of the jobs lost in the recession have not yet been recovered by that point.\n\nWhen the job target was finally hit in 2014, Pew did an update that showed that the economy was still lagging behind because the size of the potential labor force had grown. The blog post featured this chart from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.\n\nWe will note that Bush possibly engaged in a bit of hyperbole when he said \u201cever,\u201d but the employment records before the Great Depression are not especially accurate so it\u2019s not easy to get reliable data for the early decades of the United States. But otherwise, he is correct that this was an unusually long recovery.\n\nSo how can Clinton argue that the Obama administration \u201creplaced the jobs we lost faster than the historical average after a financial crash?\u201d The key phrase here is \u201cfinancial.\u201d Clinton is not comparing the recovery to other U.S. recoveries, but instead is using a metric of financial crashes. In doing so, she draws on the research of economists Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, who have argued that recessions spawned by financial crises have more difficult recoveries than those created through policy mistakes.\n\nNot everyone buys this theory \u2014 or that the 2007 recession was purely a financial crisis. Some experts argue that the Federal Reserve contributed to the subprime mortgage meltdown through its policy of low interest rates. But here\u2019s the graphic provided by the Clinton campaign, showing how the American recession compared with five other major financial recessions identified by the economists.\n\nOf the two candidates, Bush has probably the stronger argument, in that the recovery was unusually slow compared with other recent U.S. recessions, though in the past year job growth has suddenly spiked and unemployment has come down. (Of course, many might argue that Obama inherited the crisis from Bush\u2019s brother, but that\u2019s a separate issue.)\n\nClinton also has a case for her claim, but it requires you to accept the fact that the 2007 recession was entirely because of the financial markets. Readers should always be wary when candidates insert caveats such as \u201cfinancial\u201d in their talking points.\n\nWe are not awarding Pinocchios here, as this is simply an interesting illustration of how the candidates can find within the same set of data a way to make diametrically opposing points.", "lang": "en"}
