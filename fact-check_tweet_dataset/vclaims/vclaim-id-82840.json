Neither Clinton nor any of her aides have been charged with a crime. We also won\u2019t consider whether her indictment is politically viable. But we will review what we know of the two cases from a factual and legal standpoint, to see if there is a logical comparison that can be made between the two.\n\nThe FBI wanted to charge him with lying to the FBI and violating a section of the Espionage Act, both of which carried years in prison. The Justice Department has never discussed exactly why it decided to accept a plea on a lesser charge, and we may never know why he wasn\u2019t charged with lying to the FBI. His lawyers say he didn\u2019t commit those crimes, and that Petraeus\u2019s statements to the FBI weren\u2019t material to, and didn\u2019t impede, the investigation. (More on the story behind the plea agreement here.)\n\nIn one case, the mishandling charge could not be brought against a known spy leaking information to the Chinese government, because the information was not classified at birth (and was later classified): \u201cEven if the nature was such that it clearly should have been, but wasn\u2019t classified as such, we said, \u2018We\u2019re sorry, that\u2019s not going to hold up in court,\u2019\u201d one former prosecutor said.\n\nBut there clearly are fundamental differences between the two cases that make it an illogical comparison, based on what we know of the Clinton case so far. At the most basic level, there is dispute over whether Clinton\u2019s emails contained \u201cclassified\u201d information. An array of experts we consulted all told us that as long as the dispute exists, it will be difficult to bring the same charge of mishandling classified information to which Petraeus pleaded guilty.", "lang": "en"}
