The claim is false; the woman in the picture is an IAF flight lieutenant called Sneha Shekhawat; the names of pilots involved in the strike have not been released.\n\nOn February 26, 2019, India said its warplanes had launched air strikes against militant camps in Pakistan's territory. Here is an AFP story on the strikes.\n\nMultiple Facebook posts including this one, published February 26, 2019 and shared more than 350 times, purport to show the IAF fighter pilot who conducted the strikes.\n\nThe post contains an image of a woman in air force uniform wearing pilot glasses with a caption that says: \"Proud to inform you that the pilot of today's air strike is a girl from Surat Name : Urvisha Jariwala\".\n\nThe same image and claim has been shared widely on Twitter, for example here.\n\nA reverse image search found that the woman in the photo is not called Urvisha Jariwala, she is actually an IAF flight lieutenant named Sneha Shekhawat.\n\nBharat-rakshak.com, an online database of military personnel, lists Shekhawat as an IAF officer. Here is a link to her profile, which contains the same picture as the misleading post.\n\nA search on the same database using the keywords \"Urvisha Jariwala\" brings up no results.\n\nIn 2012, Shekhawat led an IAF contingent at India\u2019s Republic Day parade, becoming the first woman pilot to do so, according to this report by India Today.\n\nIndia\u2019s national broadcaster Doordarshan also interviewed her in 2015. This tweet from the network\u2019s verified account, published on October 8, 2015, advertises the interview using the same picture as the misleading post with Shekhawat\u2019s name overlaid on the image.\n\nA promo video of the interview can also be viewed on the show\u2019s YouTube account here.\n\nThe composite image below shows a screenshot of the Doordarshan compared with the misleading image:\n\nNeither the IAF nor the Indian government have released the names of the fighter pilots involved in the airstrike on Pakistan.", "lang": "en"}
