This number, and the fact that foreign tourists feel comfortable in Georgia, is a confirmation that the level of security is high in Georgia.\u201d\n\n \n\n Lavrov\u2019s claim \u201cis inaccurate with respect to Georgia and we cannot accept it,\u201d he said.\n\n \n\n If Georgia is such a high transit point for terrorists, why did the European Parliament vote in a landslide this month to back visa-free travel for Georgian citizens to 30 European countries, Georgian officials ask?\n\nOne of the conditions of attaining visa-free status with the EU was for Georgia to improve security in the country, which Georgia satisfied before Brussels granted it this status. \n\n \n\n \u201cThe trust that the European Union expressed through granting the visa-free movement is a clear proof that Georgia is a secure country,\u201d Georgian Deputy Foreign Minister Davit Dondua told reporters in Munich on February 21.\n\n \n\n Analysts contacted by Polygraph.info say that the security situation in Georgia is not as dire as Lavrov described and that he inaccurately tied Georgia to terrorism issues in the South Caucasus.\n\nThey said that while Georgia \u2013 like other nations in the region \u2013 faces challenges from radical insurgents and drug smuggling, the potential outside threat is not as great as from other neighboring countries.\n\n \n\n Michael Cecire, a regional analyst from the New America Foundation, told Polygraph.info that there is an \u201cinherent self-contradiction\u201d in Lavrov\u2019s comparison of Georgia with Central Asia. Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan already have a visa-free status with Russia.\n\n \n\n \u201cRussia maintains visa-free regimes with states that have serious internal security problems,\u201d Cecire said. \u201cIronically, the regions of Georgia that are most widely regarded as hotspots for trafficking and criminality are Abkhazia and South Ossetia \u2013 separatist regimes that are recognized by Moscow.\u201d\n\n \n\n In a 2016 annual terrorism report, the U.S. State Department wrote that \u201cGeorgia took steps to improve border security and counter the financing of terrorism.\u201d The report said that \u201coverall, the Georgian government is largely capable of detecting, deterring, and responding to terrorism incidents, despite challenges to cooperation, communication, and information sharing.\u201d\n\nAnd as for claims of Georgia exporting terrorists, Georgia\u2019s representative to Russia told reporters: \u201cAs far as we know, around 2,000 citizens of Russia have gone to Syria and Iraq.\u201d\n\nThis compares to Georgian government estimates that 50 to 100 Georgian nationals are fighting for IS or al-Qaida affiliates in Syria and Iraq, Abashidze said.\n\nThe Kremlin may be using the visa-free travel issue as political leverage to pressure the Georgian government to enter into closer security and diplomatic relations with Russia, analysts said.\n\n \n\n Kornely Kakachia, director of the Georgian Institute of Politics, told Polygraph.info that Russia is more concerned about Georgia\u2019s getting closer to the West than it is with security threats.\n\n \n\n \u201cLast year almost one million Russian tourists visited Georgia and the Russian MFA (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) never complained about security concerns,\u201d Kakachia said.\n\n \n\n Moscow is using the visa-free travel as a political tool to \u201cput pressure on Georgia aimed at persuading it to restore broken diplomatic relations with Russia and acknowledge so called \u2019new realties\u2019 on the ground, such as an \u2018independent\u2019 Abkhazia and South Ossetia,\u201d Kakachia said.\n\n \n\n Georgia broke diplomatic ties with Russia after the 2008 Russia-Georgia war.\n\nIn the 1990s, at the height of the Chechen wars with Russia, Russia and Georgia had a visa-free regime.\n\n \n\n Russia imposed visa requirements on Georgia in 2000, citing a \u201cterrorist threat\u201d due to a surge of Chechen refugees, who were fleeing Chechnya as Russia was fighting its second war against Chechen nationalists.\n\n \n\n Experts say the security environment in Georgia is significantly more stable than it was in the late 1990s.", "lang": "en"}
