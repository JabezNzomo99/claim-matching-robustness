A Facebook user named \"Michel Delmas\" posted a video on March 22, 2018 (embedded below) with a caption saying it happened in Montpellier:\n\nLink to the original post + link to archived version of the post + archived version of the video\n\nUnfortunately Michel was deceived a bit. The video shows a tram in Izmir, Turkey, stopping for a praying man somewhere in 2017:\n\nThe version Michel posted had various sound effects added and some random unrelated footage of tram passengers around the 1:45 mark (you can tell because there is bright daylight outside while the rest of the video shows dusk).\n\nNeed more evidence? Look at the first frame of the video, or a few seconds in: you can clearly see the logo of Izmir's tram company:", "lang": "en"}
