The claim is false; Chinese authorities have not projected that 11 million people quarantined in Wuhan in January 2020 will die; the US Centres of Disease Control and Prevention has stated there is no vaccine for human coronavirus but most people will recover on their own.\n\nThe misleading claim was published in this Facebook on January 24, 2020.\n\nThe post, which shows people wearing masks and protective clothing in China next to an image of a snake, has been shared more than 11,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Sinhala-language caption translates to English as: \u201cSeems more dangerous than anticipated\u201d.\n\nThe Sinhala-language text on the image translates to English as below: \n\n \u201cBy now China\u2019s Wuhan city has been sealed off along with 11 million people and since no drugs have been found to treat coronavirus, doctors say they all would most likely die. It is also noted that this virus could turn worse in March and it has by now spread to Japan, Thailand and America. It has also been found that this situation is a result of consuming the meat of the Chinese cobra. Chinese government notes the city was closed off to avoid a grave situation that would arise if this spread all over the world. By this time, even the Huanggang city has been sealed off with a 7.5 million population.\u201d\n\nA new strain of the coronavirus was discovered in China more than one month ago. It has killed at least 82 people and infected more than 2,700 people across China, as reported here by AFP on January 28, 2020. The virus has now infected people in more than a dozen countries, including the United States.\n\nThe government of Wuhan announced on January 23, 2020, that it was suspending all entrance and exits to the city as a precautionary measure to stop further transmission of the virus, as reported here by AFP. The neighbouring city of Huanggang was also placed on lockdown from the same day.\n\nA similar claim was published on Facebook here, here and here.\n\nThe claim is false; Chinese authorities have not projected all 11 million people quarantined in Wuhan will die from the virus.\n\nStrict measures were undertaken to stop the spread of the virus, according to this China Daily article, shared on the website of the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China on January 23, 2020.\n\nThe report\u2019s first paragraph reads: \u201cChina is taking more stringent measures in hospitals to safeguard healthcare workers amid the ongoing outbreak of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus strain, and training for such employees will be enhanced nationwide, the country's top health authority said on Jan 22.\u201d\n\nThere is a currently no vaccine for the new strain of coronavirus but most patients will recover on their own, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe Shanghai Municipal Health Commission announced on January 26, 2020, that a 56-year-old woman was successfully treated for the virus, Malaysian newspaper The Star reported, citing Chinese state media.\n\nDr Shawn Vasoo, the acting clinical director at Singapore\u2019s National Centre for Infectious Diseases, estimated that around 20 percent of the people infected with the virus would become very ill.\n\nThe claim in the misleading posts that the virus originated from snake meat has not yet been confirmed. A group of Chinese scientists published a paper in the Journal of Medical Virology on January 22, 2020, about the claim.\n\nUpon analysing the genetic sequence of the Wuhan virus, they found that the protein codes in the virus are similar to those in snakes -- they used samples from the many banded krait and the Chinese cobra, which are common in the area -- and believed the virus might have been transmitted from snakes to humans.\n\nIt could also have originated from bats, but there could have been an \u201cintermediate host\u201d in the transmission to humans, possibly snakes, as AFP reported on January 23, 2020.\n\nScientists have said more tests will be needed to confirm its origin, the South China Morning Post reported on January 23, 2020.\n\nCORRECTION: This story was updated on January 28, 2020, to change the number of death toll from the virus from \u201cat least 80\u201d to \u201cat least 82\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
