The viral post states that people who get flu shots should stay at home for a minimum of 2 weeks as they have an active live walking virus. Vishvas News investigated and found that the claim is false.\n\nA post shared on Facebook by a user named Jodi Graesser reads: \u201cFolks who get flu shots please have some courtesy and stay home for minimal of 2 weeks while you are an active live walking virus. Also don\u2019t hug others and give kisses and please immediately tell others you were vaccinated so they don\u2019t come close you.\u201d\n\nOn the official website of the Government of Canada, Vishvas News found some information regarding the flu shots. The website states that the flu shot is your best defence against the flu and recommended for everyone 6 months and older. It further states that the flu shot is safe and one can\u2019t get flu from flu shot.\n\nWe further investigated and found an article on the official website of Harvard Medical School. The website calls the claim a myth. It states that the flu shot can\u2019t transmit infection. It takes a week or two to get protection from the vaccine.\n\nVishvas News spoke to Dr. Sanchayan Roy, who is a General Physician. He said: \u201cThis is not true. Vaccines help develop immunity. Vaccines contain a version of the virus or bacteria that has been weakened so that it does not cause serious disease in people with healthy immune systems. Infact, it gives immunity to the body by producing antibodies. The claim which states that people who get vaccinated will be contagious for some weeks is fake.\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, vaccines help develop immunity by imitating an infection. This type of infection, however, almost never causes illness, but it does cause the immune system to produce T-lymphocytes and antibodies. Sometimes, after getting a vaccine, the imitation infection can cause minor symptoms, such as fever. Such minor symptoms are normal and should be expected as the body builds immunity. Vaccines help develop immunity by imitating an infection.\n\nNowhere has it been mentioned that the person who has got the vaccine can transfer the virus to someone he hugs or kisses or comes in contact.\n\nFlu shots make people contagious is a misleading post.
