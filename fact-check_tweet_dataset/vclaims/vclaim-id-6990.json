The alleged incident was reported both by the Lenta.ru website and the Russian state news agency TASS. On May 12, Maria Zakharova also made a post about the event on her Facebook page.\n\nThe incident allegedly occurred during an event organized by Ukraine\u2019s permanent delegation to the United Nations on the topic of propaganda and fake news. In attendance were two female Ukrainian war veterans, in uniform, who were accompanied by Maria Berlinska, also a veteran drone reconnaissance soldier and director of the documentary film The Invisible Battalion. Also in attendance was Maxim Buyakevych, a Russian Foreign Ministry official, who had been invited to the discussion.\n\nAs reported by Tatiana Vorozhko of Voice of America\u2019s Ukrainian service, one of the female veterans, Adriana Susak, posed a question to Buyakevych.\n\n\"I, a Ukrainian veteran of the war against Russian occupation, saw the results of your (Russia\u2019s) politics, \u2018truth,\u2019 and information warfare,\u201d Susak said. \u201cAs a shock trooper, and my sister here, who is a Russian-speaking sniper in the Ukrainian armed forces, we want to say...We do not need your (Russian military) \u2018support\u2019 and \u2018protection.\u2019 The population of the Donbas does not need your \u2018protection.\u2019 As for propaganda, in 2014, in the Donbas, they thought we had come to eat their children; now the people of the Donbas want your troops to return home to Russia. The question is -- when will you start to \u2018defend\u2019 Russians in Russia with your Russian propaganda?\u201d\n\nBerlinska recorded the statement on her phone and later posted it on her Facebook page.\n\nAfter the event, Berlinska followed the Russian diplomat and recorded him on her phone as she asked him several questions.\n\n\u201cWhy have you come to our land, Maxim,\u201d she asks in the video. \u201cWhy do you kill our people?\u201d\n\nShe then says \u201cLeave Ukraine, Maxim,\u201d adding: \u201cWhat? You don\u2019t have enough courage to answer a soldier?\u201d She then says: \u201cSoon you will leave. Very soon.\u201d\n\nAs the video shows, Berlinska did not threaten or attempt to touch Buyakevych. She also noted on her Facebook page that she was not dressed in camouflage, nor does she appear in the video to have been accompanied by the two female veterans who were present with her during the event at the U.N.", "lang": "en"}
