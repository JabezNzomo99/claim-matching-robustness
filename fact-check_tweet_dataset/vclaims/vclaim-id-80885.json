Historians and experts say that offers were made by the US and Russia", "author": "www.thequint.com", "date": "2020-06-17T19:53:44+05:30", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-80885", "url": "https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/did-nehru-give-india-permanent-seat-at-unsc-to-china-in-1950", "vclaim": "Congress leader and former UN Under-Secretary General Shashi Tharoor had said in an interview in 2004 that Nehru \u201cdeclined a US offer\u201d to India to take a permanent seat at the UNSC in 1953, and said China be given the seat instead.\n\nEven in his book \u2018Nehru \u2013 The Invention of India\u2019, Tharoor writes that Nehru suggested the seat, held by Taiwan till then, be offered to Beijing instead. Nehru was reportedly known to have said that \u201cthe seat was held with scant credibility by Taiwan.\u201d\n\nFurther, a March 2015 report by historian Anton Harder titled \u2018Not as the Cost of China\u2019 shows that the US had begun mounting pressure on India for a permanent seat as early as 1950, wanting her to take the place of China.\n\nHarder acknowledges that \u201cintegrating PRC into the international community by conceding to China\u2019s right to the seat\u201d was in fact the \u201ccentral pillar of Nehru\u2019s foreign policy.\u201d\n\nA 2002 Frontline article by historian AG Noorani on the \u2018Nehruvian Approach\u2019 also cited a 1955 note written by Nehru on the US and Russian offers to the UNSC. In this note, Nehru had acknowledged that suggestions were made by the US \u201cInformally\u201d but India was not \u201canxious to enter the Security Council\u201d at that stage.", "lang": "en"}
