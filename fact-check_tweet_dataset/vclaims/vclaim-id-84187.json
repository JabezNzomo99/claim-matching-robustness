The claim is false; the image is in fact a photo by the Associated Press news agency which shows a thief being punished by villagers in Ecuador.\n\nThe photo was shared here in a Facebook post on April 14, 2019. The post has been shared more than 6,700 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe image combines a graphic image of a man tied to a cross as flames lick at his legs with Tamil language text across the top which translates to English as: \u201cThis person in Nepal had sexually harassed a 5-year old school kid; even before police come into scene the villagers had punished him. Do you think if this action is correct?\u201d\n\nThe same image was also posted here on Facebook on February 12, 2019 alongside a different misleading claim, also about Nepal.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption says: \u201cBurn alive in Nepal for preaching Gospel. Please pray for the preachers around the world. And type amen to support them....\u201d\n\nBoth claims in the misleading Facebook posts are false; the image is in fact a photo by the Associated Press news agency which shows a thief being punished by villagers in Ecuador.\n\nMultiple Google reverse image searches found this 2016 image on the AP website.\n\nThe AP photo\u2019s caption states: \u201cMario Quishpe shouts as villagers burn his legs after allegedly being caught stealing in Pelileo Grande, Ecuador, some 75 miles south of Quito, Tuesday, Oct. 10, 2006. A parish priest, along with other villagers, managed to extinguish the flames before he was taken by police to the hospital where his burns were treated.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo on the AP website:", "lang": "en"}
