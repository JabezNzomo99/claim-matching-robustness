No, this is not true: Late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel mocked a video of Pence delivering boxes that were \"empty\" to a health care center amid the coronavirus outbreak, but the clip he used was edited and taken out of context.\n\nThe video that went viral of Kimmel criticizing the vice president saying, \"Well, can I carry the empty ones? Just for the camera?\" The full video on C-SPAN shows the Vice President unloading boxes, delivering them to the hospital and making a joke about empty boxes.\n\nThe Kimmel video went viral on Twitter (archived here) where it was published by Matt McDermott on May 8, 2020. It opened:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Twitter at the time of writing:\n\n\n\nJimmy Kimmel shared the clip during his monologue on May 7, 2020, ripping into \"Magic Mike\" Pence showing an edited video. The vice president was delivering supplies to a Virginia health care center as aid for health care workers during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\"Here he is with no mask on wheeling boxes of PPEs into a health care center and doing his best to lift them. What a hero. Just barely into the door,\" Kimmel sarcastically begins. \"Since it was going so well and also because he didn't realize he had a mic on, Magic Mike decided to keep it going. Listen in closely here.\"\n\nThe clip shows Pence being told boxes are empty and he responds: \"Well can I carry the empty ones? Just for the camera?\"\n\nKimmel continues: \"Mike Pence pretending to carry empty boxes of PPEs into a hospital is the perfect metaphor for who he is and what he's doing. A big box of nothing, delivering another box of nothing.\"\n\nHere is Kimmel's monologue still on YouTube where it has earned over 250,000 views as of Friday afternoon.\n\nThe clip shown by Kimmel is edited and doesn't show the full video, which is available on CSPAN. Lead Stories isolated the relevant section in this clip:\n\nDuring the longer 9-minute video, the Vice President is lifting boxes out of a van with the helped of a soldier in fatigues and other men, putting them on a dolly and wheeling them to the front door of the health center.\n\nPence returns to the van and is told by one of the men that the boxes left inside are empty.\n\n\"Those are empty, sir,\" he is told and replies: \"Well can I carry the empty ones? Just for the camera?\"\n\nThe video went viral after it was posted on Friday morning on Twitter by Matt McDermott.\n\nHere is the full 9 minute video on C-SPAN\n\nAfter being shown the longer video, McDermott responds to Pence \"joking\" about a publicity stunt.\n\nKimmel deleted the Tweet and was called out Twitter by BuzzFeed editor Dave Mack:\n\nA spokesman for Vice President Pence tweeted about it, too:", "lang": "en"}
