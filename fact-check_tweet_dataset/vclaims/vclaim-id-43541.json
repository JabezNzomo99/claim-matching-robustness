However, Reuters had already reported that India and other \u201cemerging economies\u201d had slightly reduced their holdings of U.S. Treasuries in order to prop up their own currencies.\n\nAccording to Sputnik, this is being done to retaliate against U.S. \u201cweaponization of the dollar.\u201d While even some Western media have raised concerns about such \u201cweaponization,\u201d it is clear in their reporting that other factors are at work in India, some of which have little to do with the U.S.\n\nSputnik characterized India\u2019s reduction as \u201cdrastic\" Reuters cited a reduction from $148.9 billion in May to $147.3 billion in June. The largest drop was in April this year, when India reduced its holdings by $4.3 billion \u2013 hardly drastic.\n\nReuters cited financial expert Gennady Goldberg, who said countries like India are most likely selling off U.S. securities in an effort to prop up their own currencies. Reporting on India\u2019s reduction in U.S. Treasury securities in July, Economic Times cited both domestic and external factors for the trend in selling off securities.\n\nThere is, however, one major factor in India\u2019s financial action that does have an American connection -- the Turkish Lira crisis. This crisis has been cited as a major factor in the Indian rupee\u2019s recent plunge against the dollar. The immediate cause of the lira\u2019s woes is the breakdown in U.S.-Turkish relations, which was triggered by sanctions and threats of higher tariffs on Turkish exports in August. And one expert cited by Al Jazeera actually used the term \u201cweaponization\u201d regarding the dollar when speaking about the lira collapse.\n\nHowever, Reuters reported that India was one of six \u201cemerging markets\u201d by June had reduced their holdings of U.S. Treasuries, but that the June numbers represented holdings of the six countries which preceded the flare up of U.S \u2013 Turkish relations.\n\nWhile Putin\u2019s government and media have claimed for some time that the U.S. was \u201cweaponizing\u201d the dollar, recently even some Western analysts have made the argument. And former banker Saryajit Das, described by Bloomberg as \u201cone of the world\u2019s 50 most influential\u201d figures in the financial industry, wrote an op-ed published by Bloomberg stating the U.S. \u201cis weaponizing the dollar to preserve its global economic and geopolitical position.\u201d\n\nDas made no mention of India\u2019s dumping of U.S. Treasuries but did point to sanctions targeting people, business entities, organizations and entire countries.\n\n\u201cThis gives the nation extraterritorial reach over non-Americans trading with or financing a sanctioned party,\u201d Das wrote.\n\nThe term, \u201cweaponization\u201d also came up in an article in Forbes by Charles Wallace, on the topic of countries like Russia, Iran, and Turkey announcing plans to trade in local currencies rather than dollars. This notion that those countries would move away from the dollar has been discussed by Russian leaders for many years now, usually in relation with countries such as China, Turkey, and Egypt. It has been brought to the forefront due to the Trump administrations imposition of sanctions on Iran and Turkey. Trading in local currencies would make such countries less dependent on the dollar, but this also carry serious risks as well, given that these currencies tend to be less stable.\n\nBack to the topic of this fact check: India.None of the analyses we point to cite U.S. currency \u201cweaponization\u201d as a reason for India\u2019s sell off.Nor is the Turkish lira crisis, which others have blamed on the U.S., the only factor in the Indian rupee\u2019s recent decline. And so we find Spunik\u2019s claim was false.", "lang": "en"}
