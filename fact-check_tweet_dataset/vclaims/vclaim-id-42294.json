Along with this message, a video of UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath aka Ajay Singh Bisht is being shared profusely on social media platforms. The video shows Adityanath sharing a light moment with Bihar governor Lalji Tandon.\n\nThe above tweet is by a Youth Congress leader, tweeted in the morning of February 20. On Facebook, several individual users have shared the video with identical text, indicating that the same is viral on WhatsApp. It has been posted by the page Bluffmaster Modiwhich has a following of over 450,000 and by the page Bhakton Ke Papa.\n\nThe story is the same on Twitter.\n\nThe 16-second long video clip in which UP CM Yogi Adityanath, seen chuckling along with Bihar governor Lalji Tandon, is not related to the Pulwama attack. Adityanath was not paying homage to Pulwama martyrs as claimed. The video was shot in October 2018 during the final rites of N D Tiwari, who had passed away on October 18.\n\nThe video had caused controversy back in October 2018 and had left the BJP embarrassed. Earlier, an old photo of PM Narendra Modi and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar sharing a laugh, was circulated as a recent photo taken after the Pulwama attack.", "lang": "en"}
