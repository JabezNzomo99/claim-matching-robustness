Yet Mayor Kasim Reed has, under the housing strategy, pledged to cut by 10 percent the number of residents who are cost burdened on rent by 2020, according to an opinion piece this summer by his deputy planning commissioner.\n\nThe city may have its work cut out for it on that front.\n\nTo verify the strategy report, we looked at the Census data cited in the chart.\n\nThe 2012 American Community Survey estimates that of 103,219 households in Atlanta in 2012, 50,509 of them spent 30 percent or more of their income on housing.\n\nThat\u2019s 49 percent of city households \u2013 and 10,000 more than plotted in the city\u2019s chart.\n\nThe survey for 2014, released just last week, isn\u2019t even that rosy.\n\nOf 105,999 households now estimated in the city, 52,787 of them paid more than 30 percent of their income on rent in the past 12 months.\n\nThat\u2019s just a hair under half of households.\n\nThe only improvement? Those scrambling the most to keep up with rent \u2013 households spending more than 50 percent of their income on housing \u2013 dipped by 574 households, to 27,100 in 2014.\n\nThat\u2019s a full percentage drop \u2013 but still 26 percent out of city households.\n\nHow does Atlanta stack up?\n\nFor context, PolitiFact Georgia tried to find out if one out of every four households spending half of their income for a place to sleep was unusual.\n\nRenters are on the rise in the 11 most populous American metro areas, Atlanta included.\n\nA May report by New York University's Furman Center, which studies real estate and urban policy, and Capital One bank, found each of those cities saw the amount of rental housing grow faster than any increase in owner-occupied homes in 2013.\n\nYet despite that growth, renters everywhere struggled to keep up with increasing rents and shrinking vacancies.\n\nAtlanta, for instance, saw the vacancy rate drop from 16 percent to 9.9 percent between 2006 and 2013. Median monthly rents, meanwhile, jumped 8 percent in that period, from $888 to $963.\n\nAnd in Atlanta and the other 10 cities, more than three out of every five low-income renters were severely rent burdened \u2013 paying more than half of their income on rent.\n\nA left-leaning housing advocate championed a scorecard of new housing development in Atlanta by claiming that \"tens of thousands\" of households in the city paid more than 30 percent of their income on rent.\n\nThey do, whether looking at the city\u2019s housing strategy plan or the 2012 U.S. Census estimates that shaped the report. By 2014, those estimates had grown even worse.\n\nAnd, Matthew Charles Cardinale would have been on target with an even more dramatic claim: More than a quarter of Atlanta households spent more than half of their incomes on housing.\n\nAtlanta faces the same challenges as other large cities in serving a growing rental population. To do so will require the right data.\n\nAnd Cardinale hits the mark with his claim about affordable housing in Atlanta. We rate his claim True.", "lang": "en"}
