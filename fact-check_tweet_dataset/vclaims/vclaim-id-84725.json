In the 46 second long video a group of policemen can be seen running followed by angry protestors who are throwing stones and sticks at them. The accompanying claim says, \u201cAngry Public is chasing away police in Assam after NRC\u201d, suggesting that the video depicts public anger against NRC. Names of over 19 lakh people were left out of the final National Register of Citizens (NRC) published on August 31., 2019 This has been a cause of apprehension among various sections of people and has led to several protests.\n\nSeveral Facebook users shared the video with the same message.\n\nThe video is also being shared on WhatsApp with an identical narrative.\n\nAlt News broke the video into several frames using InVid, and reverse-searched some of these frames on yandex. We came across a YouTube video uploaded on July 26th, 2018, claiming to be of Maratha Andolan from Aurangabad.\n\nWe also found that several Facebook users had uploaded the video on 25th July, 2018 with a similar claim.\n\nThe same video was uploaded by Principal Correspondent at Times of India, Mohammed Akhef on 25th July, 2018. In the accompanying tweet, he had stated that the video was of July 24th 2018 and it showed police retreating from Kaigaon Toka bridge on Godavari River where the agitators got violent.\n\nIn conclusion, a one year old video of Maratha Andolan from Aurangabad is being shared on social media with a false narrative of police chased by angry public in Assam after NRC.", "lang": "en"}
