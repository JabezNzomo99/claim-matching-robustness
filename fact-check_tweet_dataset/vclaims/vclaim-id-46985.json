No, that's misleading: ActBlue is a non-profit tech platform that facilitates online fundraising for political campaigns and organizations, including Black Lives Matter, but they pass the donations on to those groups.\n\nThe claim appeared as an article published by The National Pulse on June 11, 2020 titled \"EXCLUSIVE: Black Lives Matter Website, 'Defund The Police' Donations Go to 'Act Blue', The 'Biden For President' Campaign's Top Source of Donations\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe article claims the Biden campaign \"may\" be profiting from the Black Lives Matter fundraising.\n\nThe article cites \"ActBlue\" as the connection between the Biden campaign and Black Lives Matter, warning that the Black Lives Matter organization is promoting \"Defund the police,\" which the former vice-president has said he did not support.\n\nActBlue is an organization that facilitates online fundraising for both political campaigns and organizations. ActBlue explains on their website they are organized as a political action committee and facilitate donations to political candidates, but they are not donating to political candidates.\n\nActBlue does charge a 3.95% processing fee, according to its website:\n\nWe want as many groups as possible to be able to create strong grassroots fundraising programs. Our platform is available to Democratic candidates and committees, progressive organizations, and nonprofits that share our values for no cost besides a 3.95% processing fee on donations. And we operate as a conduit, which means donations made through ActBlue to a campaign or organization are considered individual donations. You can read more about our structure here.\n\nTo put this simply, ActBlue is the vendor that is a website that takes donations for political candidates and charitable donations. If you go to a website to donate to Black Lives Matter or to the Biden for President campaign, you will be routed to ActBlue for your donation to be processed. The money does not go into one large pot. It is kept separate for each candidate or organization.\n\nActBlue is not raising the money for the Biden campaign, they are the conduit for payments to be made.\n\nThe article misleadingly claims that ActBlue is directly giving money to the Biden for President campaign:\n\nThis amount is true but that has come from 3,565,414 donors, listed as \"number of payments,\" not from ActBlue as a donor.\n\nThe National Pulse also use a graphic to show ActBlue's top vendors/recipients with 10 democratic campaigns. However, ActBlue is the payment processor for these campaigns, not an actual donor. The money is coming from individual who are making the contributions through the website to the individual campaigns.\n\nThe false claim has been repeated in various forms, including this TikTok video:", "lang": "en"}
