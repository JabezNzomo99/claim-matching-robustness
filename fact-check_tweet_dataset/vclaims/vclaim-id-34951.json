One of the children in a dirty and torn yellow t-shirt has been encircled and it is being claimed that it is the childhood picture of Jack Ma, Chinese business magnate and co-founder of Alibaba Group.\n\nAlong with the photo, there are multiple claims in the viral post which apparently explains how Jack Ma overcame rejections in his life.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The boy encircled in the photo is not Jack Ma but Fan Xiaoqin, an 8-year-old from China who, as per reports, has a striking resemblance to the Alibaba founder. However, the other claims related to Jack Ma\u2019s struggle are almost true.\n\nThis post is quite viral on Facebook since September 2018. Netizens are also sharing this post on Twitter.\n\nWith the help of reverse search, we found many news articles carrying the viral photo. The encircled boy in the viral photo is reportedly Fan Xiaoqin, a lookalike of Jack Ma. He is also known as Mini Jack Ma in China. In the viral photo, Xiaoqin is posing with his family.\n\nXiaoqin\u2019s photos and videos went viral in China in 2016 when it was found that he looks like Jack Ma.\n\nAs per a BBC report, the Xiaoqin family lives in China\u2019s Jiangxi province, are poor and rely on government benefits.\n\nAlthough, at the World Economic Forum summit in 2018, Jack Ma also said that he was born in a very poor family and never got a great education.\n\nAFWA probed the other claims in the viral post reflecting Jack Ma\u2019s struggle and found that they are almost correct.\n\nClaim 1: Jack Ma was the only person who was turned down among 24 applicants for a KFC job.\n\nClaim 2: He scored just 1 mark out of 120 in mathematics in his college entrance examination.\n\nClaim 3: Jack Ma could not convince Silicon Valley to fund Alibaba.\n\nClaim 5: Jack Ma was turned down for 30 jobs.\n\nAt the World Economic Forum summit in 2015, Jack Ma said similar things about himself while speaking about the struggles and rejections he faced in his life.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that though the viral photo has no relation with Jack Ma\u2019s childhood, but from reports available on the Internet, one can say that he has a rags-to-riches story.", "lang": "en"}
