But images it features have been doctored; one actually pictures Biden with a group of people, and another was shot outdoors.\n\n\u201cDeep in the heart of Delaware, Joe Biden sits in his basement. Alone. Hiding. Diminished,\u201d says a narrator in the ad, which was tweeted by the Trump campaign\u2019s official account on August 5, 2020.\n\nThe same ad was also posted on Trump\u2019s official Facebook page.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign has repeatedly accused Biden -- who has limited his public appearances during the deadly coronavirus pandemic -- of \u201chiding.\u201d The US president has meanwhile campaigned from the White House, and held a controversial rally in June.\n\nIn the ad, the words \u201cAlone\u201d and \u201cHiding\u201d appear on a photo that seems to show an isolated Biden sitting on the floor.\n\nBut it has been darkened, and it has been cropped to exclude the group of people who appeared in the original, which was shot by Liz Martin for The Gazette in December 2019. The Iowa newspaper said the image was used without its permission.\n\nThe word \u201cDiminished\u201d then appears on another image of Biden, which seems to show him indoors with a hand raised to his forehead.\n\nBut the outdoors background in the original -- shot by Mark Peterson for an October 2019 POLITICO article -- has been removed, as has the microphone Biden was holding.\n\nAFP Fact check has previously debunked misleadingly edited videos that Trump has spread of Biden and former Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer.", "lang": "en"}
