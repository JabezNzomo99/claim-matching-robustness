It\u2019s not an easy question to answer, and the latest research being referred to doesn\u2019t answer it.\n\nIt\u2019s actually not meant to. The study\u2014done by the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation in the US\u2014looked at 11 rich countries and compared their healthcare systems on a number of criteria, ranking the UK in first place. The authors told us the analysis didn\u2019t distinguish between NHS and private healthcare in the UK, or between countries within the UK (each of which has a separate system).\n\nStudies like these also need to make a lot of judgement calls about what to consider in forming the rankings: how valuable is equal access, for example, compared to timely care? What you consider to be a good healthcare system might not be the same as what this research takes as its starting point.\n\nNone of these points mean the research itself is bad: the problems start when the ranking is passed off as the final word on how the NHS is doing compared to other countries.\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund report covered Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nThe UK was ranked first overall, though its performance varied across the five areas. It was ranked first for \u2018Care Process\u2019 and \u2018Equity\u2019, third for \u2018Access\u2019 and \u2018Administrative Efficiency\u2019, but second-to-last for \u2018Health Care Outcomes\u2019.\n\nThe previous Commonwealth Fund report in 2014 also placed the UK first overall.\n\nThe study wasn\u2019t actually focused on the NHS\u2014which is different depending on which UK country you\u2019re in\u2014but on the UK healthcare system as a whole. The authors told us the surveys were weighted to take account the size of each country in the UK and so the bulk of the UK results would reflect the performance of NHS England.\n\n80% of spending on UK healthcare in 2015 was by the government, largely on NHS services.\n\nThe five main areas were broken down and assessed using surveys of patients and doctors plus official statistics from the OECD, WHO and European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies. The existence of comparable data between countries influenced which measures were chosen, so things like mental health and long-term care services are not well covered.\n\nThe Nuffield Trust health think tank noted in response to the Fund\u2019s previous report that:\n\n\u201cThese results provide only a partial view of health care quality and how patients and physicians answer the questions may be affected by their own experiences and expectations; which are likely to differ across countries, cultures and population groups. For example, if the British are generally positive about their health care system and have lower expectations than say the Norwegians, the UK system will score better.\u201d\n\nEach of the five main areas assessed by the Commonwealth Fund was weighted equally. So, for example, a service being affordable and timely (access) was as important as the difference in care reported by people with higher and lower incomes (equity).\n\nA lot rests on choices like these, according to the King\u2019s Fund and Nuffield Trust health think tanks. The King\u2019s Fund weighed in on a previous version of this study:\n\n\u201cThe Commonwealth Fund\u2019s study is primarily designed to highlight poor performance in the US system. As we\u2019re good at lots of things that the US isn\u2019t \u2013 like access to care\u2014we come out particularly well\u201d\n\nIt went on to stress that this didn\u2019t mean comparative rankings like the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s are misleading or unhelpful\u2014they can raise questions and highlight areas that need attention.\n\nThe Nuffield Trust, meanwhile, also commented on the latest study, saying that \u201cWhile the NHS does well on a number of measures including efficiency, affordability, equity and some aspects of the process of care, it performs poorly in terms of outcomes.\u201d\n\nIt says that because the five themes examined by the Commonwealth Fund are given equal weight, the fact the UK does well in some \u201cswamps the effect of its disappointing outcomes on its overall score.\u201d\n\nIt concludes \u201cOne thing is clear though: just because a ranking system produces a result we like does not mean that it is the final word.\u201d\n\nDifferent international comparisons look at different countries and measure healthcare performance in different ways.\n\nThe Euro Health Consumer Index ranked the UK 15th out of 35 European countries at the start of this year (although the authors point out that precise rankings aren\u2019t that important). This was based on 48 measures across six areas, chosen to reflect patients\u2019 experiences.\n\nA 2015 study by the Nuffield Trust and Health Foundation compared the healthcare systems of 15 countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the United States and the UK). It found that for 14 out of 27 measures the UK performed worse than other countries, although it did note that the UK\u2019s performance was \u201cstable or improving\u201d in 25 of the areas.", "lang": "en"}
