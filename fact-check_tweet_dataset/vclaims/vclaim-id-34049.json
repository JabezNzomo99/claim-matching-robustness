Her most recent album, entitled \u201cCuz I Love You,\u201d peaked at number four on the Billboard 200 chart. Lizzo has been nominated for eight Grammy awards.\n\nThe alleged tweet, which was screen grabbed and posted on Facebook, masquerades as a breaking news alert from TMZ, saying, \u201cBREAKING: 4 dead, 12 injured after artist Lizzo performed a stage dive at a show in New York.\u201d It appears to be an attempt at body-shaming the Grammy-nominated artist.\n\nYet, while it mimics the breaking news format used by some outlets on Twitter, TMZ has never tweeted this news alert. It doesn\u2019t appear anywhere on the entertainment news outlet\u2019s verified Twitter account. Nor can any story be found on TMZ\u2019s website.

If Lizzo had performed one, it would have been picked up by the media, yet no news outlets have reported it, and social media users haven\u2019t documented any instances.\n\nLizzo made her \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d debut on Dec. 21, performing her hit songs \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d and \u201cGood as Hell,\u201d according to Rolling Stone.", "lang": "en"}
