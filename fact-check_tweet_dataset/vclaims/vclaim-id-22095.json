{"title": "FACT CHECK: Did Immigrants Dominate the U.S. Nobel Prize Tally in 2016 and 2017?", "subtitle": "Foreign-born, U.S.-based scientists and economists won a remarkable number of Nobel prizes in the last two years, but they didn't get them all.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2018-01-31T17:56:42+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-22095", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/immigrants-nobel-prize/", "vclaim": "Of the six U.S.-based Nobel science laureates in 2017, all were immigrants; every U.S.-based laureate in 2016 was also born outside the country.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2017, eight out 15 U.S.-based science and economics laureates were immigrants (53 percent) not the 100 percent claimed in the meme.\n\nOf the seven U.S.-based Nobel laureates in 2016, six were not born in the United States; if you restrict the numbers to science and economics, six out of six were immigrants.\n\nImmigration was the subject of heated political debate in the United States in early 2018, amid negotiations between the Trump administration and Congressional Democrats over the future of the DACA program, and the president\u2019s much-touted border wall, and after reports that Trump had made disparaging remarks about immigration from \u201cshithole countries\u201d at a private meeting with Senators.\n\nIn this climate, the liberal Facebook page God Bless the United States posted a meme on 17 January 2018, which made an interesting claim about the contribution of certain immigrants to advancements in science in the United States. It read:\n\nThe meme was shared 97,000 times within two weeks, and was originally posted by the left-wing Occupy Democrats page in October 2017, garnering 55,000 shares.\n\nWe received several enquiries from readers wondering about the accuracy of these claims. The numbers stated in the meme don\u2019t quite check out, although immigrants have historically made up a remarkably high proportion of Nobel laureates based in the United States.\n\nThe question of whether economics is a science \u2014 the subject of considerable debate \u2014 also plays a small role in calculating the figures.\n\nIn 2017, there were seven \u201cnatural science\u201d laureates (physics, chemistry and medicine) based in the U.S. at the time of their award, and only two of them were born outside the United States. If we add the American recipient of the \u201ceconomic sciences\u201d prize, that ratio becomes two out of eight.\n\nIn 2016, the meme says, \u201call six U.S. noble [sic] prize winners were also immigrants.\u201d There is no stipulation here that this relates only to science, so we\u2019ll take into account every category.\n\nThat year, all four U.S.-based \u201cnatural science\u201d laureates were born in the United Kingdom, and the two \u201ceconomic sciences\u201d awardees were also based in the U.S. but born abroad. However, Bob Dylan (who was born in the U.S.) won the Nobel prize for literature, which means six out of seven U.S.-based laureates were immigrants in 2016.\n\nOver the two years, then, the proportion of U.S.-based laureates born outside the U.S. (science-only in 2017, all categories in 2016) was:\n\u2022 Eight out of 14 (if you don\u2019t count economics as a science) or\n\u2022 Eight out of 15 (if you do)\n\nThat\u2019s more than half, by both measures, but still off of the Occupy Democrats\u2019 claim that 12 out of 12 were immigrants.\n\nHere\u2019s a list of every science laureate (including economics) affiliated with a U.S. institution at the time of their award, in 2017, and every U.S.-based laureate of any kind, in 2016.\n\nWe are taking \u201cimmigrant\u201d to mean someone living in a country they weren\u2019t born in and who arrived in the U.S. as an immigrant, but some of these individuals have acquired American citizenship and lived in the United States for many years.\n\u2022 Barry C. Barish: Born in Nebraska; affiliated with Caltech \u2014 Not an immigrant\n\u2022 Kip S. Thorne: Born in Utah; affiliated with Caltech \u2014 Not an immigrant.\n\u2022 Jeffrey C. Hall: Born in New York; affiliated with the University of Maine \u2014 Not an immigrant\n\u2022 Michael Rosbash: Born in Kansas City, Missouri; affiliated with Brandeis University \u2014 Not an immigrant\n\u2022 Michael W. Young: Born in Florida; affiliated with Rockefeller University \u2014 Not an immigrant.\n\u2022 Richard H. Thaler: Born in New Jersey; affiliated with the University of Chicago \u2014 Not an immigrant.\n\u2022 David J. Thouless: Born in the U.K.; affiliated with the University of Washington \u2014 Immigrant\n\u2022 F. Duncan M. Haldane: Born in the U.K.; affiliated with Princeton University \u2014 Immigrant\n\u2022 J. Michael Kosterlitz: Born in the U.K.; affiliated with Brown University \u2014 Immigrant (Has dual U.S.-U.K. citizenship)\n\u2022 Sir J. Fraser Stoddart: Born in the U.K.; affiliated with Northwestern University \u2014 Immigrant\n\u2022 Oliver Hart: Born in the U.K.; affiliated with Harvard University \u2014 Immigrant\n\u2022 Bob Dylan: Born in the U.S.; lives in the U.S \u2014 Not an immigrant.\n\nThe question of whether economics is a science is a hotly-contested one. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the annual Nobel prize in \u201ceconomic sciences\u201d certainly appears to view it as such.\n\nHowever, the 2013 prize \u2014 which saw two economists with contradictory views on financial markets both share the award \u2014 prompted a wave of debate about whether economics is really a science, with notable contributions from Harvard professor Raj Chetty, New York Times columnist (and Nobel laureate) Paul Krugman and Robert Shiller, one of the recipients of that year\u2019s economics prize.\n\nSetting aside this distinction, and acknowledging that the numbers provided by Occupy Democrats don\u2019t quite check out, the contribution of immigrants to the United States\u2019 Nobel Prize tally has still been extraordinary over the years.\n\nIf we take into account all categories, going back to the year 2000, our analysis shows that out of the 122 Nobel laureates who were based in the U.S. at the time of their award, 39 were not born in the United States. That\u2019s 32 percent.\n\nGiven that the foreign-born population of the United States as a whole was 12.9 percent at the last census in 2010, this suggests that foreign-born researchers and scholars have made an outsized contribution at the highest levels of American science and economics.\n\nThis trend is particularly pronounced in the natural sciences. Out of the 83 physics, chemistry and medicine laureates based in the U.S. since 2000, some 32 were born outside the United States, which is 39 percent.", "lang": "en"}
