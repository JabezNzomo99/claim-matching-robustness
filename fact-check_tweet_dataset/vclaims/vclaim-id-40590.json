Writer Ravi Rai had also tweeted the claim, but later deleted it. The archived version of his tweet can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be false. The viral video is more than eight years old and has no relation to the ongoing anti-CAA protests. The incident took place in 2011 in Punjab\u2019s Mohali.\n\nThe video has gone viral on Facebook.\n\nWith the help of keyword searches such as turban removed by police on YouTube, we found several videos of the incident.\n\nYouTube channel Sikh Touch had uploaded the same video on March 31, 2011, with the caption, Sikh Youth\u2019s turban removed 28 March 2011 @ Mohali Stadium Mohali Stadium by a Punjab Police.\n\nSeveral YouTubers such as Paul Singh and YouTube channels such as Chardikla TimeTv have uploaded similar videos of the same incident with captions which broadly say that Punjab police removed the turban of a man. These videos were uploaded between March 28 and 31, 2011.\n\nWhat happened in Mohali on March 28, 2011?\n\nWe looked for news reports related to the incident and found that The Times of India and The Indian Express had covered it during that time.\n\nAs per these reports, the incident was the fallout of a standoff between protesting rural veterinary pharmacists and Punjab police near Mohali\u2019s PCA Stadium. The protest took place on March 28, 2011, just two days before the high-voltage ICC Cricket World Cup semi-final between India and Pakistan at Mohali stadium.\n\nAccording to The Indian Express, at around 12.45 pm, hundreds of retrenched veterinary pharmacists, who were already in an indefinite protest seeking restoration and regularisation of their services, began marching towards the stadium. Police tried to disperse the crowd forcefully when they tried to enter the high-security zone.\n\nUnited Sikhs, a global organisation of Sikhs, had filed a complaint against the Punjab police before the Mohali judicial magistrate for removing a Sikh youth\u2019s turban near PCA stadium, Mohali, on 28th March, 2011.\n\nOn March 31, 2011, The Times of India reported that two gazetted officers of Punjab police, including an SP and SHO, have been suspended for allegedly removing the turban of a Sikh protester.\n\nThe eight-year-old video of a policeman removing a man\u2019s turban in Mohali has been falsely linked with the ongoing anti-CAA protests in the viral claim. This is not a Muslim impersonating a Sikh as claimed in the viral post.", "lang": "en"}
