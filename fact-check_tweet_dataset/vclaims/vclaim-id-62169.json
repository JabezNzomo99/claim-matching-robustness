PepsiCo\u2019s announcement of over $400 million to \u201clift up Black communities and Black representation at PepsiCo\u201d does not mention donating to Black Lives Matter.\n\nThe post urges other Facebook users to boycott PepsiCo, which owns a variety of food and drink brands, for allegedly donating $100 million to Black Lives Matter. The Black Lives Matter movement rekindled after George Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis police custody in late May, according to CNN.\n\nWhile the PepsiCo subsidiary Gatorade did announce on June 3 that it would be donating $500,000 to four organizations, including Black Lives Matter, PepsiCo does not appear to have done so. PepsiCo\u2019s statement announcing it will commit over $400 million over five years to \u201clift up Black communities and Black representation at PepsiCo\u201d does not mention donating to the organization.\n\nHere are the funds PepsiCo committed in its announcement:\n\u2022 $25 million to \u201cestablish scholarship support for students transitioning from 2-year to 4-year programs,\u201d as well as to support \u201ctrade/certificate and academic 2-year degrees through community colleges\u201d for black students\n\u2022 $350 million to increase its spending with Black-owned suppliers\n\nPepsiCo further announced in the statement that it would expand its Food for Good initiative, increase its contributions to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and increase its current black manager population by 30 percent, among other things.

Alix Ekstrom, director of brand communications for Pepsi, told Check Your Fact in an email, \u201cThe Pepsi brand did not contribute to this organization.\u201d\n\nThe claim may have stemmed from a July 16 segment with Lou Dobbs on Fox Business, where he stated that businesses such as PepsiCo and Bank of America were donating money to Black Lives Matter. Dobbs later issued a correction both during his broadcast and on Twitter.", "lang": "en"}
