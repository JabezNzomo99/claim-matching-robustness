Critics say that raising the minimum wage kills jobs, makes it harder for companies to hire new workers, and adds to the costs of goods and services for everyone.\n\n, a Facebook group that wants Congress to pass an $11 minimum wage, is criticizing Congress, claiming it\u2019s quick to give itself pay increases but slow to raise the minimum wage.\n\nIt posted a picture of the Internet's well-known \"Grumpy Cat\" accompanied by this message : \"Since 1988, Congress has raised its own salary 15 times 'to reflect rising costs.' But raised the minimum wage only three times.\" It has been shared more than 8,800 times.\n\nWe wondered whether the data are correct.\n\nTo count the number of minimum wage increases since 1988, we turned to the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor. Its handy shows that in 1981, Congress had set the minimum wage at $3.35 per hour, where it remained until April 1, 1990, when it rose to $3.80.\n\nSince then, there have been six additional increases. That's seven in all, not three as the Facebook post asserts.\n\nAnd how often has Congressional pay increased?\n\nFor that data, we turned to by the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan think tank for Congress, which tracked pay going back to 1789.\n\nIn 1988, members of Congress earned $89,500 per year.\n\nThe following year, Congress passed a law establishing automatic pay increases for itself unless the House and Senate specifically voted to forego raises, which it has done repeatedly . The law was amended in 1991.\n\nSince then, members of the House have seen their annual pay increase 14 times. The Senate has received 15 increases, which is the number the Facebook post got correct. Members of both bodies now receive $174,000 per year, with leaders receiving additional pay.\n\nSo where did Raise the Minimum Wage get the idea that there have only been three minimum wage increases? It comes from that fact that the seven increases were the result of , in 1989, 1996 and 2007. By that standard, Congress has only voted twice to increase its pay, although those votes produced 15 pay hikes.\n\nOne commenter on the Facebook page said, \"The minimum wage should be increased by the same percent each time Congress gets a pay raise.\"\n\nIn fact, the minimum wage is now 116 percent higher than it was in 1988. By contrast, the pay for members of Congress has increased by 94 percent and by 97 percent.\n\nA posting by the Facebook group Raise the Minimum Wage said, \"Since 1988, Congress has raised its own salary 15 times 'to reflect rising costs.' But raised the minimum wage only three times.\"\n\nAlthough Congress has scored 15 pay increases thanks to the automatic formula it adopted in 1989, it has also approved seven increases in the minimum wage during that period, not three.\n\nBecause the posting ignores more than half the minimum wage increases since 1988 while giving the false impression that Congress has actively voted itself raises 15 times, we rate the statement .", "lang": "en"}
