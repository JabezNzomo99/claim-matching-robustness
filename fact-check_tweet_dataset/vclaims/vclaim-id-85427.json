The purpose was to update 1992 estimates that 43 percent of women of reproductive age would have an abortion by age 45. The abortion rate had declined since 1992, and researchers hypothesized that the proportion of women who will have an abortion during their lifetime also probably declined since then.\n\nResearchers used survey data to find the first abortion rate for age subgroups, multiplied the rate by the number of years in each age group, and added up the number of first-time abortions that had taken place by the time women were 45 years old. This was called the \u201ccumulative first abortion rate,\u201d through which they came up with the \u201clifetime incidence\u201d of abortion, or the \u201cone in three\u201d figure.\n\nResearchers found that the proportion of women expected to have an abortion by 45 decreased from 43 percent in 1992 to 30 percent in 2008, and this decline paralleled the decline in abortion rates during that period. While the number of abortions decreased among most subgroups of women except women who were poor, cohabiting, ages 20 to 24 or non-Hispanic African Americans.\n\nRachel Jones, Guttmacher Institute\u2019s principal research scientist who conducted the abortion rate and lifetime incidence studies, said it\u2019s \u201cquite possible\u201d that the \u201cone in three\u201d statistic has changed because of the decline in abortion rate since 2008. (Studies show the abortion rate declined further between 2011 and 2013.) But it\u2019s impossible to predict whether the lifetime incidence statistic would increase or decrease, because it depends on how the number of women having first-time abortions changed during that period.\n\nGuttmacher Institute is now analyzing 2014 Abortion Patient Survey results from more than 8,000 women. This survey is done every six to eight years, and this is the first update since 2008. An updated figure for the \u201cone in three\u201d lifetime incidence will not be available until early 2017, Jones said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m reluctant to say it will probably go down. It\u2019s certainly possible,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe abortion rate was going down from 1992 to 2008, and we saw a substantial decline from lifetime incidence of abortion. Intuitively, we would see a decline \u2026 based on past patterns. But again, it\u2019s a little more complicated than that, and so I can\u2019t make any predictions.\u201d\n\nTeen birth, teen pregnancy and teen abortion rates also have declined since 2008. If most of the abortion rate decline is due substantially to declining teen abortions, it may not have much effect on the overall lifetime incidence, Jones said. If large numbers of teens had abortions after they aged out of the 15-19 range, the lifetime incidence would not change by much.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to end the shame and stigma around people who support or exercise their abortion rights and go on offense. We need to support women\u2019s rights to have full and productive lives, and make their own decisions about what\u2019s right for their health and their families,\u201d Chaudhary said. \u201cWhether the Guttmacher Institute figures go slightly up or down, what doesn\u2019t change is the stigma associated with abortion and the impact it has on those who decide to have one.\u201d\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute, which came up with the statistic, calculated the \u201cone in three\u201d estimate based on 2008 abortion rates. If the same rate prevailed, the estimate would still be applicable. The organization is now coming up with a new calculation. Without the breakdown of first-time abortions of women ages 15 to 44 in 2014, we can\u2019t definitively say whether this statistic would increase or decrease, or by how much \u2014 though previous trends indicate it could decrease. Guttmacher Institute tends to include the caveat in most references, but not always \u2014 such as the graphic that UltraViolet used as a source for its video.\n\nOrganizations, such as UltraViolet, repeating this figure need to include this caveat in their materials. This statistic is widely cited. At The Fact Checker, we have been critical of politicians and organizations citing data without doing enough due diligence to understand how old the statistics are. The \u201cone in three\u201d figure was an estimate based on the 2008 abortion rate, which has gone down since then.\n\nThe decline in abortion rates from 1992 to 2008 saw a parallel decline in the proportion of women expected to have an abortion by 45. We don\u2019t know yet if the 2014 data, which is being calculated right now, will show the same trend. But until early 2017, when Guttmacher Institute plans to release the updated findings, this \u201cone in three\u201d figure should be treated with caution and always accompanied by the appropriate caveat.", "lang": "en"}
