The Trump administration has taken a number of steps to combat foreign interference in future elections.\n\u2022 The Department of Homeland Security has developed partnerships in all 50 states to help state and local election officials defend against interference in their elections, providing services such as vulnerability assessments and expertise in technology security.\n\u2022 The FBI director says his agency has been working with social media and technology companies, sharing \u201cspecific threat indicators and account information, and a variety of other pieces of information so that they can better monitor their own platforms\u201d to combat influence campaigns such as the one Russia engaged in during the 2016 election.\n\u2022 The Office of the Director of National Intelligence led an inter-agency working group of cyber and intelligence experts to improve election security.\n\u2022 Trump expanded sanctions against Russians who were involved in or facilitated interference in the 2016 election.\n\u2022 Trump signed an executive order that will, among other things, give the president discretion to impose sanctions on foreign countries that interfere in U.S. elections.\n\nWhile the administration claims Trump has taken \u201chistoric actions\u201d and implemented a \u201cwhole-of-government approach to safeguard our nation\u2019s elections,\u201d some have argued that the administration\u2019s efforts have not gone far enough to effectively combat the problem. Others have faulted Trump for not taking a harder public stance against Russian interference. That\u2019s fair for politicians to debate. But election security experts say the president and his administration have taken some positive steps to combat foreign meddling in U.S. elections.\n\nClinton\u2019s overreach reminds us of when Trump wrongly claimed that President Barack Obama \u201cdid nothing\u201d in the months leading up to the 2016 presidential election about Russia meddling in the election. As we wrote then, among other things, Obama spoke to Putin about the issue in September 2016, and his administration worked with state officials from mid-August until Election Day to prevent voting systems from being hacked.\n\nThen, as now, the rhetoric about presidential inaction goes too far.\n\nClinton\u2019s comment came in an op-ed for The Atlantic, published on Sept. 16 under the headline \u201cAmerican Democracy Is in Crisis.\u201d Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee who lost the 2016 election to Trump, argued that \u201cthe legitimacy of our elections is in doubt,\u201d adding, \u201cThere\u2019s Russia\u2019s ongoing interference and Trump\u2019s complete unwillingness to stop it or protect us.\u201d\n\nAs we have written, Trump has sent mixed messages on Russian meddling, at times acknowledging that he believes U.S. intelligence officials who concluded Russians interfered in the 2016 election. Other times, he has tempered those statements with other comments such as, \u201cNobody really knows for sure,\u201d or he has tweeted that the Russia investigation is \u201call a big hoax.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, he and the administration \u2014 at his direction \u2014 have taken numerous steps to combat Russian election meddling.\n\n\u201cThis appears to be one of those cases where the president\u2019s words belie his actions,\u201d said Charles Stewart III, a political science professor at MIT and one of the co-authors of a report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine on ways the government can work to protect U.S. elections from outside interference.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has done quite a lot to address Russia\u2019s ongoing interference with America\u2019s elections,\u201d Stewart told us via email. \u201cBecause some of this comes from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), it is fair to say that the administration has clearly been working to address this interference. Other actions have come from parts of the executive branch, such as the special counsel and the Election Assistance Commission, that probably can\u2019t be called \u2018the administration,\u2019 but is certainly part of the web of activities the administration has been involved with.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know for a fact that the DHS has been quite active working with state and local election officials to enhance the cyber defenses of election administration,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThey have worked with dispatch (after some bureaucratic foot-dragging) to get top election officials in each state security clearances, so that they and other security agencies can share classified information about what they know. They are helping to establish information-sharing organizations, like the Government Coordinating Council and MS-ISAC. They have worked directly with state and local election offices to do things like security scans and audits. If there\u2019s anything limiting DHS in this regard, it\u2019s that their capacity is beginning to be outstripped by demand.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the National Association of State Election Directors told us via email, \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) have been critical partners for state and local election officials in preparing for the November 6th midterm election and beyond. Both DHS and the EAC have provided guidance and best practices, and many states are taking advantage of free security services offered by DHS; those states that aren\u2019t using DHS services are using private vendors or in-state resources to accomplish the same goals.\u201d\n\nResponding to criticism from some Democrats that it wasn\u2019t addressing the problem, the White House put out a press release on Aug. 2 outlining a \u201cwhole-of-government approach to election security being implemented at [Trump\u2019s] direction.\u201d\n\nThe same day, a handful of Trump administration national security officials held a press conference to highlight the work being done to protect the integrity of the elections.\n\n\u201cThe president has specifically directed us to make the matter of election meddling and securing our election process a top priority,\u201d said Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, who warned in July that \u201cthe warning lights are blinking red again\u201d with regard to foreign attacks on the U.S. digital infrastructure.\n\nEfforts have been made, Coats said, \u201cto share more information across the federal government, as well as with state and local governments, and also with the public and the private sector.\u201d\n\nCoats said he leads an \u201cinteragency working group\u201d that meets weekly to ensure \u201celection security and integration of our efforts.\u201d\n\nFor DHS\u2019 part, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen said the agency has worked with state and local officials. \u201cWhether it\u2019s offering no-cost, voluntary technical assistance or sharing best practices for securing online voter registration databases, or providing technical advice on ransomware and destructive malware, our department stands ready to provide tailored support based on each jurisdiction\u2019s unique needs,\u201d she said.\n\nTo date, she said, \u201call 50 states, the District of Columbia and over 900 local governments have partnered with DHS in order to bolster the resilience of the nation\u2019s election infrastructure.\u201d\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray said that shortly after becoming director he created \u201ca new foreign influence taskforce at the FBI, which was designed to identify and counteract the full range of malign foreign influence operations targeting our democratic institutions and our values.\u201d\n\nWray also talked about increased information- and intelligence-sharing with state and local government officials and the private sector.\n\nThe FBI also has been working with social media and technology companies, providing classified briefings and sharing \u201cspecific threat indicators and account information, and a variety of other pieces of information so that they can better monitor their own platforms,\u201d Wray said. The special counsel\u2019s office earlier this year indicted three Russian organizations and 13 Russian nationals for allegedly engaging in an extensive plot during the 2016 campaign to \u201cproduce, purchase, and post advertisements on U.S. social media and other online sites expressly advocating for the election of then-candidate Trump or expressly opposing Clinton,\u201d according to the indictment.\n\nThe same day as the press conference, National Security Adviser John Bolton sent a letter to Senate Democrats highlighting the president\u2019s actions \u201cto ensure the integrity of our elections,\u201d such as leveling sanctions against Russia, expelling Russian intelligence officers and sanctioning Russian oligarchs and companies they control, all as a result of the Russian interference in the election.\n\nMore recently, Trump issued an executive order on Sept. 12 declaring a \u201cnational emergency\u201d to deal with the threat of foreign interference in U.S. elections.\n\nThe order instructs the director of national intelligence to conduct a post-election \u201cassessment of any information indicating that a foreign government, or any person acting as an agent of or on behalf of a foreign government, has acted with the intent or purpose of interfering in that election.\u201d It also would give the president the discretion to impose sanctions on governments found to have improperly interfered in U.S. elections.\n\nAll of those efforts show some tangible progress by the administration to confront and combat the issue of foreign meddling in the U.S. elections, election security experts told us.\n\n\u201cOn the positive side, numerous government agencies now have task forces focused on the threat of foreign interference in our elections or our democracy more broadly,\u201d David Salvo, deputy director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative that uses top national security experts to develop \u201ccomprehensive strategies to defend against, deter, and raise the costs on Russian and other state actors\u2019 efforts to undermine democracy and democratic institutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat shows there\u2019s a general consensus across government that Russian interference will remain a challenge, reflecting public statements on the issue by several Cabinet officials,\u201d Salvo told us via email. \u201cThere has also been an expansion of sanctions against Russian individuals who were involved in or facilitated interference operations in the United States and other forms of corruption.\u201d\n\nCould Be Doing More, Some Say\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t say they are doing nothing,\u201d said Jake Braun, a former White House liaison to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in the Obama administration who is now executive director of the University of Chicago\u2019s Cyber Policy Initiative.\n\nBut Braun, Salvo and other experts say there are other actions Trump should and could be taking, but has not.\n\nBraun told us in a phone interview that DHS has done cyber assessments and has distributed \u201cAlbert sensors,\u201d which can identify bad actors in a network. But these have gone to a \u201ctiny fraction\u201d of the election districts in the country, Braun said. \u201cWhile progress has been made, there is a lot more to be done.\u201d\n\nAdded Salvo, \u201cThrough legislation, Congress has given the administration wide latitude to expand sanctions against Russian individuals and sectors to really raise the cost of conducting interference operations against U.S. democracy, and the administration hasn\u2019t fully implemented that legislation. Furthermore, while the recent Executive Order is a positive step in terms of signaling the degree of seriousness with which the administration ostensibly views this threat, it still gives the president discretion whether to impose sanctions on those who interfere in our elections. There should be tripwires that trigger mandatory sanctions, as proposed in bipartisan legislation currently before Congress, rather than leaving everything for the president to decide.\n\n\u201cFinally, I\u2019d say that until the signing of the Executive Order, President Trump hasn\u2019t publicly demonstrated to the American people that he himself takes this threat seriously,\u201d Salvo said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing for his Director of National Intelligence or Secretary of State to say they believe Russian interference remains a threat. It\u2019s another entirely for President Trump to say so. Leadership from the highest levels is a critical form of deterrence to defend our democratic institutions and processes from foreign interference, and hopefully builds bipartisan consensus among American citizens and lawmakers that we need to take urgent action to defend against this threat. Going forward, we need more statements from the president that mirror his comments on the Executive Order.\u201d\n\nStewart \u2014 who was part of a committee including computer science and cybersecurity experts, legal and election scholars, social scientists, and election officials that spent two years researching the issue for the National Academies \u2014 said a president who was \u201claser-focused on this issue\u201d would:\n\u2022 \u201cState clearly that no one should mess with our election, and if they do, they should expect swift and meaningful retaliation.\n\u2022 Go to Congress to make sure that s/he had the authority to meet the first threat credibly.\n\u2022 Divert resources from other projects with the intelligence and security communities to respond to the various needs, big and small, that are evident right now.\n\u2022 Work with Congress to craft a comprehensive election security bill that will address more medium- and long-term issues, to be passed now, even if only implemented after the election.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s evidence of less-than-full movement on points 1 & 3, a reluctance to do # 2, and too much timidity to take the lead on # 4,\u201d Stewart said in an email.\n\nAnd while Congress authorized $380 million in March for states to bolster election security, Democrats have faulted Trump for failing to convince Republicans to support an amendment proposed in August that would have provided an additional $250 million to states to help them protect their elections. The amendment was rejected in a 50-47 vote, largely along partisan lines. Explaining Republican opposition, Sen. James Lankford said he wanted to see how the initial $380 million was spent before considering additional funding.\n\nAgain, there is room for political debate about whether Trump has done enough to address election security and the threat of interference from Russia. But Clinton went too far with her assertion that Trump has shown a \u201ccomplete unwillingness to stop\u201d it.", "lang": "en"}
