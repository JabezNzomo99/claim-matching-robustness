Pinoy News Portal has been known to share articles from the site newsglobal.info and memes involving Philippine politicians.\n\nThe facts: Villegas himself denied issuing a statement about acquitting the suspects in Christine Silawan's rape-slay case. In a message to Rappler, Villegas said the comment was fake and a \"ridiculous lie.\"\n\nFurther, Villegas's official Facebook page has not released any statement on Silawan's death and no news organization has reported on the same comment as having come from Villegas.\n\nThe Archbishop has been a target of falsehoods recently. Rappler earlier published a fact check on his supposed endorsement of the opposition slate for the 2019 Philippine elections. \u2013 Addie Pobre/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
