It was the first joint accord to be signed since 2000.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "June 15, 2020", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-46429", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/north-korea-moon-record-fact-check/30672437.html", "vclaim": "Editor's Note: This fact-check has been updated as indicated below.\n\nOn June 9, North Korea cut off all official and unofficial communication channels with South Korea, including the direct hotline between the Blue House (south) and the Forbidden City (north). The move was in response to the distribution of anti-North leaflets flown across the border in giant balloons by civilian activist groups.\n\n\u201cThe South Korean authorities connived at the hostile acts against the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] by the riff-raff, while trying to dodge heavy responsibility with nasty excuses,\u201d said the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).\n\nTwo days later, Ri Yong-Chul, a member of the North Korean People\u2019s Committee, explained the rationale for the DPRK\u2019s actions. His statement was published on Echo of Reunification, a North Korean radio channel, and it condemned the South Korean government for not being harsher with the anti-North groups.\n\nThe statement specifically took South Korean President Moon Jae-In to task:\n\n\u201c[President Moon] seemed more humane than previous leaders when he raised both of his hands high at Pyongyang and Mount Baekdu. Having come into power as a result of citizen candle protests, we believed he would be different. But now we believe he is not only the same, but actually worse than his predecessors.\u201d\n\nCompared to President Moon\u2019s most recent predecessors, Park Geun-Hye and Lee Myeong-Bak, the relationship between the two Koreas had seen significant improvement. In April 2018, Moon achieved the Panmunjom Declaration, in which he and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un laid out a plan to reunite the Korean peninsula.\n\nThe two leaders met in person at Pyongyang to discuss the declaration. In addition, they climbed up Mount Baekdu together as a gesture of peace. This was the first such meeting since one in 2000 under President Kim Dae-Jung, who received a Nobel Peace Prize largely for his efforts to reconcile with the communist North.\n\nMoon also helped arrange the three summits between Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump, the first time ever that meetings had taken place between leaders of the two countries. The summits, in Singapore, Vietnam, and the North-South Demilitarized Zone, initially raised hopes about the possibility of the denuclearization of North Korea, although the momentum has receded since the third meeting in June 2019.\n\nBy comparison, the North-South relationship was rocky at best under former presidents Park Geun-Hye and Lee Myeong-Bak.\n\nLee effectively abandoned Kim Dae-Jung\u2019s Sunshine Policy, which had eased some travel restrictions, as soon as he took office in 2010. His decision was prompted by the sinking of the ROKS Cheonan, a South Korean warship, believed to be North Korea\u2019s doing.\n\nPark shut down Kaesong Industrial Park, a collaborative economic project between the two Koreas. North Korea carried out five nuclear missile tests and more provocative firings until an influence-peddling scandal entangled Park and she was impeached for abuse of power and removed from office in 2017. Moon\u2019s election followed that year.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s response to the communications cut-off has been measured.\n\nOn June 10, the South Korean government announced that it would press charges against Fighters for a Free North Korea and Keun Saem, the two activist groups responsible for the flyers, for violating the Inter-Korean Exchange and Cooperation Act and shared marine and airspace legislation.\n\n\u201cNorthbound leafleting \u2026 creates tensions between the South and North and endangers the lives and safety of citizens living near the border,\u201d said Unification Ministry Spokesman Yoh Sang-key during a briefing.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe North-South hotline is crucial for communication and must be maintained under mutual agreement. We will continue to work toward maintaining peace and prosperity on the Korean peninsula.\u201d\n\nAnti-North leafleting has been a frequent issue. A report by the Unification Ministry estimates around 20 million leaflets have been flown across the border since 2010.\n\nAlthough South Korea has on occasion sent police officers to restrain the activists, the Moon government had been less eager to fully ban leafleting, citing freedom of speech.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s drastic response to the flyers is seen as likely the result of built-up frustration over growing financial difficulties. Commerce with its biggest trading partner, China, plummeted after the North closed its border to protect against the coronavirus. South Korea has been unenthusiastic about helping North Korea deal with the U.S.-led economic and financial sanctions aimed at forcing denuclearization.\n\nPyongyang resumed missile test flights this year, provoking tension with the U.S. Regarding the latest communications shutdown, a U.S. State Department spokesperson told the South Korean Yonhap News: \u201cThe United States is committed to engaging the DPRK in meaningful negotiations so that North Koreans can realize a brighter future.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea fired back, saying that the United States should stay out of the Korean peninsula or \u201cface terrible things.\u201d\n\nJune 12 was the second anniversary of the first Trump-Kim summit in Singapore, while June 25 marks the 70th anniversary of the start of the Korean War in 1950.\n\nDespite the North\u2019s rhetoric, Moon has remained conciliatory. In a statement at a commemorative event Monday (June 15), he noted: \u201cChairman Kim\u2019s groundbreaking efforts\u201d to improve North-South relations and bemoaned not making more progress.\n\n\u201cI also find it very unfortunate the North-U.S. and North-South relationships have not advanced as much as was hoped,\u201d he said.\n\nMoon also asked citizens to \u201cadhere to North-South agreements\u201d and North Korea to not to \u201cshut the windows of communication.\u201d\n\nUpdate: On June 16, North Korea used explosives to destroy a joint liaison office in the Kaesong Industrial Park, located north of the demilitarized zone between the countries. The facility had opened in 2018 a symbol of North-South cooperation but has been closed since January due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe explosion came after news reports of remarks Saturday by Kim\u2019s younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, who said the building was useless and ought to be destroyed. North Korean state media again referenced leaflets distributed by defectors as reason for the destruction.\n\nSouth Korea called the act \u201cvery unfortunate,\u201d warning that \u201call responsibilities lie within the North\u201d and any further provocations would result in \u201cstrong countermeasures.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
