It claims that the dogs and cats in the image are being set on fire and tortured.\n\nThe image was being circulated the same time when tensions between India and China got escalated as a result of the border conflict.\n\nSimilar posts can be seen here and here.\n\nALSO READ: Fact Check: Don\u2019t fall for this tweet falsely attributed to Sachin\u2026\n\nWe fact-checked the above image by searching it through the Google Reverse Image Search and found the claims to be misleading. Through the Reverse Search, we found that while the image is from Yunnan, China, it is from April 25, 2012, according to an article in the Daily Mail.\n\nThe headline of the article reads: \u201cThe ultimate dog\u2019s dinner: Hundreds of caged canines saved from the cooking pot by quick-thinking Chinese activists\u201d\n\nIt further states that dogs destined to be slaughtered and served up in China\u2019s restaurants were saved when the truck transporting them was intercepted by animal rights activists.\n\nThe vehicle, carrying 505 canines packed into just 156 tiny cages, was stopped on Yunnan Province\u2019s highway from Fumin to Kunming, after other drivers spotted the sickening cargo.\n\nA number of posts, pictures and comments about the load on the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, Weibo, prompted the police to stop the lorry at the next toll gate.\n\nHence, the claims are misleading for multiple reasons \u2013 it is not an image from June 2020. It is not from Yulin, China and the animals were rescued before being slaughtered.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
