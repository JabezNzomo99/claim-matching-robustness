Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., recently took to Twitter to criticize a Trump administration proposal on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, sometimes known as food stamps.\n\nManchin wrote: \"19% of WVians rely on SNAP, but proposed changes would take food assistance from those struggling to find stable employment while doing nothing to help them to become permanently employed. I'm urging @USDA Sec Sonny Perdue to withdraw the proposal.\"\n\nThe tweet linked to a press release from Manchin explaining his position on the proposal, which would give states less flexibility on enforcing work requirements for SNAP beneficiaries. Manchin and several dozen senators from both parties expressed opposition to the proposal.\n\nWe won\u2019t address the pros and cons of the Trump administration proposal here, but we did wonder if almost one of every five people in West Virginia rely on SNAP.\n\nWe checked with experts and looked at the data, and it turns out that Manchin was pretty close to the mark.\n\nIn February 2019, the most recent month for which full data is available, West Virginia had 314,042 SNAP beneficiaries. Meanwhile, the state\u2019s estimated population for 2018, according to the Census Bureau, was 1,805,832.\n\nThat works out to 17.4 percent of state residents, or a bit lower than the 19 percent figure Manchin cited.\n\nManchin said, \"19% of WVians rely on SNAP, but proposed changes would take food assistance from those struggling to find stable employment while doing nothing to help them to become permanently employed.\"\n\nThe percentage Manchin cited is a little high, but it\u2019s close. We rate his statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
