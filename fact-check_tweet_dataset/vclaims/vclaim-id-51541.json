It further claims that coronavirus is not transmitted by air. When Vishvas News investigated we found that neither UNICEF has issued any such advisory nor the information in the viral message is accurate.\n\nA social media post attributed to UNICEF reads: \u201cThe virus does not settle in the air but is grounded, so it is not transmitted by air.\u201d The virus referred to in the graphics is coronavirus as stated in the caption. The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nVishvas News started its investigation by contacting Dr. Prafful Bharadwaj who is the Health Officer at UNICEF and asked regarding the viral post. He said: \u201cThe viral post is falsely attributed to UNICEF. UNICEF has not issued any such advisory.\u201d\n\nSo, it has been proven false that the viral advisory is not issued by UNICEF.\n\nIt has been claimed in the viral post that coronavirus does not settle in the air but is grounded, so it is not transmitted by air.\n\nAccording to WHO, current evidence suggests that COVID-19 spreads between people through direct, indirect (through contaminated objects or surfaces), or close contact with infected people via mouth and nose secretions. These include saliva, respiratory secretions or secretion droplets. These are released from the mouth or nose when an infected person coughs, sneezes, speaks or sings, for example. People who are in close contact (within 1 metre) with an infected person can catch COVID-19 when those infectious droplets get into their mouth, nose or eyes.\n\nIt further suggests that some medical procedures can produce very small droplets (called aerosolized droplet nuclei or aerosols) that are able to stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time. When such medical procedures are conducted on people infected with COVID-19 in health facilities, these aerosols can contain the COVID-19 virus. These aerosols may potentially be inhaled by others if they are not wearing appropriate personal protective equipment. Therefore, it is essential that all health workers performing these medical procedures take specific airborne protection measures, including using appropriate personal protective equipment. Visitors should not be permitted in areas where such medical procedures are being performed.\n\nThe droplets are present in the air and if a person is in close proximity of an infected person, there is a possibility that they may test positive for COVID-19. So, it may be incorrect to say tha coronavirus cannot be transmitted through air but various researches are underway.\n\nVishvas News performed social scanning of the user who shared the viral message. We found that the page named Clean & Green Services is based out of Islamabad, Pakistan.\n\nWhen Vishvas News investigated we found that neither UNICEF has issued any such advisory nor the information in the viral message is accurate.", "lang": "en"}
