The tool also showed that Facebook users reported it at least 22 times for containing false information. As of writing, it had over 1,700 shares, 4,300 reactions, and 286 comments.\n\nThe facts: The section that allows only Filipino citizens to own mass media in the country is in the 1987 Constitution, but it is not a new provision. The ownership provision was also in the 1973 Constitution, which was ratified during the administration of Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nUnder the general provisions of the 1973 Constitution, which was promulgated after Marcos' declaration of Martial Law, section 7 reads: \u201cThe ownership and management of mass media shall be limited to citizens of the Philippines or to corporations or associations wholly owned and managed by such citizens.\u201d\n\nSection 11 of the 1987 Constitution\u2019s general provisions reads: \u201cThe ownership and management of mass media shall be limited to citizens of the Philippines, or to corporations, cooperatives or associations, wholly-owned and managed by such citizens. The Congress shall regulate or prohibit monopolies in commercial mass media when the public interest so requires. No combinations in restraint of trade or unfair competition therein shall be allowed.\u201d\n\nIn relation to the conviction of Rappler executive editor Maria Ressa and former researcher-writer Reynaldo Santos Jr, Noynoy Aquino said: \u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me how the judge was able to reach the conclusion that there was malice [intended] in the [Rappler] story.\u201d (READ: Aquino: Why not use cybercrime law to go after trolls, purveyors of fake news?)\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Rappler fact checked a claim posted by Facebook page VOVph. In 2017, it wrongly compared reports from non-consecutive years of an index in an attempt to question the accuracy of Ressa's tweets and Rappler's reports. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
