But we found that these figures refer to the potential total impact of the contract, not the net benefit to the UK\u2014and so could be overstating the value of this project.\n\nWhat ships are we buying?\n\nThe claim refers to the Ministry of Defence\u2019s (MOD\u2019s) tender for two ships (with an option of a third ship) that will support the Royal Navy. The Government has recently put the tender out internationally, meaning foreign firms can bid to construct the ships, although that doesn\u2019t prevent UK firms from bidding.\n\nThese ships store supplies for Royal Navy ships at sea and are operated by the civilian-manned Royal Fleet Auxillary, not the Royal Navy itself.\n\nThe MOD told us: \u201cAll our warships are built in the UK. Our fleet solid support ships are being procured through international competition, because there is no demonstrable national security reason why procurement needs to be restricted.\n\n\u201cBritish shipbuilding yards are encouraged to bid for our fleet solid support ships.\u201d\n\nThe \u00a31 billion figure is a gross estimate for the whole contract\u2014it\u2019s not been confirmed\n\nThe MOD told us that because the tendering was at an early stage, they couldn\u2019t confirm the value of the contract. Media outlets estimated a value of \u00a31 billion, though that was when it was assumed that three ships would be built. The MOD says it definitely wants two ships, with the option of a third.\n\nPutting aside the exact figure for the moment, the claim assumes that if a British shipyard won the contract, all the money would remain in the UK. That is uncertain.\n\nOne expert, Dr Paul Stott\u2014the EU\u2019s former technical adviser on shipbuilding \u2013 says that on average around 30% of a shipbuilding contract stays with the shipyard and the remaining 70% goes into the supply chain (e.g. buying raw materials and parts to assemble a ship).\n\nBritish shipyards have previously used foreign firms in their supply chain, meaning that some of the value of shipbuilding contracts leaves the UK.\n\nFor example, take steel\u2014a key raw material in building ships. Currently UK-based BAE Systems are building new frigates for the Royal Navy. About half the steel (by value) comes from the UK and the rest is sourced from abroad.\n\nThe scale of outsourcing can be much lower\u2014just 6% of the steel by weight used building the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier came from abroad.\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s evidently possible that some of the total contract of these Fleet Solid Support ships could leave the UK, even if awarded to a British shipbuilder. And vice-versa, if the contract was won by a foreign firm, that doesn\u2019t stop them using British firms in their supply chain.\n\nThe Government argue that competition delivers value for taxpayers\n\nThe flipside of the \u00a31 billion figure is that the cost will ultimately be borne by the taxpayer.\n\nKeeping the contract in the UK could contribute more to our economy. But it could also lead to the Government accepting a relatively high bid that ultimately costs taxpayers.\n\nThe Government says it encourages international competition where possible to deliver value for taxpayers.\n\nWhen defending their choice to put the contract tender out internationally, the Government referred to a previous contract for support vessels won by South Korean firm, Daewoo.\n\nDefence Minister, Tobias Ellwood said the winning bid was half the cost of the best bid from a UK firm.\n\nHowever critics such as the GMB union argue that when comparing bids between UK firms and international firms, the Government must not just look at price, but consider that:\n\u2022 When British firms win contracts, some of the value goes back to the Exchequer through taxes.\n\u2022 Bids from foreign countries are sometimes unfairly bankrolled by respective governments (e.g. Daewoo had to be bailed out by the South Korean government in 2017).\n\u2022 There is wider socioeconomic benefit for contracts staying in the UK.\n\nThe GMB union say that socioeconomic benefit includes the fact that shipbuilders are happier, better paid and more likely to spend money in their local communities than if they were forced to seek alternative employment.\n\nThey also say that when shipyards close they have a damaging effect on local communities as the jobs are very geographically concentrated.\n\nAnd a key socioeconomic impact is simply the effect of keeping the contract domestically on employment. The claim mentions the fact that doing so would support 6500 jobs. But that estimate is also open to debate.\n\n6,500 jobs assumes all are based within the UK\n\nThe claim says the contract could support 6,500 jobs in the UK. This estimate comes from the GMB union. It used economic models originally produced by research firm Ipsos MORI and consultancy Oxford Economics that estimatea a contract worth \u00a3800m would support around 6,700 jobs\u20146,500 in the shipyard and supply chain, and a further 200 local jobs supported by shipyard spend.\n\nThe GMB used \u00a3800m rather than \u00a31 billion to make their estimate more conservative, as the value of the contract has not been confirmed.\n\nAs with \u00a31 billion estimate, this estimate for jobs assumes that all jobs in the supply chain (as well as the shipyard) are kept within the UK. The model estimates a contract of this size would support 1,800 jobs at the shipyard and around 4,700 in the supply chain.\n\nAlso, the 6,500 figure is a gross figure. That means that if the contract was awarded abroad, it wouldn\u2019t mean a loss of 6,500 shipbuilding jobs.\n\nThe Ipsos MORI model says that if a shipbuilding contract is not awarded in the UK, most of those workers would be re-employed, although possibly in a different sector such as services and potentially at a lower wage.\n\nFor this support ship contract, the model estimates that not awarding the contract in the UK would increase unemployment by about 300 people.\n\nThe House of Commons Library say EU law requires most government contracts to be procured via an open, competitive process. However, Article 346 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes an exception for national security reasons.\n\nArticle 346 refers to a list of products written in 1958 by the Council of Ministers which includes \u201cwarships of all kinds\u201d.\n\nThe MOD officially say fleet support ships are not warships. The MOD say that the fitting of these ships with weapons will be subject to a separate contract and limited to UK companies.\n\nThe CSEU union argue that these ships should be considered warships because they are armed and take part in counter-narcotics and counter-piracy operations; and that other EU countries builds similar ships domestically.\n\nSo there\u2019s disagreement about whether the Government\u2019s decision to tender the contracts internationally is purely a policy decision or whether it\u2019s, to some degree, a result of EU law.", "lang": "en"}
