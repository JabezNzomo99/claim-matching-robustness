Facebook users flagged it as\n\nthe claim, so we had a look.\n\nannounced a new law that prisoners would get a monthly salary of between R3,000 and R10,000, depending on the job they were doing, and a bonus once they had completed their sentences. This money would help prisoners \u201cstart off in life\u201d, the post claims.\n\nThe post seems to have been copied from an\n\nin the Southern Daily. Written by a \u201cstaff reporter\u201d, the story quotes a Mr FK Nyathi from the corrections department. \u201cInmates while inside of prison do many different type of jobs, ranging from cooking, cleaning, to doing the garden and we have decided to pay them for their hard work,\u201d Nyathi is quoted as saying.\n\nas a Zimbabwean owned but South African operated internet portal for casual news and friendly satire.\n\n\u2018Think twice about trusting, thrice about sharing\u2019\n\n, an independent non-profit organisation that promotes media freedom, has developed the\n\ntool to help people identify whether a website is credible or not.\n\nWhen we used the tool to test the Southern Daily website, a warning appeared: \u201cThis site may contain dodgy news. Think twice about trusting any story. Think thrice about sharing.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the site crawls with dodgy news headlines such as \u201cDonald Trump shot by Muslim woman on stage at rally\u201d or \u201cWoman turns into leopard after trying to bleach her skin\u201d.\n\nThe story about prisoners receiving a salary is credited to\n\n, an Afrikaans language tabloid. The details are the same but one important concluding sentence bears repeating: \u201ccommenting on the matter, many inmates revealed that this is too good to be true, and\n\nThe satire article made its way onto Facebook, where many have taken it as the truth.\n\n\u2018It can never be called a salary\u201d\n\nWhile South African prisoners don\u2019t earn a salary, they can collect what is called \u201cgratuity\u201d, Singabakho Nxumalo, spokesperson for the correctional services department, told Africa Check.\n\nIt\u2019s a form of compensation for work done by prisoners, such as cooking or maintenance.\n\n\u201cBut remember, in prison, it\u2019s a moneyless system,\u201d Nxumalo said. \u201cSo the gratuity can only be used to buy maybe toiletries or things from the tuck shop... but it\u2019s so small, it can never be called a salary.\u201d\n\nNor do prisoners receive a bonus after \u201cserving their time\u201d, Nxumalo said.", "lang": "en"}
