Gretchen Whitmer violating social distancing guidelines on Michigan\u2019s Mackinac Island.\n\nThe photo, which is well over a year old, does not show Whitmer violating social distancing guidelines.\n\nIn recent days, social media users have shared a photo of Whitmer speaking with two men, claiming it shows the governor violating social distancing guidelines on Mackinac Island, where the governor\u2019s summer residence is located.\n\n\u201cHappy Memorial Weekend Look at #whitmer, obviously the 6ft rule is funny because you can see her smile without her mask on!\u201d reads the caption. \u201cNice #Michigan Keep staying home\u2026.. NOT!\u201d\n\nThe photo, however, predates the confirmation of Michigan\u2019s first coronavirus cases by well over a year and does not show her breaking social distancing guidelines. In October 2018, the Oakland Press included the photo in a question-and-answer article with the then-gubernatorial candidate. It shows Whitmer \u201cspeaking to Michigan residents while on the campaign trail,\u201d according to the caption.\n\nIn an email to the Daily Caller, a spokesperson for Whitmer\u2019s office said the Michigan governor has not been to her Mackinac Island residence since September 2019.
