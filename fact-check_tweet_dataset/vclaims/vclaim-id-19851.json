However, the statistic referred to rural sub-Saharan Africa only.\n\n\u201cWe regret the slight inaccuracy therefore of her comment,\u201d Cann said.\n\nIf not 19%, then how much?\n\nIt turns out that measuring access to electricity isn\u2019t a straightforward exercise.\n\nThe World Energy Outlook cited as Kanza\u2019s source is published by the\n\n, an international organisation that provides\n\n\u201cThere is no single internationally-accepted and internationally-adopted definition of modern energy access,\u201d the organisation\n\nMeasuring access to electricity shouldn't just involve counting how many houses are hooked up to a grid. The quantity of electricity they consume, depending on their location, should matter too.\n\nThat said, the latest World Energy Outlook report considered a \u201c\n\n\u201d of those who have access to electricity and those who do not. Published in 2016, the report stated that 45% of Africa had access to electricity in 2014.\n\n, including \u201cmultilateral development banks and country-level representatives of various international organisations\u201d along with data from the World Bank living standards measurement surveys. If no data was available, estimates were provided based on pre-existing data.\n\nThe organisation does note, however, that the\n\nmay vary between countries \u201cdue to the differences in definitions and methodology from different sources\u201d.\n\n\n\nThere are other ways to measure access to electricity, a member of the\n\n\u201cThe World Bank has been working on the issue of measuring access specifically through the\n\n,\u201d Wikus Kruger said. \u201cMostly, though, this only takes into account electricity provided by grid companies.\u201d\n\nprovided a similar estimate to the World Energy Outlook report - that 46.9% of the African population had access to electricity in 2014.\n\n\n\nKruger told Africa Check that defining and measuring access to electricity is a \u201crelatively contentious issue\u201d.\n\nEchoing the International Energy Agency\u2019s sentiments, Kruger told Africa Check that \u201cthere is not necessarily uniformity in how access is measured across regions\u201d.\n\nIssues of affordability also need to be considered, Kruger added.\n\n\u201cWhereas South Africa\u2019s electricity access rate is in the high 80% range, there is uncertainty regarding how many people are able to use electricity \u2013 and use the full range of electricity services,\u201d Kruger told Africa Check.\n\nFor a number of households, connection costs alone remain \u201cprohibitively expensive\u201d, Kruger added.\n\nConclusion: Closer to half of Africa\u2019s population have access to electricity\n\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s head of Africa told a South African radio station that \u201conly about 20% of Africans have access to electricity\u201d.\n\nThis should have been in reference to rural sub-Saharan Africa only, the forum told Africa Check. Urban electrification pulled access on the continent up to an estimated 45% in 2014, data from the World Energy Outlook showed.\n\nAnother international database put it at 46.9% in 2014.\n\nEnergy expert Wikus Kruger told Africa Check that although the figure cited was too low, \u201cit does point to the direness of the situation: electricity access is a major issue on the continent, even for those that have an electricity line at their house.\u201d\n\nAt least 45% of Africa's population estimated to have accessA family in the DRC's North Kivu province takes advantage of the arrival of electricity in July 2016.
