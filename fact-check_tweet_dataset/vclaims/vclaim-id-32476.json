I really admire the guts of these humans participating in the demo with live man!! They must be having total trust in their own programming skills!!\"\n\nWe searched with the same caption and found that the video was viral on Facebook.\n\nClick here to view, and here for an archive.\n\nClick here to view, and here for an archive.\n\nIn the viral video we spotted 'Bosstown Dynamics' written and searched on YouTube and found the original 4.12 seconds video uploaded by the production house Corridor Digital on October 26, 2019.\n\nThe video was created by Los Angeles based production company Corridor Digital and named \"Bosstown Dynamics.\". The name of the video and robot is a pun on Boston Dynamics, a leading US-based robotics company.\n\nCorridor Digital explains in this below video uploaded on a separate YouTube channel 'Corridor Crew', the process behind the making of the parody video.\n\nAs explained the video was made using motion capture and as spotted in the explainer video, a human actor was playing the part of the robot which was later digitally added.\n\nAdditionally Corridor Digital has previously also created parody videos about robots. In June it had released a parody video where a robot turns on a human where it had a robot looked similar to a video from Boston Dynamics.\n\nBOOM reached out to Corridor Digital for a response, the article will be updated upon receiving a response.", "lang": "en"}
