At the time of writing this article, the tweet garnered more than 2,800 retweets and 4,400 likes.\n\nMany other individual users quote-tweeted the video believing it to be from India.\n\nAlt News discovered that the video is from Malaysia and not from India. The two billboards seen in the video have phone numbers, which we traced to a Malaysian business website, Emhub.com.\n\nWe found that the video has been circulating on the internet at least since December 2018. An individual Twitter user, who goes by the name Abdillah Toha, had posted the video on December 12, 2018. This was one of the earliest instances that Alt News could locate.\n\nAn article published in Malay, days after the video went viral on social media, claimed that the clip was shot on \u201cSprint Highway\u201d located in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Moreover, a passerby in the video can be heard speaking in Malay. The passer-by can be heard saying, \u201cBrother, what are you doing? why are you praying here? you might end up dying there. (translated)\u201d.\n\nAlt News looked up the street view from SCland Gallery (the business that was advertised in the billboard) to Sprint Highway on Google Maps.\n\nOn the way to Sprint Highway, we found the exact spot where the footage was shot.\n\nIn the images posted below, we have listed the structures visible in multiple frames of the video.\n\u2022 Two billboards placed behind each other\n\u2022 Advertising boards diagonally placed on a divider of the road [Click on the images below to expand them]\n\nThe structures collated in one of the frames of the highway\u2019s street view available on Google Maps. A screenshot of the single frame is posted below.\n\nThus, Alt News was able to independently establish that the video is from Klang Valley, Malaysia and not India.\n\nAn incident where a man was offering namaz on a Malaysian road was falsely shared as a Muslim in India putting the life of passers-by in jeopardy.", "lang": "en"}
