Uunlad ang Pilipinas 'pag ganito rin ang parusa sa mga corrupt!\" (Twenty-six corrupt government officials sentenced to death in China! The Philippines will progress if we use the same punishment for corrupt officials!)\n\nThe same photo from RJNM Manila has long been circulating on Facebook, with various pages and accounts across the world having made it viral with similar claims.\n\nUnofficial: Ronald Bato Dela Rosa Solid Supporters and Pinoy Reality were the Philippine-based pages that shared the photo. Outside the Philippines, Facebook users from Kenya such as DJ Patchez The Mixboss and pages of European-based A La Verdad Mundial and Dalicom.eu shared the photo, adapting the claim to their countries' context.\n\n\"Chinese police show a group of hardcore convicts at a sentencing rally in the east Chinese city of Wenzhou, 07 April 2004, where 11 prisoners were later excuted for various crimes. Amnesty International has called for a moratorium on the death penalty in China, saying the country\u2019s dysfunctional criminal justice system meant many innocent people were being executed, after a senior Chinese legislator suggested China executes at least 10,000 people a year, about 5 times more than the rest of the world combined.\"\n\nNo news organization reported on the supposed executions of 26 corrupt goverment officials in China. Further, Amnesty International, a London-based non-governmental organization specializing on human rights, did not report such executions in its compilation of significant events related to the death penalty worldwide in the year 2004.\n\nMeanwhile, the Facebook page RJNM Manila claims to be an account of a physical fitness center in Manila. However, it also posts about current political events aside from physical fitness.\n\nA claim from the Facebook page Unofficial: Ronald Bato Dela Rosa Solid Supporters had previously been rated by Rappler as misleading. The page later apologized and corrected their claim based on our fact check.
