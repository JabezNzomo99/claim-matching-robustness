It has been claimed that due to the disruption of normal life as a result of the bandh, the child could not be saved as the ambulance could not arrive in time.\n\nAmong those who shared this video, calling it the outcome of the Bharat bandh was a Twitter user Modified Renu (@Renu_18), who is followed on the social media platform by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The video has been retweeted over 230 times so far.\n\nAlternatively, the video has also been used by opponents of BJP to target the party. The tweet posted below has been retweeted close to 300 times.\n\nThe video along with the accompanying claim has also found its way on to Facebook.\n\nThe incident in question occurred on September 7, 2018 and has nothing to do with Bharat bandh declared for September 10. According to a report by Lallantop, the video is from Sitamarhi in Bihar. Four year old Simran had succumbed to a snake bite on her finger, after no driver was available on duty to take her to Sadar hospital in Sitamarhi by an ambulance. Simran\u2019s family hastily arranged a tempo to take her to the hospital but she could not be saved. Simran died on the way to the hospital.\n\nMoreover, Alt News found that this video had been uploaded on September 9 by a Facebook user which claimed that the child had died due to a snake bite.\n\nIt may be noted that reports have emerged of a two-year old child who died in Jehanabad, Bihar after road blockade apparently stopped an ambulance on the way. However, this report is separate and not related to the social media claim presented in this article. Moreover, contradictory claims have emerged with regard to this report with district administration stating otherwise.\n\nUsing unrelated images and videos for politicking on social media is now an established practice, which was seen in this instance wherein an unrelated video of an incident that took place three days back was shared as the outcome of the Bharat bandh.", "lang": "en"}
