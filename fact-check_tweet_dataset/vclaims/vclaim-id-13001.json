Our focus is strictly on the status of Trump's proposal.\n\nIt went nowhere.\n\nThere were two main opportunities: the Republican health care and tax cut bills in 2017. Deductibility of insurance premium failed to make it into either one.\n\n\"There has been no change,\" said private health policy consultant Robert Laszewski told us.\n\nIn our last update, Laszewski noted that tax credits had edged out deductibility as a way to make insurance more affordable. Tax credits would reach more people because anyone who qualified could take them, while deductions only help people who itemize on their tax returns, or only about 30 percent of tax filers.\n\nAt the end of the day, neither tax credits nor deductions made it through.\n\n\"There have been no changes to the tax treatment of insurance premiums,\" said Urban Institute senior fellow Howard Gleckman.\n\nWe rate this Promise Broken. That can change based on what happens during the remainder of Trump's first term.", "lang": "en"}
