Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., claimed the debt doubled under George W. Bush and is tripling under President Obama. We rated it Half True -- the debt under Obama has tripled since Bush took office, but other factors affect debt.\n\nBut, we wondered, as Obama\u2019s presidency comes to a close, where are we now in terms of debt?\n\nPence spokesman Marc Lotter pointed us to the Treasury Department\u2019s Debt to the Penny clock, a real-time look at the nation\u2019s debt that goes back almost two decades.\n\nOn Jan. 20, 2009, when Obama took office, the gross federal debt (which includes both public and intragovernmental debt) was $10.63 trillion. As of Aug. 3, 2016, it is $19.4 trillion.\n\nSo the numbers check out.\n\nBut experts we spoke with still note that the debt cannot be pinned on just Obama. For one thing, Congress signs off on spending and taxation.\n\nAnd, reining in government spending during the recession would have been a bad idea, economists told us.\n\nGeorge Washington University law professor Neil Buchanan noted that the economy was in \"free-fall\" when Obama took office. In Arizona, the housing market crashed and key sector jobs, such as construction, dried up.\n\n\"Tax revenues were plummeting, because incomes were falling, while spending had to go up (for unemployment benefits, Medicaid, and so on),\" Buchanan said. \"Had we tried to balance the budget during that time, it would have accelerated the downturn, and there could have been a depression.\"\n\nMoreover, according to Bucknell University economics professor Gregory Krohn, the Congressional Budget Office projected in January that debt held by the public would increase to 75.6 percent - up from 39.3 percent in 2008.\n\n\"Debt held by the public, a more meaningful measure, more than doubled from $6.4 trillion to $13.9 trillion over the same period,\" Krohn said.\n\nPence said that under the Obama administration, \"the debt has nearly doubled.\"\n\nHis numbers are on the mark. But it is important to note that the debt cannot all be blamed on Obama. Congress has a role in approving spending. And, experts told us that money needed to be spent in a free-falling economy.", "lang": "en"}
