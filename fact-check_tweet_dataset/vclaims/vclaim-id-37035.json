Dianne Feinstein said a gunman will lay down his arms if no one else is armed.\n\n\u201cWhen the gunman realizes that nobody else is armed, he will lay down his weapons and turn himself in\u2026. that\u2019s just human nature,\u201d reads the alleged quote.\n\nThere is no record of Feinstein ever saying this. The quote appears to have originated on a now-defunct satirical website.\n\nFeinstein has been a vocal supporter of gun control for decades. In the 1990s, she authored the now-expired assault weapons ban that limited the types of firearms Americans could purchase.\n\nThe California senator has repeatedly sought to enact gun control legislation, including an updated version of the ban. \u201cWithout stronger laws to prevent straw purchasing and close the gaping holes in our background check system, a presumptive murderer barely has to lift a finger to buy a gun,\u201d Feinstein said after the mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, California.\n\nHowever, The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence to suggest Feinstein ever made the statement attributed to her in the meme. An online search revealed nothing credible resembling the quote.

Although the site is no longer accessible, a February 2013 article \u2013 \u201cFeinstein and Boxer Ask Californians to Lay Down Their Weapons During Statewide Manhunt\u201d \u2013 contained the quote:\n\n\u201cThe Senators feel the best course of action is to remove all weapons from law enforcement and private citizens so no one else gets hurt,\u201d reads a fabricated quote, attributed to a Senate communications intern. \u201cWhen the gunman realizes that nobody else is armed, he will lay down his weapons and turn himself in \u2026 that\u2019s just human nature.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
