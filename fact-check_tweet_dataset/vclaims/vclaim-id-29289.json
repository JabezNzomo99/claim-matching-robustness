The claim is false; it originated on a parody Twitter account; the photo is actually an AFP image of a 2004 bomb attack on a Shiite mosque in Karachi.\n\nThe misleading posts, for example here on Facebook, share a screenshot of a tweet by @INA_Pakistan.\n\nThe tweet contains a photograph of a mosque covered in debris and has a caption saying: \u201c#NewsFlash #Karachi Blast during bomb test in a Mosque, 15 scientists dead, 10 seriously injured.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Tweet, which has been retweeted more than 4,000 times since it was posted on March 11:\n\nThe INA News Twitter account says it is a parody account from Pakistan. Its Twitter profile says: #parody #satire #Just4Fun #NotRelatedToANI\n\nThe website URL listed on the INA Twitter account does not work.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the account:\n\nANI is the acronym for Asian News International, an Indian news agency.\n\nThe INA logo is a reversal of the ANI logo.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the ANI logo as seen on their verified Twitter account, which has nearly three million followers:\n\nAccording to the parody INA News Twitter account, the \u201cA/C Owner\u201d is Twitter user @MayoorBalot.\n\nThe account has not yet Tweeted but has 13,900 followers.\n\nIn the handle, the @MayoorBalot Twitter account lists an unverified Facebook account in the name of Bobby Deol or, @TheBobbyDeol, which has more than 14,000 followers.\n\nBobby Deol is an Indian actor. His Internet Movie Database entry can be seen here, and his verified Twitter profile can be seen here.\n\nThe unverified Bobby Deol Facebook account shared the misleading INA tweet, without specifying that the content was taken from a purported parody account.\n\nThe caption of the misleading Facebook post says: \u201cThe Madrasa scientist of Pakistan got their 72 virgins while testing bomb in mosque,\u201d followed by three laughing face emojis.\n\nMultiple other Facebook and Twitter users shared the misleading INA tweet as if it was real news, for example here on Facebook, and here on Twitter.\n\nThis Twitter user retweeting the INA tweet says: \u201cFinally a true pic and a REAL definition of MOSLEMS sacred place called mosque ... and all those RAM MANDIR virodhi's use to fantasize that Mosques are the place for prayer..\u201d\n\n\u201cRAM MANDIR virodhis\u201d refers to people opposed to the building of a Hindu temple at Ayodhya in India's Uttar Pradesh state. In 1992, a mosque at the site was razed, sparking violence that killed more than 2,000 people. Here is an AFP report on the Ayodhya tensions.\n\nA Google reverse image search found the image in the misleading posts is actually an AFP photo of a 2004 attack on a Shiite mosque in Karachi.\n\nThe image can be viewed here on AFP Forum.\n\nThe AFP photograph's caption says: \"Pakistani worshippers and police officers walk through the wreckage inside a Shiite Muslim mosque after a bomb ripped through during holy Friday prayers in the volatile port city of Karachi 07 May, 2004. At least five worshippers were killed and several others injured when a bomb ripped through a packed mosque in the Pakistani city of Karachi during Friday Muslim prayers.\"\n\nHere is an AFP report on the aftermath of the 2004 attack.", "lang": "en"}
