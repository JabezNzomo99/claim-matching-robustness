John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee that would add \"19,200 additional trained, full-time, active duty U.S. Border Patrol agents along the southern border.\" The amendment was widely seen as as a way of garnering votes from undecided Republicans. (The amendment, and eventually the bill itself, passed the Senate easily with bipartisan support, though the measure now faces an uncertain fate in the House.)\n\nIf the bill is enacted as is, Maher said during a roundtable segment of his June 21, 2013, show, it is \"going to make the Border Patrol bigger than the FBI -- you could put one agent every 250 feet. There'll be over 40,000 agents. It's four times more than any of the Republicans were asking for in their wildest dreams. It's like, to get Republican senators to vote for something now, you have to get to crazy.\"\n\nA reader suggested we check out this claim, so we did.\n\nThe bill is \"going to make the Border Patrol bigger than the FBI\"\n\nThe amendment promises 19,200 additional trained, full-time, active duty U.S. Border Patrol agents along the southern border. In most media accounts, this has been shorthanded to be roughly a doubling of the size of the southwest border agent ranks to 40,000.\n\nThe most recent published statistics we found reported that in 2012, there were 18,516 Border Patrol agents on the southwest border. That would make the new total 37,716 once the newcomers are all sworn in and wearing uniforms. That\u2019s not quite 40,000, but even at 37,716, it\u2019s still enough to beat the FBI, because in 2012, the FBI had 35,629 employees.\n\nWant an even more striking comparison? Match up the number of agents in each of the two agencies.\n\nThe FBI has 13,766 special agents. This means that once the amendment\u2019s plan is carried out, the Border Patrol will have more than two and a half times as many agents on the southwestern border alone as the FBI does to investigate crimes anywhere in the world. (And the Border Patrol is even bigger than that. It assigned an additional 2,430 agents in 2012 to the northern border and coastal regions, and its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, has nearly 39,000 additional employees in the U.S. and around the world.)\n\nSo, however you slice it, Maher\u2019s correct that the Border Patrol will be bigger than the FBI if the Senate bill is enacted.\n\n\"You could put one (Border Patrol) agent every 250 feet\"\n\nAccording to the International Water and Boundary Commission -- a bi-national body that oversees governance issues on the U.S.-Mexico border -- the border between the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico is is 1,954 miles long. That works out to 10.32 million feet.\n\nDoing the math, you could space out 37,716 agents one every 274 feet (or, using the widely published 40,000 figure, you could put them every 258 feet). Either way, Maher\u2019s calculation strikes us as very close to accurate.\n\nNeedless to say, the Border Patrol wouldn\u2019t deploy their personnel in this fashion. Not only do patrols work on shifts, but some agents are flying helicopters, some are escorting or guarding detainees and a good number are shoulder-to-shoulder at the major border cross points screening cars, searching for drugs. But Maher\u2019s rhetorical point is well-taken: The agency literally, if it wished, could place agents every 274 feet.\n\nMaher said that if it is enacted, the Senate immigration bill is \"going to make the border patrol bigger than the FBI -- you could put one agent every 250 feet.\" He\u2019s right on the first claim and on target with the second. In all, we rate his statement True.", "lang": "en"}
