High daily doses include:\n\nOverall, the results showed a 20 to 50 percent increase in risk of a heart attack when using NSAIDs compared with not using these medications.\n\nHowever, Bally emphasizes that the absolute risk is very small and will vary based on patient's baseline risk.\n\n\"These numbers do not mean that a person has a 20 to 50 percent risk of having a heart attack after taking those drugs,\" she told CBS News.\n\nRather, the findings mean that as a result of this increase, the risk of heart attack due to NSAIDs is on average about 1 percent annually, she said.\n\nBhatt, who was not involved in the study, offers some more perspective.\n\n\"Someone who is young and healthy and takes an NSAID for a sprained ankle, the risk of heart attack is already very low so it raises the risk from very low to very low,\" he said. \"On the flip side, an 80-year-old who has high blood pressure, who's had bypass surgery, for that patient, the risk could be substantial.\"\n\nThe study also looked at long-term use of NSAIDs and found that the heightened risk did not seem to continue to increase even further when people took them for longer than one month. However, Bally said this should be interpreted with caution since the authors did not study repeat heart attacks; she advised it's still best to use NSAIDs for the shortest time possible.\n\nThe study was observational and cannot prove that taking NSAIDs actually causes a heart attack. The researchers note another limitation of the study is that not all the factors that could potentially influence risk could be taken into account.\n\nThe research doesn't explain underlying reasons for the link, but experts have some theories.\n\n\"Other studies show that NSAIDs can raise blood pressure and lead to fluid retention,\" Bhatt said. \"These sorts of things can help precipitate a heart attack, particularly in people who are already vulnerable to it.\"\n\nPrevious research has also shown these medications may put people at risk for blood clots.\n\nExperts say the study is not meant to scare people away from using NSAIDs, but rather to be more mindful when using them.\n\n\"If someone needs to treat occasional pain, fever, or inflammation they should consider all available treatment alternatives and get the help of the health care providers,\" Bally said.\n\nShe notes that people taking these drugs for chronic pain may want to consider whether the benefit of increasing the dose for better relief outweighs a possible increased risk of heart attack. They could talk to their doctors about other avenues of treatment such as physical therapy or local injections.\n\n\"The bottom line is, don't treat these drugs like candy just because they're sold over the counter,\" Bhatt said. \"Treat them like any medications. Only use them if you really need to, lowest dose possible, for least amount of time.\"", "lang": "en"}
