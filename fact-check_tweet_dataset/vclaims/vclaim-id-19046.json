NOT TRUE", "subtitle": "", "author": "dubawa.org", "date": "2019-08-05T10:00:44+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-19046", "url": "https://dubawa.org/protocol-recruitment-by-ghana-police-service-not-true/", "vclaim": "EVIDENCE: The claim has been debunked by the Ghana Police Service through its official Twitter handle, @GhPoliceService\n\nAn advertisement claims the Ghana Police Service is undertaking a \u2018protocol recruitment\u2019. The advertisement, which bore the logo of the Ghana Police Service and the name of DCOP Charles Kpapu Torkor, Commandant at the Ghana Police Command and Staff College, urged interested persons to contact one Mr Charles, for enrolment. It also listed social media handles through which they could be reached.\n\nEfforts by Dubawa to reach Mr Charles on the two numbers provided in the ad proved futile as both numbers were \u2018either switched off or out of coverage area.\u2019\n\nThe Ghana Police Service, through its Official twitter handle, @GhPOliceService, has however, said the advertisement is \u2018false\u2019. The Police Service cautioned members of the general public against transacting business with the advertisers.\n\nThis is not the first time attempts have been made by unscrupulous persons to dupe individuals with such fake advertisements. While other such attempts, like the current one, have been intercepted and foiled, others were unknown until several people had been defrauded.\n\nIn March 2015, hundreds of young people were turned away when they reported at police training depots across the country for enlistment. They were said to have paid between Gh\u00a22000 and GH\u00a23500 to the fraudsters who in turn issued them fake appointment letters purportedly signed by the Director-General in charge of Human Resources, COP Patrick Timbilla.\n\nAgain in June 2015, some young men and women, carrying fake offer letters, reported at a house in Accra waiting to be transported to training depots for enlistment into the Ghana Police Service.\n\nCONCLUSION: Ghana Police Service is not undertaking a \u2018protocol recruitment\u2019 as claimed by an advertisement.\n\nCaroline Anipah is the Programme Officer of DUBAWA, Ghana.
