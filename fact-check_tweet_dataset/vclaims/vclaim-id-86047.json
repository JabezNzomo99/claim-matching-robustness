Strikingly, Cassidy makes this accusation himself. Generally, such harsh attacks are done in the voice of an anonymous narrator. So Cassidy is really putting his credibility on the line.\n\nLast December, House and Senate negotiators led by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) reached an agreement on a budget deal that restored some of the spending cuts (\u201cthe sequester\u201d) contained in a previous budget agreement. The goal was to call a two-year truce in Washington\u2019s endless tangles over spending.\n\nIn an effort to find savings, negotiators agreed on a reduction in military pensions worth $6.2 billion over 10 years, by reducing the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for military retirees under the age of 62 by 1 percent. (Federal workers also were hit with an increased retirement contribution rate worth $6 billion over 10 years.) As cuts go, it was a relative pittance, affecting fewer than one out of every 22 military retirees. It also was designed to not go into effect until 2016, in case Congress decided to change its mind.\n\nBy the time the bill arrived in the Senate, the budget deal had already been approved in the House, by a vote of 332 to 94, with Cassidy in the majority. House votes generally don\u2019t allow for amendments, unlike in the Senate. In an effort to keep the bill intact, Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) \u201cfilled the amendment tree\u201d to make it difficult to amend the bill.\n\nSo the vote that Cassidy cites is a procedural vote to reopen the amendment process. \u201cThe legislation before us today now is brought forward in a way that will not allow any amendments,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who pushed to allow amendments. \u201cNobody can get an amendment to fix this part of the legislation that plainly needs fixing.\u201d\n\nWhy did Sessions want to reopen the process? He wanted to offer an amendment removing the reduction in military pensions. In an effort to keep it budget neutral, savings would be found by closing what he called a loophole that allowed illegal immigrants to obtain child tax credits by using a taxpayer identification number, rather than a Social Security number.\n\nIn fact, the same day that the Senate voted to approve the budget agreement, Cassidy defended the reductions in military pensions on the Laura Ingraham Show. \u201cThere are no benefit cuts to people who are retiring,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is an adjustment to their cost of living, which starts off not for all but those who retire \u2026 before age 62.\u201d\n\nIn any case, within weeks, Congress did reverse the pension cuts. The House voted 326 to 90 on Feb. 11 to restore the old formula, and the Senate followed suit on Feb. 12, with a vote of 95 to 3. Both Cassidy and Landrieu voted for the repeal. President Obama signed it into law three days later.\n\nJohn Cummins, a Cassidy spokesman, said that Cassidy did not have a chance to amend the bill under the rules of the House, while he argued that Landrieu had that opportunity in the Senate. \u201cComically, Senator Landrieu and her allies have been using budget votes to spin fictional stories about Dr. Cassidy\u2019s record, as has been routinely called out by independent fact checkers,\u201d he said. \u201cYet, when Dr. Cassidy uses clear chronology and facts to hold Senator Landrieu accountable, she cries foul.\u201d\n\nCassidy is really going out on a limb here, personally vouching for a ridiculous claim. Given that Cassidy voted for the same pension reductions in the House \u2014 and defended them when the Senate approved them \u2014 he certainly earns points for hypocrisy as well.", "lang": "en"}
