However, BOOM found that the video is old and unrelated to the anti CAA agitation. The video is from Goa where a man was held for entering a ladies toilet wearing a burkha. Identified as Virgil Bosco Fernandez, he was arrested by Goa police in February, 2019, after he was caught exiting a ladies toilet at a bus stand in Panjim. The video was earlier viral with claims that the accused had Sangh affiliations and was trying to defame Muslims. BOOM had debunked the same claim in March 2019. Police at the time had told BOOM that the man was being treated for a mental illness.", "lang": "en"}
