There are different versions of the post with some claiming it is from Turkey and others claiming it is from Iraq, but all say that the food is being left on the ground as a response to COVID-19. Examples can be seen here and here .\n\nThe original video was posted as a Facebook live video in a public group called \"Cocuklar Icin El Ele\", a Turkish volunteer association helping those in need ( here ). The live video is about 31 minutes long. The man filming the video can be heard saying:\n\n\u201cMy brothers and sisters, we are packaging food for 750 families for the truck that we will hopefully send to Idlib tomorrow. If anyone is free right now and wants to help, please come. We will be very grateful. Hopefully, we will load the trucks at around 10 o\u2019clock tomorrow and send it to our brothers in need in Idlib. Also, we are accepting donations until 10 o\u2019clock today for our brothers in Elazig affected by the earthquake. So, we are accepting products you are bringing for the people in Elazig affected by the earthquake until 10 o\u2019clock. God willing, we will send a truck there too, tomorrow.\u201d\n\nHe later adds, \u201cFood, blankets, clothing, whatever is needed for an earthquake. We are accepting everything. We are accepting until 10 o\u2019clock today and we will hopefully send it tomorrow.\u201d\n\nIn the video, the man can be heard instructing the volunteers on compiling the food packets. He can be heard saying each packet needs to have 11 items. He shows what is in the packets and explains that each bundle includes 5 kg of flour, 2.5 kg of bulgur, 2.5 kg of rice, 2 kg sugar, one packet of barley, four packets of pasta and 1 kg of red lentils. The man can be heard saying they have packaged 200 packs so far and plan to prepare 550 more.\n\nThe location of the video is Emirgazi Sokak in Konya, Turkey ( here!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sqp_qxxbO4E7ZC22pPs13dA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ). The man in the video can be heard apparently instructing someone how to reach this location in a phone call. He says that they are right next to Zeki Ozdemir High School and that one could search \u201cCocuklar icin el ele\u201d association on a navigation system. A quick internet search reveals that both these places lead near to Emirgazi street. With Google Street View, the pavement and colorful stripes on the walls of the buildings can be observed and match the Facebook live video. While it is not yet updated on Google maps, the association now has its branding on the front of the building. ( here!1s0x14d08552cb056b3f:0x7075ed57f51d972d!3m1!7e115!4shere!5scocuklar+icin+el+ele+konya+-+Google+Search&imagekey=!1e10!2sAF1QipObGCqvCPipgCEWCyqqEsc4ZRS7Th7g35xPrwyR )\n\nYasin Gunduz, who shot the original video, told Reuters, \u201cThe video was taken in Konya. This footage shows aid efforts for the Idlib bombing refugees coming closer to our borders and also those affected by the earthquake in Elazig that happened at the same time.\u201d\n\nThe video was filmed on January 25, 2020 when there were no reported cases of COVID-19 in Turkey ( here ). While the video does depict aid packages in Turkey, it is not in relation to coronavirus response. It shows relief packages for victims of bombings in Idlib, Syria ( here ) and an earthquake in Elazig, Turkey ( here ).\n\nPartly false: this video shows an organization preparing food packets in Turkey in January to be sent to those in need following air strikes in Syria and an earthquake in Turkey.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
