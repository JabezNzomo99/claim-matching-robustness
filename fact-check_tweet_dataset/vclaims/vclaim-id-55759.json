Gretchen Whitmer has taken aggressive steps to slow the spread of COVID-19. While polls show wide support for her response, she has faced a fierce backlash from some Michiganders who say the restrictions in the statewide stay-at-home order violate their constitutional rights.\n\nWhitmer, who extended the order on April 24 and slightly loosened some of the regulations, has said that the restrictions are necessary to protect public safety and that they\u2019re helping to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nBut we recently came across a post on Facebook that\u2019s putting words in her mouth.\n\nThe post, which was shared on April 13, reads: \"Michigan Governor says \u2018Now is not the time to live by the Constitution, it\u2019s time to put that Damn thing in a shredder\u2019!!!\"\n\nSome commenters believed she said it; others asked for proof.\n\nWe\u2019re here to tell you: She didn\u2019t.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that Whitmer made this comment.\n\nA search for the quote in news databases, as well as in transcripts of Whitmer\u2019s recent appearances, interviews and statements, comes up short.\n\nWhitmer\u2019s office also told us the statement isn\u2019t legitimate.\n\n\"This is completely false information,\" a spokesperson wrote in an email. \"Posts like these are being spread across social media platforms to create rumors and fear.\"\n\nThis quote is bogus and only exists in unsourced social media posts. We rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
