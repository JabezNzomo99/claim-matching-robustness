Chris Larson earned a Pants on Fire when he claimed, more than halfway into 2013, that Gov. Scott Walker \"hasn't done a public event\" the entire year.\n\nThe Republican governor had attended public meetings, presided over military ceremonies and given speeches, among many other public events.\n\nNevertheless, Walker has been criticized for not being more accessible. And on July 15, 2016, a claim made by another Democratic lawmaker caught our attention.\n\nState Rep. Dana Wachs of Eau Claire, a lawyer and four-year lawmaker who has been mentioned as a possible 2018 gubernatorial candidate, said in a tweet:\n\n\"Walker holding listening sessions: Good. Making them invite-only & excluding the press: Not so good.\"\n\nIs he right that the listening sessions are invitation only and exclude the media?\n\nWachs\u2019 tweet included a link to a Capital Times news article that was posted the same day.\n\nThe article said that, according to state records, Walker's office had asked lawmakers, lobbyists, state agency heads and local economic development agencies to help select attendees for his invite-only listening sessions throughout the state.\n\nThe article said Walker had held 50 such sessions, all of which were open only to invited guests. The general public and the press were excluded.\n\nThis wasn't disputed. The governor\u2019s office issued a statement in connection with the 50th session that quoted Walker as saying:\n\nBefore every listening session, we\u2019re in contact with area state legislators, no matter what party they represent, as well as community leaders to help us reach out and invite a good cross-section of people with different experiences and opinions. We also focus on ensuring those from a particular community are the primary attendees.\n\nAdvance notice of participation is intended to ensure that there are no threatening criminal backgrounds and to avoid people whose intent is to be disruptive.\n\n \n\n While listening sessions are closed to members of the press to encourage an honest and candid conversation between attendees, local members of the media are given the opportunity to sit down for one-on-one interviews following the listening session in the interest of transparency.\n\nA few weeks earlier, residents in Pierce County held signs outside one of Walker\u2019s listening sessions to protest not being allowed in. But such protests have not been common.\n\nWalker had touted the tour six months earlier in his \"State of the State\" address. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel noted criticism from Democrats, including Russ Feingold, who is running against Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson for the seat he lost to Johnson in 2010.\n\nAs a senator, Feingold\u2019s listening sessions were open to the public, and that wasn't always pleasant during the emotional debates over President Barack Obama's health-care law in 2010, the Journal Sentinel noted. If the meetings aren\u2019t open to the public, Feingold told the newspaper, \"you're going to have a pre-selection process and you're not going to get the full picture.\"\n\nWalker spokesman Tom Evenson said the governor speaks to local media after each session.\n\nWachs says Walker's \"listening sessions\" are \"invite-only and excluding the press.\"\n\nAs he travels Wisconsin to meet with residents, Walker asks various people, including Democratic lawmakers, for suggestions on who to invite to his listening sessions. But the sessions are not open to the public or to the press, only to people who are invited.", "lang": "en"}
