He spent a week in the hospital, including three nights in intensive care, before being released on April 12, according to NPR.\n\nA viral Facebook post claims that the British prime minister did not have COVID-19, citing two doctors who allegedly treated him in the hospital as sources. (RELATED: Viral Video Claims To Show Mass Grave For Coronavirus Victims In Italy)\n\nDr. Shirley Knott allegedly said Johnson \u201chad the most pathetic, contrived cough I have heard in all my years of practise,\u201d while Dr. Ashleigh Pullin was quoted as saying, \u201cIf he had Covid-19 then I\u2019m not a doctor!\u201d The post asserted that these statements are \u201cproof\u201d that the public had been \u201choodwinked.\u201d\n\nBut there is no evidence this story is real. Neither doctor mentioned in the post can be found on the General Medical Council\u2019s register, a database that lists all the doctors in the United Kingdom. Nor could any news reporting could be found to back up the claim.\n\nReuters Fact Check traced the origins of the post to Facebook user Anthony George, who originally shared the story on the satirical Facebook page \u201cA Poke in the Eye With a Sharp Wit.\u201d The page describes itself as a \u201cplace for political humour and satire, poking fun at those in the government of the day.\u201d\n\nGeorge confirmed to Reuters that the post was written as satire, saying, \u201cThere was nothing personal intended towards Boris Johnson himself indeed, had it been Jeremy Corbyn or any other PM, I would have said the same.\u201d\n\nHowever, many of those who shared George\u2019s post failed to realize or disclaim its satirical nature. This is a common way misinformation spreads on the internet.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
