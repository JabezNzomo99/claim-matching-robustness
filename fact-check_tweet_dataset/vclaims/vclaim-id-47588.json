However, the video was actually recorded last year before the pandemic, and the Guinean government has not issued any such order.\n\nIn the video, a visibly angry French-speaking man is heard rebuking foreigners and demanding that they respect Guineans. Behind him, a group of Asian men and women look on, while cheers and clapping can be heard off-camera.\n\n\u201cThis can\u2019t go on. Either they respect the laws of this country, or they get out of here,\u201d the man says in French.\n\nOn April 18, 2020, a Kenyan blogger with more than one million followers tweeted the video and wrote: \u201cGuinea has allegedly arrested Chinese nationals in the country and has asked Beijing to assure the safe return of her citizens from China before they are released. #ChineseInKenyaMustGo\u201d.\n\nThe video was also posted with the same claim to Instagram on April 17, 2020. It has since been viewed more than 2,000 times and used in an article by a Kenyan website.\n\nThe same claim was also posted on Facebook here, here and here.\n\nThis video appeared online after Africans living in southern China report they have been victims of arbitrary evictions and discrimination during the pandemic, as covered by AFP here. In mid-April, the African Union expressed \u201cextreme concern\u201d about the situation and called on Beijing to take action.\n\nThe man in the video is not a government official, as some posts suggested, but the leader of a trade union.\n\nAFP was able to identify the man by searching for the keywords (in French) \u201cChinois\u201d (Chinese) and \u201cGuin\u00e9e\u201d (Guinea) on YouTube. This led us to another version of the same video, below, where the description identifies the man as a Guinean union member going by the name \u201cMara.\u201d\n\nFurther keyword searches using \u201cMara\u201d and \u201csyndicaliste\u201d (French for unionist) led to numerous photos and articles about Aboubacar Sidiki Mara, the secretary-general of the General Union of Workers of Guinea (UGTG), who is the man seen in the video.\n\nMara is a prominent union figure in Guinea. In May 2018, he was charged with \u201cincitement to revolt\u201d and given six months in jail, with a four-month suspended sentence.\n\nAFP contacted Mara, who said that the video was filmed last year before the start of the pandemic near Boffa, a town about 200 kilometres north of the capital, Conakry.\n\n\u201cIt was a reaction that I had when a Chinese person attacked a Guinean person in the Boffa port. I was present on the scene, and I asked the workers to chase the Chinese out of the region,\u201d he said, adding that the matter was later settled amicably.\n\nContrary to the claim being shared alongside the video, there is no record of the Guinean government ordering the arrest of Chinese nationals residing in the west African nation.\n\nOn April 14, 2020, Guinean Minister of Foreign Affairs Mamadi Tour\u00e9 held a cordial meeting with Huang Wei, the Chinese ambassador to Guinea, where he expressed his \u201cdeep concern about the differential treatment and the stigmatization which the Africans were undergoing\u201d in China\u2019s province of Guangdong, according to a statement published on the ministry\u2019s official Facebook page.\n\nAccording to this statement, the Chinese ambassador said that China attached \u201cgreat importance to this situation\u201d and that \u201cthe Chinese central government has given firm instructions to the localities in order to improve the mechanisms, methods and conditions of confinement\u201d.\n\nIn a statement published on April 20, 2020, the Chinese embassy in Guinea denied any arrests of its citizens had taken place.\n\n\u201cRecently, certain online media made noise about articles and videos on 'the arrest of Chinese nationals in Guinea by the Guinean government'. The embassy of China in Guinea attaches great importance to this matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cFollowing verification, we have found that these are pure and simple lies. We indignantly protest what is apparent defamation that aims to attack the friendship between China and Guinea and between China and Africa.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
