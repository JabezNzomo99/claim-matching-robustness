No, that's not true: the footage is at least ten years old and appears to only show bikers belonging to the Mongols MC. The image in the tweet from @_WhiteRabbitt_ dates back from 2018 and shows Hell's Angels in Canada. Other images circulating in connection with the rumor are similarily old or from different locations. No footage or images of both clubs riding together is shown and Sonny Barger, one of the oldest and best known members of the Hells Angels has denied any rumors about an alliance with the Mongols.\n\nThe video was published on YouTube channel Only Observer on June 13, 2020 titled \"Hell's Angels and Mongols riding together on their way to Seattle to scrap with Antifa Terrorists\" (archived here) which lacked any further description.\n\nClick below to watch the video on YouTube:\n\nThe video opened with an unverified tweet (archived here) from an account that describes itself as\n\nIt appears to have been launched in March 2020 and has been mainly tweeting about various conspiracy theories like Pizzagate, Bill Gates, vaccines and 5G. This is the tweet in question:\n\nThe account cites no sources for this news and Lead Stories has been unable to find any sort of announcement on websites or pages linked to either the Hell's Angels or the Mongols.\n\nNote that the image in the tweet is also not recent, it seems to date back to a 2018 gathering of Hell's Angels in Montreal, Canada according to The Canadian Press on Yahoo on August 10, 2018.\n\nSAINT-CHARLES-SUR-RICHELIEU, Canada -- Authorities ramped up checkpoints and their overall presence east of Montreal on Friday as members of the Hells Angels and their sympathizers continued to arrive for a weekend gathering. The Canada Run -- the Hells' annual get-together -- is being held this year in St-Charles-sur-Richelieu, 50 kilometres from Montreal. Police said some 500 full-patch Hells members and up to 200 sympathizers were expected to attend.\n\nThe rest of the footage appears to show the Mongols MC riding through a California landscape, with the occasional police car or helicopter keeping an eye on things. However that footage has been on YouTube for almost ten years, you can watch it here on a channel named \"MONGOLS MOTORCYCLE CLUB\" where it was uploaded on June 15, 2010:\n\nAnother image frequently used in tweets and posts shows two men wearing Hells Angels and Mongols colors walking side by side, for example in this tweet (archived here):\n\nHowever that image appears to be quite old as well, it appeared in an article (archived here) on Cycle Source in 2011.\n\nAnother frequently shared image, for example in this tweet (archived here) supposedly shows the Hells Angels riding towards Seattle together with either the Mongols, the Outlaws or Bikers for Trump:\n\nThat image appears to be a screenshot from a 2019 video taken in Brighton, UK (which is also why the bikers are driving on the left side of the road):\n\nLead Stories also checked the websites of the Hells Angels and the Mongols and found no mention of any alliance or collaboration. We reached out to both clubs but have yet to hear back, we will update this post if we get a reply to our inquiries.\n\nWhat's more, Sonny Barger, founder of one of the oldest Hells Angels chapters and a prominent member of the club, has taken to Facebook (archived here) to deny the rumor:\n\nHat tip to Biker News for pointing us towards Sonny Barger's post and for retracting their initial coverage of a similar rumor concerning Placerville, CA (which we debunked here)", "lang": "en"}
