The statistics support this.\n\nOf those killed on the road in Britain 2016, 6% were cyclists, as were 14% of those seriously injured. Along with pedestrians and motorcyclists, the government classifies cyclists as \u201cvulnerable road users\u201d because they are significantly more likely to be killed or injured per mile travelled, compared to other road users.\n\nThe claims were made in response to a (now deleted) Conservative Party tweet (see screenshot here) which said \u201cWe\u2019re launching a consultation into dangerous cycling so that our most vulnerable road users are protected.\u201d A government minister apologised for the tweet about \u201cdangerous cycling\u201d, saying it didn\u2019t reflect the policy it was announcing.\n\nVery few pedestrian fatalities involve cyclists. Of the 448 pedestrians killed by a vehicle in 2016, three were caused by bicycles, compared to 289 by cars. These levels have been broadly consistent over the past five years.\n\nHowever, the government thinks that the law on dangerous cycling is not as far-reaching as that on dangerous driving (it says it\u2019s harder to prove the offence of death or injury caused by dangerous cycling, and it\u2019s likely to carry a shorter sentence). It has launched a consultation into whether the law on dangerous cycling needs updating.\n\nCyclists and motorcyclists are the most likely to be killed or injured on the road\n\n102 cyclists were killed on British roads in 2016. Around 3,400 were seriously injured, and there were around 15,000 other casualties. This data won\u2019t cover any incidents that weren\u2019t reported.\n\nOf the 1,792 people killed on British roads in 2016, almost half of them (816) were car occupants, 25% (448) were pedestrians, and 6% (102) were cyclists. Looking at those seriously injured, the proportion of car users falls (to 37% in 2016) while the proportion of cyclists rises (to 14%). These figures are broadly consistent over the last five years.\n\nThe raw numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story, though, because car use is a much more common mode of transport than cycling or walking. Given that car drivers make up around 80% of the traffic on British roads, they are likely to make up a significant number of the casualties.\n\nSo another way to look at these figures is to ask how many deaths there are per miles travelled by a particular type of user. Based on this, the government identifies pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists as \u201cvulnerable road users\u201d.\n\nFor every billion miles travelled, these three groups are far more likely to be injured in an accident, or to be killed, than any other group. The above chart, published by the Department for Transport, shows slightly different figures to those reported in the underlying data, but the broad impression is very much the same in both sources.\n\nThe government has recently pointed out that \u201cThere were 2,491 recorded collisions between cyclists and pedestrians (where no other vehicle was involved) that resulted in a pedestrian casualty between 2011-2016, of which 20 were fatal and 546 resulted in serious injury.\u201d\n\nThis is correct, although proportionally very few pedestrian casualties involve bicycles. From 2012 to 2016, 2,120 pedestrians were killed by a vehicle in Britain\u20140.8% of these involved a bicycle, and 66% involved a car. In 2016, 448 pedestrians were killed by a vehicle\u2014three of these deaths involved a bike, and 289 involved a car.\n\nAlmost 26,000 pedestrians were seriously injured by vehicles from 2012 to 2016. Two percent of these involved a bike, and 81% involved a car. In 2016, 108 pedestrians were seriously injured by a bicycle, compared to 4,156 by a car.\n\nThe government is considering introducing a new offence against dangerous cycling\n\nBut why is the government doing this, if cyclists make up a significant number of casualties on the road, but bicycles cause relatively few pedestrian deaths? Largely, it\u2019s because the laws on dangerous cycling are not as wide-reaching as those on dangerous driving.\n\nCurrently, cyclists charged with dangerous or careless cycling can be fined up to \u00a32,500. In cases where a cyclist causes serious injury or death, they can be charged with \u201cwanton or furious driving\u201d, which carries a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment. This law was introduced in 1861, originally intended for horse and carriage driving, meaning it may not be appropriate for modern-day cycling cases, according to an independent legal review carried out for the government.\n\nThe government points out that there are a wider range of offences covering dangerous driving, including causing death by dangerous driving (carrying up to 14 years imprisonment) and causing serious injury by dangerous driving (up to 5 years imprisonment). It considers that there is a gap in the law, whereby it\u2019s easier to prove dangerous driving in court than dangerous cycling\u2014the \u201cwanton and furious driving\u201d offence only covers the extremes of dangerous cycling. It also notes that causing serious injury or death by dangerous or careless cycling is likely to lead to a shorter sentence than if caused by dangerous or careless driving.\n\nIt is therefore considering whether to bring in a new offence for dangerous cycling, equivalent to that of causing death by dangerous driving. At present, the government is seeking public consultation on whether to change the law.", "lang": "en"}
