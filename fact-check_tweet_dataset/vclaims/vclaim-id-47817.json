As per this article, Rizwan Ahmed, a daily wage worker, had died in Ambedkarnagar district of UP and his father alleged that Rizwan had died due to the injuries suffered as a result of the thrashing by Tanda town Police three days earlier. But, in a video enclosed in the tweet by Ambedkarnagar district Police on 19 April 2020, the Police said that they have examined the CCTV footage and have not found the occurrence of any such incident as alleged by the family members of Rizwan and the postmortem report had no mention of injuries due to lathi charge on the deceased\u2019s body. Also, the Police have said that, in the report, it was mentioned that the deceased had an infection in lungs & heart and injuries due to falling from a motorcycle, which was confirmed by a local doctor.\n\n\n\nThe Ambedkarnagar Police, in another tweet, also uploaded a video with a recording of local (Tanda) doctor\u2019s statements. In the video, the doctor has said that five to six days ago, Rizwan\u2019s family member approached him for medicine saying Rizwan had met with an accident.

The Ambedkarnagar Police also tweeted condemning the fake news being spread on social media regarding the incident.\n\nTo conclude, \u2018Rizwan died due to infection in liver and heart and had injuries due to falling from a motorcycle\u2019, clarifies Ambedkarnagar Police (UP).\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
