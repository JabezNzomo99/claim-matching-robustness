Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: \u2018104\u2019 launched as a Pan-India helpline number for the \u2018Blood on Call\u2019 service. Fact: \u2018104\u2019 helpline was launched for the \u2018Blood on Call\u2019 service only in Maharashtra. It is not a Pan-Indian service. Other states use the \u2018104\u2019 helpline for providing other services. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen searched on Google about the \u2018Blood on Call\u2019 (104) service, it was found that the service was launched in Maharashtra in January-2014. The details provided in the post about the service can be also found in an article published by \u2018Times of India\u2019 in 2014. The helpline number can be also found in Maharashtra\u2019s Public Health Department website. But, the \u2018104\u2019 helpline is being used for different purposes by other states (even Maharashtra uses the same number for other purposes) and the \u2018Blood on Call\u2019 service was not found to be implemented across the country.\n\nWhen searched further about the \u2018104\u2019 helpline, it was found that \u2018GVK EMRI is operating \u201c104 Health Advice Helpline Services\u201d in partnership with Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Goa and Rajasthan Administration of the Union Territories of Daman & Diu and, Dadra & Nagar Haveli.\u2019\n\nTelangana:\n\n104 medical services are under the control of the director and commissioner of the health department and are meant for rural health services.\n\nAssam:\n\n104 Sarathi is a round-the-clock free of cost health contact center. It provides four key services: Medical advice using triage, Counseling services, Directory information, and Complaint registry.\n\nRajasthan:\n\nThe 104 Medical Advice Service will help people get all information related to health by dialing a toll-free number \u201c104\u201d.\n\nTo sum it up, a state-specific \u2018Blood on Call\u2019 (104) service in Maharashtra is being shared as a Pan-Indian service.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
