He met with Sebastian Kurz, Austria\u2019s current chancellor, whom TASS quoted as saying:\n\n\u201cAs a superpower, Russia not only plays a big role in trouble spots - in Syria, in the east of Ukraine and in other ones, but it also has a big responsibility. And we hope and expect that Russia will make its contribution so that the people there could live the way they would like to, that is in peace.\"\n\nIt is the brevity of the article and the TASS headline, that \u201cstresses its (Russia\u2019s) role for peace\u201d that evokes our \u201cmisleading\u201d verdict \u2013 an article that was so stark in its inaccuracy that we originally set out to fact check the chancellor.\n\nChancellor Kurz is correct to state that Russia plays a big role in the two trouble spots he named. Putin\u2019s government instigated the trouble in Ukraine when Russia invaded and annexed the Crimean peninsula and then facilitated a war in the country\u2019s eastern Donbas region. It was a Russian citizen, Igor Girkin (aka \u201cStrelkov\u201d), the ex-commander of pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine, who publicly said he \u201cpulled the trigger of this war\u201d \u2013 hardly the peaceful role that TASS proclaims.\n\nIn the Syrian civil war that began in 2011, Russia backed the regime of Bashar al-Assad but did not militarily intervene until October 2015, when the Russian air force was deployed to support pro-government forces on the ground. With Russian air support, those pro-government forces have managed to retake territory lost in 2011-2015, including major population centers like Aleppo.\n\nWhile Russia is participating in peace negotiations for Syria, many analysts contend it prolonged the Syrian civil war by providing support to Assad and allowing him to launch major counter-offensives.\n\n\u201cThe intervention of Russia in the Syrian Civil War decisively tipped the balance of the conflict in favor of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad,\u201d Christopher Kozak, a senior researcher at the Institute for the Study of War told Polygraph.info via email. \n\n\n\nThe full context of Kurz\u2019s remarks can be seen on the Kremlin Web site, which published a transcript of the on-camera press conference. \n\n \n\n \u201cObservance of human rights is very important for us,\u201d Kurz is quoted on the Kremlin website just before the comments used by TASS.\n\nKurz also said: \u201cIn addition, we hope that progress will also be achieved in eastern Ukraine and that the Minsk agreements will be implemented. This is the scenario we want for our continent. We are deeply convinced that solely through cooperation and joint actions we can make further progress in relations between the two sides.\u201d\n\nThe article also leaves out Kurz\u2019s comments about Austria\u2019s intention to continue upholding the EU sanctions against Russia, which were put in place largely due to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, part of Ukraine in 2014.\n\nInterestingly, TASS covered this angle in a separate article about the meeting.\n\n\"We will continue our efforts to uphold communication channels with Russia, despite the necessary response to its actions, and take steps toward each other,\" TASS quoted Kurz as saying.\n\nAccording to Alexey Kovalev, an ex-RIA Novosti editor who now runs his own blog debunking Russian state media propaganda, the unusually short article on Sebastian Kurz\u2019s comment may have been due to an \u201covercautious editor\u201d trying to cover themselves.\n\nWhile the longer TASS article notes Kurz\u2019s positive words about Russia, it also includes his country\u2019s position on \u201canti-Russian sanctions.\u201d A reader who encounters the shorter article would be left with a different impression of the Austrian Chancellor\u2019s words.", "lang": "en"}
