Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of Congress MLA Anil Upadhyay blaming Congress leaders for anti-CAA protests and associated violence. Fact: There is no Congress MLA with the name Anil Upadhyay. Previously, many such random videos were shared with the same name but as \u2013 \u2018BJP MLA Anil Upadhyay\u2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched with the keywords, the extended version of the same video was found on YouTube. The video was uploaded by \u2018The Newspaper\u2019 channel on 4 March 2020. It was not mentioned anywhere that the man speaking in the video is a Congress MLA.\n\nWhen searched on the \u2018My Neta\u2019 website about \u2018Anil Upadhyay\u2019, it was found that there is no Congress MLA with the name \u2018Anil Upadhyay\u2019. There were two persons with that name in the search results but neither of them belongs to INC (Indian National Congress).\n\nEarlier, when several other videos claiming to be related to \u2018BJP MLA Anil Upadhyay\u2019 were shared on social media, FACTLY has debunked them. The fact-check articles can be read here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, there is no Congress MLA in the country with the name \u2013 \u2018Anil Upadhyay\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
