The Home Office doesn\u2019t publish figures on this, so we have to rely on estimates.\n\nThe most recent estimate suggests that around 618,000 people could have been living in the UK without permission in 2007. But because this was an estimate, the study thought that in reality it could be anywhere between 417,000 and 863,000 people. Of these around 442,000 (72%) were thought to live in London.\n\nThese figures include an estimate of children who may have been born in the UK while their parents were here illegally. They were based on the 2001 census.\n\nAn earlier estimate from the Home Office, also using the 2001 census figures, suggested that there might be around 430,000 people, or between 310,000 and 570,000.\n\nThere has been a considerable rise in immigration since these old estimates were put together, so they should be treated with caution.\n\nWhatever the number, \u201cthe consensus among researchers is that the majority of irregular migrants in the UK are likely to be visa over-stayers\u201d, according to the Migration Observatory at Oxford University. This could include a tourist who has overstayed a short-term visa, or someone who has been living in the UK but hasn\u2019t left before their longer-term visitors permit expired.\n\nWhy else might someone be in the country illegally?\n\nIf someone has broken the terms of a legal residence permit then they\u2019re also technically in the country illegally. An example of this would be someone that came to the UK to work, but had a permit with limits on the number of hours they would work each week. If he or she worked for longer than this, they could be in the country illegally.\n\nOthers might have entered the UK \u2018clandestinely\u2019, meaning that they\u2019ve snuck in, or as the Migration Observatory says, entered through \u2018means of deception\u2019\u2014for example, using forged documents.", "lang": "en"}
