Laudet's caption of the clip reads: \u201c#SuperTyphoon2019 coming to the Philippines\u2026 let\u2019s pray.\u201d\n\nLaudet\u2019s post has been spotted via Facebook Claim Check, one of Rappler\u2019s channels for fact checking. As of this writing, the post has garnered around 3,400 reactions, 1,300 comments, and 23,000 shares.\n\nPag-asa clarified that as of Tuesday, May 7, no super typhoon is headed to the Philippines. The weather agency, as of this writing, has only just been monitoring two low-pressure areas (LPA) inside and outside Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR).\n\nIn the CNN report, meteorologist Tom Sater was discussing with anchors the characteristics of Typhoon Ruby along with comparisons to Super Typhoon Yolanda. The two were compared as Typhoon Ruby was considered the Philippines\u2019s strongest typhoon in 2014, which came a year after Yolanda.\n\nFacebook user Catherine Del Castillo Laudet, meanwhile, describes herself as one who works in a chemical and pharmaceutical company. Her recent posts, aside from the false claim about a super typhoon, have been flagged by some Facebook users as fake. \u2013 Addie Pobre/ Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
