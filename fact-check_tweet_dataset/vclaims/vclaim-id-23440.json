But Keller\u2019s chances of winning were not rated 50-50 before the election \u2014 not by a long shot.\n\nAfter Keller\u2019s victory, Fox News reported, \"Tuesday's result is no surprise, as the 12th District is solidly Republican and voters there backed Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election by a margin of better than 2 to 1 over Democrat Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nInside Elections\u2019 Nathan Gonzales, one of the nation\u2019s major political handicappers, rated the contest Solid Republican, the safest category on his rating scale.\n\nIn addition, Politico reported that \"the race drew little attention from national Democrats.\"\n\nThe seat became vacant when Republican Rep. Tom Marino resigned from Congress in January after winning by a 32-point margin in November 2018. He said he would be taking a private-sector job.\n\nTrump said Keller \"was a 50-50 shot\" before his landslide victory.\n\nKeller was running in a deeply Republican district and was considered by independent political analysts to be the prohibitive favorite. He was not someone running in a coin-flip race. We rate the statement False.", "lang": "en"}
