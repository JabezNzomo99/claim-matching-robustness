This woman already has her baby cutting lines of cocaine for her!\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what this April 28 Facebook post would have you believe.\n\n\"This is the most disgusting picture I\u2019ve EVER seen,\" the poster writes about the image of a woman leaning over a pile of white powder on a table while the child next to her seems to be dragging a credit card through the substance. \"Get this shared so she gets caught and gets that kid took off her!\"\n\nThe post has been shared more than 116,000 times and it was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nIn the comments, people have piled on, calling the woman pathetic and stupid and words we won\u2019t print here. But at least one account described the image differently: \"Boomer bait.\"\n\nThat\u2019s because the photo was staged by actress and sketch comedian Janell Lenfert. In 2015, she posted the image on the account with this caption: \"If you need a babysitter, please let me know!\"\n\nShe also included a caveat: \"Can\u2019t believe I need to say this but THIS IS FAKE. IT\u2019S BAKING FLOUR PEOPLE!!\"\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
