[They were] incorporating the data from the old dashboard to a new dashboard,\u201d the Director of Public Health at the Ghana Health Service (GHS), Dr Badu Sarkodie confirmed in an interview with GhanaFact.\n\nDuring the \u201ctransition period,\u201d the website only showed the total number of cases recorded in Ghana and a notice that said, \u201cupdates coming soon.\u201d\n\nGhanaweb.com in defence of the published article has said the story \u201ccan be corroborated by the new and revamped features visible\u201d on Ghana\u2019s coronavirus official website.\n\nThe 3news.com article has also not been pulled down from the website about three hours after the alert by the information ministry as editors of the online platform stand by their story.\n\nMeanwhile, all efforts to reach the Ministry of Information to clarify its position on the issue have proven futile. We will duly update this report if we get a response.\n\nGovernment has been forced recently to respond to widespread claims that some key information around the coronavirus spread in Ghana and total samples tested had either been bloated or being massaged.\n\nWithout communicating details of the upgrade of the COVID-19 official website, the \u201ctransition period\u201d allowed for speculation due to the gap in communication.\n\nIt was wrong for the Information Ministry to flag the 3news.com story as false because at the time of filing the story the changes to the website were true.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that Ghana\u2019s COVID-19 official website was only undergoing an upgrade.\n\nThe COVID-19 portal now comes with data visualization upgrade and \u201cthe previous data are all there,\u201d Dr Badu Sarkodie has stated.\n\nAn independent content search showed the previous data published on the platform can be found using the pull-down button at the top right-hand corner of the website.", "lang": "en"}
