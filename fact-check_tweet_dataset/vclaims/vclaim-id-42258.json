When asked about chorus growing to declare Pakistan as terror state, hesitates to answer and says we have to solve the terrorism crisis on our country first.\u201d\n\nThis is the message that played out on the channel below Kumaraswamy\u2019s sound bite which is in Kannada. \u201cShocker from Cong ally and Karnataka CM\u201d, \u201cHDK blames India for \u2018terrorism crisis'\u201d and \u201cKarnataka CM refuses to condemn Pak\u201d were some of the titles used by the channel for this story.\n\nAccording to Times Now, H D Kumaraswamy refused to categorically condemn Pakistan. Instead, he spoke about \u201cterrorism crisis on our country first\u201d, as reported by Times Now. Is this true?\n\nWhat did H D Kumaraswamy say?\n\nSocial media users who came across this broadcast by Times Now lashed out at the channel, saying that it had got its translation horribly wrong. According to them, Kumaraswamy had NOT \u201cblamed India for terrorism crisis\u201d, as reported by Times Now.\n\nThe correct translation of Kumaraswamy\u2019s sound bite is as follows:\n\n\u201cKilling the Pulwama mastermind is a good thing but no matter what we do we can not come out of the grief of losing 40 of our Jawans. We need to work towards building an environment where unfortunate events like these don\u2019t repeat. It\u2019s Govt\u2019s responsibility. \u201c\n\n\u201cAnnouncing Pak as a terror nation is one part. The Important part is eradicating the activities of terrorists living in India. It can be done by gun or by bringing them into confidence. It\u2019ll avoid more of our soldiers dying. Central govt should give more importance to that.\u201d\n\nThe above statement was interpreted by Times Now as Kumaraswamy blaming India for terrorism instead of unequivocally condemning Pakistan. The channel misquoted the Karnataka CM, who tweeted later saying he had been misquoted as well as misunderstood, and that he had only reiterated the need for making the country stronger \u201calong with destroying the enemies\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
