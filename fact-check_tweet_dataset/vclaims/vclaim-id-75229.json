The picture used in the forward is from 2015 when the Telugu cinema actor met the prime minister after the release of Baahubali, the first film in a two-part series.\n\nBelow is a tweet from the prime minister's verified Twitter account on July 26, 2015.\n\nA screenshot of the PTI article carried by the Indian Express clearly shows the date.\n\nBaahubali 2: The Conclusion is easily set to break Box Office records having grossed over Rs 600 crores in the first six days since its release, according to news reports.\n\nThere have been several hoax WhatsApp messages circulating that claim a few of the actors and director S.S. Rajamouli have donated earnings from the film to the families of CRPF and army jawans.", "lang": "en"}
