The post has got over 1000 shares.\n\nClick here for the archived link of the post.\n\nAnother Facebook page - Pulse of India's post claims, 'All set for kumbh Mel\"\n\nClick here for the archived version of the post.\n\nFacebook pages Namo Bharath - Narendra Modi for PM and Postcard Kanada also shared the image. Postcard later deleted the post. Below is a screenshot.\n\nClick here for the archived link of the post.\n\nHow did we find the image is from Saudi Arabia and not Kumbh Mela?\n\nA Google reverse image search showed websites pointing the image is from Saudi Arabia.\n\nHowever, none of them were authoritative sources. So, we used other tools to find the exact location.\n\nEvidence I: Close observation and magnification of the image shows women in burqa walking on the road.\n\nThis indicates that it cannot be a site of Hindu pilgrimage.\n\nEvidence II : A basic Google search for 'white tents in Saudi Arabia' showed results for Mina Valley. The tents seen in the image below of Mina Valley are similar to those in the disputed picture. The tents have a peculiar pattern with a conical structure placed on top of the tent. Moreover, the manner in which the air conditioners are placed are similar.\n\nThese tents are clearly different from the tents pitched for Kumbh Mela in Uttar Pradesh as seen below.\n\nEvidence III: The location in the image is next to King Khalid Bridge in Mina Valley\n\nWe decided to find the exact location of the image in Mina Valley using Google Maps.\n\nA landmark that stands out in the image is the arched flyover.\n\nBOOM located the flyover on Google Maps and found it merging into the King Khalid Bridge, Mina Valley.\n\nClick here for the link to the map.\n\nUpon navigating the map, BOOM found that the infrastructure seen along the road towards the bridge is similar to that seen in the image. Here, are few features that we found matching.\n\nEvidence IV: Upon searching for 'Mina' and 'Haj' on Twitter, we found a video clip by @MadinahDate which gives an aerial view of the location. From 0.20 seconds of the clip you can see the the start of the arched flyover merging into King Khaled Bridge, corroborating what we found using Google Maps.\n\nEvidence V: BOOM also found an Arabic news article by Al-manara.net filed on August 2018 which says that the image is from Mina Valley during Hajj.\n\nMina valley known as the tent city is located around 7 kms away from Mecca. It accommodates more than 3 million Hajj pilgrims.", "lang": "en"}
