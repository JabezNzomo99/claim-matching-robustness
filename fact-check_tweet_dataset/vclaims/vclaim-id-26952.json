No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to educate gullible Trump supporters and Republicans about the need to actually click and read links before sharing or liking them in order to avoid being embarrassed by fans of the site later. All the events described in the article are not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by America's Last Line of Defense on February 4, 2019 titled \"Al Sharpton Files FOIA Request to Release Trump's Tax Returns\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nBut Sharpton's own website makes no mention of this \"news\" and the article itself was posted under the category \"DESTROYING AMERICA WITH SATIRE\".

Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\n'Nothing on this page is real': How lies become truth in online America November 17 The only light in the house came from the glow of three computer monitors, and Christopher Blair, 46, sat down at a keyboard and started to type. His wife had left for work and his children were on their way to school, but waiting online was his other community, an unreality where nothing was exactly as it seemed.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news.
