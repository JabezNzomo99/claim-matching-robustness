But he never raised either tax.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-09-06T07:00:09.841Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-37358", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/06/koch-funded-group-misfires-with-attack-ad-phil-bredesen/", "vclaim": "This is a puzzler because, although he considered it, Bredesen did not actually increase the sales tax or gas tax while in office. Instead, the governor and Tennessee lawmakers enacted a new tax on cigarettes, raised employer taxes to shore up the state\u2019s unemployment trust fund and closed several corporate tax loopholes, among other changes.\n\nTennessee\u2019s gas tax did not increase while Bredesen was governor from 2003 to 2011. It was set by law at 20 cents per gallon from 1989 to 2017, when Gov. Bill Haslam (R) signed a 6-cent increase to be phased in over three years.\n\nIn 2003, Bredesen said raising the gas tax by \u201ca couple of pennies\u201d per gallon might be needed so that Tennessee could get matching funds from the federal government that otherwise might have been left on the table. He would return to this idea over the following years, according to news articles cited by Americans for Prosperity. But he never acted on it.\n\n\u201cI think infrastructure is important,\u201d Bredesen said in 2006, according to the Times Free Press. \u201cWe fund it through the gas tax. And if there\u2019s additional federal money which a small increase in the gas tax would make sense to bring down, then I\u2019m for it. I think we should do it.\u201d\n\nAnd Bredesen\u2019s campaign pointed out that, in 2006, he proposed a sales tax holiday for the back-to-school season, which is now a yearly tradition. \u201cThanks to this annual tax-free weekend, Tennesseans have saved over $100 million,\u201d a Bredesen spokeswoman said. (How do they get this $100 million estimate? According to the Leaf-Chronicle of Clarksville, Tenn., \u201cthe first Sales Tax Holiday was Aug. 4-6, 2006, saving Tennesseans about $15 million. Since then, Tennesseans have enjoyed a combined $8 [million] to $10 million in tax savings each holiday.\u201d)\n\nBredesen did raise some taxes and fees during his eight-year tenure \u2014 other ones. A cigarette tax from 2007 was estimated to add $160 million to $180 million in annual revenue. Temporary higher taxes on employers raised an estimated $245 million a year for the state\u2019s troubled unemployment trust fund. The Times Free Press calculated that these and other changes, such as closing corporate tax loopholes and raising fees, added more than $900 million a year in revenue for Tennessee\u2019s state budget.\n\n\u201c\u2018Support\u2019 means you\u2019re in favor of something whether you act on it or not,\u201d said Gabrielle Braud, an AFP spokeswoman. \u201cBredesen talked publicly and repeatedly about wanting both taxes and actually took steps to eliminate the sales tax cap but was rebuffed by lawmakers. The goal of the ad is to highlight for Tennesseans how Phil Bredesen\u2019s instincts turn to harmful tax increases even when he doesn\u2019t get his way.\u201d\n\nThe TV ad itself doesn\u2019t make this nuanced argument. The way it\u2019s worded, viewers easily could get the impression that Bredesen not only \u201csupported\u201d but proposed or signed higher taxes for gasoline and other purchases. After all, when an elected official supports something, especially a governor, that usually means some kind of official action.\n\n\"Governor Bredesen balanced eight budgets without imposing an income tax or increasing the sales tax on Tennessee families,\u201d said Alyssa Hansen, a Bredesen spokeswoman. \u201cHe also worked diligently with the legislature to raise the tobacco tax to fund education and to close corporate tax loopholes that were siphoning resources away from public safety, health care, education, and other priorities.\u201d\n\nThe head-scratcher here is why Americans for Prosperity chose to spotlight ideas that never took off instead of the taxes and fees Bredesen did raise. Our unsolicited advice for ad-makers is to stick with the facts, even if they\u2019re not as exciting. Otherwise the risk is ending up like Americans for Prosperity, with Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
