Around \u00a360million.\u201d Viral post sent to us by a reader.\n\nFollowing the wedding of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle, we\u2019ve been asked to factcheck claims going round on social media about the royal family\u2019s finances and contributions to the British economy.\n\nThis follows claims that the wedding would be taxpayer funded\u2014something we looked at in this factcheck.\n\nThe royal finances are complex and reflect the way the monarchy\u2019s role has changed over time. Currently the Queen\u2019s income comes from three sources: the Sovereign Grant from the government and two private income sources. One of these she receives as sovereign and is passed down from sovereign to sovereign (the Privy Purse), and the other is income from her personal investments.\n\nSome of the Queen\u2019s money comes from the Sovereign Grant\n\nHistorically, the Sovereign was responsible for lots of government expenses and used income from their lands to help pay for this.\n\nAs public taxes became more important than Crown lands income as the government\u2019s primary source of revenue, King George III agreed to give the income from some Crown holdings to the Treasury in exchange for an annual payment.\n\nThese holdings are collectively known as the Crown Estate. The estate includes lots of properties which generate income from things like rent.\n\nOver time, more and more income from Crown lands was handed over to government, and as such the Sovereign was directly responsible for less and less government expense.\n\nThe profits of the Crown Estate are public money and all go to the Treasury. This is then collected together with the income the Treasury gets from general taxation and other sources, into one pot: the \u201cConsolidated Fund\u201d. We\u2019ll refer to this pot as \u201cpublic money\u201d; most of it comes from general taxation, but some of it is from non-tax sources (such as the Crown Estate profits).\n\nThe Treasury then pays the Sovereign Grant to the Queen, which is currently calculated as the equivalent of 25% of the Crown Estate\u2019s profits two years previously. The amount of the grant isn\u2019t determined by how much the royal family plans to spend.\n\nIn any year, the Treasury always pays at least as much as it paid in Sovereign Grant the previous year, so if the Crown Estate\u2019s profits were to go down then the Grant would not (and so would end up being more than 25%). This hasn\u2019t happened yet; since the Sovereign Grant replaced the old system of funding the monarchy in 2011, the estate\u2019s profits have increased each year.\n\nIt used to be 15% but was increased this year to pay for refurbishments to Buckingham Palace and will stay at 25% for 10 years.\n\nIn 2019/20 the Queen will receive \u00a382 million. Any unspent money goes into the Sovereign Grant Reserve each year.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the government is taking the Queen\u2019s private revenue\n\nIt\u2019s incorrect to say that government keeps \u00a3360 million of the royal family\u2019s \u201cprivate revenue\u201d.\n\nIn 2017/18, the Crown Estate made about \u00a3330 million profit. As we\u2019ve said this all goes into Consolidated Fund before the government pays the Sovereign Grant which is based on 25% of Estate profits. But the Crown Estate isn\u2019t the royal family\u2019s private property.\n\nThe Queen herself is part of the state\u2014specifically, Head of State. So the land she owns as Head of State, (meaning the Crown Estate) can be described as the Sovereign\u2019s \u201cpublic estate.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury say of the Crown Estate, \u201cwhile it is part of the public sector, it is not government property.\n\n\u201cNor is it part of the monarch\u2019s private estate.\u201d\n\nThe Queen does have two private sources of money\n\nThe Queen also receives private income from two other sources.\n\nOne is the Privy Purse, used to meet the some of the Sovereign\u2019s and royal family\u2019s private and official expenditure. It\u2019s funded by other landholdings, collectively called the Duchy of Lancaster.\n\nThese include rural areas in Lancashire and Yorkshire, but also urban holdings in central London near the Savoy hotel. In the year to March 2018, the income from the Duchy was around \u00a320 million.\n\nThe other is private investment income from holdings such as from the Royal Stud at Sandringham or Balmoral Castle. These aren\u2019t owned by the \u201cSovereign\u201d as an abstract entity, but by the Queen personally. As this is private income, we don\u2019t know how much this amounts to.\n\nThe Queen pays tax on private income and income from the Duchy of Lancaster.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know the wider economic benefit of the monarchy exactly\n\nSome of the claims following the Royal Wedding argue that we shouldn\u2019t begrudge the monarchy the public costs from the Royal Wedding (for example security), because they create so much economic benefit.\n\nOne estimate came from consultancy Brand Finance who said that in 2017 the monarchy contributed \u00a31.8 billion to the UK economy, of which around \u00a3550 million came from tourism.\n\nThis is a gross figure (so before the estimated costs have been subtracted). The net contribution estimate is \u00a31.5 billion a year.\n\nThis estimate is largely subjective depending on what factors you think should or shouldn\u2019t be included.\n\nFor example, the report estimates the monarchy contribute \u00a350 million towards the media industry by providing the inspiration and \u201cmystique\u201d for TV shows like The Crown and plays like King Charles III. It\u2019s up to you to decide whether you think those should or shouldn\u2019t be included.\n\nAnd even once you decide what influences to include, then trying to put a number on the exact contribution the royal family make to those areas is harder still. Any estimate is going to be extremely uncertain.", "lang": "en"}
