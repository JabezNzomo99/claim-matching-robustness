Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nWhen searched for the name of the candidate on Google, it can be found that Kento Jini has won the Alo East Constituency Assembly seat in Arunachal Pradesh unopposed. Ram Madhav, BJP\u2019s National General Secretary, has also tweeted about this on his Twitter account. There are only two Parliamentary seats in Arunachal Pradesh and the BJP members contesting those seats are Tapir Gao (Arunachal East) and Kiren Rijiju (Arunachal West).\n\nAlso, the affidavit filed by Kento Jini can be found in the Alo East Constituency section of the ECI\u2019s website, where it can be seen that he applied for Alo East Assembly Constituency. He was elected unopposed as nomination filed by his lone rival candidate (Minkir Lollen \u2013 Congress) was found invalid by the Election Commission. So, it can be concluded that the claim made in the post is FALSE.", "lang": "en"}
