On the surface, that might seem like a hard sell, given that she was fired as chief executive of HP less than six years after she took the helm in mid-1999. \u201cCarly Fiorina\u2019s time at the top of HP was a disaster\u201d is the subhed for a Bloomberg article that recently appeared in The Chicago Tribune.\n\nMoreover, the statistics don\u2019t tell the story about how difficult the merger was. (For some fascinating\u2013and critical\u2013history, read this Fortune magazine article from 2005 titled \u201cWhy Carly\u2019s big bet is failing.\u201d) Fiorina pushed the merger to make HP the dominant maker of personal computers \u2014 just as PCs began their long decline. HP announced in 2014 that it would spin off its PC and printer business, signaling that it was giving up on Fiorina\u2019s gambit.\n\nThe Fiorina Super PAC initially said it was comparing first quarters of 2000 and 2005, which didn\u2019t make much sense, except for the fact that she was forced out in the first quarter. Then officials compared a year to year growth for the second quarter (ending April 30) in 1999, which was 2 percent, to the full year figure for 2004.\n\nYet given that Fiorina started on July 17, using the third quarter probably makes more sense. The net revenue growth in that quarter was 12 percent, not 2 percent. In other words, growth can vary from quarter to quarter, making it a misleading metric for evaluating a nearly six-year tenure.\n\nAnnual revenue comparisons make the most sense. Fiorina only headed HP for three months in the fiscal year of 1999, so that year is an appropriate base. The net revenue growth in 1999 was 7 percent, according to the 10-K. Fiorina only headed HP during the first quarter of 2005, so let\u2019s use the growth figure for fiscal year 2004. The 10-K says revenue growth was 9 percent, but much of that was due to currency exchange rates, so on constant currency basis the revenue growth was 3 percent.\n\nPatents are the lifeblood of the technology industry. As evidence of this claim, the Fiorina Super PAC points to the fact that the 2005 10-K says that HP\u2019s patent portfolio was over 30,000 as of Oct. 31, 2005, while a news article from 1999 quotes her as saying the company had 10,000 patents.\n\nThat is certainly a tripling of patents, but the statement was about the rate of patents a day. That 1999 article quotes Fiorina as saying that patents were growing at a rate of five patents a day, so that should be considered the base for comparison.\n\nThe gap between the two statements is almost six years (Dec. 1999 to Oct. 2005), so 20,000 additional patents indicates a growth rate of 9 patents a day. (The campaign counts it as five years, for a rate of 11 a day.) Either way, that a doubling of the rate, not a tripling.\n\nAlso, the purchase of Compaq added to HP\u2019s patent portfolio. While we could not determine a precise number for Compaq patent portfolio at the time of the merger, HP\u2019s 2003 10-K suggests Compaq added about 3,000 patents. So that takes off about a patent a day, resulting in an innovation rate of about 8 patents a day.\n\nBut before the merger with Compaq, HP had 86,200 employees and Compaq had 63,700 employees. That adds up to 149,900. HP\u2019s filings show that the combined company had 141,000 employees in 2002 and 142,000 employees in 2003. By 2005, the number was 150,000. In other words, the number of employees barely budged from the pre-merger total\u2013and people lost jobs as a result.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times, evaluating Fiorina\u2019s record when she ran for the Senate in 2010, noted that during her tenure HP also acquired more than a dozen other companies with at least 8,000 employees. Indeed, Fiorina has acknowledged firing more than 30,000 workers in the wake of the Compaq merger.\n\nLeslie Shedd, press secretary for Carly for America, issued the following statement: \u201cDuring Carly\u2019s tenure at HP, she doubled revenue, tripled innovation, and quadrupled cash flow. Under Carly\u2019s leadership, HP weathered the 2001 economic recession that shuttered some of the top tech companies in Silicon Valley. Carly Fiorina made the tough decisions that were necessary to reform the company, and HP and its shareholders reaped the rewards of those decisions after she left.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
