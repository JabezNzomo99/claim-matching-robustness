A lengthy\n\nand our readers selected the 7 contained in this report.\n\nThe president\u2019s spokesman, Dr Bongani Ngqulunga, said he would respond to our email requesting sources for the claims, but he hasn\u2019t yet.

However, Africa Check has so far been unable to confirm this and to double-check the value of the first phase with the department of trade and industry\u2019s Sidwell Medupe. - Laura Kapelari\n\n, people in the know told us that South Africa\u2019s antiretroviral therapy programme is undoubtedly the world\u2019s largest.\n\nAnd it is even larger than what the presidency says it is. At the end of February 2017, 3.69 million people were on antiretroviral therapy supplied by the government, the national health department\u2019s Joe Maila told us.\n\nWhen the World Health Organisation last provided a comparison,\n\n, South Africa had 3.5 times as many patients as India, the next in line.\n\non the same day, which said that in the 2015/16 financial year \u201cthe National School Nutrition Programme reached a total of 9,630,590 learners in 21,177\u201d schools.\n\n, supports the figures cited in the statement. The tweeted claim is therefore an understatement.\n\nThe nutrition programme is funded through a treasury grant. In 2015/16, R5.7 billion was allocated to South Africa\u2019s provinces. The programme provides meals to pupils in the country\u2019s poorest 60% schools.\n\nThe department does not monitor the feeding scheme in all schools, however.
