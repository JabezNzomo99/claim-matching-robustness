Amy Klobuchar, a Democratic candidate for president, went too far when she said Education Secretary Betsy DeVos \u201cnot only has tried to defund special education, but she also has tried to get rid of the Special Olympics funding.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar has a point about the Special Olympics, but the administration\u2019s proposed budget keeps the bulk of the special education funding intact.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the proposed fiscal year 2020 Department of Education budget sought to eliminate federal contributions to the Special Olympics \u2014 a cut that DeVos later said she opposed behind the scenes and that President Donald Trump reversed after public outcry. But most of the federal government\u2019s funding for special education flows through Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, and the department\u2019s budget proposed keeping that federal funding at $13.2 billion \u2014 the same as Congress approved for FY2019.\n\nDeVos found herself in the national media spotlight for her department\u2019s proposed budget cut of nearly $18 million for the Special Olympics and more than $20 million to other programs that serve blind and deaf students.\n\nDuring the CNN town hall on April 22, an audience member asked Klobuchar about DeVos\u2019 attempts to \u201cslash funding from special needs programs.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar noted that she \u201cstrongly opposed\u201d DeVos\u2019 appointment as secretary of education.\n\n\u201cIt is no surprise to me that these things keep happening, and she not only has tried to defund special education, but she also has tried to get rid of the Special Olympics funding, if you watched any of this,\u201d Klobuchar said.\n\n\n\nLater in her answer, Klobuchar, who supports substantially increasing federal IDEA funding, said the Trump administration wants to \u201creduce the funding for special ed and for the Olympics which then had a reverse on because there was such a public outcry. That hurts people with disabilities, and they haven\u2019t done anything to fund education for people with disabilities. So I give them, since you\u2019re all students, an \u2018F.'\u201d\n\nIn often confrontational congressional testimony, DeVos attempted to defend the cuts, noting that she was under a directive to cut 10 percent from the overall education budget and \u201cwe had to make some difficult decisions with this budget.\u201d DeVos added that the Special Olympics is \u201cwell-supported by the philanthropic sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it that we have a problem with children who are in special education? \u201cDemocratic Rep. Mark Pocan asked in a widely reported exchange.\n\nDeVos noted that the proposed budget kept IDEA funding levels the same, even in the context of an overall 10 percent cut to the education budget.\n\nPocan, though, said he was talking about cuts to other programs, including ones that support blind and deaf students.\n\nIndeed, the proposed budget did call for cuts to programs for the disabled, including:\n\u2022 Reducing federal funding to Gallaudet University, a school for the deaf, by $13 million, to $121 million.\n\u2022 Cutting the federal allocation for the American Printing House for the Blind, a program that produces books for blind students, by $5 million, to $25 million.\n\u2022 Cutting the funding for the National Technical Institute for the Deaf by $8 million, to $70 million.\n\u2022 And reducing the funding for the Helen Keller National Center from $13 million to $10 million.\n\nWhen we contacted Klobuchar\u2019s office, it cited cuts to those programs \u2014 which are authorized under legislation separate from IDEA \u2014 as well as proposed cuts to programs that include services for those with special needs, including Arts in Education, which offers special programs for disabled students, and the Office of Disability Employment Policy, which seeks to eliminate barriers in the training and employment of people with disabilities.\n\nIn a statement released on March 27, DeVos defended the administration\u2019s commitment to special education funding.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake: we are focused every day on raising expectations and improving outcomes for infants and toddlers, children and youth with disabilities, and are committed to confronting and addressing anything that stands in the way of their success,\u201d DeVos stated. \u201cThe President\u2019s budget reflects that commitment. It supports our nation\u2019s 7 million students with disabilities through a $13.2 billion request for IDEA funding, the same funding level appropriated by Congress. All of that money goes directly to states to ensure students with disabilities have the resources and supports they need. The budget also requests an additional $225.6 million for competitively awarded grants to support teacher preparation, research and technical assistance to support students with disabilities.\u201d\n\nThe National Education Association told us that although the department\u2019s budget proposes to keep the federal contribution to IDEA at the same level it was in FY2019, the average federal share per child would be less in FY2020 because the average cost per pupil is expected to rise, as is the number of children with disabilities served.\n\nAfter he reversed course on funding the Special Olympics, Trump told reporters on March 28, \u201cI have overridden my people.\u201d Trump\u2019s previous budget proposals similarly called for eliminating Special Olympics funding, but Congress funded it anyway.\n\nInterestingly, DeVos \u2014 who last year contributed a quarter of her salary, $50,000, to the Special Olympics \u2014 said she has fought behind the scenes to keep the Special Olympics funding in the administrations\u2019 proposed budgets, but according to CNN, she was rebuffed by the White House budget office.\n\nOne can take issue with the proposed cuts to several programs that serve people with disabilities. But that is different from attempting to \u201cdefund special education,\u201d as Klobuchar put it. The proposed cuts to those programs are a fraction of the money proposed for special education funding through IDEA.\n\nKlobuchar\u2019s office said she \u201cmade it clear that this was both defunding some programs, as well as reducing funding of other programs.\u201d But the line between cutting funding for some programs for people with disabilities versus special education funding through IDEA has been blurred in the public debate, and Klobuchar\u2019s comment that DeVos sought to \u201cdefund special education\u201d contributes to the confusion.", "lang": "en"}
