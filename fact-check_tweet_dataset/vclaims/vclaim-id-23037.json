The caption claimed that the students had admitted to receiving training for terror activities at the madrasa.\n\nIt also stated that mainstream media has refused to bring this event to light as they had \"orders from above\" to ignore it.\n\nThe video shows a group of children being escorted by the police.\n\nBOOM searched for the caption in English and found the video shared on social media platforms with the same caption.\n\nBOOM found a discrepancy in the claims being made in the caption. While the Hindi text received on WhatsApp suggest that the children themselves claimed that they were being sent for terror training, the captions on Facebook videos suggested that it was the police who made that claim.\n\nWhile going through the list of Facebook search results for the caption, BOOM found that the video was shared four years ago, with the same caption.\n\nOne of the videos was shared on August 7, 2015, while the other was shared on August 9, 2015.\n\nTo investigate further, BOOM did a Google search with the keywords \"63 muslim students detained Kolkata\" and set the time-filter to show results between August 1, 2015 and August 10, 2015.\n\nThe search results led us to three different reports on this issue by the Indian Express, Scroll and DNA, respectively.\n\nAccording to news reports, on August 2, 2015, Government Railway Police (GRP) at Sealdah railway station in Kolkata detained 63 children along with a madrasa teacher and his wife.\n\nIndian Express reported that the children were from Bihar's Purnea-Kishengunj belt, and were on their way to Pune for training in a madrasa.\n\nAccording to Scroll and DNA, the GRP stated that the group was intercepted after they allegedly failed to provide proper identity documents.\n\nThe report did not mention any suspicions of terror activities raised by the police, neither did it mention the children claiming that they were being sent for terror training.\n\nThe articles also mentioned that the detention led to protests from the Muslim community across Kolkata, which lead to a panic on Twitter about a possible 'riot' in the city.\n\nHowever, Scroll reported that there were no riots in the city.\n\nThe reports suggest that the children were sent back to their families in Bihar.", "lang": "en"}
