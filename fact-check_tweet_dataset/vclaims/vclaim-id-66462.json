It prohibits a handgun buyer from taking possession of the weapon until 48 hours after a background check is started -- even if the check comes back clean within a matter of hours or minutes.\n\nThe City of Milwaukee, the Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence and the Wisconsin Medical Society are that oppose scrapping the law. Some say the cooling-off period can help prevent crimes of passion, such as domestic violence.\n\nUnder the repeal bill from Wanggaard, who is a retired Racine police traffic investigator, a buyer could of a handgun as soon as the seller completes the background check.\n\nbacking the repeal include the National Rifle Association, the Milwaukee Police Association union and the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation. Some say the wait following a successful background check is an \"unnecessary on both the purchaser and the dealer,\" and that a person who needs a gun for protection can be put at risk.\n\nWalker has indicated he supports the repeal. Asked about such a measure in February 2015, he : \"I think we want to be a leader in this area as well.\"\n\nHere are highlights from some key studies about the effects of waiting-period laws:\n\ndone by one researcher from Georgetown University and one from Duke University that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2000 examined the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a 1994 federal law that established a nationwide waiting period and background check for handgun sales. (The waiting period provision was later removed.)\n\nThe study concluded that the law\u2019s waiting period was associated with reductions in the firearm suicide rate for people age 55 and older, but not associated with reductions in homicide rates or overall suicide rates.\n\nOther has found that people who buy handguns are at a higher risk of committing suicide during the first week after the purchase. For example, published in 2000 by members of the Firearm Injury Center at the Medical College of Wisconsin said a Wisconsin study found a \"sharp increase\" in the risk of suicide within one week of a gun purchase.\n\nBut by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that reviewed studies on the effects of waiting periods on violence found that some studies indicated a decrease in violent outcomes associated with the delay, while others indicated an increase.\n\nAnd a by one researcher from the University of Cincinnati and another from Arizona State University found no statistical effects from waiting periods on gun crimes.\n\nIn a nutshell, except for suicide, the studies show Wanggaard\u2019s claim about waiting periods and violence is largely correct.\n\nDaniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Gun Policy and Research, told us there is research linking more thorough background checks -- which take longer than an instant FBI check -- with reduced homicide rates. The more thorough checks are more likely to turn up reasons why a person cannot legally purchase a gun. But Webster said he is not aware of research that shows waiting periods reduce violence.\n\nSimilarly, Harvard\u2019s David Hemenway said he was aware only of research that links lower suicide rates with wait periods. Many studies link lower levels of lethal violence with strong gun control laws in general, but not with particular laws such as a waiting period, he said.\n\nWanggaard said, \"There\u2019s no statistical evidence that\" a waiting period for handgun purchases \"reduces violence whatsoever.\"\n\nThere is research to indicate that handgun waiting periods are linked with lower suicide rates. But we did not find evidence that waiting periods coincide with less violence being committed by one person against another. If such evidence emerges, we may revisit this item.\n\nAs it stands, Wanggaard\u2019s statement is accurate but needs clarification -- our definition of Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
