There is also some evidence that the impact on women is most disproportionate, in comparison to men, among higher earners.\n\nThese calculations don\u2019t tell the whole story though. Even if a woman is the nominated recipient of child tax credit, if she lives with a male partner, that partner will also be affected by the loss to household income. So these figures don\u2019t reflect the \u201cindirect\u201d impact on other household members. It also doesn\u2019t include spending changes that can\u2019t be linked to individuals (e.g. departmental spending and business tax rates).\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Labour has made such a claim\n\nBack in 2010, the coalition government committed to operating without a structural deficit on day-to-day spending by 2014/15 (a target that wasn\u2019t met, and still hasn\u2019t been), which required reductions in public spending.\n\nSince 2010, Labour has asked the House of Commons Library (a research service for MPs)\u2014using Treasury data\u2014to look at every single specific change to direct taxes, benefits and tax credits under the coalition (and now also Conservative) governments, starting with the coalition's first budget of June 2010. Labour asked them to work out the financial impact of these changes on women and men respectively. The methodology was created by the Labour MP Yvette Cooper. We first covered Labour\u2019s reporting of the findings five years ago.\n\nThe latest estimate, produced following the autumn budget in 2017, is that since 2010, 86% of the \u00a394 billion net reduction in public spending (which the government has made through tax and benefit changes) comes from money that previously went to women.\n\nWomen are the main recipients of the benefits which have been affected\n\nThe main reason for this is that that women are the main recipients of the benefits which have seen the biggest reductions in government spending.\n\nFor instance, the Treasury picked out the child element of tax credits as a major area for savings, by limiting how many children can be claimed for\u2014in 2016 it estimated this would be worth \u00a31.6 billion in savings by 2020/21. Among in-work families, 86% of recipients of child tax credits were women in April 2018\u2014meaning more women will be affected by a loss of child tax credits than men.\n\nOn the flipside, some of the government\u2019s tax changes have seen individuals gain, rather than lose, income. The increase in the personal tax allowance is one of these. As roughly 60% of income taxpayers are men, more men will get a financial benefit from this policy than women.\n\nAs the House of Commons Library puts it, its calculations generally assume \u201cthat policies primarily impact on the gender of the person to whom the benefit is paid or tax imposed.\u201d\n\nThis is a limitation on the calculation, because it doesn\u2019t reflect how reductions in benefits might be felt across the whole household. For instance, child tax credit (in areas where Universal Credit has not replaced it) is paid to a nominated person within the household\u2014most often a woman. But many of these women live with a male partner, who would likely also be affected by that loss of income.\n\nWe don\u2019t know to what extent the women and men included in the House of Commons Library\u2019s calculations are pooling their incomes into a wider household budget.\n\nAnother issue is that, even if we know what proportion of recipients of a certain benefit are women, we don\u2019t always know what the average award is. If the male recipients of a certain benefit get, on average, a higher payment than female recipients, then this needs to be factored in, alongside the number of recipients of each gender.\n\nThe House of Commons Library says \u201cwhere possible, information on differences in the average awards paid to men and women is taken into account\u201d\u2014but it\u2019s not always possible for them to do so.\n\nThe government has questioned the selection of government policies included in Yvette Cooper\u2019s methodology. The calculations don\u2019t include spending changes that can\u2019t be linked to individuals (e.g. departmental spending and business tax rates). The government has also argued that it should not include reductions in benefit which affect higher-earning individuals, such as the removal of child tax credits for parents earning \u00a350,000-\u00a360,000.\n\nThis links to a broader government argument that the analysis does not recognise the benefits of spending reductions in creating \u201csound public finances\u201d and economic security (as made by then-Chancellor George Osborne back in 2015). But assessing the wider systemic impact of spending reductions is beyond the scope of this piece.\n\nFurther evidence supports the House of Commons Library\u2019s findings\n\nFocusing just on the direct financial impact of spending reductions, there is more evidence to suggest that women have been more negatively affected than men in terms of income.\n\nIn November last year, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) released a report on the \u201cimpact of tax and welfare reforms between 2010-17\u201d. It looks at the financial impact of government policies since 2010 on a specific set of areas, including income tax, benefits, tax credits, and Universal Credit. It doesn\u2019t exactly match with the House of Commons Library\u2019s method, but takes a broadly similar approach.\n\nThe EHRC report found that \u201cWomen lose more than men from reforms at every income level. Overall, women lose around \u00a3940 per year on average, more than double the losses of around \u00a3460 for men\u201d.\n\nThe EHRC also shows that the relative impact on men and women varies according to income level. By dividing the country into ten income \u201cdeciles\u201d (with 1 being the lowest 10% of earners, and 10 being the highest-earning 10%), the smallest difference in impact is among the lowest 10% of earners (an average loss of just over \u00a3800 per year for men and around \u00a31,000 for women).\n\nThe biggest gap is in decile 7 (a loss of around \u00a3220 for men, and around \u00a3740 for women). Men toward the top end in deciles 8 and 9 are typically no worse off, and men in decile 10 have gained an average of just under \u00a3200 a year. Women in deciles 8 and 9 are an average of \u00a3400 worse off, and typically \u00a3500 worse off in decile 10.\n\nThe report argues that \u201cthe result that women experience larger losses than men is mainly driven by the fact that women receive a much larger proportion of benefits and tax credits than men\u201d and that since 2010 \u201cthe largest negative impact on incomes is as a result of cuts to benefits\u201d.\n\nThis is also why disparities between men and women are highest in younger age groups. Among families receiving benefits relating to children, it is most often the mother who receives them. This means the findings are subject to the caveats we highlighted earlier, about how we don\u2019t know the \u201cindirect\u201d effect upon any male partners of women receiving child tax credits.\n\nThe report also picks out a number of other groups, beyond women, who are particularly affected by tax and benefit changes. Ethnic minority households, households containing someone with a disability, lone-parent families, and families with three or more children are all picked out as \u201csignificantly adversely impacted\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
