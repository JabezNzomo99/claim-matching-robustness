The photo of Saban appears to come from an Aflac commercial.\n\nThe image appears to show a screen grab of an April 16 tweet from Biden that thanks Saban, the head coach of the University of Alabama\u2019s football team, for endorsing the former vice president\u2019s campaign. Below the alleged tweet, a photo of Saban is accompanied by an alleged quote from the coach, his signature and a Biden campaign logo.\n\n\u201cSo thankful to have the endorsement of the greatest coach in college football!\u201d Biden supposedly tweeted. \u201cTogether with the people of Alabama we can start to rebuild this great country. Join us!\u201d (RELATED: \u2018His Brain? No. His Heart\u2019 \u2013 Is This A Real Joe Biden Campaign Ad?)\n\nThere is, however, no record of Biden tweeting the remark or the image in the Facebook post. A search of Biden\u2019s verified Twitter account turned up no matches. ProPublica\u2019s archive of his deleted tweets also doesn\u2019t show any similar tweets.\n\nThe photo of Saban appears to come from a 2019 Aflac commercial. Had Saban publicly endorsed Biden as the supposed quote suggests, it likely would have been picked up by major media outlets, yet none appear to have reported on it. Check Your Fact didn\u2019t find any credible media outlets attributing the quote to Saban.\n\nJosh Maxson, the assistant athletics director of football communications at the University of Alabama, confirmed to Check Your Fact in a phone interview that Saban did not endorse Biden. Saban appears to rarely publicly comment on politics, though he did appear in an ad endorsing Democratic West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin in 2018, according to NBC Sports.\n\nThe Biden campaign did not respond to a request for comment.", "lang": "en"}
