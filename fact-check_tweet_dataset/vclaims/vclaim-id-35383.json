(Click here)\n\nThe story flew around the Internet as the death toll from the virus climbed past 600 on Friday and amid growing speculation that China was not being open about the scale of casualties.\n\nHowever, we could not find a single reliable news website that corroborated AB-TC's claim. The claim appears to have originated on the website.\n\n\n\n\ufeffThe website AB-TC (City News) has no details on the site mentioning who is behind the website. The articles on the website do not have authors and are claimed to be written by 'Local Correspondents'.\n\n\n\nBOOM accessed whois details of the website and found that it is registered in Guangdong China and was set up just seven months ago in June 2019\n\nAlthough the site is registered in Guangdong, its content is in English and is US-centric aimed at readers in the United States.\n\nThe site also has other telltales signs of being a fake site with a stack of click-bait links.\n\nWe also ran a key word search (\"ab-tc.com\" AND \"hoax\" OR \"fake\" OR \"fact-check\") to see if the website was fact-checked earlier and found stories from US fact-checking website Snopes and Lead Stories.\n\nSnopes, which also debunked the same claim said, there was no mention of this supposed court case on the The Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China website.\n\nFact-checker Lead Stories has even detailed a list of its stories that feature ab-tc.com.\n\nThe first case of the virus was reported by China to the WHO in December, 2019. China claims that this virus emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan but the exact source of the virus has not yet been identified.The World Health Organization declared the 2019-nCoV as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020.\n\nBOOM has actively debunked misinformation ranging from various methods of prevention and treatment of the virus, unrelated images linked to the outbreak, misrepresented sources of the Coronavirus, to the Chinese prime minister and president being dragged into the circulation of fake news.", "lang": "en"}
