Vishvas News has earlier debunked this claim and found it to be fake.\n\nA post shared on Facebook by a page named \u2018Health Tips by Raghida\u2019 reads: \n\n\u201cDrinking Cold water after a meal = Cancer! Can u believe this? For those who like to drink cold water, this applies to you. It\u2019s nice to have a cold drink after a meal, however, the cold water will solidify the oily stuff that you\u2019ve just consumed, which slows digestion. Once this \u2018sludge\u2019 reacts with the acid, it will break down and be absorbed by the intestine faster than the solid food. It will line the intestine. Very soon, this will turn into fats and lead to cancer.. It is best to drink hot soup or warm water after a meal.\u201d The archived version of the post can be read here.\n\nWe started its investigation by visiting the official website of National Cancer Institute. We did not find any report citing any connection between the drinking of cold water and cancer. If the information was true, it would have been well documented in medical establishments.\n\nAs per US National Institute of Health, chilled liquids do not solidify ingested fats when the two meet in the stomach. The cold water you consume after food will eventually turn to the body\u2019s internal temperature.\n\nThe complete fact check can be read here.\n\nWe also spoke to Dr. Manish Singhal who is an oncologist with Indraprastha Apollo Hospital. He said: There is no link between cold water and cancer. The cold water you consume after food will eventually turn to body\u2019s internal temperature very similarly what should happen to it if you keep a cold or warm glass of water outside in ambient temperature. The stomach muscles mix the food and liquid with digestive juices. The stomach slowly empties its contents to small intestine.\n\nThe post has been shared on Facebook by a page named Health Tips By Raghida.

The viral claim is false.", "lang": "en"}
