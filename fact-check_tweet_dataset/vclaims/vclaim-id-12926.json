But that\u2019s not the case. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, briefing reporters in support of a House proposal on March 7, even noted: \u201cFor most Americans, they receive their health coverage through their employer. It\u2019s about 175 million folks. Those individuals will see no significant change other than there won\u2019t be a penalty for not purchasing coverage.\u201d (Note: the Congressional Budget Office says the figure is 155 million.)\n\nA 2016 Commonwealth Fund study found that for people with low and moderate incomes, the ACA\u2019s tax credits have made premium costs roughly comparable to those paid by people with employment-based health insurance. About half of the adults in the marketplace said their premiums were affordable \u2014 and 4 in 5 people who joined the marketplace or Medicaid after the law was implemented said they were satisfied with their health insurance. (About half of the adults said that before they signed up, they had been without health insurance for more than two years.)\n\nIn some states, the ratio is even smaller. The impressive nine pages of backup material for the Ohio ad say that there were nearly 250,000 enrollees in the ACA, many of whom qualified for subsidies. Compare that number to 6 million Ohioans on employer-provided plans, 2.4 million on Medicaid and 1.7 million on Medicare, according to estimates by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Combined with an expansion of the Medicaid program contained in the Affordable Care Act, the number of people in Ohio who lacked health insurance dropped from 1.4 million in 2013 to 681,000 in 2015.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly correct that the ACA market has been under pressure because the mix of people signing up for health care under plans offered on the exchanges has been unhealthier than expected. The feared individual mandate \u2014 which Republicans say they will eliminate \u2014 did not have the expected result of persuading people to buy insurance. Younger and healthier Americans apparently were more willing to pay a $695-per-person fine than sign up for health care they think is too costly. So the people in the insurance pools have tended to be those who have chronic illnesses and thus require more care and frequent doctor or hospital visits. The makeup of the risk pools is also why insurance companies have sought higher premiums and the biggest deductibles.\n\nBut, at the same time, health costs for employer-provided plans have grown much slower than expected since the ACA was implemented. The average family premium is now almost $3,600 lower than if premium growth had kept pace with the rate in the decade before the law was passed, while all out-of-pocket costs would have been nearly $5,000 higher if they had continued on the previous inflationary path. However, there is little consensus among health-care experts about whether the ACA can be credited with the slower rise in health-care costs.\n\nAs we noted in the fact check, almost a third of those tax hikes were aimed at couples making more than $250,000 and individuals making more than $200,000. The Joint Committee on Taxation identified only about $130 billion in taxes with direct impact on the middle class, and $247 billion more in taxes with possible indirect effects. Most calculations show that middle-income Americans were expected to get more in tax relief, such as health-care subsidies, than in additional taxes. Indeed, the tax increases mostly were used to pay for the tax credits, which were estimated to total $1 trillion in the 10-year period.\n\nThese ads conflate \u201cObamacare\u201d with the entire health-care system. The ACA was intended to provide additional options in the individual market for people who could not afford health insurance. Most people on the exchanges get tax credits that mitigate the cost of premiums, which has resulted in a substantial decrease in the number of Americans without health insurance. In the meantime, people who have employer-provided plans saw little or no change, except that the law may have added benefits, eliminated lifetime caps on coverage, and barred the denial of insurance for preexisting conditions.\n\nThe \u201cmess\u201d extends to people in the individual market who do not qualify for tax credits \u2014 and their premiums have increased because of mandates in the law, a sicker-than-expected pool of applicants and decreasing competition because insurance companies have found it too difficult to make money. Whether Republicans will find a solution to this problem \u2014 without creating more havoc \u2014 is open to question. But the ads need to make clear, as Price did, that the turmoil on the exchanges has not affected most Americans.", "lang": "en"}
