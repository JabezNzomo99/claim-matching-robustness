We then put those keyframes through Reverse Image Search and found the same video on YouTube from 2017.\n\nAfter extensively searching through YouTube using keywords like \u2018flag\u2019, \u2018largest\u2019, \u2018India\u2019, we came across a video from 2016, similar to the viral video but from a different angle.\n\n\u201cCM KCR Hoists Largest Indian Biggest Flag in Hyderabad\u201d the video was titled.\n\nUpon carefully analysing both the videos, we noticed some similarities like the red carpet and the plants. We also noticed that the background music (band playing Jai Ho) is the same in both the videos. Music at time code 0:03 sec in the viral video, where the flag is being unfurled is same as music at time code 1:26 min of the above video. Moreover, the video action at these time codes is also the same.\n\nTaking a cue from the above information, we ran a search and found several media reports from 2016 on the same. The reports can be seen here and here.\n\nAccording to the reports, the 291 feet high flag flies high along the banks of Hussain Sagar Lake in Sanjeevaiah Park and was unfurled on June 2, 2016, by Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao.\n\nUpon searching further, we found that in March 2017, a 360-foot-tall tricolour flag was hoised at Attari-Wagah border.\n\nHence, from the above information, it is clear that the post in question is misleading.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
