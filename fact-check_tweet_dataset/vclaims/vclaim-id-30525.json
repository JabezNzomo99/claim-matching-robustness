This would be for reasons such as race, religion, nationality or political opinion.\n\nSkarstein told Africa Check that in making the claim, the council used the number of people listed as refugees by the\n\n, the UN arm responsible for registering and helping refugees.\n\nFurther, the council only considered refugees from South Sudan hosted in Uganda because those were the figures available to them, Skarstein said.\n\n\u201cThe other figures were less up to date or not for the same period. However, adding other refugees in Uganda would of course only strengthen the argument,\u201d Skarstein added.\n\nBetween 30 August and 5 December 2016 the average number of South Sudanese refugees registered in Uganda \u201cwas well above 3,000 a day\u201d, Skarstein said.\n\nThis figure was then compared to that of refugees received in various European countries throughout 2016, specifically \u201cNorway, Iceland and Ireland\u201d.\n\nWhat led to the refugee crisis?\n\nof people to flee their country.\n\nIn October 2016, 1.28 million people had been displaced, compared to 115,000 in 2013,\n\nat the UNHCR. She drew Africa Check\u2019s attention to the sharp increase in displaced persons from South Sudan in 2016 following renewed hostilities mid-year.\n\nshows that 602,212 people from South Sudan were either registered or awaiting listing as a refugee in Uganda as at 5 December 2016. More than half of them (309,896) arrived or applied after 30 August.\n\nThis would mean that in those 98 days, an average of 3,162 South Sudanese daily sought safety in Uganda, close to Skarstein\u2019s ballpark figure of \u201cwell above 3,000\u201d.\n\nBut how does this compare with the number of refugees hosted in Europe in 2016?\n\n, Malte Brosig, told Africa Check that the distribution of refugees across Europe is \u201cvery uneven\u201d.\n\nhigh volumes of asylum applications throughout 2016, compared to others such Denmark, Poland and Estonia.\n\nTo get refugee figures for Europe, Nahmias directed Africa Check to the European Union\u2019s statistical office,\n\n. That is because in Europe, \u201crefugees are usually registered by governments and not by UNHCR\u201d, she said.\n\nEurostat collects information from 32 European states on several issues, including migration.\n\nIts data shows that at least 6 countries - Luxembourg, Croatia, Slovenia, Latvia, Estonia and Slovakia - received fewer than 3,162 applications in total in 2016.\n\nTwelve Eurostat members are yet to report full-year figures, of which 3 countries already had far more than 3,162 applications at last report: France (75,945), Greece (44,390) and Austria (39,495). The other nine had registered\n\nLooking at the countries that the\n\n3,485 asylum applications in 2016, while Ireland\u2019s count was 1,990 between January and November 2016.\n\n1,000 people over the same period.\n\nBrosig told Africa Check that a number of factors, such as location, need to be considered when analysing migration. Countries that neighbour conflict areas - such as Uganda - could expect a higher influx of refugees compared to those further out.\n\n\u201cGetting to Iceland is a major undertaking. I\u2019d assume refugees would need to pay large sums for such a trip,\u201d Borsig said.\n\nHe added that most refugees affected by war \u201cremain close to their home assuming they want to return once the war is over, stay in contact with relatives or simply don\u2019t have the means to move on\u201d.\n\nConclusion: Number of European countries had fewer annual asylum applications in 2016 than those lodged in Uganda daily\n\nUN data showed that, on average, 3,162 South Sudan refugees were listed or awaiting registration in Uganda per day between 30 August and 5 December 2016. Refugee figures for other nationalities, such as those fleeing Burundi and the DRC, are not yet available. This will of course push up Uganda\u2019s average daily intake.\n\nOf the European countries for which full-year data for 2016 is available, six had registered fewer than 3,162 refugees. At last count, 9 of the countries for which full-year figures are not yet available had fewer than 3,162 asylum applications in 2016.\n\nUnless all of these countries had experienced a big spike in end of year applications, the claim is correct that more refugees sought safety in Uganda per day at the end of 2016 than many wealthy European countries received that entire year.\n\nAt least 6 European countries registered fewer refugees, with possibly 9 more.South Sudanese refugees arrive at a permanent refugee settlement in the Adjumani district in Uganda in June 2016.
