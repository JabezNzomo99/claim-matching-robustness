RSS swayamsevaks providing relief after Cyclone Fani strikes eastern coastal regions),\u201d is the caption he used to share the images.\n\nThe image on top was traced back to 2017 using Google reverse-image search. The website of Vishwa Samvad Kendra, Tamilnadu had described the image as RSS workers providing aid during the 2017 Cyclone Ockhi in Kanyakumari.\n\nThe image on the bottom was traced back to 2014 using reverse-image search on Yandex. Vishwa Samvad Kendra\u2019s pan-India website carried the photograph in an October 2014 article, according to which it pertains to RSS relief work in Vishakhapatnam during Cyclone Hudhud.\n\nA set of three images have been shared by several individuals and pages, including the Twitter handle of Vishwa Samvad Kendra, Assam. A user who described himself as an RSS pracharak also shared the photographs.\n\nReverse-searching individual images led Alt News to a 2018 tweet that carried all the three photographs. According to the tweet, the images depict RSS relief work during the 2018 Cyclone Titli.\n\nWe found identical images on websites tnews.co.thand organiser.org.Both websites claimed that the images were shot during devastation in Andhra Pradesh last year.\n\nThe photographs fact-checked in this article are also circulating on WhatsApp.\n\nHowever, none of them depicts RSS providing aid during Cyclone Fani in Odisha.\n\nOld images of RSS relief work are often circulated on social media as a recent event. A similar pattern was observed last year during Kerala floods.", "lang": "en"}
