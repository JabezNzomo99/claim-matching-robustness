The first is that Forbes declared her the most beautiful woman out of all the Indian royal families. The second is about her making the decision to leave behind her royal life to become a Jain Sadhvi. A few photos of Maharani Radhika Raje along with a video of a woman are being circulated along with these claims. In the video, a woman wearing a white-coloured sari and gold ornaments. Her hair is being shaved off in what looks like a religious ceremony. Facebook user Anil Chetan claimed in an August 12 post that the clip featured none other than Raje. By the time this article was written, his post had been shared 1,600 times and the video had been viewed more than 2 lakh times.

A man named Udayam Ajanna had shared this via a Facebook Live stream. By the time this article was written, it had been viewed more than 5,700 times. (link to the archived post)\n\nA video story by India Today from August 17 claimed that Forbes magazine had dubbed Maharani Radhika Raje Gaekwad the most beautiful woman in the Indian royal families. The website of News Today Chhattisgarh had also shared the news of the Maharani becoming a Jain Sadhvi.\n\nThis information is being shared widely across Twitter and Facebook.\n\nAlt News will put before you the reality of the two claims about Baroda\u2019s Maharani Radhika Raje on social media.\n\n1. Forbes has not declared the Maharani the most beautiful woman of the Indian royal family\n\nThe claim of Forbes magazine declaring Maharani Radhika Raje Gaekwad as the most beautiful woman in Indian royalty is completely false. Radhika Raje had also rejected this claim through an Instagram post.\n\nThe Indian edition of MillionaireAsia Magazine had put the Maharani on their cover in December 2019 alongside a feature story about her. The publication had given Radhika Raje the nickname of \u2018The Modern Day Maharani\u2019. No information about her was found on the Forbes website.\n\n2. Maharani Radhika Raje has not become a Jain Sadhvi\n\nAfter doing some digging on Maharani Radhika Raje\u2019s Instagram, we discovered a post dated August 19. This post contained an official statement on this matter issued by the Lakshmi Vilas Palace. The statement makes it clear that the claims suggesting Radhika Raje is leaving her property to become a Jain Sadhvi are completely false.\n\nWoman seen in the viral video is not Maharani Radhika Raje\n\nAfter doing a keyword search on YouTube, we discovered the viral video. It had been uploaded on June 16, 2018. According to the channel, the video shows a ritual that is carried out before the Jain \u2018Deeksha\u2019 ceremony. We did not get any additional details about the woman appearing in the video. Furthermore, the face of the woman featured here does not resemble Maharani Radhika Raje\u2019s features.\n\nApart from this, the pictures being shared with these false claims have been taken from her Instagram account.\n\nUltimately, the claims being made about Maharani Radhika Raje of Baroda are nothing but a hoax. Neither has she decided to become a Jain Sadhvi nor has Forbes magazine declared her the most beautiful woman among the Indian royal families. The video being shared on social media with these claims is actually two years old.", "lang": "en"}
