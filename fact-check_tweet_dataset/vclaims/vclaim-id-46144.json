No, that's not true: A viral video suggests that video of protests was related to the fifth-generation wireless technology, but it was recycled footage from the Hong Kong anti-government protests in 2019.\n\nThe claim appeared in a post published on YouTube by Truth Isonn on April 4, 2020, titled \"China Riot - 5G protest\" (archived here).\n\nClick below to watch the video on YouTube:\n\nA keyframe reverse image search has revealed that the post is a mishmash of file footage from the anti-government protests that rocked Hong Kong for several months in 2019 and into early 2020.\n\nThis video was not of a 5G protest in Hong Kong. Indeed, at one point in the video, the footage is labeled November 11, 2019, when the demonstrations were still underway.\n\nImages from the video link back to Reuters footage featured in this article (note the umbrellas at 1:25 in the video are seen in this Hong Kong protest footage):\n\nThe anti-government unrest began in June 2019 after millions of people came out to protest a bill that would have allowed extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China.\n\nThe bill was shelved, but the protests grew into a larger pro-democracy movement, which posed a serious challenge to Beijing.\n\nAccording to a wireless blog, three mobile operators have launched 5G services in Hong Kong. As Lead Stories has previously reported, concern over the safety of 5G wireless technology is a new Internet favorite among conspiracy theorists.\n\nA keyframe from the video post showed a list of \"flu-like symptoms\" that it suggested 5G exposure could cause. However, an article in the U.K. edition of Wired magazine on June 12, 2019, noted that concerns about the dangers of 5G are unfounded:\n\nDespite this, there is no solid evidence that 5G - or any mobile communications network - can have a harmful effect on human health. The upgrade is based on similar technology to preceding mobile networks, and so far no study has found a link between mobile phones and cancer, although research into the area is ongoing.\n\nEven so, Internet rumors about the risks of 5G technology persist. They join a growing list of conspiracy theories that are being shared to scaremonger the public.
