The photos have been shared in a misleading context; they actually show vegetables being donated at an event in southern Sri Lanka in August 2019, more than eight months before the curfew was implemented.\n\nThe images were published on Facebook here on March 27, 2020.\n\nThe post\u2019s Sinhala-language caption translates as: \u201cWhile people in other \u2018developed\u2019 countries suffer with empty shelves this is in our country. Tissamaharama vegetable dansala.\u201d\n\nThe post makes reference to Tissamaharama, a small town in southern Sri Lanka, and a dansala, which are donation events organised during Buddhist lunar holidays known as Poya days.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nOn March 20, 2020, Sri Lanka announced that regional curfews imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus would be enacted nationwide. The since-extended curfew caused shortages of essential goods and produce.\n\nA similar claim was made about the same photos on Facebook here, here, here and here, and on Twitter here.\n\nA reverse image search found the photos were in fact published on Facebook here on August 14, 2019, months before the COVID-19 pandemic erupted.\n\nAccording to the post, the photos show a dansala that was organized at a local temple called Kande Viharaya in Tissamaharama.\n\nThe post's full Sinhala-language caption translates to English as: \u201cA unique dansala\u2026 The vegetable dansala held at the Tissamaharama Kande Viharaya..\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Facebook post:\n\nBelow are screenshot comparisons of some of the images from the misleading posts (L) and the 2019 Facebook post (R):\n\nKande Viharaya\u2019s chief priest said the photos were taken during the 2019 Nikini poya, which is observed during the August full moon.\n\n\u201cThis dansala was held last year during the Nikini poya. It was covered in various television stations as well,\u201d the priest told AFP by phone on March 29, 2020.\n\nA Tissamaharama correspondent for Sri Lankan television network Hiru TV, Amila Sampath, also said the images were from the danasala in August 2019.\n\n\u201cI covered this danasala held at the Kande Vihara temple last year on August 14 and I can confirm these images are being re-circulated on social media in an inaccurate context,\u201d Sampath told AFP by phone on March 29, 2020.\n\n\u201cA businessman from Colombo transported the vegetables seen in the images from Bandarawela for the dansala,\u201d he added.\n\nThe vegetable donation event was also featured here on Sri Lankan TV news channel Derana on August 14, 2019. It can be seen from the 30-minute nine-second mark to the 30-minute 22-second mark.", "lang": "en"}
