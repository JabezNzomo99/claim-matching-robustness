{"title": "Does 61% of the country now back Remain?", "subtitle": "Polls suggesting 61% of people would back remain in a second referendum are probably overstating the lead.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-24167", "url": "https://fullfact.org/europe/do-61-percent-back-remain/", "vclaim": "Does 61% of the country now back Remain?\n\nIt\u2019s misleading to suggest that 61% of the British public would back remaining in the EU if another referendum were held, because it\u2019s based on a poll which assumes the only other option in a referendum would be the government\u2019s draft Brexit withdrawal deal.\n\nOpinion polls about Brexit often give conflicting messages about the public\u2019s preferred way forward, because so much depends on what options people are given to choose between and how the questions are worded. We\u2019ve previously covered claims that no deal is the public\u2019s favoured option, which were based on a similar limited choice.\n\nPolls do generally suggest that more people currently back remain than leave, but a 61%-39% margin is probably overstating the lead.\n\nWhat did the poll say?\n\nThe report is based on a survey conducted by YouGov for a firm called KIS Finance.\n\nAs KIS say, the 61% figure is the number who would vote to remain \u201cif given the choice now of remaining in the EU or leaving on the terms set out in Theresa May\u2019s deal\u201d. 39% would support the prime minister\u2019s deal under that binary choice.\n\nThat figure only includes those who said they would vote, and excludes those who answered \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d or refused to answer. If you include them, the figures are 45% for remain, 29% for the government\u2019s deal, 13% say they would not vote, and 13% don\u2019t know or didn\u2019t answer.\n\nIf another option, of no deal, is added to options presented, then the numbers change to 44% for remain, 28% for no deal, and 10% for Theresa May\u2019s deal (while 7% would not vote and 11% did not know or didn\u2019t answer).\n\nThe 61% figure is the same as that in a similar poll, also run by YouGov, which was published in mid-March, which also limited the choices to remain or Theresa May\u2019s deal, excluded don\u2019t knows, and was weighted by likelihood of voting.\n\nIn all polling (and particularly current polling around Brexit) the responses people give can change significantly depending on what options are presented and how questions are worded.\n\nThe problem here is that the headline says \u201c61% would back Remain in a second referendum\u201d, which assumes that any second referendum would be between remain and the government\u2019s current withdrawal deal. But if there is a second referendum, there is no guarantee that these would be the options put to the country. As we wrote when checking a similar-but-opposite claim that no deal was the country\u2019s preferred option, \u201cthe question poses a hypothetical situation which isn\u2019t the one Britain finds itself in\u201d.\n\nIn this case, pitting remain against the current deal (which is generally not popular with most of the public) may help to boost its figures somewhat, as is also the case when you pit no deal against the prime minister\u2019s deal.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with asking questions like this to explore issues, but it\u2019s important to understand the context of what the question was. The New European article does give more details of what the poll asked; however the headline figure has since been repeated on social media without those caveats.\n\nIn general, when polls present a wider range of options (such as this series of polls from Opinium that offer five possible ways forward), the public is more split and no option comes close to having a majority. In polls that ask the simpler question of whether people would back remain or leave were they given that choice again, remain has consistently been the more popular option for some time, but with a smaller lead over leave than the 61%-39% split suggested here.", "lang": "en"}
