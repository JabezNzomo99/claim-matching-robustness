No, that's not true: a website that was registered just three weeks ago launched a rumor saying the actor was dead but the article is mostly just copy pasted from his biography on Wikipedia and does not make any mention of what he supposedly died of or where. No other actual news sources are confirming the news so it is definitely false.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Your Daily News on September 9, 2018 titled \"Danny Trejo The Famous Native American Actor Dies at age 74\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so they might have confused it with real news:\n\nBut the site that launched the rumor, yourdailynewsfix.online, was only registered about three weeks ago:\n\nNo mention is made of the news on Trejo's Twitter account, official website or official Facebook page and no other news outlets are reporting on it.", "lang": "en"}
