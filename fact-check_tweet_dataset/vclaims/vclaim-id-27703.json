Discussions about guns in America tend to be politically fraught, and so too is the terminology surrounding them.\n\nA frequent misconception about AR-15 firearms, for instance, is that the \u201cAR\u201d in the name stands for \u201cassault rifle.\u201d It does not. AR stands for ArmaLite Rifle, reflecting the company name (ArmaLite) of the original manufacturer of the weapon. Although ArmaLite sold the design of the rifle to Colt in 1959, the term \u201cAR-15\u201d has persisted and acts as a catch-all for similar guns, even though various models with different manufacturers have different names.\n\nArmaLite developed the weapon in the 1950s with the original intention that it would be used by the military but didn\u2019t have much success selling it before handing it off to Colt. As NPR reports, Colt had widespread success selling the automatic M-16 to the military, which troops used in Vietnam. Colt produced a semi-automatic, civilian version of that weapon and marketed it as the \u201cAR-15.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Colt\u2019s patents for the AR-15 expired in the 1970s, other manufacturers began making similar models,\u201d NPR reported. \u201cThose gun makers gave the weapons their own names, yet the popularity of the AR-15 turned it into a generic term for all types of AR-15-style rifles.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
