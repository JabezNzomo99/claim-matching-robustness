In the book, the fictional disease was developed at \u201clabs outside the city of Wuhan\u201d. The real outbreak of Covid-19 is believed to have originated in the city.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written about before, there\u2019s no evidence that Covid-19 was artificially created, or originated from a lab.\n\nOther characteristics of \u201cWuhan-400\u201d don\u2019t match Covid-19. The book says that \u201cOnce infected, no one lives more than twenty-four hours\u201d and that its \u201ckill-rate is one hundred percent\u201d, something that is not true of Covid-19, which has a fatality rate of around 2%.\n\nThe book also says that it \u201cafflicts only human beings\u201d and that \u201cno other living creature can carry it\u201d, while Covid-19 is believed to have crossed over into humans from bats, possibly via a third animal. And Covid-19 is a respiratory disease, while the book\u2019s disease affects the brain stem, where it \u201cbegins secreting a toxin that literally eats away brain tissue like battery acid dissolving cheesecloth.\u201d\n\nThe other book the Daily Star mentions is called \u201cEnd of Days: Predictions and prophecies about the end of the world\u201d co-written by \u201cpsychic and spiritual teacher\u201d Sylvia Browne, and published in 2008.\n\nIt claims: \u201cIn around 2020 a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and the bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, while there is not yet a vaccine for the Covid-19 coronavirus, the human immune system does fight the disease. As noted, most victims survive. Trials of vaccines and other potential treatments are currently underway.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that this prediction was made just a few years after the (closely related) SARS outbreak, and that it comes amidst some of the book\u2019s other health predictions\u2014which include claiming a cure for \u201cparalysis and Parkinson\u2019s disease [will be found] no later than 2012\u201d, and the assertion that \u201cblindness will become a thing of the past by 2020\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
