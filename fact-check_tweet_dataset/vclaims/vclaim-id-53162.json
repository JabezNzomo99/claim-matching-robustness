Then, after clicking on the embedded video to watch it, only the first few seconds would play before prompting users to share the story first to continue watching.\n\nThe article was first shared on Facebook around Saturday, June 27, according to Facebook's Claim Check dashboard. One post, for instance, has been shared over 1,000 times since Sunday, June 28.\n\nThe dashboard also shows that articles with similar headlines were posted by websites w0rldwid3arr0w.xyz and livenow.tv-networks-channel.com at around the same time, but are now unavailable as of posting time.\n\nThe embedded video in the claim is from a July 15, 2015 TV Patrol news report about a different carjacking incident that was caught by security cameras in Santa Mesa, Manila.\n\nThe 18-second video for the claim used only the first 13 seconds of the TV Patrol report, then cut away to just the actor's picture for the remainder.\n\nUpon further inspection, the video was uploaded last Friday, June 26, by a YouTube channel named Tumbling News Buns. The channel has only 5 clips, 3 of which (including the one about Piolo Pascual) are similar short clips of actual news reports taken out of context.\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
