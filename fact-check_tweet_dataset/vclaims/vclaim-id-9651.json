Nope, that's not true, it is made up and entirely false.\n\nWe spotted the claim on a Facebook page named \"Breaking-News-BN\", we've embedded the post below:\n\nIt was published published on March 22, 2018 with the caption \"Facebook has done it again type on.com and see who's checking your account...
