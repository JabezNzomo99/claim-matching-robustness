As per the Facebook post, the man sold everything and came to India where he underwent another X-ray.\n\nHowever, doctors in India told him that there was nothing in his chest; the cockroach was present in the X-ray machine in Zimbabwe, according to the bizarre claim.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be false. This is a fictitious story doing the rounds on social media for quite some years.\n\nThe viral image is photoshopped. The original picture is the X-ray image of famous yesteryear Hollywood actress Marilyn Monroe's chest.\n\nIn 2017, Facebook page \"Let's enjoy Zimbabwe\" posted this same image with a similar narrative. This was also shared by many users on Facebook in 2018.\n\nUsing reverse image search, we found the original image, which is an X-ray of Marilyn Monroe's chest. In 1954, she was admitted to Cedars of Lebanon Hospital for surgery for endometriosis, a gynecological condition.\n\nIn 2010, a set of three X-ray images from this hospital visit were auctioned for $45,000. This was reported widely by mainstream media and can be read here.\n\nComparing the viral image with the original X-ray image, it is confirmed that the former is photoshopped. Signs of manipulation are clearly visible in the viral image.\n\nThe viral post is fictitious. There are several versions of a similar narrative found along with the same viral image. The viral image is photoshopped and purportedly accompanied by this healthcare-related funny story.", "lang": "en"}
