Carly Fiorina had inaccurately claimed twice during the GOP debate on CNN that 307,000 veterans had died waiting for health care. This figure is significantly higher than previous estimates that \u201cdozens\u201d of veterans had died waiting for health care in an Arizona VA facility.\n\nThis is a widely misreported statistic that first began circulating after a Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Office of Inspector General report released Sept. 2, 2015, and subsequent news coverage. Concerned Veterans for America, a conservative veterans advocacy group, cited an article quoting this figure in a political ad released this month. But the difference is that the group\u2019s ad quotes a headline that says 307,000 \u201cmay\u201d have died waiting for care, versus Trump\u2019s statement (and Fiorina\u2019s references, for that matter) that states the figure as a direct fact.\n\nThe VA\u2019s inspector general investigated allegations of mismanagement in processing health-care applications at the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s Health Eligibility Center, after whistleblowers told the House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs that there was an application backlog. The center is the VA\u2019s \u201ccentral authority for eligibility and enrollment processing activities,\u201d and maintains about 22.3 million records in its system.\n\nInvestigators found there were about 867,000 records in a \u201cpending\u201d status, meaning the veteran applied for enrollment but the VA needed additional information (often financial) before approving the veteran for benefits. Of those records, 307,173 were for people who were reported as deceased by the Social Security Administration.\n\nThe problem is that this database includes records of veterans who died before the health-care enrollment process began in 1998. There also are records of veterans who never sought care from the VA, because millions of records from another VA data source were entered into the system in December 2013.\n\nThe application dates do not show in the system, so there\u2019s no way to tell which records are associated with veterans who were applying for health-care benefits.\n\nWhile the center is the hub for all eligibility and enrollment processing, the database includes non-health-care data. For example, the system keeps records of disability benefits, home loans, veterans\u2019 family members who qualify to receive health care, employees participating in the employee health program, patients receiving humanitarian care and patients whose military service was not confirmed. The VA\u2019s OIG officials could not identify what proportion of the 22.3 million records in the system were not related to health-care enrollment.\n\nThere were about 307,000 records of veterans who were marked as \u201cpending\u201d in the health-care database, who had already died, according to their Social Security records. But given all the limitations in the database, it\u2019s impossible to know whether those veterans had died before or after the VA began its health-care enrollment system, or whether they had applied for health care.\n\nIt is possible that all 307,173 veterans applied for health care. But that\u2019s an absolute worst-case scenario, and the OIG said it could not confirm how many veterans with \u201cpending\u201d statuses had applied for health care.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to throw out jarring figures in relation to access-to-care problems at the VA. But this one is not accurate. When Fiorina used it, we gave her the benefit of doubt because there were so many misconstrued reports in media coverage that could have led her to believe this was a legitimate figure. But when a candidate publishes a white paper or policy proposal, it\u2019s incumbent on them to check the facts. We\u2019re bumping this rating to a Three.", "lang": "en"}
