We've examined the education and tax-cutting claims before, so here we'll examine whether the ad is right when it says Time magazine called him \"one of America's best governors.\"\n\nIndeed, in November 2005, Time featured him in a story headlined \"America's 5 Best Governors.\" (The others were Kenny Guinn of Nevada, Janet Napolitano of Arizona, Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas and Mark Warner of Virginia.)\n\nThe article said Huckabee \"approached his state's troubles with energy and innovation\" and cited his accomplishments with children's health care and economic growth. It called him \"a mature, consensus-building conservative who earns praise from fellow Evangelicals and, occasionally, liberal Democrats.\"\n\nTime isn't the only publication to honor him that month. Governing magazine (which is owned by the same parent company as PolitiFact) named him one of its \"Public Officials of the Year.\"", "lang": "en"}
