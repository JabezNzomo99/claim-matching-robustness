But the photo of Hitler has been doctored to add the book; in the original, his raised hand is empty.\n\n\u201cSome was wondering why would Trump go to a nearby church to hold up a Bible in front of a church? The answer is he was mimicking and imitating Hitler!\u201d said a June 2020 Facebook post with the two images, which is no longer available.\n\nOn June 1, law enforcement forcibly cleared peaceful protesters who were demonstrating near the historic St John\u2019s Episcopal Church -- which was defaced with graffiti and damaged in a fire during a demonstration on May 31 -- so Trump could walk over from the White House for photographs in which he held a Bible.\n\nThe US president adopted a martial tone in a nationwide address just before the church visit, threatening a military crackdown to quell \u201crioting, looting, vandalism\u201d amid protests following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.\n\nThe image of Hitler in the social media posts has been digitally altered. The original -- which AFP found using a reverse image search and which was taken by the dictator\u2019s photographer Heinrich Hoffmann in the 1930s -- shows his right hand is empty.\n\nA Twitter user claimed to be the one who altered the image, but this could not be independently confirmed by AFP.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was a Friend posted a challenge to make a meme of Trump holding the bible. So I made the meme on my $60 phone with no Photoshop apps. Just cut and paste. I posted it as a meme. It took off from there,\u201d @iDGRic tweeted.\n\nFloyd\u2019s final moments -- in which he pleaded for his life and said he could not breathe as a white police officer knelt on his neck -- were captured on video.", "lang": "en"}
