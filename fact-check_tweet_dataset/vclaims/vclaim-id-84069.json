They change the content surreptitiously hoping that no one notices. Yesterday, Financial Express published an article authored by Manika Gupta and titled \u201cIs Kamal Haasan anti-Hindu, does he even know what he is talking about?\u201d. The article was in reference to Kamal Haasan\u2019s recent comments on Draupadi and Mahabharata and the complaints filed against him by certain groups who were angered by his comment.\n\nIn an interview on March 12 to a private channel, Kamal Haasan had said:\n\nIn Mahabharata, Panchali was used a pawn while the men gambled. She was used as a collateral. And India is a country that respects and honours a book that revolves around men using a woman to gamble away as if she was a mere object.\n\nFollowing this comment, a police complaint has been lodged with the Chennai police by a group known as Hindu Munani Katchi and later a PIL was filed by a member of the same group in Chennai High Court.\n\nOn this issue, Manika Gupta of Financial Express wrote an article attacking Kamal Haasan for his comments. The article was so hilariously blunderous that I took a backup of the article using the archive.is service in case Financial Express realises the blunder and changes the article later. The website \u201carchive.is\u201d can take a snapshot of any web page and this snapshot will always be alive even if the original web page disappears or changes. Not surprisingly, this morning, Financial Express had quietly changed the content of the article.\n\nThe original article backed up on archive.is can be accessed here =>http://archive.is/zergT\n\nThe article in its present state can be accessed here =>http://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/is-kamal-haasan-anti-hindu-does-he-even-know-what-he-is-talking-about/603025/\n\nIn para 3 of the original version of the article, the author suggested that while living in a Hindu majority country, Kamal Haasan had no business commenting on a Hindu mythological figure and that it was a misuse of his freedom of speech.\n\nThe comment is unwarranted. Clearly, he is misusing his freedom of speech. As he lives in a Hindu-majority country he has no business to comment on a mythological figure that Hindus have respect for. Kamal Hasan has forgotten the context and the times in which Draupadi lived.\n\nClearly, the author has no clue about a book called the \u2018Constitution\u2019 which still gives equal rights to all citizens irrespective of religion and article 19 guarantees the freedom of speech and expression. The changed version of the article has the following content instead.\n\nThe comment is unwarranted as it relates to a mythological figure that many Hindus have respect for. Kamal Hasan has forgotten the context and the times in which Draupadi lived.\n\nPara 4 of the original version of the article was even more shocking.\n\nHe is not only inciting enmity between the two groups but also forgetting that his own religion has instances of worst condition of women. He should focus on triple talaq and issues like that rather than bothering about one-off reference in the Mahabharata. Only if he could mind his own business!\n\nNo equivalent of this para exists in the revised version of the article. In the original version of the article, the author assumed that Kamal Haasan is Muslim, probably because of his name. She went on to attack him for the condition of women in \u2018his\u2019 religion and asked him to \u2018mind\u2019 his \u2018own\u2019 business. As it happens, Kamal Haasan was born in a Tamil Brahmin family in the town of Paramakudi, in the Ramanathapuram district of Tamil Nadu, to D. Srinivasan and Rajalakshmi. Clearly, the author doesn\u2019t believe in researching the topic she writes about. Otherwise, it is difficult to come up with an article which is such a ginormous pile of rubbish. Also, a single Google search would have been enough to know that Kamal Haasan has publicly proclaimed himself to be an atheist on multiple occasions.\n\nIn Para 5 of the original version of the article, the author actively wishes for action against Kamal Haasan. She writes:\n\nLet\u2019s hope the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed against Haasan in the Tirunelveli district court by Hindu Makkal Katchi (HMK) for hurting the sentiments of Hindus is heard and verdict granted against Kamal Haasan.\n\nThe revised version of this para in the article currently available on Financial Express website is as follows:\n\nA Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed against Haasan in the Tirunelveli district court by Hindu Makkal Katchi (HMK) for hurting the sentiments of Hindus.\n\nIt seems that the author Manika Gupta was as hurt by Kamal Haasan\u2019s comments as were the members of Hindu Munani Katchi and that is alright. What is questionable is her personal emotions manifesting into her journalism. What is shocking is Financial Express letting such views come out in public domain without any editorial intervention wherein an author is actively hoping that action be taken against Kamal Haasan and these views are pushed to lakhs of readers via their platform.", "lang": "en"}
