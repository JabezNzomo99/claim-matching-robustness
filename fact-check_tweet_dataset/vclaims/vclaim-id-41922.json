Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of the claim.\n\n\n\nClaim: Letter from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) exepmting all Advocates in India from paying toll fees at the toll plazas. Fact: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), an agency under the MoRTH, has clarified that it hasn\u2019t exempted Advocates from paying toll fees at the toll plazas. So, the letter is a \u2018fake\u2019 one and the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe letter in the post seems to be issued by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH). So, when we visited the official Twitter account of MoRTH, we found a retweet of the tweet by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on the same issue. In the tweet, the NHAI clarified that it hasn\u2019t exempted Advocates from paying toll fees at the toll plazas on the National Highways. So, the letter carrying such information is a \u2018fake\u2019 one. \n\n\n\nAs the news went viral, PIB India tweeted terming this letter as a fake one.\n\nDuring the search process, a Facebook post with the same claim but with a different letter was found. In that letter of MoRTH, it was mentioned that an Advocate\u2019s letter to enlist their \u2018class\u2019 in the exempted list of toll payment on the National highways was forwarded to the Chairman of NHAI for necessary action. So, that letter is also being falsely shared stating \u2018no toll to advocates\u2019.\n\nTo sum it up, misleading letters are being circulated on social media stating that all Advocates in India are exempted from paying toll fees. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
