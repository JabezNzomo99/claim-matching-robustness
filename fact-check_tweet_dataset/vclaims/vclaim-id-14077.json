This does address the pupil numbers issue, but other problems remain. Most crucially, inspection practices mean we can\u2019t properly compare the levels today with those in 2010.\n\nThe issue is that schools rated below good or outstanding are prioritised for re-inspection (so their ratings might go up). But if a school is already rated highly, it is less likely to be inspected again (so its rating won\u2019t go down).\n\nAs of 2017, almost 580,000 pupils were in schools that were rated good or outstanding, but which hadn\u2019t been inspected since at least 2010\u2014so we don\u2019t really know if they are actually still good or outstanding nearly a decade down the line.\n\nIn other words, the system is set up in such a way that you would expect the number of schools with a good or outstanding rating to go up over time, even if that might not necessarily reflect the real situation.\n\nThe ratings system for schools also changed in 2012, which could have further affected the numbers.\n\nThese points should not come as a surprise to the Secretary of State for Education, and the government should not be using this statistic.", "lang": "en"}
