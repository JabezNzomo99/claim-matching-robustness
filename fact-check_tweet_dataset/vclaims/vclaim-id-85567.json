But Arpaio and his deputies resisted Snow\u2019s 2011 order, and Arpaio acknowledged as much in interviews with the media. For example, in April 2012, Arpaio told \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d: \u201cI\u2019m still going to do what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m still going to arrest illegal aliens coming into this country.\u201d\n\nOctober 2016: The DOJ\u2019s Public Integrity Section, which investigates corruption charges against public officials, announced that it would charge Arpaio with criminal contempt of court. U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton took up the case. Bolton was so well regarded by both parties for her fairness that then-Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), one of the country\u2019s most conservative senators, recommended her for nomination by President Bill Clinton.\n\nAlthough the DOJ was not on any timeline to take up the case, it made its announcement on the eve of early voting. Arpaio and his attorneys question the timing of this. Still, had the DOJ declined to pursue it, Bolton could have assigned it to a private attorney, per Snow\u2019s request. As Snow noted in his referral, the case was still under the judicial branch\u2019s purview.\n\nArpaio\u2019s attorney, Jack Wilenchik, said Arpaio was referring to the DOJ\u2019s political appointees and the Public Integrity Section, \u201cwhich announced that it would be bringing charges two weeks before his reelection (and while the former president was still in office), directly and materially contributing to Mr. Arpaio\u2019s loss. Those are the prosecutors who brought the case.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize that every prosecution is in some sense a political decision.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Raymond Hulser, who in 2015 became chief of the Public Integrity Section, is a nonpolitical career civil servant who has worked in the unit since 1990. The Criminal Division has nearly 700 lawyers and only about six of those lawyer positions are political appointments, per a DOJ official. The remaining 690-plus lawyers serve in the career ranks.\n\nThis column in the right-leaning Federalist offers a comprehensive account of the role that politics played over the past decade. But it\u2019s clear that the conviction was not tied to the ideologies of Obama\u2019s political appointees at DOJ. Instead, the decisions to convict Arpaio of civil and criminal contempt came from the judiciary \u2014 two U.S. District Court judges. Moreover, the threat of a criminal contempt charge loomed long before October 2016, as Arpaio was found in civil contempt early 2015.\n\n\u201cThese were not Department of Justice charges. This was the court\u2019s request that its order be vindicated with a trial. Whether it was the Department of Justice who was going to, at the judiciary\u2019s invitation, prosecute this case or a lawyer here in Phoenix, a prosecution was going to take place,\u201d said Paul Charlton, former U.S. attorney in Arizona under the Bush administration.\n\nMoreover, there is criticism of the DOJ that it did not prosecute Arpaio as aggressively as it could have, Charlton said: \u201cJudge Murray Snow\u2019s order indicated that the court believed that Arpaio had perjured himself and obstructed justice. The single misdemeanor count prosecuted by the Obama DOJ was an exercise in restraint, and others would say far too timid given the facts.\u201d\n\nArpaio\u2019s conviction stems from a lawsuit filed by individuals who were racially discriminated against by the policing practices under his watch. A Bush-appointed federal judge ordered the agency to stop this, but Arpaio resisted and flouted the order. That judge found Arpaio guilty of civil contempt of court, and referred his case for criminal conviction. Another federal judge, known among Democrats and Republicans for her fairness, issued his criminal conviction.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s announcement on the eve of early voting may have swayed some voters from Arpaio. But local support for the six-term sheriff began declining long before that, and voters knew since early 2015 that Arpaio may face a criminal contempt charge. Despite Trump\u2019s claim, there was no clear path to victory for Arpaio before the DOJ charge.", "lang": "en"}
