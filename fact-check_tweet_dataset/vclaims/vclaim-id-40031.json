On Sept. 4, the day of Pence\u2019s visit to Reykjav\u00edk, the Icelandic-American drag queen Heklina posted two photographs of a row of rainbow flags, along with the following message: \u201cHere\u2019s a great example of why I\u2019m proud to be from Iceland. Mike Pence is visiting the country and everyone is outraged. Mayor of Reykjavik, all the biggest firms and companies, everyone, they\u2019re all flying the gay flag. All Pence will see everywhere on his visit is gay gay gay.\u201d\n\nThat widely shared tweet was further promulgated when the left-leaning Facebook page Occupy Democrats shared a screenshot of it the next day:\n\nWe received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of Heklina\u2019s claims and the authenticity and provenance of the photographs she included in her tweet.\n\nHeklina\u2019s description of the flag phenomenon was somewhat exaggerated, perhaps for rhetorical effect. But Pence\u2019s visit to Reykjav\u00edk was marked by an unusually widespread initiative to fly the LGBT rainbow flag among businesses, government buildings, and other entities in the city, especially those located close to a building where Pence held meetings with local officials.\n\nThe two photographs Heklina included in her tweet were authentic. The one on the left was taken by Isold Uggadottir and shows a row of rainbow flags erected by the IT company Advania outside its building on Gu\u00f0r\u00fanart\u00fan in Reykjav\u00edk:\n\nThe location was highly significant because the white building visible in the background, across the street from Advania, is H\u00f6f\u00f0i House, a historic Reykjav\u00edk landmark and the location where Pence met with Iceland\u2019s president Gu\u00f0ni Th. J\u00f3hannesson on Sept. 4:\n\nThe photograph on the right in Heklina\u2019s tweet was also authentic and showed the same set of flags outside Advania\u2019s building. It appears to have been taken from an article published on the website of the Icelandic magazine Mannl\u00edf.\n\nA spokesperson for Advania confirmed in an email to Snopes that the company had erected the rainbow flags around 11.30 a.m. on the day of Pence\u2019s visit, adding, \u201cWe felt it was a good day to celebrate diversity.\u201d However, the spokesperson declined to either refute or confirm the widely held understanding that the flags were flown specifically in response to Pence\u2019s visit or intended as a gesture of protest against his past pronouncements on LGBT rights. The rainbow flags were not taken down immediately after the vice president\u2019s meeting across the street, and as of Sept. 6 they were still in place, according to the spokesperson.\n\nSeveral other local businesses and even some official government buildings, especially in the neighborhood surrounding H\u00f6f\u00f0i House, also erected rainbow flags \u2014 or allowed them to be erected \u2014 during Pence\u2019s visit. Some entities did this on their own initiative, but others were encouraged to do so by T\u00f3tla S\u00e6mundsd\u00f3ttir, an LGBT activist, and Katr\u00edn Oddsd\u00f3ttir, a prominent Icelandic human-rights lawyer.\n\nThey distributed rainbow flags to several buildings on the day of Pence\u2019s visit, in an effort to form what S\u00e6mundsd\u00f3ttir described to Snopes as a \u201crainbow circle\u201d around the location of Pence\u2019s meeting with the president of Iceland.\n\nThe following is an incomplete list of the entities that flew rainbow flags in Reykjav\u00edk during Pence\u2019s visit on Sept. 4:\n\nVS\u00d3 R\u00e1\u00f0gj\u00f6f, an engineering firm located across the street from H\u00f6f\u00f0i House.\n\n\u00cdslenska Hamborgarafabrikkan, a hamburger restaurant located across the street from H\u00f6f\u00f0i House.\n\nReykjav\u00edk Service Center (12-14 Borgart\u00fan), an official municipal building located down the street from H\u00f6f\u00f0i House.\n\nEfling, a trade union located about five minutes\u2019 walk from H\u00f6f\u00f0i House.\n\n7 Borgart\u00fan, headquarters of Rikiskaup, the Icelandic government\u2019s Office of Central Public Procurement, located one block away from H\u00f6f\u00f0i House (Photograph courtesy of Katr\u00edn Oddsd\u00f3ttir):\n\nLaugarneskirkja, a Lutheran church located about a mile east of H\u00f6f\u00f0i House. On Facebook, the church wrote \u201cLove is love\u201d:\n\nR\u00e1\u00f0h\u00fas Reykjav\u00edkur (Reykjav\u00edk City Hall), located around one mile west of H\u00f6f\u00f0i House.\n\nAccording to S\u00e6mundsd\u00f3ttir, the following entities also erected rainbow flags to mark Pence\u2019s visit, though we haven\u2019t yet found photographic evidence to corroborate these particular claims: Handprj\u00f3nasambandi\u00f0 (a craft store and handknitting association), and Kaffit\u00e1r (a caf\u00e9).\n\nThe participation of City Hall could be what Heklina was alluding to when she claimed that the mayor of Reykjav\u00edk had flown the rainbow flag. Mayor Dagur B. Eggertsson himself later retweeted Heklina\u2019s claims, but a spokesperson for City Hall told Snopes in an email that Eggertsson did not personally order the flags to be flown, though the spokesperson added \u201cI am sure he had nothing against it.\u201d Rather, the decision to erect LGBT rainbow flags outside City Hall was taken by \u201cofficials and city staff,\u201d the spokesperson told us.\n\nWe didn\u2019t find evidence that \u201call the biggest firms and companies, everyone\u201d in Iceland had flown rainbow flags to protest Pence\u2019s visit there in September 2019, as Heklina wrote in her tweet. That appears to have been an exaggeration, perhaps for rhetorical effect. However, we did find evidence of a remarkable initiative among several entities in Reykjav\u00edk \u2014including City Hall, businesses, municipal and government buildings, and a church \u2014 to mark Pence\u2019s visit in that way.\n\nGiven that this effort was particularly concentrated around H\u00f6f\u00f0i House, where Pence held meetings on Sept. 4, it is reasonable to imagine that the visual effect of the flags would have been quite striking to the vice president as he entered and exited that neighborhood.\n\nThe fact that Reykjav\u00edk City Hall, a second official municipal building and an Icelandic government agency all joined in forming the \u201crainbow circle\u201d is especially noteworthy.", "lang": "en"}
