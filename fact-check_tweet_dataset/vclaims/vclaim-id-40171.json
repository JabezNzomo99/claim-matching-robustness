Many of his points were either inaccurate or repeated debunked conspiracy theories.\n\nHe claimed it was Ukraine that interfered with the 2016 election. But American intelligence officials say that is a conspiracy theory.\n\nHe said he released details of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to show how Democrat Adam Schiff made up his own version. But Trump released the call readout before \u2014 not after \u2014 Schiff discussed it in a public hearing.\n\nRELATED: Impeachment is underway, the election is one year away and political fact-checking is needed now more than ever. Today, your donation to PolitiFact is tripled.\n\nHe asked why Europe isn\u2019t providing aid to Ukraine. But they have committed $15 billion.\n\nHe said he doesn\u2019t like the phrase \"deep state.\" But he used the phrase at political rallies in Louisiana and Kentucky this month.\n\nHere are 14 things Trump said that were either wrong or need additional context.\n\nWhistleblower didn't create \"fake story\" | No evidence Yovanovitch didn't hang Trump's photo | Trump does know Gordon Sondland | Mueller found nothing? Not so fast\n\n\"They gave the server to Crowdstrike or whatever it\u2019s called, which is a company owned by a very wealthy Ukrainian. And I still want to see that server, you know the FBI has never gotten that server, that\u2019s a big part of this whole thing. Why did they give it to a Ukrainian company?\"\n\nBroadly, the words \"Crowdstrike\" and \"server\" are tied to a theory claiming that Crowdstrike, an American cybersecurity firm, hid a server containing Hillary Clinton emails in Ukraine. That theory conflates work Crowdstrike did for the Democratic National Committee related to a 2016 breach in its servers, and Clinton\u2019s deleted emails from a private email server she used when she was Secretary of State.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t make clear who is the \"they\" he had in mind here. But this is something he also brought up in his July call with Zelensky.\n\nThe DNC hired Crowdstrike in May 2016 to investigate a breach in its servers. In October 2016, the U.S. intelligence community said it was confident that Russia was behind the DNC hack, and that it reached its conclusion partially with the help of Crowdstrike\u2019s audit of the DNC servers. We\u2019ve found no evidence that Crowdstrike ever worked on issues around Clinton\u2019s private email server.\n\nPart of the conspiracy hinges on the fact that the FBI did not directly review the hacked hardware, leaving the property under the control of its owners. In his March 2017 testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, former FBI Director James Comey said the agency accessed a review of the system conducted by Crowdstrike.\n\nWe previously found no evidence that investigating the server copy would have prevented the FBI from tracking down the hackers.\n\nOne more thing: Crowdstrike isn\u2019t owned by a wealthy Ukrainian. Crowdstrike is owned by California-based Crowdstrike Holdings, Inc. The company was co-founded by chief executive George Kurtz, chief technology officer Dmitri Alperovitch and Gregg Marston (now retired) in 2011. Conspiracists claim Alperovitch is Ukrainian. He isn\u2019t. He\u2019s an American citizen born in Russia.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., listens as his panel hears testimony from the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine William Taylor and career Foreign Service officer George Kent, on Capitol Hill in Washington on Nov. 13, 2019. (AP)\n\n\"(Adam Schiff) made up my phone call. He made it up. He made up a phone call, and then when I released it, everybody was embarrassed.\"\n\nFor starters, Trump\u2019s claim confuses the timeline of events. The White House released its readout of the call on Sept. 25. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, discussed the call the following day.\n\nHe also didn\u2019t make it up. During a Sept. 26 congressional hearing, Schiff gave his interpretation of what Trump said on the call, which he said \"reads like a classic organized crime shakedown.\" He was not reading word-for-word from the readout, but Republicans said he made it seem like he was.\n\nSchiff explicitly introduced his remarks as \"the essence of what the president communicates\" and described them as \"in sum and character, what the president was trying to communicate.\" He said he was presenting Trump\u2019s message \"shorn of its rambling character and in not so many words,\" and he never pretended to offer Trump\u2019s exacts words.\n\nWhen we compared Schiff\u2019s dramatized version to the White House readout of the call, we found that his summary was mostly accurate save for a few exaggerations.\n\n\"You have a whistleblower with a fake story, it is just as fake as (Adam) Schiff\u2019s story.\"\n\nThe complaint got nearly every detail correct, as the memorandum released by the White House shows.\n\nIt was correct on the request that Ukraine investigate the Bidens and the notion that Ukraine might have the DNC server that was hacked by the Russians in the 2016 election.\n\nIt was correct that Trump aimed to connect the Ukrainians with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giluiani, and Attorney General Bill Barr, even down to the detail of Trump mentioning the two in conjunction.\n\nThe complaint described Trump as attempting to pressure Ukraine. That is a matter for the impeachment inquiry to resolve, but the details the whistleblower offered to back that up are correct.\n\n\"Why isn\u2019t Germany putting up money? Why isn\u2019t France putting up money (for Ukraine)? Why isn\u2019t all of the European nations, why aren\u2019t they putting up \u2026\"\n\nThey are. While the United States has taken the lead providing military aid, the Europeans, Japan and Canada have provided the brunt of economic and government restructuring aid to bolster Ukraine.\n\nSince 2014, the European Union and its financial assistance agencies have directed $15 billion to Ukraine in loans and grants. EU spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic told PolitiFact that the aid was \"the largest support package in the history of the European Union.\"\n\nRELATED: Did you know, now through Dec. 31, any new donation to PolitiFact will be tripled?

Bush years, described a de facto division of labor.\n\n\"The United States provides more military assistance, while Europe provides significant reform assistance,\" Pifer said. \"Both are necessary to bolster the country\u2019s security.\"\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testifies before the House Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Nov. 15, 2019. (AP)\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch is \"an Obama person \u2026 I heard bad things.\"\n\nYovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, was not \"an Obama person.\"\n\nYovanovitch has worked for the government for over 30 years. President Barack Obama appointed her to her post in Ukraine in 2016, but before that, she was the ambassador to Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, both times under President George W. Bush.\n\nThe \"bad things\" Trump heard about Yovanovitch were unsubstantiated allegations pushed by Giuliani, journalist John Solomon, former Ukrainian prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko and others.\n\nThe allegations, which included unsupported charges that Yovanovitch privately bad-mouthed Trump and gave Lutsenko a do-not-prosecute list, were challenged by witnesses testifying as part of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump has said that \"everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,\" a ridiculous claim that we rated Pants on Fire. It\u2019s also inaccurate that Yovanovitch was \"dishonest\" in her closed-door deposition, as Fox News host Tucker Carlson falsely claimed.\n\n\"This ambassador (Yovanovitch) \u2026 she wouldn\u2019t hang my picture in the embassy. It took a year and a half or two years to get the picture up.\"\n\nThere\u2019s a good chance Trump is correct in saying his photo didn\u2019t appear in the U.S. embassy in Ukraine for some time after his inauguration. But there's little evidence to believe the delay had to do with Yovanovitch.\n\nIn September 2017, the Washington Post reported that, eight months after the president\u2019s inauguration, photos of Trump and Vice President Mike Pence were still missing from thousands of government offices. That included embassies abroad.\n\nWhy? The Post reported the delay had to do with red tape at the Government Publishing Office (GPO), which prints official portraits.\n\nThe GPO told the Post it was still waiting for the White House to send official portraits of Trump and Pence. The White House told the newspaper that the duo had not yet decided when they would sit for the photos.\n\nIn short: the delay in hanging photos of Trump likely had more to do with the White House than government offices.\n\nAt the end of October 2017, the White House announced that it had published the official portraits and had started circulating them among government offices \u2014 nine months after Trump\u2019s inauguration. It\u2019s reasonable to assume that it took longer for those portraits to make their way to embassies overseas than to government offices in the U.S.\n\nYovanovitch\u2019s legal team told PolitiFact in an email that the embassy in Ukraine hung the official portraits of the president, vice president and secretary of state as soon as they arrived from Washington. They did not provide an approximate date for when that occurred.\n\nWe reached out to the State Department and the General Services Administration (GSA), which maintains thousands of government offices around the world, for more information. We haven\u2019t heard back from State, and the GSA did not provide a comment in time for publication.\n\n\"These were their witnesses. This was the best they\u2019ve got.\"\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee called 12 witnesses to testify publicly as part of the impeachment inquiry. Three of those witnesses \u2014 David Hale, Kurt Volker and Tim Morrison \u2014 were also on the GOP\u2019s list of requested witnesses.\n\nThe White House sent a letter to the committee in October indicating that it would not be cooperating with the impeachment inquiry. Several administration officials did not testify as a result of the White House\u2019s instructions.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is joined by Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union as he arrives at Air Force One in Brussels, Belgium, on July 10, 2018. (AP)\n\n\"This guy Sondland, hardly know him.\"\n\nThe public record shows that Trump and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, are not strangers.\n\nIn his Nov. 20 testimony, Sondland said he and Trump are not \"close friends\" but share a \"professional, cordial working relationship.\" He said they have spoken roughly 20 times.\n\nAlthough Sondland preferred other candidates to Trump in the 2016 election, he donated about $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee and was nominated for his post by Trump in 2018.\n\nThere are numerous photos of the Sondand and Trump together, including aboard Air Force One. In October, Trump tweeted that he \"would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t like to use the word \u2018deep state\u2019.\"\n\nWhile we can\u2019t judge his feelings, we can empirically say that Trump uses the phrase regularly. We ran the term through a program called factbase, which tracks Trump\u2019s speeches, remarks and Twitter account. Here\u2019s a sampling:\n\nRally in Kentucky, Nov. 4: \"We are finally putting America first. Yet the deep state and the failed ruling class are trying to resist any changes to their failed policies of the past. They believe it is their right to rule over you and to redistribute your wealth all around the world. No, thank you. No, thank you.\"\n\nRally in Mississippi, Nov. 1: \"The Democrats, the media, and the deep state are desperate to stop us. And it's not me, it's us, it's all of us.\"\n\nTwitter, Oct. 17: \"Tonight, we forcefully condemn the blatant corruption of the Democrat Party, the Fake News Media, and the rogue bureaucrats of the Deep State.\"\n\nRally in Louisiana, Oct. 10: \"We're directly taking on the unholy alliance of corrupt Democrat politicians, deep state bureaucrats and the fake news media. \"\n\nU.S. Vice President Joe Biden, center, son Hunter Biden, left, and his sister Valerie Biden Owens, right, at a ceremony in Sojevo, Kosovo, Aug. 17, 2016.(AP)\n\n\"I watched Joe Biden with the prosecutor, who a lot of people said was a great prosecutor, and they took him off and he was prosecuting that company.\"\n\nWishful thinking. Trump has previously praised Ukraine\u2019s former prosecutor general Viktor Shokin as a \"very good\" and \"very fair prosecutor.\" But Trump ignores the widespread criticism of Shokin.\n\nBiden, while vice president, was part of a widespread consensus among Western leaders and institutions in asking for removal.\n\nWhen Shokin was fired in 2016, the Kyiv Post reported that he was \"likely one of the most unpopular figures in Ukraine\" over his reputation for corruption, the subject of popular street protests.\n\nTrump\u2019s statement about \"that company\" refers to Burisma, where Biden\u2019s son Hunter served on the board. A former Ukrainian official said the investigation into Burisma was dormant under Shokin.\n\n\"Obama would send pillows and sheets. He wouldn\u2019t send anything else.\"\n\nTrump, along with other Republicans including Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., has downplayed the aid the United States gave to Ukraine during the Obama administration. Former Ukraine President Poroshenko had used similar language in 2014, and so did the late Sen. John McCain in 2015.\n\nWhile the Obama administration refused to provide lethal weapons in 2014, it did provide extensive military and security aid.\n\nObama rejected a request from Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko for lethal aid that included Javelin anti-tank missiles. (Trump later approved the sale of them.) U.S. officials were concerned that providing the Javelins to Ukraine would escalate their conflict with Russia, which had invaded Crimea.\n\nHowever, Obama\u2019s White House approved a $53 million aid package that included vehicles, patrol boats, body armor and night-vision goggles, as well as humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe help didn\u2019t stop: Between 2014 and 2016, the United States committed more than $600 million in security assistance to Ukraine. Under Obama, the federal government started the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which sent other kinds of U.S. military equipment to the country. From 2016 to 2019, Congress appropriated $850 million.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been tougher on Russia than any president in history.\"\n\nThe consensus among experts has been that Obama was more forceful than Trump has been on countering election meddling.\n\nPrior to the 2016 election, Obama publicly named the Russian government as the culprit and confronted Vladimir Putin. Obama took his most significant action after the election when he ordered 35 Russian diplomats and suspected intelligence agents to leave the United States.\n\nMeanwhile Trump cast doubt on Russia\u2019s election meddling and repeated Putin\u2019s denials of his government\u2019s involvement. In August, Trump grudgingly signed a law calling for new sanctions against Russia in response to its interference with the election, saying it was \"seriously flawed.\" The legislation was not advocated for by Trump \u2014 it was pushed for by Congress.\n\nTrump\u2019s two highest-profile acts challenging Russia were his cruise missile attack against Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad, a Russian ally, and his approval of lethal arms sales to Ukraine. In both of those cases, Trump went further than Obama did.\n\nExperts previously told us that to the extent that Trump\u2019s policies against Russia have met or exceeded Obama\u2019s post-2014 policies, the credit goes more to his agencies and Congress.\n\nFormer special counsel Robert Mueller testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, July 24, 2019, before the House Judiciary Committee hearing on his report on Russian election interference. (AP)\n\nOn Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation: \"They went through 2.5 years. They found nothing.\"\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation did not establish that Trump\u2019s campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in the 2016 election interference. But it outlined numerous contacts between the campaign and Russia.\n\nMueller also identified 10 \"key issues and events\" as part of the investigation on whether Trump obstructed justice, such as Trump\u2019s firing of Comey and Trump\u2019s involvement in crafting a misleading statement on behalf of Donald Trump Jr. regarding a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer. Ultimately, Mueller said his team was unable to make a conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice, \"while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\"\n\nThe Mueller report also detailed Russia\u2019s sophisticated social media disinformation campaign and other efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives hasn\u2019t done much, but it has done a little.\n\nCongress enacted 68 bills and resolutions into law between January and mid-November, but the House passed or agreed to 389 bills and 151 resolutions in the same time frame.\n\nPelosi has blamed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who vowed to be a \"grim reaper\" for the House\u2019s progressive policies, for leaving those bills untouched in the Senate.\n\nWe counted roughly 300 House bills that are stuck in the Senate in our analysis of what Congress is doing besides impeachment.", "lang": "en"}
