Only 4% of urban properties have speeds less than 10Mbit/s.\n\nOfcom says that\u2019s because of the longer lengths of copper wire between rural properties and the source of their internet connection.\n\nIt also says that slow broadband is a significant problem for many smaller businesses across the UK.\n\nA separate study last year found that just under half of people living in remote rural areas said their internet connection was fast enough, and more than half had an average speed less than 6.3Mbit/s. At that speed the report said it would take about a minute to download 10 songs, or four minutes to save 200 photos.", "lang": "en"}
