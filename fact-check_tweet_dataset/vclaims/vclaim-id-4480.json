It clearly is a hoax if you watch the video. It's called CICRET, a spook on \"SECRET\". Someone is trying hard to convince us with a slick video.\n\nOn 2014, the YouTube account Cicret published a video titled \u201cThe Cicret Bracelet: Like a but on your skin.\u201d The video\u2019s description outlined Cicret\u2019s functionality thusly:\n\nThe clip showcased some impressive technology that eliminates a number of inconveniences experienced by smartphone users: The Cicret Bracelet enables submersion in water (as evidenced by a portion of the video\u2019s taking place in a bathtub) and, as described by ZDNet, allows users to enjoy device functionality even when their handsets are out of reach:\n\nIt will use a tiny \u2018pico projector\u2019 and eight miniature proximity sensors to replicate an image of your device screen on to your arm. Low energy Bluetooth will communicate with your mobile device. A Wi-Fi component will connect you to the network. It will have a vibrate function and a micro USB charging port. Touching your arm with your finger will interrupt one of the sensors and return the instruction back to the Cicret bracelet. Flicking your wrist will initiate the display on your arm. The Cicret bracelet will be water resistant and durable. Flick, swipe, pinch and zoom functionality will be supported along with tap to text. You will even be able to answer the phone with a flick of your wrist.\n\nThe Cicret App and Bracelet was lauded by tech bloggers as the next stage of smartphone connectivity, and videos and articles about it were widely shared on social media sites. But if your first impression was the device looked like something out of science fiction, you weren\u2019t entirely wrong. A number of skeptical users had some pointed questions about the Cicret claims, and among the more logical queries (such as how the device might work for people with dark skin or abundant arm hair) was a far more central mystery: does the Cicret bracelet actually exist?\n\nViewers of the video were quick to notice the device as shown appeared to have been cobbled together from recognizable existing products. Some observed extant advances don\u2019t allow for such capabilities to be contained within a device as small as the one depicted, and others noted the projection quality seemed remarkably high.\n\nAs it turned out, the Cicret bracelet did not actually exist, and no working prototype of it had yet produced. In a 2014 report from Washington television station WTOP, Cicret Guillaume Pommier reluctantly confirmed the impressive video produced was a mockup not representative of any functional prototype device:\n\n\u201cThe video we put online is an illustration of what our Cicret Bracelet could allow users to do,\u201d says Pommier. Pommier says he and three partners are trying to raise money on their own, through PayPal instead of standard crowdfunding vehicles such as Kickstarter. \u201cWe need someone who\u2019d put up some money to allow us to finish a prototype,\u201d says Pommier.\n\nThat report highlighted additional areas of concern about the project, specifically a lack of transparency and the anonymity of its creators:\n\nThe site contains a brief \u201cAbout Us\u201d description of the principals, with no descriptions of their previous projects. The website site lists no street address or phone number for the a Gmail address. Asked about the lack of information on the company\u2019s website, Pommier has an answer: \u201cTo be honest it\u2019s because of 4 on our team are actually working for another company. Obviously we don\u2019t want to be fired because of this second professional activity!\u201d\n\nCicret has since addressed some of those concerns, adding a physical address and a listing of their team member\u2019s names, photos, job titles, and addresses to their web site, and producing a video that purports to show a (decidedly less visually impressive) functioning prototype of their virtual bracelet that works with all skin colors:\n\nAlthough the Cicret bracelet and app may not be impossible to develop with current technology, it\u2019s also not a device that actually exists at this stage. While an eventual working Cicret could one day be real, it\u2019s also possible the concept will graduate to the realm of vaporware.", "lang": "en"}
