Region XI refers to the Davao Region; Zamboanga Peninsula is Region IX.\n\nTwo other publications, Rappler and The Daily Sentry\u2019s source broadsheet The Daily Tribune, - committed the same error in their reports.\n\nState auditors, upon finding out CHR had spent P5.4 million on live-in trainings in various hotels, only said it could have spent less had the commission:\n\nIt did not say the Commission behaved like a \u201cspendthrift\u201d or that it played rich, as The Daily Sentry claimed.\n\nNone of the establishments CHR used for their trainings at the time were rated five or four-star hotels in the Department of Tourism\u2019s (DOT) 2017 list of star-rated properties. Hotels with such ratings are classified by DOT as \u201cupscale\u201d and \u201cluxurious.\u201d\n\nSeda Vertis North in Quezon City, where the CHR held in a three-day training in July 2017, was given five-star status by DOT only last March.\n\nCHR spokesperson Jacqueline De Guia said in a statement they had to hold their trainings outside their premises because of \u201climitations in office space,\u201d the Commission being housed in an \u201cold, condemned building.\u201d\n\nCHR also had to lend its only Multi-Purpose Hall to the Human Rights Victims\u2019 Claims Board after its term was extended in 2016, added De Guia.\n\nThe commission has since taken measures to address COA\u2019s observations:\n\nThe Daily Sentry's misleading story, which could have reached more than 2.7 million people, was posted almost two weeks after COA published its audit on CHR.\n\nTraffic to the story was largely generated from social media by the pages The Filipino News, The News Gear and News Wire PH. The Daily Sentry was created January 10.\n\nDe Guia, J. (2018, July 10). On the audit observations on the CHR\u2019s training expenses .
