In the course of the debate, Clinton accused Trump of refusing to release his tax returns and suggested her opponent\u2019s motivation was that he had something to hide:\n\nCLINTON: For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns. You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it. We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing [returns] when you\u2019re under audit. So you\u2019ve got to ask yourself, why won\u2019t [Trump] release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he\u2019s not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he\u2019s not as charitable as he claims to be. Third, we don\u2019t know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks. Or maybe he doesn\u2019t want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he\u2019s paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody\u2019s ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn\u2019t pay any federal income tax.\n\nBut when questioned by CNN\u2019s Dana Bash immediately after the debate, Trump disclaimed that he said his paying no federal income taxes made him smart, quickly pivoting off the subject onto a complain about government spending:\n\nDANA BASH: My question for you is, first of all, it sounds like you admitted that you hadn\u2019t paid federal taxes and that, that was smart. Is that what you meant to say? TRUMP: No, I didn\u2019t say that at all. I mean if they say I didn\u2019t, I mean it doesn\u2019t matter. I will say this, I hate the way our government spends our taxes because they are wasting our money. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re running it so poorly. Whether it\u2019s spent in Iraq or wherever they\u2019re spending it, they are wasting our money. So I do hate the way our government spends our money.\n\nTo hold that Trump hadn\u2019t actually said what he had just been recorded saying would require a good deal of semantic contorting, such as claiming that Trump was describing his not releasing his tax returns (rather than his not paying tax) as \u201csmart,\u201d or that Trump meant he hadn\u2019t said that he never paid any federal taxes (even if that was the case in at least some years).", "lang": "en"}
