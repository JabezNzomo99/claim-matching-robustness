Fred Doucette actually wrote an extremely similar statement as a letter to a local newspaper last year. The statement may have gotten linked to Eastwood after the Massachusetts Republican Party shared Doucette\u2019s letter with a meme featuring Eastwood\u2019s likeness.\n\nA viral Facebook post credits Eastwood, an actor-director known for films such as \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d and \u201cGran Torino,\u201d with authoring a long statement supporting Trump. It has been shared more than 12,000 times.\n\n\u201cI love when people call Trump Stupid,\u201d reads the beginning of Eastwood\u2019s alleged statement. \u201cYou mean the multi-billionaire who kicked every Democrats (sic) butt, buried 16 career Republican politicians, and continues to make fools out of once reputable news organizations.\u201d\n\nHowever, there\u2019s no evidence Eastwood ever actually said or wrote the long statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. No credible sources link it to him online, and Eastwood doesn\u2019t appear to have any social media accounts, per a tweet from his daughter Morgan.\n\n\u201cStop posing as my dad,\u201d she tweeted in 2016. \u201cHe would not know how to use social media.\u201d (RELATED: \u2018Why I Stick My Neck Out For Trump\u2019 \u2013 Did Clint Eastwood Author This Pro-Trump Statement?)\n\nThrough a quick internet search, the Daily Caller discovered that a nearly word-for-word statement actually comes from Doucette, a Republican New Hampshire state representative and Trump\u2019s campaign chair for the state. He wrote it as a September 2019 letter to the Eagle-Tribune, a newspaper that circulates in parts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that social media users linked it to Eastwood after the Massachusetts Republican Party shared Doucette\u2019s letter on its Facebook page with a meme that quotes Eastwood as saying, \u201cIf Congress really gave a rat\u2019s ass about the American people, they would resign.\u201d\n\nThe Caller didn\u2019t find any record of Eastwood making the statement about Congress either.", "lang": "en"}
