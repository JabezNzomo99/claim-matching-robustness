The organizations mentioned in the article have been linked to conspiracy theories in the past.\n\nThe article, published by the website NBCM News, alleges that the queen and husband Prince Philip were found guilty in 2013 by \u201csix judges of the International Common Law Court of Justice\u201d in the Belgian capital of Brussels.\n\n\u201cAfter nearly a year of litigation, Queen Elizabeth and her husband, Prince Phillip, were found guilty in the disappearance of ten native children from the Catholic-run Kamloops residential school in British Columbia,\u201d the article alleged. \u201cGrieving parents haven\u2019t seen their children since they left for a picnic with the Royal couple on Oct. 10 1964.\u201d\n\nBut there is no truth to the article\u2019s claim. The British royal family often makes headlines. If the queen had been found guilty of such a crime, it would have been picked up by major news outlets, yet none have reported on it, and Buckingham Palace has not issued a press release.\n\nCloser examination of the article reveals other red flags that add to its dubiousness. The two organizations, the \u201cInternational Common Law Court of Justice\u201d and the \u201cInternational Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State,\u201d are not legally recognized governing bodies. Both are linked to the Canadian conspiracy theorist Kevin Annett, according to Snopes.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the two organizations have appeared in conspiracy theories.
