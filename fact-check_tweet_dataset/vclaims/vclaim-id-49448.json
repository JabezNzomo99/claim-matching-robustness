As people discussed what a Ye presidency would look like \u2014 or if this announcement was just a publicity stunt \u2014 a photograph supposedly showing the rapper and entrepreneur wearing a jacket with a Confederate flag patch started to circulate online:\n\nThis is a genuine picture of him sporting a Confederate flag on his jacket.\n\nThis photograph was taken in 2013. At the time, West had just released \u201cNew Slaves,\u201d a song centered on racism in the United States, and had started selling memorabilia emblazoned with the Confederate flag at his shows.\n\nThe rapper thrust himself into the spotlight, yet again, with news that several pieces of merchandise from his Yeezus tour are emblazoned with the controversial Southern Cross. At his tour store in Los Angeles, a replica of the flag is affixed to the wall with red tape and adorned with the words, \u201cI ain\u2019t coming down.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a photograph of one of the pieces of merchandise featuring the Confederate flag sold at West\u2019s tour shop in Los Angeles:\n\nWhile several people criticized West for peddling a piece of racist memorabilia, West defended the decision, arguing that he was attempting to take ownership of the flag.\n\n\u201cYou know the confederate flag represented slavery, in a way, that\u2019s my abstract take on what I know about it, right. So I wrote the song \u2018New Slaves.\u2019 So I took the Confederate flag and made it my flag. It\u2019s my flag now. Now what are you going to do?\u201d", "lang": "en"}
