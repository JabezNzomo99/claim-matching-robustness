Deputy Chief Dave Dailey [said] the group was seen taking videos by another patron but had not yet been able to locate the video in question on social media. Dailey said that the grocery store surveillance was not able to capture the incident, but showed the teens in the store.\n\nThe Purcellville Police Department soon afterwards issued a statement in which they acknowledged that \u201cno actual customers or produce were spit or coughed on directly\u201d:\n\nOn March 19, 2020 the Purcellville Police Department notified the public of an incident which occurred on March 18th at a local grocery store involving juveniles reportedly coughing on produce, while filming themselves and posting it on social media. After a thorough investigation, the Purcellville Police Department identified the juveniles involved, notified their parents, and subsequently interviewed the subjects. The two juveniles questioned admitted to their involvement, and it was determined that there was no criminal intent. The investigation concluded the teenagers were getting close to other patrons and coughing into their own sleeves, while filming it on their phones. After viewing the video footage, officers determined no actual customers or produce were spit or coughed on directly, but we appreciate the store\u2019s swift action in reporting the incident to police and removing any items in question to ensure the health of store patrons and employees. Due to the age of the minors involved, no names or video footage will be released.\n\nWe asked the Purcellville Police Department for additional information on the subject but had not received a response at publication time.", "lang": "en"}
