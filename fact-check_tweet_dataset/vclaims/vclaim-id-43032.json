No, that's not true: This claim was put out by a satirical website and has no basis in fact.\n\nThe claim originated from an article (archived here) that was published by Gish Gallop on February 14, 2020. It was titled \"Bernie Sanders Returns Mike Bloomberg's $18.53 Dollar Donation\" and opened this way:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe hoax story, which has been shared hundreds of times on social media, went on to ficticiously quote Sanders as saying, \"[If] Mike Bloomberg things he can buy off this campaign with his 18 dollars and 53 cents, he's got another thing coming.\"\n\nAmong other places, at least one (unofficial) Bloomberg Facebook group, Bloomberg 2020, seems to have been taken in by it, according to CrowdTangle data. The Bloomberg 2020 post has since been deleted. Sanders and Bloomberg are both seeking the Democratic nod to run against President Donald Trump, a Republican.\n\nBelow is an image of the shares, according to CrowdTangle data:\n\nGish Gallop is upfront about being satirical. This is the language that appears at the bottom of its webpage.\n\nThis website is for entertainment purposes only. Please do not let your children use this site.
