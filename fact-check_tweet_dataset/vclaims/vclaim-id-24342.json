But perhaps there is neither government nor those sensitive hearts who will shed tears for this child who lost his life in the catastrophic floods in Mithila. -translated\u201d). The tweet had garnered more than 1,800 retweets before it was deleted.\n\nThe official Twitter handle of Rashtriya Janata Dal quote-tweeted Tiwari\u2019s tweet and attacked the ruling BJP dispensation in Bihar\n\nIndian rural media platform Gaon connection tweeted the image of the child with the claim that it depicts the tragedy in Bihar.\n\nMany other prominent individuals on Twitter also posted the image with a similar narrative taking potshots at the Bihar government.\n\nAlt News found that while the infant indeed lost his life in Muzaffarpur, however, it was not because of drowning in the ongoing floods in Bihar. The mother of the child attempted suicide by jumping into a river along with four of her children. The incident took place in Sital Patti village, which falls under the jurisdiction of Siwaipatti police station in Muzaffarpur.\n\nMuzaffarpur District Magistrate Alok Ranjan clarified that the viral image/video of the drowned infant washed ashore had nothing to do with the floods in the state. Addressing a press conference on July 18, Ranjan said that Reena Devi had pushed her four children into the water and herself jumped into the river after a quarrel with her husband who lives in Punjab. He further added, \u201cIt was purely man-made which can be dubbed as a criminal offence for the attempt to murder.\u201d In the incident, three children \u2013 Karan Kumar, Jyoti Kumari, and Raj Kumar died while seven-year-old Radha and Reena Devi were rescued.\n\nSpeaking to The Quint, Alok Ranjan said that Devi\u2019s husband Ram had filed an FIR against his wife after returning from Punjab. Ranjan added that there was no connection of the deaths with the Bihar floods since the woman\u2019s house was at a distance from the closest river and not in danger of being affected by flooding.\n\nAlt News contacted Siwaipatti police station. We were informed that Reena Devi has been arrested and an FIR has been registered with the charge of attempt to murder.\n\nIn conclusion, a photo of a child whose mother attempted to commit suicide along with the infant in a river in Muzaffarpur district was linked with the devastation caused by the ongoing Bihar floods.", "lang": "en"}
