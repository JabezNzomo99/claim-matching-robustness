Another handle @shuklapinku posted the same image with a message, \u201c\u0908 \u0915\u0935\u0928 \u092a\u0922\u093c\u093e\u0908 \u092a\u0922\u093c\u0947 \u0932\u0940 JNU \u092e\u0947\u0902 ..!\ud83d\ude0a (What is she studying in JNU -translated)\u201d. These two tweets have garnered close to 1000 retweets so far.\n\nA few more people on Twitter and Facebook shared the image with a similar narrative. (1, 2, 3, 4)\n\nA Google reverse image search of the image revealed that the image is not related to the JNU students\u2019 protest. \u201cPolice arrests a woman who was participating in a protest demanding for minimum wage, at labour Commissioner Office in Hyderabad\u201d, reads the caption of the image published by Outlook. According to the media outlet, this is an image by PTI on September 19, 2017.\n\nThe other image of an elderly woman is from a protest reportedly led by women\u2019s rights activists and lawyers outside the Supreme Court after a clean chit was given to the former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi on allegations of sexual harassment raised against him in May 2019. Alt News had earlier fact-checked the claim and found that the woman in the picture is a CPI leader named Annie Raja.\n\nIn conclusion, old and unrelated photographs of elderly women who are escorted by police personnel are being shared as of JNU students protesting fee hike. Earlier this week, Alt News has debunked(1, 2) images of JNU students who were misidentified as elderly students to discredit their protest against fee hike.", "lang": "en"}
