In March, Italy surpassed China as the country with the highest death toll. A blog post shared on Facebook claims that thousands of those deaths were intentional.\n\n\"Italy arrest (sic) doctor for intentionally killing over 3,000 coronavirus patients,\" the post\u2019s title says.

And yet searching for information about Dr. Sergio Kerr, we found no such reports.\n\nWe rate this blog post Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
