President Barack Obama scrubbed a planned attack on Syrian facilities \u2014 which planners believed would have left two-thirds of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons intact \u2014 in exchange for a diplomatic solution that was to result in the removal of all chemical weapons.\n\nRice said: \u201cWe were able to find a solution that didn\u2019t necessitate the use of force that actually removed the chemical weapons that were known from Syria, in a way that the use of force would never have accomplished. \u2026 We were able to get the Syrian government to voluntarily and verifiably give up its chemical weapons stockpile.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe assess that Syria has not declared all the elements of its chemical weapons program to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Despite the creation of a specialized team and months of work by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to address gaps and inconsistencies in Syria\u2019s declaration, numerous issues remain unresolved. Moreover, we continue to judge that the Syrian regime has used chemicals as a means of warfare since accession to the CWC in 2013. The OPCW Fact-Finding Mission has concluded that chlorine had been used on Syrian opposition forces in multiple incidents in 2014 and 2015. Helicopters \u2014 which only the Syrian regime possesses \u2014 were used in several of these attacks.\u201d\n\nJust four days before Rice\u2019s comments, the Treasury Department sanctioned Syrian officials for use of chlorine in warfare. \u201cThe Syrian regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons against its own people is a heinous act that violates the long-standing global norm against the production and use of chemical weapons,\u201d said Adam J. Szubin, acting undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence. \u201cToday\u2019s action is a critical part of the international community\u2019s effort to hold the Syrian regime accountable for violating the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and UN Security Council Resolution 2118.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last of the remaining chemicals identified for removal from Syria were loaded this afternoon aboard the Danish ship Ark Futura,\u201d Ahmet \u00dcz\u00fcmc\u00fc, the director-general of the OPCW, announced in June 2014. \u201cThe ship made its last call at the port of Latakia in what has been a long and patient campaign in support of this international endeavor. Removing the stockpile of precursor and other chemicals has been a fundamental condition in the program to eliminate Syria\u2019s chemical weapons program.\u201d\n\nSo what about Syrian attacks involving chlorine? This is a so-called dual-use chemical with industrial uses, under the OPCW classification, and so it was not part of the deal with Syria. As for the recent sarin attack, either Syria held back some material or it created some new material since 2014, even though production facilities were supposed to be eliminated.\n\nIn 2015, Kerry slammed Syria for using chlorine in attacks against citizens, although Obama drew criticism for saying chlorine \u201chistorically has not been listed as a chemical weapon, but when it is used in this fashion, can be considered a prohibited use of that particular chemical.\u201d Meanwhile, OPCW in 2015 and 2016 reported finding traces of sarin and VX nerve agent at Syrian facilities that had not been declared to inspectors or previously visited.\n\nKerry\u2019s \u201cexit memo\u201d to Obama, released 11 days before Rice\u2019s remarks on NPR, acknowledged that Syria continued to use \u201cundeclared\u201d chemical weapons. \u201cRemoving these weapons from Syria ensured that they could not be used \u2014 by the Assad regime or by terrorist groups like ISIL \u2014 but unfortunately other undeclared chemical weapons continue to be used ruthlessly on the Syrian people,\u201d Kerry wrote. \u201cWhile we have made progress, we cannot and will not rest until the Syrian people can no longer be gassed and terrorized by these vicious weapons.\u201d\n\nBut the Obama administration had a tendency to oversell what was accomplished, perhaps because Obama received so much criticism for not following through on an attack if Syria crossed what Obama had called \u201ca red line.\u201d We have a reasonable-person test here at The Fact Checker, and it\u2019s doubtful many NPR listeners realized that \u201cknown\u201d was code for the fact that Rice only was referring to chemical weapons stocks declared by Syria \u2014 or that chlorine weapons were not covered by the agreement.\n\nThe reality is that there were continued chemical-weapons attacks by Syria \u2014 and that U.S. and international officials had good evidence that Syria had not been completely forthcoming in its declaration and possibly retained sarin and VX nerve agent. Yet Rice said: \u201cWe were able to get the Syrian government to voluntarily and verifiably give up its chemical weapons stockpile.\u201d She did not explain that Syria\u2019s declaration was believed to be incomplete and thus was not fully verified \u2014 and that the Syrian government still attacked citizens with chemical weapons not covered by the 2013 agreement. That tipped her wordsmithing toward a Four.", "lang": "en"}
