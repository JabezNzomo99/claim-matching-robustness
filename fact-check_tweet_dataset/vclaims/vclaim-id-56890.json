(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Instagram is owned by Facebook.\n\nThe Instagram post directs to a link that clarifies that the additional $2,400 a month isn\u2019t as available as was the one-time $1,200 stimulus check. It says that unemployed Americans can get $600 a week, or $2,400 a month, if they qualify for federal unemployment help under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor says that the $600 a week benefit under the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation is only available through the end of July. The radio station does not make that clear.\n\nSeveral Instagram users commented on the post, calling it \"very misleading\" and \"click bait.\"\n\nThe Instagram post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
