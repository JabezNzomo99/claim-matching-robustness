Robert Menendez on trial \u2014 and was his co-defendant convicted on prostitution charges \u2014 as an online meme says?\n\n\n\nA: No. Menendez was tried on corruption charges last year, but was not convicted. His co-defendant was found guilty of defrauding Medicare in an unrelated case.\n\n\n\nBob Menendez. Is he on trial?\n\nWeeks before the midterm elections, an outdated meme circulating on Facebook has resurrected charges against New Jersey Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez.\n\nThe popular meme tells users that Menendez is \u201con trial for corruption\u201d alongside a defendant who was \u201cconvicted and is getting life in prison in a case that involves selling underage minority immigrant girls into prostitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is the outrage?\u201d the meme, posted Oct. 10, asks.\n\nBut the meme distorts the facts in several respects.\n\nFor starters, Menendez was tried last year on charges that he had accepted bribes and used his influence to help a friend\u2019s personal and business interests. In return, the federal indictment alleged, Menendez received gifts, vacations and hundreds of thousands in political donations.\n\nThe trial ended in November 2017 when a jury deadlocked, leading to a mistrial. A federal judge subsequently acquitted the senator on some of the charges and the government ultimately dropped the case. The Senate Ethics Committee, in a letter earlier this year, \u201cseverely admonished\u201d Menendez for his actions.\n\nSo, Menendez is no longer \u201con trial\u201d \u2014 as the circulating meme declares \u2014 or facing charges.\n\nAnd what about the claim that Menendez\u2019s co-defendant and friend, Salomon Melgen, got \u201clife in prison\u201d in a case involving underage sex workers? That\u2019s also inaccurate.\n\nIn a separate case, Melgen, an ophthalmologist, was accused of defrauding Medicare, including by submitting false claims and falsifying entries in patient charts. He was sentenced in February to 17 years in prison after being convicted on 67 counts.\n\nNeither of the two federal cases involved any charges relating to prostitution.\n\nEarly in the corruption case, investigators did indeed probe claims from an anonymous tipster that Menendez and Melgen had solicited underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic. Those allegations were investigated, court records indicate, and never led to charges being filed.\n\nNevertheless, the unproven claims have been used as the basis for an attack ad against the senator as he seeks reelection, as the Washington Post\u2018s Fact Checker has reported. Menendez faces Republican Bob Hugin on Nov. 6.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cPublic Letter of Admonition.\u201d U.S. Senate Select Committee on Ethics. 26 Apr 2018.\n\n\u201cSouth Florida Doctor Sentenced in Medicare Fraud Scheme.\u201d Press Release, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Florida. 22 Feb 2018.\n\nUnited States of America v.
