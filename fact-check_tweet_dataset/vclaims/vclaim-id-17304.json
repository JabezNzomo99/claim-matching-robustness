Hannity asks Assange if he can guarantee 1,000 percent that WikiLeaks \u201cdid not get it [hacked information] from Russia \u2026 or anybody associated with Russia.\u201d Assange interjects with \u201cyes\u201d before Hannity finishes his question, then says that \u201cour source is not the Russian government and it is not a state party.\u201d His answer leaves open the possibility that the information could have come through an intermediary. As seen in Trump\u2019s tweet, this exchange was ultimately interpreted as Assange saying the \u201cRussians did not give him the info.\u201d\n\nThen there are the emails of John Podesta, former chairman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Private security researchers confirmed that the Russian foreign intelligence service hacked into Podesta\u2019s email account after tricking him to log in to a fake Google log-in page, then leaked the emails. WikiLeaks obtained these emails and published them on its website, but it is less clear as to who exactly sent the Podesta emails to WikiLeaks.\n\nAssange has repeatedly disputed claims that the emails came from the Russian government. Yet, in a December interview on Hannity\u2019s radio show, he left open the possibility that Guccifer 2.0\u2019s activities were linked to the Russians. \u201cNow, who is behind these, we don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cThese look very much like they\u2019re from the Russians. But in some ways, they look very amateur, and almost look too much like the Russians.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it absolute? Is there any room for margin of error? Sure . . . attribution is quite complex. But that\u2019s not the same as saying it isn\u2019t the Russians. \u2018Maybe it\u2019s the Chinese, maybe a 14-year-old, maybe a 400-pound hacker\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s just not credible,\u201d Hennessey said. \u201cShort of a videotape of Vladimir Putin at the keyboard himself narrating it, it\u2019s hard to imagine [being able to prove definitively that the Russians were involved in WikiLeaks]. This really is, from an intelligence standpoint, a dream in the sort of level of intelligence that we\u2019re seeing here.\u201d\n\nThe Intercept article notes that federal officials have not disclosed how they arrived at the October 2016 announcement formally accusing Russia: \u201cWhat\u2019s missing is any evidence at all. If this federal confidence is based on evidence that\u2019s being withheld from the public for any reason, that\u2019s one thing \u2014 secrecy is their game. But if the U.S. Intelligence Community is asking the American electorate to believe them, to accept as true their claim that our most important civic institution was compromised by a longtime geopolitical nemesis, we need them to show us why.\u201d\n\nFurther, he does not disclose any of the independent assessments that have been made about Guccifer 2.0, who has claimed credit for providing WikiLeaks with DNC emails. We award Assange Three Pinocchios for his distortion of the facts. Obviously, we will also keep an eye on this and update as further information becomes available.", "lang": "en"}
