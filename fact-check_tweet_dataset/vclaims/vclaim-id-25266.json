At the time of writing this article, the post had over 6,300 shares.\n\nThe photograph has also been circulated on Twitter with the identical claim. Several among those who shared it are followed by railway minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s Office (1, 2, 3).\n\nAlt News found that the image was circulated last year as well. From a page Semah G. Weifur Fans, it received over 59,000 shares. This page made a similar claim of the man being a terrorist. Be vigilant, terrorists have adopted a new strategy, they turn into a beggar with explosives. Their targets are schools,\u2026 What is the truth? Upon reverse searching the image on Google, we found a 2014 tweet by Sisat.pk of the same photograph captioned differently \u2013 \u201cMan with hashish jacket on turkhum border.\u201d We found another tweet from that same year by a Pakistan-based journalist also claiming that the man was caught with hashish at Turkhum border, which is a crossing point between Pakistan and Afghanistan. ThePrint recently debunked the photograph. The viral image was also shared in 2014 with an altered claim that the man was an ISIS terrorist. Malaysian website rojakPOT had busted the false narrative. An image of a Muslim man carrying hashish, caught by the Pakistani army at the Pak-Afghan border in Turkhum, was thus viral as a suicide bomber caught by the Indian army.", "lang": "en"}
