No, that's not true: Pelosi's letter to House Democrats on November 18, 2019, warned that relying on the November 2020 election to decide if President Trump should be ousted instead of impeachment hearings to \"expose the truth\" is a \"dangerous position... because the President is jeopardizing the integrity of the 2020 elections.\"\n\nShe did not write it was \"too dangerous\" to wait for the election.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by jobs-post.blogspot.com on November 19, 2019, titled \"Pelosi Tells Dems 'Too Dangerous' To Wait For Election To Decide President\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThis story claimed that Pelosi said waiting for the election to decide Trump's fate is \"too dangerous,\" which is not what the speaker wrote. This is the relevant section:\n\nThe facts are uncontested: that the President abused his power for his own personal, political benefit, at the expense of our national security interests.\n\n\n\nThe weak response to these hearings has been, \"Let the election decide.\" That dangerous position only adds to the urgency of our action, because the President is jeopardizing the integrity of the 2020 elections.\n\nPelosi never wrote that waiting for an election would be \"dangerous and risky.\" She said the hearings were important for preserving the integrity of the election, not as a substitution to a free and fair election.\n\nPresident Trump also used Pelosi's letter to claim she said it was \"dangerous to let the voters decide\" his fate. The president also falsely claimed Pelosi wanted to \"change our voting system.\"\n\nRead the full letter Speaker Pelosi sent to House Democrats:\n\nNOVEMBER 18, 2019 PRESS RELEASE\n\nDear Democratic Colleague,\n\n\n\nAs we enter this pre-Thanksgiving week, we must extend the Continuing Resolution to keep government open and advance our legislative agenda to meet the needs of the American people. \n\n\n\nThank you to the many Members who participated in our Speaker's Meeting on Jobs. The presentation of the challenges facing America's working families and the solutions presented by Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman DeFazio and Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Pallone helped advance our infrastructure legislation. The discussion on USMCA was constructive and will continue this week.\n\n\n\nAt the same time we legislate, we continue to investigate and litigate, as the impeachment inquiry proceeds.\n\n\n\nLast week, the country was impressed by the valor and patriotism of the dedicated public servants and career diplomats, appointed by the President, in speaking truth to power. This week, we will hear from additional witnesses who will courageously expose the truth and defend our democracy.\n\n\n\nThe facts are uncontested: that the President abused his power for his own personal, political benefit, at the expense of our national security interests.\n\n\n\nThe weak response to these hearings has been, \"Let the election decide.\" That dangerous position only adds to the urgency of our action, because the President is jeopardizing the integrity of the 2020 elections.\n\n\n\nThere are also some who say that no serious wrongdoing was committed, because the military assistance to Ukraine was eventually released. The fact is, the aid was only released after the whistleblower exposed the truth of the President's extortion and bribery, and the House launched a formal investigation.\n\n\n\nNone of us comes to Congress to impeach a President, but rather to make progress for America's working families. However, our first order of business is our oath to support and defend the Constitution from all enemies foreign and domestic. As such, we are custodians of the Constitution and, For The People, defenders of our democracy.\n\n\n\nThank you for your patriotic leadership.", "lang": "en"}
