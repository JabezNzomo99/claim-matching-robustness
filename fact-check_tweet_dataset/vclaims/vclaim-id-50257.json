However, we found that this is actually an old list of blood donors, which is unrelated to coronavirus and dates back to at least 2015. An archived version of the post can be found here. The Quint has edited the post to hide the numbers of the donors. The list, which contains names, blood groups and phone numbers of roughly 64 so-called plasma donors is being shared on platforms as a response to people asking for plasma donations or simply as awareness notices amid the pandemic. Plasma therapy, which uses the plasma of recovered COVID-19 patients, is one of the investigational therapies being tried in India as part of the effort to fight the virus. Recovered COVID patients' immune systems may have created antibodies that fight the novel coronavirus. These antibodies build up and can be found in plasma, the liquid part of blood.

Two of them said that they had also donated blood in recent months. V Mohan, one of the people named in the list, told The Quint that this was a group of blood donors based in Chennai, which had been made two or three years ago and said that it had nothing to do with plasma donation in the COVID context. \u201cThis list has been wrongly forwarded as a plasma donor list. So many of the volunteers have been getting calls about plasma donation that some have even had to change their numbers. Please don\u2019t forward as plasma donors, we are all normal blood donors.\u201d Therefore, it is clear that an old list of blood donors is being circulated as that of plasma donors in context of the coronavirus pandemic.", "lang": "en"}
