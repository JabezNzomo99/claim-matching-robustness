Human Rights Committee. The report spawned headlines such as this one in the Huffington Post: \u201c1 In 3 Black Males Will Go To Prison In Their Lifetime, Report Warns.\u201d\n\nBut if you actually read the report, one would see the source of the information was another report issued by the group in 2011, titled \u201cAddressing Racial Disparities in Incarceration.\u201d But this time the citation was simply \u201c(Bonczar, 2003).\u201d That ultimately led to a 2003 report issued by the Bureau of Justice Statistics and written by Thomas P. Bonczar, a Justice Department statistician.\n\nAlready, you can see there is a problem. Reporters and politicians have been treating as \u201cnew\u201d an estimate that was at least 10 years old \u2014 and citing the hard work of the Justice Department as the fresh insights of an advocacy organization.\n\nBJS officials say that the report has not been updated because of budgetary issues and time constraints, but they hope to take on the project in the next year or two. The original estimate relied on a time-consuming and difficult survey of prisoners to determine how many were in their first jail term. Although the prisoner survey was done again in 2004, no updated estimate was issued, in part because of technical reasons having to do with changes in Census Bureau methodology.\n\nIn fact, BJS reports show that 2001 represented the high point, with 3,535 black males per 100,000 U.S. (black male) residents imprisoned in state and federal prisons. The figure has steadily declined every single year since then and, as of 2013, stands at 2,805 per 100,000. In other words, the incarceration rate for black males fell 20 percent since 2001.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these numbers represent all people imprisoned as of Dec. 31 and so includes repeat offenders. So it\u2019s a different data set than the one used for the \u201c1 in 3\u201d statistic, but it does indicate that the 2001 numbers may be too high for use in 2015.\n\n\u201cThese changes suggest that rates of first incarceration may also have changed since 2001, and, consequently, that the lifetime likelihood of incarceration in prison may have changed for some groups, but it is not possible to calculate the amount of any change,\u201d Bonczar said in an interview. He added that \u201cit\u2019s likely the first lifetime incarceration rate for black males has declined. How much, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nHe noted that in 1997, an earlier version of the survey using 1991 data calculated that 28.5 percent of black males were likely to be admitted to prison in their lifetime, compared with 32.2 percent in the 2001 report. That was still significantly higher than the rates for Hispanic or white men.\n\n\u201cGiven that imprisonment rates are now on the decline, clearly the model used in the prevalence report isn\u2019t valid any longer, and when we do get enough staff to be able to pick this project up again, we probably should consider giving projections based on several possible future directions for the imprisonment rate,\u201d said E. Ann Carson, another BJS statistician.\n\nMarc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, acknowledged that with the black rate of incarceration declining since 2001, it\u2019s possible that lifetime chances might have declined by as much as 20 percent, yielding an estimate that about 1 in 4 black males can expect to end up in jail. \u201cBut even that lower figure should be highly disturbing, regardless of what one believes the causes may be,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAlthough we do a great deal of analysis of BJS data, almost all of our original sources are from BJS and we always provide the appropriate citations to make that clear. But in many cases (not just this item) the facts get reported as if we had done the original research,\u201d he said, adding that the same thing happens when the group\u2019s original research is cited by secondary sources. \u201cNot sure what the cure is for this type of sloppiness, but hope that The Fact Checker\u2019s intervention at least makes a dent in this.\u201d\n\nThe basic lesson is: Read the footnotes. Sanders and various media organizations did not do enough due diligence to understand how old these numbers are. There is certainly little justification to assert that a black male born \u201ctoday\u201d faces these odds of entering prison. At best one can say that a baby born in 2001 faced these odds \u2014 if the rate had remained the same.\n\nBut it looks as if the rate has declined, calling into question the \u201c1 in 3\u201d statistic. The actual figure is as yet unknown and still could be high. But this figure should be treated with caution until BJS produces an updated estimate. Until then, this is a Two-Pinocchio statistic.", "lang": "en"}
