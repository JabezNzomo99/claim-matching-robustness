No, that's not true, at least the vandalism part. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to educate gullible Trump supporters and Republicans about the need to actually click and read links before sharing or liking them in order to avoid being embarrassed by fans of the site later. All the events described in the article are not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by America's Last Line of Defense on February 7, 2019 titled \"BREAKING: Liberal Vandals Spray Joshua Trump's House With Racist Graffiti\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nPoor Joshua Trump was bullied in school because of his last name, so President Trump and the First Lady did the right thing: they invited him to be on camera at the State of the Union Address. While Josh fell asleep during the SOTU, Fox News says he was excited to hear President Trump's words. But the story doesn't have a happy ending. When Josh and his parents returned home, they found their house covered with racist graffiti: \"No White,\" the graffiti reads, as well as \"BLM\" -- shorthand for Black Lives Matter. According to reports from the local news station, swastikas were painted on the doorway as well.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nBut the photo illustrating the story is actually two years old and was apparently taken in Kansas, not in Delaware (where Joshua Trump actually lives according to media reports):\n\nThe site that posted the hoax comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes wearethellod.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
