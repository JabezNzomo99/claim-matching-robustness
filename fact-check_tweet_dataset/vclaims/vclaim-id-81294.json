We had completed five fact checks of Republican statements, four fact checks of Democratic claims and five neutral or analytic examinations of the issue. Reviewing these columns, the pattern is fairly clear: rhetorical overreach by Republicans; give-no-quarter spin from Democrats.\n\n2: Four Pinocchios for Obama\u2019s claim that Republicans have \u2018filibustered about 500 pieces of legislation\u2019\n\nPresident Obama made a rather striking claim at a campaign fundraising dinner \u2014 that Senate Republicans have filibustered \u201c500 pieces of legislation that would help the middle class.\u201d No matter how you do the math \u2014 or a measure a \u201cfilibuster\u201d \u2014 Obama\u2019s statement was patently false, and so he earned Four Pinocchios.\n\nWe examined a claim by Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Democrat who is challenging Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Grimes claimed that the Senate Republican leader \u201cquadrupled his net worth on the backs of hardworking Kentuckians that can\u2019t afford it.\u201d The implication was that increase in McConnell\u2019s wealth came from being on the public payroll. But Senate documents show that the increase in his reported wealth stemmed from an inheritance for McConnell\u2019s wife, former labor secretary Elaine Chao. Grimes earned Three Pinocchios.\n\n4: Rand Paul\u2019s claim there was \u2018no plane\u2019 for Special Ops forces in Benghazi\n\nBenghazi pops up twice on this list. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) asserted on Fox News that the White House \u201ccouldn\u2019t find a plane\u201d for Special Operations forces in Libya because they were trying to contact YouTube to remove an anti-Islam video that prompted demonstrations in the Middle East. But Paul\u2019s claim is a fantasy; there was ample aircraft for Specials Ops forces. So he earned Four Pinocchios.\n\n5: Harry Reid\u2019s claim that the Koch brothers are \u2018one of the main causes\u2019 of climate change\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid repeatedly attacks the Koch brothers, the industrialists who are funding millions of dollars in attack ads against Democrats. In an eyebrow-raising statement, he claimed that Koch Industries is \u201cone of the main causes\u201d of climate change. But actually, the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions amounts to one-third of 1 percent in the United States \u2014 and about 6/1,000th of a percent in a global context. He earned Three Pinocchios.\n\nFinally, Obamacare turns up on the list. This column looked at two outlandish claims, one by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and one in an ad for Rep. Lee Terry (R-Ky.) Paul earned Four Pinocchios for issuing a newsletter that claimed that \u201cfor every Kentuckian that has enrolled in Obamacare, 40 have been dropped from their coverage.\u201d The math was nonsensical; Kentucky has actually signed up 413,000 people, more than double the plans that were canceled. The Terry ad earned Three Pinocchios for suggesting that a constituent lost her health plan when in fact she has been able to keep it.", "lang": "en"}
