The video was shared on social media after Janmashtami i.e., August 12. Facebook user Rajendran Pillai SN posted it on August 13 (archive).\n\nThe same was shared on Twitter.\n\nAlt News has also received several fact-check requests for the video.\n\nThe woman in the video is not New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, but American Hindu member of the US Congress Tulsi Gabbard. She had tweeted the video for Janmashtami on August 11 and wished everyone for the festival.\n\nGabbard had also shared the video on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.\n\nThe clip, therefore, is falsely circulating in the name of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern who was hailed for making New Zealand COVID-19 free. It is noteworthy that after Arden\u2019s government recorded no new cases of community transmission for over 100 days, the country saw a second wave of the virus outbreak. Elections in the country, scheduled for September 19, have been delayed for four weeks. Earlier, a video of Ardern visiting a Hindu temple ahead of polls was shared with the false claim that she visited the temple after the country was declared COVID free.", "lang": "en"}
