The Supreme Court order on the playing of national anthem in cinemas led to flurry of activity in the \u201cnationalist\u201d channel\u2019s studio. \u201cAbsurd anthem controversy breaks out\u201d announced Republic TV as it manufactured and stoked an absurd controversy. Alt News counted 80+ tweets by the channel with the hashtag #AnthemFirstNoCompromise. So what was all the noise about? Did Rahul Gandhi or Owaisi really say that there is no need to stand for the national anthem?\n\nHearing the application for the recall of court\u2019s order dated Nov 30th, 2016 regarding mandatory playing of national anthem in Cinema halls, the Supreme Court had proceeded to order that the Centre may take a call on the issue one way or the other by issuing an appropriate notification/circular. Justice DY Chandrachud had posed the question to the Attorney General: People go to cinema for undiluted entertainment. Tomorrow if someone says don\u2019t wear shorts and t-shirts to cinema halls because National Anthem is being played, then where do we stop this moral policing? Should we wear our patriotism on our sleeves?\u201d The case has now been listed for January 9, 2018. The interim order, directing cinema halls across the country to play National Anthem before the start of Cinema, remains unmodified.\n\nThe context of people\u2019s reaction was the Supreme Court order and whether or not cinemas should play the national anthem. Did anyone even say that one should not stand when the national anthem is played? But that is how it unfolded in Republic TV studios. \u201cWe believe that standing up for national anthem should be mandatory. What do you think?\u201d, asked the channel\n\nIt then proceeded to declare Rahul Gandhi, Owaisi and liberals don\u2019t want to stand for national anthem. It was yet another opportunity to attack the opposition and liberals with the nationalism stick. Here are some of the questions asked by the channel:\n\nIs not standing up for the national anthem liberal?\n\nIs not standing up for the national anthem secular?\n\nIs not standing up for the national anthem intellectual?\n\nIs not standing up for the national anthem progressive?\n\nRepublic TV program played it as \u201cModi v/s Rahul-Owaisi on anthem\u201d\n\nWith Gujarat polls around the corner, the channel used it as an opportunity to show that Congress disrespected the National Anthem.\n\nWho said don\u2019t stand for the National Anthem?\n\nLet us come back to the question. What did Rahul Gandhi and Owaisi say about the national anthem? Did they say don\u2019t stand for it as Republic TV was broadcasting it? Alt News contacted both Asaduddin Owaisi and Rahul Gandhi\u2019s office to check if they ever said what Republic TV claimed.\n\nAsaduddin Owaisi was clear in his conversation with Alt News. He said that he agreed with Justice Chandrachud\u2019s observations questioning the need for wearing our patriotism on our sleeves. He repeated to Alt News what he had gone on record earlier i.e. \u201cNational Anthem must be played on Independence Day, Republic Day, opening of the parliament, official functions and other solemn occasions but why in a theater?\u201d He confirmed that at no point had he made a statement ascribed to him by Republic TV that people should not stand when national anthem is played.\n\nOwaisi\u2019s views can also be heard on this CNN-IBN video.\n\nRandeep Surjewala, In-charge Communications for Congress denied that Rahul Gandhi had made any statement about not standing for national anthem. He told Alt News in a statement that, \u201cMr. Rahul Gandhi famously said, \u2018My flag is my religion\u2019. News played by Republic is patently false and another attempt of their yellow journalism to tarnish the Congress Party and its leader by their pre-determined prejudicial agenda. Agencies like Republic TV have made a habit out of being BJP bhakts and peddle lies in garb of news\u201d.\n\nClearly neither Rahul Gandhi nor Asaduddin Owaisi had made any statement about not standing for the national anthem as claimed by Republic TV. Owaisi\u2019s words agreeing with Justice Chandrachud\u2019s criticism regarding the need to play the anthem in theaters were twisted to imply that he did not want people to stand when the anthem is played. Rahul Gandhi, on the other hand had not even made a statement on this matter. Yet, Republic TV painted it as \u201cModi v/s Rahul-Owaisi on anthem\u201d in their program, accusing them of being against standing when National Anthem is played. With 80+ tweets, twitter polls, screaming anchors and shouting panelists, this absurd debate seems to be yet another propaganda ploy by Republic TV to run down the opposition. Is anyone getting fooled by such blatant lies anymore?", "lang": "en"}
