These posts have been shared over 80,000 times.\n\n\u201cFREE HORSES!!!! 52 thoroughbred horses need homes. Will go to Sugarcreek this Sat. for slaughter. Gentleman died due to COVID-19 and his son wants nothing to do with them. Most broodmares are broke and some are in foal weanling, yearlings, 2 yrs. and 3 yrs. old most are gelded. FREE and papered. Friend of the deceased is trying to find homes.(732) 618 8243 Fairhill, Md. Please copy and paste this on your status I would hate to see all these horses put down. PLEASE someone help they are FREE and papered!!!!!!!!\u201d\n\nThe appeal is not a real one. Similar text reappears online occasionally, according to several equestrian publications, sometimes with new contact details. This time, the post specifically mentions the \u201cformer owner\u201d died due to Covid-19.\n\nThe post stems from a genuine appeal made in 2011, after the owner of dozens of horses, vet Daniel C. Stearns, passed away in Ohio. A friend of his put an appeal on Facebook, saying a number of horses were destined for \u201cSugarcreek\u201d, a local livestock auction, and listing a phone number for anyone interested.\n\nAll the horses were soon rehomed.\n\nThe fact checking organisation Snopes reported that in 2012, a version of the appeal circulated again, with a UK phone number attached that would charge the caller a high rate. The post has appeared with a number of different phone numbers attached over the years.", "lang": "en"}
