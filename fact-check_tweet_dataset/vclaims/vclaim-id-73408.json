To support this, it revived a report on a December 2016 speech by the chief executive where he ordered \u201cthe closure of all online gaming\u201d in the country.\n\nThe president did not say he will ban ML in his speech from three years ago, nor in any recent talk.\n\nCivskie TV swiped a 60-second clip from Eagle News\u2019s 65-second-long report on Duterte\u2019s speech on Dec. 22, 2016 after signing the General Appropriations Act of 2017. It was uploaded with the wrong context, bearing the spurious title, \u201cBREAKING NEWS: PAGSASARA NG MOBILE LEGENDS SA PINAS | INAPROBAHAN NA (Closure of Mobile Legends in the Philippines | Approved)!\u201d\n\nEagle News\u2019s story stated that Duterte\u2019s closure ban referred to online gambling. It also mentioned that then-Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre clarified after Duterte\u2019s speech that the president meant the closure of online gambling operations, which was likewise reported by other news outlets.\n\nCivskie TV\u2019s misleading post has been viewed over 49,000 times on YouTube. It has also received more than 14,200 Facebook (FB) interactions and could have reached 2.8 million netizens, with social media traffic mostly coming from the page Ormoc The City Of Beautiful People \u2665\ufe0f.\n\nOther top traffic generators to Civskie TV\u2019s upload were FB groups Mobile Legends Philippines and Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Official Philippines, where netizens shared the video asking whether the claim was true or not.\n\nThe revival of clips of Duterte\u2019s 2016 speech has also generated false FB posts, with pages and groups publishing untrue status updates and photos with text that reads: \u201cMOBILE LEGENDS will be officially BANNED in Philippines on September 5, 2020.\u201d\n\nA look through social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle shows there are at least 980 posts from FB pages and public groups in the last seven days carrying the words \u201cMobile Legends,\u201d \u201cbanned\u201d and \u201cPhilippines.\u201d\n\nThe untrue claim about ML surfaced after broadcast journalist Raffy Tulfo aired his opinion in a July 17 episode of his program Raffy Tulfo in Action that governments should consider prohibiting ML, noting that it causes \u201crelationship strains\u201d, \u201cdepression\u201d and \u201chealth problems\u201d in some cases.\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
