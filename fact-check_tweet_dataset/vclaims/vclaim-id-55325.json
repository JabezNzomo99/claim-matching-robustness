No, that's not true: The scientific name for the novel coronavirus was not painted on the train, nor was a train \"carrying\" the virus, which is a nonsensical claim. This post is a hoax, and the letters were added using photo-editing software.\n\nThe claim has appeared in multiple posts (archived here), including one published on Facebook by Lu Smith on March 13, 2020. It opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this:\n\nSnopes has already debunked the claim that the train was carrying \"COVID-19.\" It concluded the photograph had been digitally manipulated.\n\nThe novel coronavirus is a viral respiratory illness and cannot be transported in trains, planes or automobiles. Nor do scientists believe it can be shipped via mail. Instead, doctors and scientists say the virus is transmitted through person-to-person contact.\n\nSome posters are suggesting that the government wants to dispense the virus on the population. If that were true, why would the trains be marked with COVID-19? The claim seems to defeat itself.\n\nThe angle of the lettering does not match the curve of the tanker trunk - a clear indication that the photo was doctored.", "lang": "en"}
