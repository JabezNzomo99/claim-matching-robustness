Both the alleged congressman and the lawyer who pointed out the 'issue'  do not exist", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Aug 9, 2018 7:39 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-26084", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/hoax-lp-congressman-typhoon-yolanda-funds-corruption-charge", "vclaim": "A lawyer named Arturo Braganza, a spokesperson of the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC), supposedly pointed out the issue. He said that Cachuela \"has no means\" to buy the said property \"based only on his income as a livestock trader.\"\n\nThe claim has been posted as early as March 2017 by 5 blogs namely realspotnews.info, aramco.netviral.com, dutertenewsglobal.info, pinoybuzzfeed.com, and dailybuzzph.com\n\n\n\nThe 2017 posts did not mention the name the alleged congressman.\n\nCachuela\u2019s name is not in the list of district representatives for the 15th Congress which is featured in the website of the House of Representatives. Comelec records show that nobody by the name of Francisco Cachuela ran in 2010 and won as representative for the 1st district of Leyte, which includes Tacloban City.\n\nHowever, there is an An Waray party list which is based in the islands of Leyte, Samar and Biliran. They held 2 seats in 2010, 2 in 2013, and 1 in 2016.\n\nThe image of the house in the 2018 post is different from the 2017 posts. Running the image through reverse image search also shows results as photographs of different suburbs. It also shows the pinoybuzzfeed.com and dailybuzzph.com posts.\n\nThe post also said that Oxfam International and World Health Organization (WHO) \"recently released\" a report that \"more than 60% of the donations to Typhoon Haiyan victims were lost and wasted.\" Oxfam confirmed to Rappler that there was \"no such report published\" by the organization.", "lang": "en"}
