Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post\n\nClaim: Rahul Gandhi: \u201cSurgical strikes and Air strikes happened during UPA government but we didn\u2019t disclose to anyone, not even to Army and Airforce\u201d. Fact: The source of the information being posted by many users on Facebook is a parody account which posts satirical and parody content. So, the claim made is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for the statements made by Rahul Gandhi on Google, a link to \u2018Limes of India\u2019 post can be found in the search results. The description of the account on Twitter shows that the account is 100% Fake, Satire, Parody and all tweets are fake. So, the content of the tweets should not be taken seriously.\n\nRahul Gandhi said in a public interaction meeting during the Rajasthan Assembly Elections that the UPA government also conducted Surgical strikes but did not disclose the information to the public. But, he did not say that the UPA government conducted strikes not even disclosing it to Army and Airforce.\n\nFinally, Rahul Gandhi\u2019s statement which was twisted by a parody account is being shared on Facebook as his statement and there isn\u2019t any truth in these posts.", "lang": "en"}
