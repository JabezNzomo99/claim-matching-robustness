I don\u2019t even know if they knew she was Russian at the time. All they had was her name. Todd: They didn\u2019t know she was Russian, I think they knew she was Russian, but ok. Giuliani: Well, they knew it when they met with her, not when they set up the meeting. You, you told me, you, you asked me, you know, did they show an intention to do anything with Russians? Well, all they knew is that a woman with a Russian name wanted to meet with them. They didn\u2019t know she was a representative of the Russian government and indeed, she\u2019s not a representative of the Russian government. So, this is much ado about nothing.\n\nIt\u2019s not true that Trump Jr. \u201cdidn\u2019t know she was a representative of the Russian government.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s recap exactly what the president\u2019s eldest son was told about the meeting.\n\nAs we have written, emails later released by Trump Jr. show that he was expecting to talk with a \u201cRussian government attorney\u201d who was going to provide \u201cvery useful\u201d information on Clinton from the Russian government.\n\nA June 3, 2016, email from music publicist Rob Goldstone said that Russian pop star Emin Agalarov had asked Goldstone to contact Trump Jr. on behalf of his father, Aras Agalarov, a Russian real estate developer who has ties to Donald Trump Sr., including his 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.\n\n\u201cThe Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,\u201d Goldstone wrote in the June 3, 2016, email. \u201cThis is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump \u2014 helped along by Aras and Emin.\u201d\n\nTrump Jr. responded minutes later, saying that \u201cif it\u2019s what you say I love it.\u201d\n\nFour days later, Goldstone emailed again to \u201cschedule a meeting with you and The Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow.\u201d Shortly after, Trump Jr. suggested a time and place for the meeting, saying, \u201cHow about 3 at our offices? Thanks rob appreciate you helping set it up.\u201d\n\nOn June 9, 2016, Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, then-Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, and Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and now senior adviser, met with Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in New York. Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian American lobbyist, Ike Kaveladze, a Russian real estate company executive, and Anatoli Samochornov, a translator and a former State Department contractor, also attended the meeting.\n\nThere is no evidence to date that shows Veselnitskaya provided any incriminating information at that Trump Tower meeting, and there is dispute over whether she is a \u201cRussian government attorney\u201d or an attorney who works closely with Russian government officials.\n\nIn testimony last year before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Veselnitskaya said, \u201cI would be honored to be an attorney of the Russian Government, but I do not work for the Government of Russia.\u201d But the Associated Press reviewed documents earlier this year that it said showed Veselnitskaya \u201cworked more closely with senior Russian government officials than she previously let on.\u201d\n\nRegardless, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the president\u2019s son agreed to the meeting after he was promised dirt on Clinton from a Russian government official \u2014 contrary to Giuliani\u2019s claim.", "lang": "en"}
