Those three, which are the three leading things on their leaflets, are simply not true\u2026 completely untrue.\u201d\n\nOne of these claims can be described as \"simply not true\". The other two cannot.\n\nWe do not send \u00a3350 million a week to the EU as a membership fee. But Turkey is a candidate to join the EU with the UK\u2019s support\u2014although very far from actually joining. And the EU treaty does allow for work towards an EU \u2018common defence\u2019 but only with the further agreement of every EU country.\n\nIt is wrong to talk about the UK sending \u00a3350 million a week to the EU. This is the amount the UK would pay as an EU membership fee if we didn\u2019t have the rebate, a discount which brings it down to \u00a3250 million a week. The rebate never leaves the country.\n\nTurkey is an official candidate country to join the EU. The UK government supports it joining the EU, and the European Commission recently talked about \u201caccelerating\u201d the process.\n\nOn the other hand, Turkey applied in 1987, it\u2019s currently got through one of 35 different sets of negotiations that have to be completed for it to join, and things haven\u2019t made much progress recently. Even if negotiations were completed, every EU country has a veto on Turkey joining, and several aren\u2019t keen.\n\nSo it\u2019s reasonable to say Turkey won\u2019t join the EU any time soon. But the referendum decision isn\u2019t time limited and saying that it\u2019s \u201ccompletely untrue\u201d to talk about Turkey joining the EU at any stage is going too far.\n\nThe EU treaty does provide for \u201cthe progressive framing of a common defence policy that might lead to a common defence\u201d. Some people are keen on an EU army, and groups of countries can work together on defence in the meantime.\n\nBut to get an EU army, every country in the EU would have to support it. The UK does not, and the government has said that \u201cthe UK will never be part of a European Army\u201d.\n\nSo the idea of an EU army has a basis in reality, but the UK government is opposed to it and can stop it.", "lang": "en"}
