The link to the supposed article leads to an image of a gorilla extending its middle finger.\n\nThe Canadian government introduced the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) in March, which provided $2,000 a month, for up to four months, for workers who had their hours reduced or lost their jobs due to COVID-19, among other measures, according to USA Today. In June, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau extended the CERB by eight weeks.\n\nA viral Facebook post claims the Canadian federal government is offering a grant of $200 a day for all Canadian citizens \u201cto stay at home to avoid the spread of COVID-19\u201d between July 8 and Aug. 8. The post then directs users to click a link to a supposed article explaining how Canadians can apply.\n\nBut the alleged article link is a hoax. The link the user provides directs people to an image of a gorilla with its middle finger extended, not an article providing more information.

Dany Morin, a spokesperson for the Canada Revenue Agency, told the Daily Caller in an email that the post was \u201cnot factually correct.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can find accurate information about benefits to help Canadians and businesses facing hardship as a result of the global COVID-19 outbreak on Canada.ca,\u201d Morin added. \u201cThe Canada Revenue Agency would like to remind Canadians to be aware of scams. Information on how Canadians can protect themselves from them can be found at Slam the scam \u2013 Protect yourself against fraud.\u201d\n\nAs of press time, Canada has over 117,500 cases of COVID-19 and some 8,900 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.", "lang": "en"}
