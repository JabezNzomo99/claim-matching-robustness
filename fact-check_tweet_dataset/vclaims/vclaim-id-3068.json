Wrong.\n\nHe also accused the CHR of bragging about probing Duterte and disputed the commission\u2019s investigative mandate. Wrong and wrong.\n\nAsked in a Feb. 13 press conference who would represent the government before the ICC should its preliminary examination on drug-related killings move forward, Calida questioned the authority of the international court to investigate the president. He said the 1987 Constitution is \u201chigher than any treaty,\u201d including the Rome Statute that created the ICC.\n\nCalida also invoked the president\u2019s immunity under the Constitution:\n\nICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda Feb. 8 her office will conduct a preliminary examination of crimes committed in the government\u2019s anti-drug campaign. The \u201cinvestigates and, where warranted, tries individuals charged with genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression.\u201d\n\nCalida said the ICC \u201chas no jurisdiction because our courts are functioning,\u201d offering as proof a pending case in the Supreme Court contesting the constitutionality of the Oplan Tokhang.\n\nDuring the press conference, Calida also turned his ire on the CHR:\n\nDuterte\u2019s immunity from suit during his tenure does not stop the ICC from investigating him.\n\nThe Rome Statute, to which the Philippines is a signatory, states:\n\nThis means presidential immunity, earlier invoked by Duterte when he threatened to kill criminals, is not an excuse from the ICC probe. (See )\n\nWhile Calida is correct in saying the ICC when local courts are functioning, the Philippines, having been a party to the Rome Statute since 2011, has a \u201cgeneral obligation to cooperate\u201d with the ICC in its investigations.\n\n\u201cWhen we suited up to be a part of the Rome Statute that established the ICC, we agreed to this international legal system of holding international criminals accountable before the world\u2019s first permanent international tribunal,\u201d said lawyer Romel Bagares in an earlier interview with VERA Files.\n\nCalida\u2019s allegation that the CHR had bragged about conducting an investigation on Duterte is also inaccurate.\n\nCHR Chairperson Chito Gascon, following Bensouda\u2019s Feb. 8 announcement, never said his office will investigate Duterte separately from the ICC probe.\n\nA report by Agence France Presse quoted Gascon saying the CHR is willing to extend help if requested by the international tribunal.\n\nContrary to Calida\u2019s claim, the CHR, though not a separate branch of government, has the power to investigate human rights violations by state and nonstate actors.\n\nThe 1987 Constitution tasks the commission to \u201cinvestigate, on its own or on complaint by any party, all forms of human rights violations involving civil and political rights.\u201d (See )\n\nThe CHR in 2016 an investigation on the alleged extrajudicial killings in the Duterte administration\u2019s war on drugs.\n\nInquirer.net.
