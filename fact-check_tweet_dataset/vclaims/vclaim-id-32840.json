But the images are older and not linked to the alleged assault; they show two unrelated events in Mexico and Cambodia. The website to first publish the claim has been the subject of a previous debunk by Snopes.\n\nOne of the misleading images appears in this article, which was first published on the Believers Portal website in July 2017 and has now resurfaced in Nigeria.\n\nThe story alleges that Muslim extremists had attacked missionaries from an organisation called Bibles For Mideast in the Middle East, without specifying a location.\n\nHeadlined \u201cMuslims beat three Christians with iron pipes for sharing bibles\u201d, the article features an image of three shackled men huddled on the ground with their faces covered.\n\nThe story has been shared more than 35,000 times on Facebook since it was first published three years ago, according to CrowdTangle, a social media monitoring tool.\n\nMost shares have been happening since December 2019 when the Believers Portal republished its 2017 story on its Facebook page.\n\nThe picture accompanying this post, shared for example here and here, shows three men on the ground being violently beaten by a stick-wielding crowd.\n\nNeither image is related to the claims made in the story.\n\nReverse image searches on Google and Yandex for the picture in the Facebook post led to this 2010 picture gallery on the Chinese news website ifeng.com.\n\nThe caption reads: \u201cOn March 26, 2010, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, angry villagers beat three captured robbers with sticks and stones, two of whom were killed. On the 25th, three robbers were arrested while robbing two women on motorcycles in the outskirts of the capital Phnom Penh.\u201d\n\nThe image and story were picked up by English news websites, including Metro which published them on March 26, 2010, with the headline \u201cFrenzied Cambodian mob kills motorcycle thieves with bamboo sticks\u201d.\n\nA reverse image search for the photo of the three shackled men led to this Reuters image taken on April 27, 2010, by Tomas Bravo.\n\nThe caption says the picture shows kidnapped victims at a ranch used by drug hitmen near the municipality of Sabinas Hidalgo in Mexico.\n\nOn June 13, 2016, a website claiming to represent evangelists secretly promoting Christianity in the Middle East posted a statement saying three of its missionaries had been attacked by Muslim extremists, without specifying a location.\n\nWithin days, the statement, published without an image, was picked up by several religious websites including here, here and here.\n\nThese stories, published in June 2016, are very similar in content and feature quotes attributed to the alleged director for Bibles for Mideast, named as pastor Paul Ciniraj.\n\nHowever, they don\u2019t feature the two misleading pictures. We\u2019ve traced their first appearance to the Believers Portal website.\n\nAFP has so far been unable to independently verify whether the attack described in the story really took place. It has contacted Bibles For Mideast via a form on its website but is yet to hear back.\n\nA Google search for Ciniraj, the alleged head of Bibles for Mideast, revealed that his name appeared in a separate debunk by the Snopes website posted on April 26, 2017.\n\nHe was cited as claiming in a post that he and other Christians were rescued from the clutches of death by a group of three lions.\n\nSnopes concluded the allegation was \u201cextremely implausible based on the few details supplied\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
