Tony Evers has laid out a series of key benchmarks for easing social distancing restrictions, dubbed the \"Badger Bounce Back\" plan.\n\nThe state is tracking data on cases, symptoms and hospital usage, but Evers has also pointed to three other logistical elements: access to personal protective gear, expanded testing and expanded contact tracing.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald homed in on the last of those while criticizing Evers in an April 26, 2020, interview with WISN-TV\u2019s \"UpFront\" program.\n\n\"We need better information. More explanations,\" said Fitzgerald, R-Juneau. \"They have no tracing program going on that we can speak of.\"\n\nContact tracing, done by public health officials, is the process of supporting patients with suspected or confirmed infections. Steps include identifying who else they had contact with, warning those other individuals and educating everyone exposed on how to protect themselves and others through isolation and other steps.\n\nIt\u2019s a fundamental element of the pandemic response, helping to identify clusters of cases early on to minimize the spread.\n\nDoes Wisconsin really have no such program \"to speak of\"?\n\nTracing ramp up hasn\u2019t always been smooth\n\nAsked for evidence of the claim, Fitzgerald spokesman Alec Zimmerman said this:\n\n\"The point he was trying to make is the same that (Wisconsin Department of Health Services) makes daily in the briefings -- tracing as it is now isn\u2019t enough.\"\n\nZimmerman noted the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported on shortcomings in the system.\n\nFor instance, the newspaper contacted 10 people who had the disease or lost loved ones within the first few weeks of the outbreak, and seven said they were never contacted by health officials as of April 23 when the story published.\n\nA story published May 1, 2020, detailed how Milwaukee has added staffing and made other changes to improve the tracing program.\n\nState and local officials have been tracing\n\nHealth officials across the nation are scrambling to add contact tracers.\n\nThe number of tracers needed for the pandemic is about double the usual need, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\n\"Public health nurses do this regularly, for example, for sexually transmitted diseases or tuberculosis,\" DHS spokeswoman Elizabeth Goodsitt said in an email. \"What is new in this space is mainly the large scale of cases and the speed at which the virus is able to spread \u2013 which means we need additional contact tracers to do this work so that we are able to reach each identified exposed person really quickly.\"\n\nDHS doesn\u2019t know how many tracers are working in Wisconsin or how many tracing investigations have been done since those efforts are lead by local health departments.\n\nDHS Deputy Secretary Julie Willems Van Dijk said at the April 28 COVID-19 media briefing that the goal is to have 1,000 contact tracers \"between the DHS surge capacity and the capacity of local health departments.\"\n\nThe state had trained 400 contact tracers as of April 30 to provide \"surge capacity\" for local health departments, Goodsitt said. The number trained was closer to 250 when Fitzgerald made his claim.\n\n\"The state surge team has been part of more than 1,100 interviews (as of April 30), which is just a fraction of calls our local public health tracers have made,\" Goodsitt said.\n\nThe number of tracers varies widely among some of the state\u2019s larger health departments.\n\nAs of April 25, the Journal Sentinel reported the Milwaukee Health Department had dedicated 19 people to tracing, about 8% of its staff (though that was up to 54 by May 1, 2020). The Washington Ozaukee Health Department had dedicated 15 people, or about 38% of its 40-person staff. CBS 58 reported April 23 that Waukesha County had 30 contact tracers.\n\nMilwaukee officials told the Journal Sentinel the initial tracing interview had been conducted within a week for 92% of all positive cases in the city, but it\u2019s an extensive process. They make about 10 contacts for every positive case.\n\nFitzgerald said Wisconsin has \"no tracing program going on that we can speak of.\"\n\nWisconsin \u2014 like every other state \u2014 is still ramping up the capacity for tracing. And there have clearly been gaps in the work so far.\n\nBut it\u2019s a significant exaggeration to summarize that as having no program when hundreds of people are doing this work around the state. Tracing was being done around the state when Fitzgerald said this, and those efforts have continued to ramp up since.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
