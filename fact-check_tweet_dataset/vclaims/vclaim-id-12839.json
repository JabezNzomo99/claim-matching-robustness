The transaction is worth 10.5 billion Euro, according to the company.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin praised the deal as the \u201cbiggest privatization deal in the world oil industry in 2016\u201d and \u201cvery beneficial\u201d for Russia\u2019s budget.\n\nThe deal, though, drew blistering criticism from the international business press, banking authorities, and financial deal experts.\n\n\u201cIt still isn't possible to determine from public records the full identities of those who bought it,\u201d Reuters wrote in a recent investigative report.\n\nThe Reuters report said an unidentified company in the Cayman Islands was involved in the deal and that its owners cannot be traced.\n\nThe Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo is talking to 14 banks to syndicate a 5.2 billion euro loan that financed part of the deal. But some of those institutions are unsure about who\u2019s behind the deal, news reports say.\n\n\u201cEuropean banks are asking questions about Rosneft's new owners,\u201d writes Russia Beyond the Headlines, an international news outlet owned by the Russian government.\n\nThe U.S. and other Western nations are investigating whether Banca Intesa is violating international sanctions placed on Russia for its takeover of Crimea.\n\nRussia\u2019s former finance minister, Alexey Kudrin, said the Rosneft deal is open to scrutiny. In comments to Russia\u2019s RBC, Kurdin said that he refuses to call the deal \u201ctransparent.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday many investors in the world are asking themselves who is the responsible party for the risks in this deal?\u201d he asked. \u201cI too do not know the answer. Obviously, the risks have been distributed somehow. But we don\u2019t see how.\u201d\n\nResponding to the cascade of criticism, Mikhail Leontiev, a spokesman for Rosneft said: \u201cThe whole market sees this deal as transparent\u2026The Fitch agency, which, excuse me, has no intimate relations with our company, declared the deal transparent in its official release.\u201d\n\nBut Fitch\u2019s Moscow representative, Maxim Edelson, told Reuters that the transparency of the deal is \u201cvery questionable.\u201d\n\nOne week later, Fitch issued a press release saying that \u201cThe ownership structure of the joint venture appears transparent: Fitch understands the joint venture that holds the stake in Rosneft is owned in equal shares by Glencore and QIA.\u201d\n\nHowever, the press release said: \u201cFitch does not rate Rosneft and therefore does not have detailed information on the transaction.\u201d\n\nThe relationship between Rosneft and Fitch was severed in February 2014 at Rosneft\u2019s request. Fitch said at that time that Rosneft did not provide sufficient information required for an adequate analysis of the company\u2019s activities.\n\nCraig Pirrong, an international finances professor at the University of Houston, told Polygraph.info via email, that public information about the December deal is seriously deficient.\n\n\u201cThis transaction was completely opaque,\u201d he said. \u201cThroughout the process crucial details were lacking, and indeed, to this day some very basic facts are unknown.\u201d\n\nAmong the lingering questions, Pirrong said, are \u201cwho is providing funding for approximately 2.2 billion euros of the stated purchase price - the difference between the purchase price and the investments by Intesa Saopaolo, Glencore, and the Qataris.\"\n\nPirrong also wondered who provided the indemnities to Glencore, what the nature of these indemnities is, and who the owners are of the Cayman Island company allegedly involved in the deal.\n\nSergey Aleksachenko, former deputy chief of Russia\u2019s Central Bank and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told Polygraph.info that the Rosneft \u201cprivatization\u201d deal is \u201cturbid,\u201d and to claim otherwise would be \u201claughable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Russian government\u2019s official version that is an equal partnership between the Glencore and QIA \u2013 does not withstand a minimal fact check,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the partnership was based on a fifty-fifty basis, why then did Qatar Investment invest 2.5 billion Euros and Glencore only 300 million Euros?\u201d", "lang": "en"}
