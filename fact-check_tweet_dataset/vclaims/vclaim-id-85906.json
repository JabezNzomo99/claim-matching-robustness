I was mentioning earlier investments in infrastructure, one of the things I left out was an investment in basic science and technology\u2026. \u201cThe same is true in biotech, the genome sciences. Huge opportunities for us to figure out what are the sources of diseases, how can we prevent them or at least intervene more quickly. Autism is a prime candidate where we have seen a skyrocketing autism rate. Nobody knows exactly why. Some people are suspicious that it\u2019s connected to the vaccines, but \u2014 this person included [pointing to person in the crowd] \u2014 the science right now is inconclusive, but we have to research it. Part of the reason I think it\u2019s very important to research it is those vaccines are also preventing huge numbers of deaths among children and preventing debilitating illnesses like polio. And so we can\u2019t afford to junk our vaccine system. We\u2019ve got to figure out why is it that this is happening so that we are starting to see a more normal, what was a normal, rate of autism. Because if we keep on seeing increases at the rate we\u2019re seeing we\u2019re never going to have enough money to provide all the special needs, special education funding that\u2019s going to be necessary.\u201d\n\nREPORTER: Because vaccines came up, it was 2008 that the president said that the science was inconclusive. So the difference now \u2014 does he believe something has changed in the research that would make that not the case? EARNEST: Well, we do know that at the time that the president was speaking, there was a study that has since been debunked that indicated that there might be some connection between autism \u2014 or increasing rates of autism and vaccines. But, like I said, since that time \u2014 I believe this was in 2010 \u2014 that study was retracted because it was completely undermined based on additional scientific data that had been presented. So, in the mind of the president, this is an issue that science has settled and that it is clearly the responsibility of parents all across the country to get their kids vaccinated for the measles.\n\n\u201cAll I can say is that we vaccinated ours. That\u2019s the best expression I can give you of my opinion. It\u2019s much more important, I think, what you think as a parent than what you think as a public official. And that\u2019s what we do. But I also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well so that\u2019s the balance that the government has to decide. But I can just tell people from our perspective, Mary Pat and I have had our children vaccinated and we think it\u2019s an important part of making sure we protect their health and the public health.\u201d\n\nSen. Paul never said that he believed the cases were directly related to vaccines. The senator said temporally and the word temporally is defined as a certain order with regards to time. The senator never used the term causally related in that interview nor the subsequent statements. I am sure you would agree that parents who have a belief, correct or incorrect scientifically, that their children\u2019s illness and affliction were caused by a vaccine or a combination of vaccines is tragic. Any child being ill is tragic and the emotional pain experienced by a parent is tragic. You are reading way too much into his comments. If you take his words at face value and don\u2019t read motives or make inferences from his statement, his statement was reasonable and not controversial. People have told him of what they believe to be cases where the administration of a vaccine had a negative outcome. Don\u2019t infer causation because he communicated what others have communicated to him.\n\nWe understand that Paul did balance his statement with comments that vaccines \u201care a good thing\u201d and that he also issued a statement saying he been misunderstood. But it is wrong to simply communicate what non-experts have said on a public health issue, because you run the risk of misleading people. That\u2019s what got former congresswoman Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) in trouble. She earned Four Pinocchios, in part because she denied she had done anything wrong \u2014 and she made the statement repeatedly.
