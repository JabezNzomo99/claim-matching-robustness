No, that's not true. The tweet did go out from a TV reporter, but it was doctored to claim that a murder investigation was underway at the nursing home - the epicenter for the Seattle-area outbreak that has state officials on high alert.\n\nThe claim surfaced in a post (archived here) where it was published on Facebook by user Cream de La Meme, with just a screen capture from 4Chan.org of the fake tweet by user Anonymous under the title \"SHIT JUST GOT SPOOKY BOYS.\" It was posted February 29, 2020, and it opened:\n\nThe doctored tweet purportedly came from TV reporter Ted Land with King 5 News in Seattle, and it claims a murder investigation was underway at a nursing home where one patient has died and several others have been sickened with the Coronavirus. The 4Chan post ended with:\n\nLand has been covering the coronavirus story as it unfolds in Washington State, but his official Twitter account shows no such reporting.\n\nThe photo in the fictional account appears to have originated with one that Land used in his original post about the Kirkland Care Center, shown here:\n\nA Twitter user called this to Land's attention, suggesting he let everyone know it was fake. Land responded, saying in a tweet: \"Wow that's concerning. Thanks for letting us know.\"\n\nThe news station was also alerted to a different fake story on its website, claiming firefighters are being quarantined after helping patients at the Kirkland home. It has since been deleted.\n\nThe post by Cream de La Meme was called out by some users as bogus:\n\nOn Cream de La Meme's About section on Facebook, it reads:\n\nThe emergence of the novel contagious illness at the Life Care Center of Kirkland has left one resident dead and four others hospitalized, with three in critical condition, local health officials said late Sunday. A health-care worker in her 40s also remained in satisfactory condition. The resident who died was a man in his 70s with underlying health conditions, officials said. Officials previously said that of the nursing home's 108 residents and 180 staff members, more than 50 have shown signs of possible COVID-19 infection.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, there have been nearly 90,000 confirmed cases of the Coronavirus documented since the outbreak in Wuhan, China. Official tracking by the organization shows there have been 3,056 deaths so far across the 67 countries where the disease has spread. Of the more than 60 cases confirmed in the United States, Bloomberg reported Monday:\n\nFour more people have died of the coronavirus in Washington state, bringing the total fatalities to six, and local officials said they're preparing to isolate large numbers of patients for what they anticipate could be a significant outbreak. The deaths have been centered around a nursing home near Seattle in Kirkland, where there are a large number of suspected patients. In total, there are at least 18 cases in the Pacific Northwest state, with at least 14 in King County and four in Snohomish County.\n\nOther fact checks by Lead Stories concerning coronavirus misinformation include:\n\u2022 Fact Check: San Diego Lab Says It Has Created Coronavirus Vaccine In Three Hours\n\u2022 Fact Check: Florida Man NOT Arrested For Robbery Using Cough As A Weapon\n\u2022 Fact Check: Lysol Products Can Kill Older Strains Of Coronavirus, But Tests Have NOT Scientifically Proven They Kill Novel Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: Hair Weaves And Lace Front Wigs Made In China NOT Likely To Contain Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: Scientists Did NOT Discover That Cocaine Kills Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: NO Evidence Coronavirus Is Bioweapon Leaked From Wuhan Lab\n\u2022 Fake News: Six Coronavirus Cases NOT Confirmed In Wichita, Kansas (Or Several Other U.S. Cities)\n\u2022 Fake News: 20 Million Chinese Did NOT Convert To Islam, And It Was NOT Proven That Coronavirus Epidemic Did Not Afflict Muslims\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Evidence To Support Claim From Bioweapons Expert Who Says Coronavirus Is Biological Warfare Weapon\n\u2022 Fake News: Popping Bubble Wrap Does NOT Expose People To Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fake News: Data From Windy.com Does NOT Show Massive Release Of Sulfur Dioxide Gas Near Wuhan\n\u2022 Fake News: Latest Research Published By Chinese Scientists Did NOT Say Coronavirus Will Render Most Male Patients Infertile\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Proof That High-Rise Buildings Have Become Human Incinerators To Combat Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fake News: Residential Building NOT In Wuhan, NOT Set Ablaze To Control Coronavirus Spread", "lang": "en"}
