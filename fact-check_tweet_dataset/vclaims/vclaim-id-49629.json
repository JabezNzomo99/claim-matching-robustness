The claim, which has been widely shared for years and in various forms, is false. Facebook told AFP that content can\u2019t be posted on an individual\u2019s wall in a way that cannot be seen by them.\n\nThis version of the post published on January 7 has garnered more than 5,300 shares on Facebook and says the content posted by hackers can be seen by a person\u2019s friends -- but not by the account-holder themselves.\n\nMultiple versions of the hoax can be seen posted here as early as 2011 and here in 2015.\n\nRudi Dicks, a senior cyber security specialist at BDO South Africa, told AFP the creators of such memes don\u2019t gain much from posting them.\n\n\u201cThese misinformation notifications have been around for as long as the internet has existed with early examples appearing in the form of mass emails which encourage you to notify everyone in your address book about \u2018misinformation\u2019. The attackers gain no benefit out of these emails other than to see their work shared on a massive scale,\u201d said Dicks.\n\nDicks said he was not aware of any proof that a post can be made on your wall that others can see but you can\u2019t. \u201cA far more common and likely scenario is that an attacker (or more often a friend) gets access to your logged-in Facebook account and posts on your wall as you,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, that would be seen as a normal post, and could be deleted by the account holder as well.\n\n \n\n A Facebook spokesperson confirmed this to AFP: \u201cThis appears to be an old meme that attempts to spread false claims. Contrary to the meme\u2019s claim, people can\u2019t post on your timeline in a way that your friends can see but you can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDicks suggests using the Facebook activity log to see everything that has been done from your account.\n\n\u201cYou should also always be careful not to click on links from unknown senders which could lead to compromise of your device or Facebook account,\u201d he added.\n\nFacebook also encourages people to report suspicious content using its Help Center.", "lang": "en"}
