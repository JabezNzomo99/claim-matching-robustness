In one such case, an image showing a gift packet is being shared on social media to insinuate that the Telangana government is distributing gifts among Muslims while no festivities are being allowed for Hindus and other religious communities. Not only is the image old, the fact that the Telangana government distributed gifts during Ramzan is also untrue. According to the claim Government of Telangana is distributing special gift among Muslims during Ramzan. \u201c\u0924\u0947\u0932\u0902\u0917\u093e\u0928\u093e \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u0932\u092e\u093e\u0928\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0930\u092e\u091c\u093c\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u093f \u0938\u094d\u092a\u0947\u0936\u0932 \u0915\u093f\u091f \u092b\u094d\u0930\u093f \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0926\u0947 \u0930\u0939\u0940 \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0942 \u0915\u0947 \u0924\u094d\u092f\u094c\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u0930\u093e\u092e\u0928\u0935\u092e\u0940,\u0939\u0928\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u091c\u092f\u0902\u0924\u0940,\u0909\u0917\u093e\u0926\u093f \u092a\u0930 \u0918\u0930 \u0938\u0947 \u092d\u0940 \u092c\u093e\u0939\u0930 \u0928\u093f\u0915\u0932\u0928\u093e \u092e\u0928\u093e \u0925\u093e,\u201d the claim reads. [Translation: Telangana government is distributing special gifts during Ramzan. On Hindu festivals such as Ramnavami and Hanuman Jayanti people were prohibitted from going out.]\n\nTo make the claim look authentic, the image of a gift packet with \u2018Eid Mubarak\u2019, \u2018Ramzan Gift\u2019 and \u2018Government of Telangana\u2019 written on it is being shared along with the text. Among those who shared the claim was Suresh Chavhanke, the Editor-in-Chief of Sudarshan News. An archived version of the Tweet can be accessed here. An archived link of the Tweet can be accessed here. An archived version of the post can be viewed here.\n\nWe divided the claim into three parts:\n\u2022 Were gifts distributed by the Telangana government during Ramzan this year?\n\u2022 Is the picture shared along with the claim authentic?\n\u2022 Does the government distribute gifts only during Ramzan? A Google search using the keywords \u201cGovernment of Telangana Ramzan Gift\u201d directed us to news reports which hinted that the image used along with the claim is as old as 2015. While we cannot ascertain when the photograph was taken, the fact that it was uploaded in 2015 makes it evident that it has been in circulation in the past. Next, we found a tweet by Krishank Manne, a leader of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti. The tweet carried a clip from a press briefing where Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao can be heard saying that this year Ramzan gifts won\u2019t be distributed. Hon'ble CM KCR made it clear in the PC ----\n\nAs people will touch the bags with their hands and there is a chance for virus to spread , Government will not be distributing Ramzan gifts for this year...\n\n\n\nWill be glad If BJP and their mouthpieces stop spreading Fake News https://t.co/7oRWANmoG5 pic.twitter.com/kmxHhgvXKC \u2014 krishanKTRS (@krishanKTRS) May 12, 2020 To confirm, we reached out to Telangana Police officials who corroborated the fact that no gifts were distributed this year due to COVID outbreak. Further, a keyword search using \u201cTelangana Government distributes gifts on festivals\u201d led us to news reports suggesting similar gifts being given to mark other festivals like Christmas and Bhatukamma. Clearly, an old image was used to propagate a false claim that the Telangana government is providing gifts for Muslims during Ramzan. This is not the first time that Sudarshan News Editor, Suresh Chavhanke has been caught spreading misinformation. The Quint has debunked multiple claims made by him in the past.
