It further claims that the family\u2019s driver has also tested positive for COVID-19. While a servant has shown symptoms, Imran Khan has tested negative.\n\nWe fact-checked the above claims and found them to be false.\n\nFirstly, we did not find any such news by Aaj Tak nor did we find anything on Imran Khan\u2019s official social media accounts.\n\nWe noticed that the layout of the viral image is significantly different from some of the bulletins on Aaj Tak\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\nFurther on the top left, the word Breaking News is cut off and reads \u201ceaking News\u201d. These mistakes lead us to the conclusion that the viral screengrab is doctored.\n\nRahul Kanwal, News Director of India Today, also took to Twitter to clarify that the screengrab is FAKE.\n\nThe above information proves that the viral image is FAKE.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
