The audio recorded by Suresh Kochattil, who describes himself as part of the social media wing of the BJP, angered many on social media as he had said the majority of the victims of the Kerala floods \u2018rich\u2019 and hence did not require food or other aid. He said that the flood victims needed electricians, plumbers and other technicians to clean and rebuild their houses.\n\nIt is important to note that Nair did not ask anyone to either redirect their relief material to any particular organisation or communalise the rescue efforts as done by other Twitter handles and Facebook posts. Nair\u2019s only request was to give the Army total freedom without any restriction, as perceived by several flood-affected victims in Kerala.\n\nBut it appears that several Twitter handles who were already upset about tweets, audio and video messages seeking to politicise and communalise the Kerala relief floods directed their anger against Nair. India Today anchor Shiv Aroor called Nair a \u2018fake\u2019, also pointing to the audio/video that had gone viral.", "lang": "en"}
