It is alleged that many of the sex crimes Epstein committed took place on the island, leading the FBI to search the island after Epstein\u2019s death.\n\nThe address in question appears if a Google search is done for \u201cLittle St James theme park.\u201d The listing has been claimed on Google, but it has not been verified. Satellite imagery of the location showed that initially, the \u201ctheme park\u201d is actually what was formerly Epstein\u2019s main compound on the island. As of the publication of this article, a second location has been added with the exact same address and business name, this one for a building on an unnamed road on the island of St. Thomas. The \u201ctheme park\u201d on Little St. James has nine reviews, all from within the last week, and the listed phone number is for \u201cSpongeBob and the Find Gary hotline.\u201d (Gary is SpongeBob\u2019s pet snail in the television show.) The number was created as part of a promotion for a SpongeBob film.\n\nGoogle has lax standards in allowing people to list businesses on Google Maps that have led to the platform being \u201coverrun with millions of false business addresses and fake names, according to advertisers, search experts and current and former Google employees\u201d as pointed out in a 2019 Wall Street Journal article. Some of these fake businesses are deliberately intended to deceive Google users, while others are done as jokes. For example, in 2015 one prankster claimed the White House was the location of their fake snowboarding shop named \"Edwards Snow Den,\" a joking reference to the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. All evidence seems to point toward SpongeBob\u2019s address being found on Epstein\u2019s island as being another one of these practical jokes. There\u2019s nothing to indicate an actual connection between SpongeBob Squarepants and Little St. James exists\u2014124 Conch Street, Bikini Bottom is the address of a pineapple under the sea, not a theme park on Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s island.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
