A government spokesman told us that\n\n\u201cFirms are not being asked if they 'back Brexit'. It's natural for any government department to want to work with firms that are positive about and focused on whatever task it is they are being asked to do.\u201d\n\nThe department in question is International Trade, which recently put two digital jobs (worth \u00a350,000 each) out to tender. In each case, there are four \u201ccultural fit criteria\u201d, together worth 15% of how a bid for the work will be evaluated. (85% is based on skills and price.)\n\nSo a company\u2019s commitment to the UK\u2019s bright future following Brexit might affect its chances of getting this work by around 4% based on this criterion.\n\nAll this is included in the Guardian\u2019s story. The headline, though, implies that this practice is widespread. It may not be. We haven\u2019t immediately been able to find any other examples on the government website.\n\nAs the fairly new Department for International Trade gets up to speed, there may be more. It\u2019s hard to assess how companies would demonstrate this commitment\u2014we\u2019ve asked the government if it can provide any further detail.", "lang": "en"}
