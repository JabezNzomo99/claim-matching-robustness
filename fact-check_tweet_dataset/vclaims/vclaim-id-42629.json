Among other points of criticism was his repeated insistence on referring to the disease as the \u201cChinese virus,\u201d despite widely-accepted public health authority guidelines that warn against naming disease outbreaks after nations or regions of the world, due to the unfounded stigmatization such names can cause.\n\nThe president used that name again during a White House briefing on March 19. Afterwards, social media users shared a photograph purportedly taken at the event, which appeared to show that Trump was even ignoring the guidance of his aides in insisting on referring to COVID-19 as the \u201cChinese virus.\u201d Washington Post photographer Jabin Botsford tweeted the following:\n\nThose images were authentic. The original, official photograph was taken by Botsford himself and published by the Getty Images agency on March 19. The website described the image as follows:\n\n\u201cA close up of President Donald J. Trump\u2019s notes shows where Corona was crossed out \u2018Corona\u2019 and replaced with \u2018Chinese\u2019 Virus as he speaks with his coronavirus task force in response to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic during a briefing in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House on Thursday, March 19, 2020 in Washington, DC.\u201d\n\nTrump did call COVID-19 the \u201cChinese virus\u201d in his March 19 remarks, although perhaps ironically, he referred to it simply as \u201cthe virus\u201d in the place where \u201cCorona\u201d had been scratched out and replaced in handwriting by \u201cChinese\u201d in his notes. As shown in the video below, he actually said at that point: \u201cAs you know, my administration is working every day to protect the American people and the American economy from the virus [\u2026]\u201d:\n\nIt\u2019s not clear who made the handwritten edit in black marker on March 19, but the handwriting style certainly appeared consistent with that seen in notes which Trump famously held in his hand as he spoke to reporters in November 2019 at the height of Congressional hearings held in advance of his own impeachment trial:", "lang": "en"}
