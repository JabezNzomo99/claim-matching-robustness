It was first shared on the platform on May 26 and had been viewed 3,200 times according to Claim Check data. It was also reported at least 4 times for containing false information.\n\nWhen asked about the veracity of the announcement, the DSWD said in a message to Rappler through its official and verified Facebook account that the Facebook link did not come from the agency.\n\nUnder the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, the DSWD is the government agency tasked to provide economic relief to Filipinos affected by the coronavirus lockdown.
