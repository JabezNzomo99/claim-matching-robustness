First, is it true that Russia does not interfere in the domestic affairs of other countries? Second, is it true that Russia is not interfering in the situation in Iran?\n\nThe answer to the first question is a clear \u201cno\u201d: Russia has been accused of -- and, in some cases, proven to have been guilty of -- interfering in the domestic affairs of a number of countries, sometimes militarily. Among those countries are Georgia, Ukraine (from which Moscow annexed Crimea), Montenegro, France, Spain, Syria and the United States and Britain.\n\nAs for Klimov\u2019s claim that Russia is not interfering in the situation in Iran, thus far there is insufficient evidence to rate it as solidly \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse.\u201d Our verdict for this claim is \u201cunclear,\u201d based on the interesting observations of Russian government-media behavior (which has been repeatedly examined and proven indicative of Kremlin\u2019s position), as well as Russia\u2019s official statements and Polygraph.info expert opinions.\n\nOn December 28, one day before the protests reportedly started spreading in Iran, the country\u2019s ambassador to Russia, Mehdi Sanai, had an audience with Russian Deputy Foreign minister Mikhail Bogdanov in Moscow. According Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry, the Iranian ambassador requested the meeting, which resulted in a \u201cconfidential exchange of opinions\u201d about the \u201cunfolding situation in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nDuring the subsequent days, Russian government-backed media reports on the situation in Iran practically mirrored reports by Iranian government media. The Russian media reports were dominated by Russian translations of statements by top Iranian officials alleging that \u201cforeign powers\u201d were behind the protests, that \u201cenemies\u201d were \u201ctrying to use any opportunity to harm the Iranian people,\u201d \u201cand repeating the claims that the \"Revolutionary Guard never caused any harm to the protesters.\u201d\n\n\u201cSupport for Iranian regime is certainly a primary driver of Russian foreign affairs,\u201d Rasool Nafisi, a Middle East expert and professor at Strayer University in Virginia, told Polygraph.info\n\nAccording to Nafisi, Russia\u2019s support for the regime was particularly visible in \u201crecent months,\u201d due to cooperation between Tehran and Moscow over Syria.\n\nHowever, Nafisi said he thought it was too early to say \u201cwhether or not the Russians are siding with the protest movement that is going on right now in Iran or siding with the government of Iran,\u201d because the future of the protests is not clear yet and they could \u201cfade away soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the protest movement takes root and becomes a serious force in Iran,\u201d Nafisi said, then the Russian government, \u201cfearing\u201d that Iran might undergo pro-Western changes, \u201cwould interfere, if not with obvious intervention like what they did in Ukraine,\u201d then by \u201cproviding weapons, providing information and certainly to support the present Iranian regime.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
