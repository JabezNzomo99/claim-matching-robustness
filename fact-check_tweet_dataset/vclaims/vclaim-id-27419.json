The right level should be zero.\u201d\n\nLast week Jeremy Corbyn warned of rat hair-laced paprika and maggoty orange juice if the UK signs a trade deal with the USA. It\u2019s been a line often used by Labour to criticise government policy.\n\nIn certain areas of food hygiene the US has less stringent rules than the EU and after Brexit the UK could move towards lower food safety standards as part of a trade deal with the US.\n\nBut illustrating this by claiming that these particular contaminants are \u201callowed\u201d in the US\u2014and implying that they\u2019re not in the UK\u2014is a misreading of the facts.\n\nThese levels are the limits at which point the US requires mandatory enforcement action to be taken against food manufacturers. Action can also be taken against manufacturers if the amount of contaminants in their food falls below these levels. There are no similar enforceable limits on levels of contaminants like this within the EU.\n\nWhat are the rules in the USA?\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines levels of contaminants in certain foodstuffs, above which it automatically takes enforcement action. It says that contamination below these levels \u201cpose no inherent hazard to health\u201d.\n\nBut describing these limits as \u201cacceptable levels\u201d is not a fully accurate description of what these levels represent.\n\nThe FDA says: \u201cIt is incorrect to assume that because the FDA has an established defect action level for a food commodity, the food manufacturer need only stay just below that level.\n\n\u201cThe levels represent limits at which FDA will regard the food product \"adulterated\"; and subject to enforcement action.\u201d\n\nThe FDA also says: \u201cPoor manufacturing practices may result in enforcement action without regard to the action level.\u201d\n\nSo essentially, if food is contaminated below those levels, enforcement action can still be taken against poor manufacturing practices. Above those levels enforcement action is mandatory.\n\nHow does this compare to the UK?\n\nLabour is making the point that the US has lower food standards when it comes to allowing contaminants like maggots in food. Barry Gardiner emphasised that \u201cthe right level should be zero\u201d.\n\nBut there are no limits in the UK or EU on what level of contamination warrants enforcement action, so implying that the level in the UK is zero is wrong.\n\nWhile maximum levels are set for various harmful chemical and biological contaminants, a Food Standards Agency spokesperson told us:\n\n\u201cIn EU Food Law there are no allowable limits of foreign bodies in food and there is no published list of \u2018tolerance\u2019 levels of foreign bodies / matter in food.\u201d\n\nThe US does have less stringent standards than the EU when it comes to certain food production protocols. For example the US uses chlorine washes and growth hormones in meat production.\n\nThe US also has different food safety processes. For example, in the EU it is mandatory for food manufacturers to a have a safety plan based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles.\n\nIn the USA this is only mandatory for some products (although juice is one such product.)\n\nIn practical terms, it\u2019s not clear how big a difference this makes. For example, the Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s Global Food Security Index scored the USA 99.4 out of 100 for food safety, just shy of the UK\u2019s perfect score.\n\nAnd to suggest that simply changing safety standards will lead to a rise in contaminants ignores a myriad of other important factors including the power of supermarkets to impose food standards on suppliers, and the likelihood that an orange juice brand known for having maggots in its products may well be forced out of business by consumer choice quicker than enforcement by the Food Standards Agency.\n\nEven putting that aside, while the prospect of maggoty orange juice is certainly unappealing, it\u2019s also worth saying that there\u2019s nothing inherently unsafe about it: it\u2019s just gross, rather than actually dangerous. The FDA standards describe the significance of these examples as \u201caesthetic\u201d rather than a \u201cpotential health hazard\u201d.\n\nIt may also be worth noting that, from figs to food colouring, many of us end up eating insect material by choice anyway.", "lang": "en"}
