He went from Head Start to Harvard. As mayor, he worked to lift up our schools. Graduation rates are up, and Providence won a national award for innovative ideas in early learning.\"\n\nWe know that schools in Providence and the state\u2019s other urban communities have higher dropout rates than schools in wealthier communities. We wondered whether graduation rates in Providence had actually gone up -- and, if so, how much Taveras had to do with it.\n\nThe Taveras campaign directed us to the Providence Public School Department\u2019s report on 2013 Graduation Rates. Based on data from the Rhode Island Department of Education, the report, issued on May 18, 2014, lists graduation rates for the past five graduating classes.\n\nThe rates for graduation in four years are:\n\nAs the report notes, the 71.4 percent graduation rate for the class of 2013 \"is the highest rate for the past five years.\" (The 2014 rate is not yet available.)\n\nAnd, in 2012-2013, all of the city\u2019s 10 high schools (eight district schools and two public charters) except for Classical and Mount Pleasant experienced a one-year increase.\n\nClassical - the largest of the 10 - dipped by 1.1 percent to 96.1 percent. Mount Pleasant\u2019s rate dipped by 1.6 percentage points to 57.4.\n\nTaveras took office in January 2011, halfway through the school year. So during his years in office, through 2013, the four-year graduation rate jumped nearly 6 percentage points.\n\nWell, there are some caveats.\n\nFirst, Providence\u2019s 2013 graduation rate of 71.4 percent is still lower than the district\u2019s own goal -- 73 percent. And it\u2019s substantially lower than the statewide average of 79.7 percent.\n\nAnd two city high schools -- Central and Mount Pleasant -- continue to lag even further behind.\n\nMount Pleasant\u2019s rate, as we\u2019ve noted, was only 57.4 percent in 2012-2013.\n\nCentral\u2019s 2013 rate did jump by more than 7 percentage points from the previous year, but it was still only 63.6 percent.\n\nAnd finally, how much credit can the mayor, who took office in January 2011, take for the graduation rate increases?\n\nIn Providence, the mayor does have more influence over the school system than mayors or town managers in other communities. The Providence mayor appoints school board members (subject to City Council approval). In most other communities, they are elected. The school committee retains administrators, including the superintendent.\n\nTaveras spokeswoman Dawn Bergantino said improved graduation rates \"don\u2019t happen overnight and are due to the hard work of many - teachers, students, community organizations and others - who are committed to the success of Providence\u2019s young people.\"\n\nShe also cited programs put in place under the mayor, for example, expanding participation in the school meals program and negotiating a slightly longer school day in the last teachers\u2019 contract.\n\nWe also asked Providence Schools Supt. Susan Lusi, who was appointed by the school board during Taveras\u2019 administration, for her insight.\n\nAcknowledging the stagnant low rates at Mount Pleasant, and Central\u2019s low (but improving) graduation rates, \"we have work to do in the district,\" she said.\n\n\"But I think we are all happy to see the data moving in the right direction, and it definitely is. There are some things we have done that will take more time to show up in the graduation rates.\"\n\nThat includes the \"Graduate Providence\" campaign that she and Taveras have led, starting in 2012, that involved visits \"to every high school,\" and meetings with parents regarding the state\u2019s graduation requirements.\n\nGuidance counselors, administrators and teachers \"met with every student regarding where they were vis a vis meeting these graduation requirements,\" and schools and families signed off on plans. Numerous academic supports were put in place, as well as work with community partners, she said.\n\nLusi also noted that dropout rates have been steadily declining. (They dropped from 16.9 percent to 12.2 percent between 2012 and 2013).\n\nTIm Duffy, executive director of the Rhode Island Association of School Committees, said, \"I think the numbers bear out that Providence has improved its graduation rate; clearly they are moving in the right direction.\"\n\nDuffy noted that the five-year graduation rates and other alternative plans \"have adapted to allow students to go [graduate] at a pace that suits the individual student a little bit more.\"\n\nA campaign video for Angel Taveras says \"Providence graduation rates are up.\"\n\nIndeed, rates have risen nearly 6 percentage points since Taveras took office.\n\nDid Taveras have a role in the increase, as the ad clearly implies? He has taken some steps to boost graduation rates, but he\u2019s been in office only three and a half years -- a caveat not mentioned in the shorthand of a 30-second video.\n\nBecause the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it .", "lang": "en"}
