The Justice Department found no evidence that the government conspired to kill King in a review of the 1999 lawsuit. The image in the post was taken roughly ten years before King\u2019s assassination.\n\nRapper Montana of 300 posted a meme Jan. 16 that falsely claims King died in the hospital from being smothered. The post includes a photo of King lying in what appears to be a hospital bed. (RELATED: Does Alabama Celebrate Robert E. Lee And Martin Luther King Jr. On The Same Day?)\n\n\u201cDid y\u2019all know that MLK didn\u2019t die from the bullet that hit him? He was killed (smothered) in the hospital,\u201d reads the meme. \u201cAlso in 1999 the US government was found guilty in a court of law of conspiring to kill him but was silenced by the media\u2026 YALL NOT READY FOR THIS TALK THO (sic).\u201d\n\nA 1979 House Select Committee on Assassinations report found King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, after being shot around 6 p.m. at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. He died roughly an hour later at St. Joseph Hospital from a \u201cgunshot wound to the chin and neck with a total transaction of the lower cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord and other structures of the neck,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThe image in the Instagram post does not depict King in the hospital after being shot that day. The photo, taken by The Associated Press in 1958, actually shows King recovering from an operation to remove a steel letter opener that a mentally unstable woman stabbed in his chest ten years earlier, according to the caption.\n\nAs evidence that King died at the hospital in a government plot, the post cites a 1999 wrongful death lawsuit brought against Memphis cafe owner Loyd Jowers by lawyer William Peppers on behalf of the King family. Jowers had claimed he hired someone other than James Earl Ray, the man who originally pleaded guilty to assassinating King but later recanted his confession, to kill King.\n\nThe jury ruled in that civil suit that Jowers and \u201cothers, including governmental agencies\u201d conspired to assassinate King.

Civil suits only need a \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d to prove the case, which lower standard than the burden of \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d in criminal cases, according to Cornell Law School.\n\n\u201cMost of the witnesses and writings offered to support the various government-directed conspiracy claims relied exclusively on secondhand and thirdhand hearsay and speculation,\u201d wrote the Justice Department. \u201cAdditionally, none of these allegations were ever linked together.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times, CNN and other media outlets covered the 1999 trial.", "lang": "en"}
