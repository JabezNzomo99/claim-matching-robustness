This is a timely topic that Congress has debated for months, and may come up again during the GOP and Democratic debates this week. Our friends at FactCheck.org have written about this, and we wanted to explore it as well using the Post\u2019s polling research and standards. How accurate is Fiorina\u2019s claim?\n\nThere is only one survey that addresses fetal tissue donations. Fox News in August asked: \u201cWhich of the following comes closer to your reaction to the [Planned Parenthood] videos?\u201d Of the respondents, 49 percent said the videos are \u201cdisturbing, and the use of fetal tissue from abortions in research should be stopped,\u201d and 43 percent answered that the videos are \u201cdisturbing, but if medical research needs this fetal tissue to save lives, it should continue.\u201d\n\nThe only supporting evidence that Fiorina\u2019s campaign sent was a Dec. 11, 2015, NewsBusters article about a Robert Morris University poll. The poll, released in October 2015, found that 53 percent of respondents strongly and somewhat supported congressional Republicans\u2019 plan to shift \u201cPlanned Parenthood federal funds to community clinics that perform the same services, but do not perform abortions.\u201d But when respondents were asked about their position on tax dollars supporting Planned Parenthood, about 25 percent identified with the view that the organization \u201cshould not receive any tax dollars.\u201d\n\nQuestion order also may have played a role in this survey\u2019s results. Immediately before the question on funding, respondents were asked whether they were aware of undercover videos \u201cshowing top Planned Parenthood officials describing the harvesting of organs of fetuses and selling them for a profit, even though this is a felony under federal law.\u201d This wording could have reduced respondents\u2019 support for funding, asked in the next question. The researcher said the questions were presented in logical order and the description of the videos is \u201centirely accurate. This is indeed what the videos show, why they are disturbing to many people, and why defunding Planned Parenthood has entered the national conversation.\u201d\n\nA quick refresher: Legislation introduced in Congress and in several states to ban abortions at 20 weeks use the \u201cpost-fertilization\u201d method (from the moment of conception) to count the age of the fetus. This is different from the more common way to date a pregnancy, as used by the medical community at large and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: from the first day of the woman\u2019s last menstrual period (\u201cLMP\u201d).\n\nFertilization takes about two weeks after the first day of LMP. That means when the bill\u2019s supporters say \u201c20 weeks,\u201d they mean 20 weeks post-fertilization. When the bill\u2019s opponents say \u201c20 weeks,\u201d they mean 20 weeks LMP, or 18 weeks post-fertilization. So when politicians talk about an abortion ban at 20 weeks or five months, they\u2019re not always talking about the same thing, and may not be referring to the same definition as the public understands it.\n\nClement could not find any question in the Roper Center Public Opinion Archive that asked about an abortion ban \u201cfor any reason at all\u201d after five months. In general, questions about the 20-week ban include exceptions for rape or incest. (The bills introduced in Congress have included exceptions for some rape and incest cases, and in cases where the abortion is necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman \u2014 though only for physical conditions, not emotional or psychological conditions.)\n\nAmericans\u2019 attitudes on abortion are highly circumstantial. Americans generally are opposed to abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy: A 2012 Gallup poll found 61 percent of Americans believe abortion should generally be legal during the first trimester, but the support dropped to 27 percent in the second trimester and 14 percent in the third trimester. (The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists defines second trimester as 14 to nearly 28 weeks LMP.) But this poll doesn\u2019t include an abortion ban after 20 weeks \u201cfor any reason.\u201d\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s unclear exactly how public opinion would stack up for abortions after 20 weeks for rape victims. But Clement said that according to the 2014 General Social Survey, 85 percent of Americans supported legal abortion if a woman\u2019s health is in danger, and 75 percent in the case of rape (73 percent for birth defect). So it\u2019s quite possible that support for such abortions stays above a majority even after 20 weeks, though no survey has asked specifically that.\n\nFiorina declares with certainty that the vast majority of Americans agree about three things: what Planned Parenthood is doing (i.e., fetal tissue donations \u2014 the practice and/or accepting reimbursement) is wrong, that Planned Parenthood should be defunded, that abortion \u201cfor any reason at all after five months\u201d should be stopped. Our review of polls that meet Washington Post standards shows that Fiorina\u2019s claim about the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Americans is a vast exaggeration \u2014 and borderline false.\n\nThere is no Post-verified polling that gets exactly at her first and third points. The polling that does relate to the videos does not show a clear majority opinion of support or opposition, though slightly more Americans were in opposition. American attitudes over 20-week abortions are circumstantial, and there is no clear majority opinion against abortions \u201cfor any reason at all after five months.\u201d And her claim that the \u201cvast majority of Americans\u201d support defunding Planned Parenthood is inaccurate. We suggest Fiorina more closely study the polling results before making such a sweeping claim.", "lang": "en"}
