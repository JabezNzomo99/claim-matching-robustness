We can look at the rate of self-inflicted deaths as well as the absolute numbers.\n\nFor every 1,000 prisoners, 1.4 ended their own life, up from 1.1 in 2015. That\u2019s also around the highest on record.\n\nSee more in our article on the state of prisons in England and Wales.\n\nThe Samaritans\u2019 helpline is available at all hours and can be contacted free on 116 123, or you can email jo@samaritans.org.", "lang": "en"}
