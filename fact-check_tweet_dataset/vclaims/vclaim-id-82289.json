The most famous \u2014 or infamous \u2014 political commercial of all time featured images of a nuclear explosion. This was the \u201cDaisy\u201d commercial aired just once by the 1964 reelection campaign of Lyndon Johnson (D). By design, the ad made no mention of his opponent, Sen. Barry Goldwater (R), but the clear implication was that a vote for Goldwater would lead to nuclear war.\n\nThis ad by the National Republican Senatorial Committee also ends with images of a nuclear holocaust\u2014 mushroom clouds as well as buildings and school buses blown to pieces. It is likely to be a template for attack ads against Democrats who supported the international agreement to restrain Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions. Not a single Republican lawmaker supported the agreement \u2014 and quite a few Democrats also opposed it. Even Democrats who supported the deal expressed misgivings and said it was a close call.\n\nWhen Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, decided to support the agreement, she, too, said she had concerns. She stressed that if the Iranians \u201cbreak this last chance at diplomacy, all options, including the use of military force, will be on the table to stop a nuclear-armed Iran. The United States will never allow a nuclear-armed Iran.\u201d She also urged that sanctions be maintained on Iran for its support of militant groups in the Middle East.\n\nIran has billions of dollars in assets that are frozen in foreign banks around the globe, and this deal would unlock those funds. No one quite knows how much money is at stake, but estimates range from $29 billion to $150 billion, with $100 billion the figure most often used. The Treasury Department has estimated that once Iran fulfills other obligations, it would have about $56 billion left.\n\nBut this may not be far-fetched. The Treasury Department in 2011 designated the entire Iranian government as a \u201cprimary money-laundering concern.\u201d Iran is estimated to have spent as much as $15 billion in 2012 and 2013 propping up the government of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, even as its economy imploded because of sanctions. So foes of the agreement have argued that the deal will make it easier for Iran to expand its regional influence through its proxies.\n\n\u201cArms controls\u201d refers to U.N. Security Council sanctions limiting nations from supplying Iran\u2019s weapon programs. Iran had wanted the sanctions lifted immediately, but as a compromise the deal called for the embargo on ballistic missiles to be lifted after a maximum of eight years. Sanctions on conventional weapons would be lifted after five years. The time frame could be shortened if the International Atomic Energy Agency determines that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was only for peaceful purposes.\n\nUnder the deal, all of Iran\u2019s declared nuclear sites, such as the Natanz uranium enrichment facility, will be under continuous monitoring by the IAEA. For 10 years, Iran will have limits on the uranium enrichment permitted at Natanz; the IAEA will be able to keep close tabs on the production. The deal also allows IAEA monitoring of Iran\u2019s centrifuge production and storage facilities, the procurement chain, and the mining and milling of uranium \u2014 verification measures that many experts say exceed those under previous negotiated nuclear deals with other nations.\n\nSo what is the ad talking about? It is referring to sites that have not been declared as nuclear, such as sensitive military locations. Under a side agreement between Iran and the IAEA, Iran will help collect samples at Parchin, which Tehran says is a conventional military facility, though the IAEA believes explosive triggers for nuclear weapons may have been tested there. The IAEA sought access to the site to determine whether there had been a military dimension to Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nNews reports have given contradictory information on what took place during a September visit to Parchin by the IAEA. Officials have said that Iranian technicians played a role in obtaining the samples \u2014 possibly without IAEA officials present \u2014 but insisted that the verification process was not compromised. Still, officials have conceded that the arrangement was a departure from the way the IAEA normally conducts inspections.\n\nUnder the accord, Iran gives up all but 300 kilograms of its enriched uranium (three percent of what it had as of May) and agrees not to produce plutonium \u2014 two routes to a nuclear weapon. It will give up a lot of nuclear equipment and has agreed to limits on uranium enrichment. But after 15 years, many of the restraints will end.\n\nReasonable people can disagree about whether this is appropriate. The Obama administration argues that even after 15 years, Iran\u2019s break-out time would be limited to one year \u2014 enough time to take action to thwart Tehran from building a nuclear weapon. But other estimates have suggested that, depending on the equipment used by Iran, the breakout time could dwindle quickly to as little as a few weeks. If correct, that would make it very difficult to halt Iran\u2019s march to a nuclear weapon \u2014 if its leaders were willing to risk international sanctions again.", "lang": "en"}
