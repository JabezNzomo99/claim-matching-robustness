A sample of the goonda like language used by Satinder Awana is as follows:\n\nThis incident purportedly happened in December 2016. This video coming out in the public domain just a few days after the marauding ABVP students thrashed other students in Ramjas college, Delhi, further cements the culture that pervades within the RSS student body.\n\nThe other striking aspect of this video is how the police just stood mum as Satinder Awana openly threatened and abused the female law faculty. With BJP in power in the centre, it is quite apparent that ABVP members now enjoy a lot of freedom to threaten/intimidate people while the Delhi Police turns a blind eye.\n\nIn fact, Delhi Police\u2019s partisan approach to ABVP has a history. It can be recalled that just over a year ago, in February 2016, three students from JNU, Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya were arrested under charges of sedition. One year has passed since then and Delhi Police is yet to file a chargesheet in any one of the aforementioned cases. In fact, even former Supreme Court judge has opined that no case of sedition can be made out in the case of these students. As opposed to urgency showed by Delhi Police in filing baseless sedition charges against the aforementioned students in JNU, it took them a full 20 days to even begin interrogating ABVP students after a JNU student called Najeeb Ahmed went missing on 15th October 2016 after a clash with ABVP students. ABVP students in case of Najeeb were finally summoned by Delhi Police on November 6th, 2016. Najeeb Ahmed continues to be missing.\n\nThis partisan approach of Delhi police towards ABVP continues with them failing to control the attack on students by ABVP members in Ramjas college and then failing to arrest those who were caught on camera assaulting the students.", "lang": "en"}
