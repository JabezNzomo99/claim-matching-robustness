Pressed on the matter by Labour MP Zarah Sultana, Mr Hancock said 16 March \u201cis when the lockdown truly started\u201d.\n\nOn 21 July, at an appearance in front of the science and technology committee, Mr Hancock said: \u201cThe idea that lockdown is a date is wrong, because actually what matters epidemiologically is the behaviour of people and you saw throughout this period, people were going about their ordinary business less and less.\u201d\n\nWhat have government ministers said?\n\nGovernment ministers, including Mr Hancock himself, have repeatedly said lockdown began on 23 March.\n\nIn a daily briefing on 1 June, Mr Hancock said the figure for deaths was the \u201clowest figure since lockdown began on 23 March\u201d. On 2 June, he told the House of Commons that he had announced the day before that the level of daily deaths \u201cis lower than at any time since lockdown began on 23 March\u201d. On 8 June, he said the level of fatalities was \u201cthe lowest number since 21 March, before lockdown began\u201d.\n\nIn a speech on 11 May, Boris Johnson referred to \u201cthe period of lockdown which started on March 23rd\u201d. This exact phrasing was echoed by housing and communities secretary Robert Jenrick two days later on 13 May, by education secretary Gavin Williamson on 16 May, by environment secretary George Eustice on 19 May, and by culture secretary Oliver Dowden on 20 May\n\nBusiness secretary Alok Sharma has repeatedly spoken of lockdown being introduced on 23 March. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab said lockdown began \u201cat the end of March\u201d in a speech on 18 May. And when announcing the need for face coverings on public transport on 4 June, transport secretary Grant Shapps said there had been significant falls in the use of public transport \u201ceven before lockdown was introduced on 23 March\u201d.\n\nMinutes from the meeting of SAGE on 16 March said there is \u201cclear evidence to support additional social distancing measures be introduced as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThe same day, Mr Hancock updated the House of Commons on the government\u2019s plan to fight coronavirus. This included a new requirement to isolate for two weeks if you or a member of your household has symptoms, and advice \u201cagainst all unnecessary social contact with others and unnecessary travel\u201d. He said people should work from home if they possibly can, and avoid pubs, clubs, cinemas and restaurants. However, he stopped short of telling people they must stay at home, or telling these businesses to close.\n\nIn a televised announcement on 23 March, Mr Johnson said: \u201cFrom this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction - you must stay at home.\u201d\n\nThis instruction included the \u201cvery limited purposes\u201d for which people were allowed to leave their homes, such as shopping for necessities, one form of exercise a day or travelling to work if they could not work from home, and banned gatherings of more than two people from different households in public. Non-essential shops were told to close, and social events including weddings were stopped. Mr Johnson warned the police could enforce the rules.", "lang": "en"}
