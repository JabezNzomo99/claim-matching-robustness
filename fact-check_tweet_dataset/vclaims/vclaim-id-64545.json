There was a water main break in a facility room, which was repaired.\n\nOn July 14, 2020, water flooded into the underwater Lincoln Tunnel, which passes under the Hudson River and connects New York and New Jersey.\n\nFrightened commuters traversing the Lincoln Tunnel, which passes under the Hudson River and connects New York and New Jersey, thought they were part of a dystopian disaster movie on the night of July 14, 2020, when water began rushing into the tunnel.\n\nThe incident caused some to fear that the Hudson River was flooding the underwater tunnel.\n\nAlthough the sight of water flooding into an underwater tunnel was no doubt scary, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which maintains the tunnel, said the water wasn\u2019t from the Hudson. Spokeswoman Amanda Kwan said in an email that the flooding was from a water main rupture in a facility room. \u201cIt was fixed and all water from the rupture has been pumped out as designed.\u201d\n\nThe year 2020 may have been beset by a number of crises, including the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and inflamed national political rhetoric, but one of those was not the Lincoln Tunnel failing and the Hudson River overtaking trapped commuters.", "lang": "en"}
