The Washington Post, too, reported that the \u201csecond meeting, undisclosed at the time, took place at a dinner for G-20 leaders.\u201d\n\nBoth stories were based on a newsletter written by Ian Bremmer, president and founder of the Eurasia Group, for the clients of his New York-based risk management company.\n\nIn a statement released on the evening of July 18, the White House confirmed that the two leaders talked at the July 7 dinner with the aid of a Russian interpreter, as the Times and Post reported. This second conversation took place only hours after the two leaders had met earlier that day in a highly anticipated and well-publicized meeting.\n\nBut Trump dismissed the reports of the second conversation as a \u201cfake news story of secret dinner with Putin,\u201d claiming the \u201cpress knew!\u201d That\u2019s misleading.\n\nThe media \u2014 the Times, Post, CNN and other major media outlets \u2014 did not describe the event as a \u201csecret dinner.\u201d They accurately described it, as the Times did, as a \u201cprivate conversation\u201d that took place at a \u201cleaders-and-spouses dinner.\u201d\n\nAnd while the media knew about the dinner, which was on the public schedule, reporters did not witness the two leaders talking because the dinner was off-limits to the press.\n\nThe president\u2019s official schedule for July 7 included a 9:45 a.m. EST meeting with Putin that lasted more than two hours and was widely covered by the media. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson attended that meeting and discussed it with the media that same day after it ended.\n\nThe president\u2019s schedule that day also included a 1 p.m. EST concert at the Elbphilharmonie followed by a \u201csocial dinner\u201d at 2:15 p.m. EST. It was at the dinner that Trump and Putin spoke for a second time.\n\nAt the time, there was no official White House acknowledgement or read out of the second conversation between the two leaders. The only media mention of it that we could find was a single sentence in a July 8 BuzzFeed article about the other G-20 countries reaffirming their support for the Paris agreement. \u201cBuzzFeed News understands that the two leaders engaged in another \u2018long chat\u2019 right after a G20 dinner on Friday night, according to a source present,\u201d the website wrote. It wasn\u2019t until July 18 that the White House confirmed that the conversation took place and only after Bremmer\u2019s report was widely picked up by the media.\n\nWhile the White House does not dispute that the two leaders spoke at the dinner, there is a disagreement over the length of the conversation.\n\nBremmer has said, based on his interviews with those present at the dinner, that the Trump-Putin private conversation lasted \u201croughly an hour.\u201d White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the conversation was brief and nothing more than \u201cpleasantries and small talk\u201d were exchanged.\n\nAs for what the press knew about the second Trump-Putin conversation, the fact is that the dinner was closed to the media \u2014 so Trump\u2019s claim that the \u201cpress knew!\u201d is puzzling. We asked the White House what the president meant, but we received no response.\n\nThe media relies on White House pool reports at such events. The print reporter assigned to pool duty that day was Washington Post reporter Abby Phillips, who filed pool reports that were distributed to the media. Phillips filed a pool report that evening that said she was in a \u201chold location\u201d during the concert and dinner. The next pool report she filed was after the dinner. She wrote, \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen POTUS in many hours but he has reached his temporary home in Hamburg.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Trump is frustrated by the media coverage of the ongoing federal investigation of Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election and whether there was any coordination between the Russians and his campaign. He frequently attacks major media outlets as \u201cfake news.\u201d But the president cannot dismiss legitimate news stories, as he is doing here, by twisting the facts.", "lang": "en"}
