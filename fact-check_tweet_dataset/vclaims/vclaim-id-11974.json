At 4:10 minutes India TV flashed an image where the PM could be seen sweeping the floor.\n\nUsing phrases of fawning, the anchor attempted to narrate the story of a boy whose life was full of struggles. He described young PM Modi as a \u201chero in the making.\u201d\n\nIndia TV, however, used a photograph of the PM that wasn\u2019t his at all.\n\nOne of the photographs used by India TV to showcase the prime minister\u2019s struggles was a morphed image. The image where PM Modi can be seen sweeping the floor was viral on the internet since the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. However, an RTI petition filed in 2016 revealed that the photograph was fake.\n\nAccording to Janta ka Reporter, the RTI reply said, \u201c\u2026It is stated while the information sought does not form part of records, it may be noted that the said photograph is morphed and the person in the photo is not Mr Narendra Modi.\u201d\n\nThe image used by India TV was, therefore a photoshopped image that has been debunked three years ago and the same was reported across mainstream media outlets. This isn\u2019t an isolated incident of India TV using incorrect information in its broadcast. Last year, the channel had incorrectly claimed that Pakistani posts of Kirpan and Pimpal were destroyed by the Indian army in an immediate retaliation to the beheading of soldiers. As it turned out, Kirpan was actually an Indian post and the army itself confirmed there was no reaction.\n\nUpdate: India TV deleted its broadcast from its English website and YouTube channel after Alt News\u2019s story. However, it can still be accessed on its Hindi website.", "lang": "en"}
