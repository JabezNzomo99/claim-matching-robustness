One challenge is that mayors are elected for three years, and PPPs have a lifespan of 20 to 25 years,\u2019 Jett said.\u201d\n\nThe PNA story did mention the 40 percent foreign ownership limit, yet the quote about the Philippines performing \u201cwell\u201d does not appear in the ADB PPP Monitor as claimed.\n\nA Nov. 24 Philippine Daily Inquirer report titled \u2018ADB sees foreign ownership cap hindering further development of PPP market\u2019 used a longer version of the quote:\n\nThe quote is used at the end of the report, but unlike the PNA report, is not attributed to the PPP Monitor, only to \u201cADB.\u201d\n\nA Nov. 24 Bloomberg report contains a video interview of ADB PPP specialist Alexander Jett, who describes the Philippines as having \u201cdone well\u201d in terms of boosting investor confidence, still not a blanket claim as the PNA and PTV reports headlined:\n\nADB, ADB Launches First Annual Report Monitoring Progress of PPP Environment in Member Countries\n\n(Guided by the code of principles of the International Fact-Checking Network at Poynter, VERA Files tracks the false claims, flip-flops, misleading statements of public officials and figures, and debunks them with factual evidence.
