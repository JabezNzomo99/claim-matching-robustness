It appears to come from an article published on a satire website.\n\nThe Obama family is sometimes a target for misinformation online and, in this case, Facebook users have been sharing an article dubiously claiming Obama\u2019s daughters were \u201ccaught on camera burning US Flag at DC Protest.\u201d The link being shared leads to a photo of Obama and his daughters, as well as another link that directs users to the full article.\n\n\u201cIn a show of anti-American sentiment which will surprise precisely nobody, Sasha and Malia Obama were allegedly caught on camera burning a us (sic) flag during a protest in Washington, DC,\u201d reads part of the June 15 article. \u201cKneeling across the road from the White House, they were seen wearing Black Lives Matter T-shirts and singing \u2018Amazing Grace\u2019 while holding hands with other protestors.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that Sasha and Malia Obama burned an American flag at a recent protest against racial injustice and police brutality in D.C. Had they done so, it would have been picked up by major media outlets, yet none have done so.
