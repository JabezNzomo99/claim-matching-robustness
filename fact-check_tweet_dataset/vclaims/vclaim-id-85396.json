I don\u2019t mind apologizing for things. But I can\u2019t apologize for the truth. I said tremendous crime is coming across. Everybody knows that\u2019s true. And it\u2019s happening all the time. So, why, when I mention, all of a sudden I\u2019m a racist. I\u2019m not a racist. I don\u2019t have a racist bone in my body.\u201d\n\nThis posed a conundrum for The Fact Checker. We had fact checked most of his statements from his news conference announcing his effort to win the GOP presidential nomination, but many of those were in the realm of domestic and international policy. We tend not to wade into fact checking incendiary comments that some might label opinion.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign pointed to data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which tracks citizenship of offenders in federal prisons by primary offense, which is the offense with the longest maximum sentence when a person is convicted of multiple offenses. Of 78,022 primary offense cases in fiscal year 2013, 38.6 percent were illegal immigrant offenders. The majority of their cases (76 percent) were immigration related. Of total primary offenses, 17.6 percent of drug trafficking offenses and 3.8 percent of sex abuse were illegal immigrants. Of 22,878 drug crime cases, 17.2 percent were illegal immigrants.\n\nBut these numbers are not indicative of general crime trends of non-citizens. Federal prisoners made up 10 percent of the total incarcerated population in the United States in 2013. When asked how the data are indicative of the Mexican government sending criminals to the United States, or that there is a crime wave coming across the border, a Trump campaign adviser said: \u201cThe data speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nResearchers found Secure Communities did not result in a meaningful reduction in the FBI\u2019s overall index crime rate or in rates of violent crimes. There were modest reductions in burglary and motor vehicle theft, not serious crimes like homicides or violent crime. (This program is now on its way out.)\n\n\u201cImmigrants in general \u2014 unauthorized immigrants in particular \u2014 are a self-selected group who generally come to the U.S. to work. And once they\u2019re here, most of them want to keep their nose down and do their business, and they\u2019re sensitive to the fact that they\u2019re vulnerable,\u201d said Marc Rosenblum, deputy director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan think tank.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to connect any crime with illegal immigration, by its nature. Drug smuggling and violent crimes do exist, but the cases are not indicative of larger trends in the immigrant population. What we do know about crime rates among non-citizens and inmates with unknown or unauthorized immigrant statuses show Trump\u2019s assertions about a crime wave are not accurate.\n\nTrump\u2019s repeated statements about immigrants and crime underscore a common public perception that crime is correlated with immigration, especially illegal immigration. But that is a misperception; no solid data support it, and the data that do exist negate it. Trump can defend himself all he wants, but the facts just are not there.", "lang": "en"}
