The unnamed PAF officer, on the other hand, expressed concern about the \"influx\" of Chinese nationals working in establishments in the country.\n\nMore, the story misleadingly uses a Getty Images photo of China's Peoples' Liberation Army soldiers marching in Hong Kong taken in 2013.\n\nMakabansa.com's false story surfaced as China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) began their joint maritime drills in China from Oct. 21 to 28.\n\nThe story also came out around the time the Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group arrested about two dozen men, including Chinese nationals, during a raid on a warehouse in Ilocos Norte province. The men were involved in telecom fraud and were preying on Chinese livingin the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom, police said.\n\nThe false could have reached over 527,000 people, and traffic from social media largely came from the pages Thinking Class of the Philippines, Democratic WARRIORS, and THE RESISTANCE - FILIPINO DISSENTING VOICES AGAINST DUTERTE REGIME.\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
