He said that there had been a reduction of 25% in local government spending, \u00a322 billion taken out of welfare spending and 17,000 fewer police officers.\n\nAlthough he didn\u2019t specify a time frame for this fall, the context seems to suggest that he meant between 2010 and 2015\u2014the period when the Liberal Democrats were in coalition with the Conservatives.\n\nThe figures Mr Marr quoted are correct. Police numbers did reduce by around 17,000 during that time. Around \u00a322 billion less was spent in real terms on social security payments than otherwise would have been the case, due to changes announced between 2010 and 2015. And council funding\u2014looking at a comparable measure including money from central government, council tax and business rates called \u201ccore spending power\u201d\u2014fell by 25% in real terms.\n\nAnalysis by the National Audit Office found that council funding in England from central government and council tax combined decreased by 25% in real terms between 2010/11 and 2015/16.\n\nThis is based on a measure called \u2018core spending power\u2019 which includes \u201cthe main streams of government funding to local authorities\u201d, money the council gets from council tax and business rates and some other funding.\n\nWe\u2019ve explained more about how these funding figures are calculated here.\n\nThe changes in welfare spending which Mr Marr quoted are based on BBC analysis of figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2014this in turn was based on policy costings from the Office for Budget Responsibility.\n\nThese figures show the results of changes to social security measures across the UK announced between 2010 and 2015. This amounted to just over \u00a322 billion less being spent on social security by 2015/16 (in 2018/19 prices) than would have been the case had the changes not occurred.\n\nBetween March 2010 (just before the Coalition entered government) and March 2015 (just before the general election that year) the number of police officers in England and Wales fell by just over 16,500. That\u2019s around 12%.\n\nPolice officer numbers peaked in 2009 at just under 144,000 and have been on a downward trend since then.\n\nThere were over 122,000 police officers in England and Wales in March 2018. These figures are all referring to full-time equivalent officers (or how many there would be if you added up all police officers\u2019 hours to create full-time roles.)", "lang": "en"}
