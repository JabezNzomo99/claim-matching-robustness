The Russian billionaire appears to be a made-up character.\n\nA widely-shared post purportedly shows a screen grab of a news article about a Russian billionaire, identified as both Vladist and Vladir Sugarin, who offered a billion dollars to James and Williams to have a \u201csuper athlete\u201d child. The headline reads, \u201cWhite Billionaire Offers $1 Billion to Breed Lebron (sic) & Serena.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeBron makes hundreds of millions. Serena makes hundreds of millions,\u201d one post credits Sugarin with saying. \u201cTheir super baby will make billions.\u201d (RELATED: Did LeBron James Wear A \u2018Same Crime\u2019 Protest T-Shirt?)\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that the financial offer described in the screen grab ever actually happened. The Daily Caller News Foundation didn\u2019t find any credible report corroborating the story. Sugarin, who Forbes does not list on its \u201cWorld\u2019s Billionaires\u201d ranking, seems to be a fictional character.\n\nThe story, previously debunked by Snopes, appears to have originated on Cream Bump Daily, a now-defunct parody news website that described itself as producing \u201csatirically funny news.\u201d\n\nYet, while Cream Bump Daily clearly disclaimed that it was satire, numerous social media users and online blogs fail to make the same disclosure. They portray the story as factual.\n\nVariations of this claim have been circulating since at least 2016, according to Snopes.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
