If you are with [President Rodrigo] Duterte then who can be against you. But if you are not with Duterte then everybody will be against you. You have been warned!\" the quote card read.\n\nThe facts: Roque did not say the quote attributed to him. In his interviews with PTV4 and ABS-CBN News Channel (ANC) on Wednesday, May 6, Roque did not issue any warning to any television network.\n\nInquirer.net also posted on its social media platforms that the quote card was manipulated. Next to the manipulated photo, Inquirer.net showed its real quote card where Roque said the shutdown order from the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) took him by surprise.\n\nIn Roque\u2019s appearance on PTV4, he also said that the shutdown of ABS-CBN \u201csaddened\u201d Malaca\u00f1ang since it would not be able to help report news and expand coverage of the government\u2019s briefings on the coronavirus pandemic response.\n\nOn Thursday, May 7, the network filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court, which included filing for an injunction and a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO). The injunction and TRO would theoretically allow ABS-CBN to go back on air.", "lang": "en"}
