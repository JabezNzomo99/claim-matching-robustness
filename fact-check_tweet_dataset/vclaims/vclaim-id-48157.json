The claim is that the woman is a critically-ill COVID-19 patient in Italy, and when she told the doctors of her final wish to hug her crying child, the doctors put a protective covering on her entire body and placed the child on her chest. Then the child at once stopped crying and the woman left the world. \u2018FACTLY\u2019 has found the image to be old and not related to any recent incident. The image was found to exist on the internet at least since 1997. So, an old image is being shared in the context of COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
