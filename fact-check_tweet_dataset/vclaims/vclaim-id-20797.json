That was the case in 2017, when news outlets around the world reported on Jiftip, an adhesive band designed to offer men an alternative to condoms during sex.\n\nIn August 2017, Inked published an article with the headline \u201cTeens seal their penis holes closed to avoid using condoms!\u201d At some point after this, probably thanks to the headline of the Inked article, the rumor mutated from an adhesive product into do-it-yourself territory, prompting a flurry of concerned e-mails to us:\n\nApparently teens are now super glue-ing their urethras shut to avoid using condoms. I hope this is fake! I saw an article on Facebook that was so outrageous I feel it had to be wrong. It states that teens are gluing their penises shut to avoid using condoms. TEENS SEAL THEIR PENIS HOLES CLOSED TO AVOID USING CONDOMS!\n\nIn August 2016, the Hong Kong-registered Sumina Global Limited registered \u201cJiftip\u201d as a trademark in the United States. Some 18 months earlier, a businessman named Momo Sumina \u2014 whose LinkedIn profile lists him as Sumina Global\u2019s marketing director \u2014 applied for a United States patent for \u201cseminal and urinary fluid emission arresting devices, systems, and methods of using the same.\u201d\n\nThis was a new version of his 2014 application for an invention that Sumina billed as \u201cUrethra Shield \u2014 Alternative to the Male Condom\u201d:\n\nA fluid emission arresting device is provided. In some embodiments, the fluid emission arresting device may comprise: a barrier layer made of a flexible material which may comprise a generally planar exterior surface and a generally planar interior surface. An adhesive layer may be applied to the interior surface of the barrier layer and may be configured to attach to the glans of the penis to position the barrier layer over the urethra opening to block fluid from exiting the urethra opening. In further embodiments, once the device is attached to the penis over the urethra opening, the barrier layer may prevent fluid from exiting the urethra so that the urethra may function as a fluid reservoir.\n\nUnited States Patent Office records suggest that the patent application has not been granted as of June 2018. In 2017, Sumina Global posted a short instructional video on how the adhesive device is purported to work:\n\nThe Jiftip web site features a shopping cart, where users can \u2014 at least in theory \u2014 purchase three Jiftip strips for $9, or ten for $24. Before completing an order, customers must agree to the following terms and conditions:\n\u2022 There is no promise of safety, not in nature, not with Jiftip products. I will not risk using it as a condom or for preventing pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections.\n\u2022 Holding the ejaculation inside may not be safe for me.\n\u2022 I will use Jiftip for novelty, pleasure, convenience, fun or entertainment purposes ONLY.\n\u2022 Sharing or giving my Jiftip to unauthorized persons/friends has consequences, and I accept full responsibility for them. On 2nd thought, I\u2019ll send them to Jiftip.com so they can accept responsibility for themselves.\n\u2022 I\u2019ll be thoughtful of any sex partners, meaning I\u2019ll get their approval before testing Jiftip with them.\n\nWhile the web site now features repeated emphatic disclaimers about the safety (or otherwise) of using Jiftip (calling it a \u201cbackup for your pullout\u201d) the makers of the product previously made bold claims about the safety of using the adhesive to have sex without a condom, variously promoting Jiftip with the slogans \u201cBareback sex without the worry\u201d and \u201cfeeling and freedom of raw sex is safe now.\u201d\n\nSumina, in his original 2014 patent application, billed his invention as an \u201calternative to the male condom.\u201d The Jiftip web site now stresses the opposite: \u201cIs Jiftip a condom alternative? NO! It\u2019s a sexual pleasure enhancement device.\u201d\n\nThe device certainly exists, as the detailed patent application and instructional videos make clear, and the online store embedded in the Jiftip web site would also suggest that the product is for sale. However, we could find no evidence, beyond the web site itself, of anyone actually having bought a pack of the adhesives.\n\nDespite the fact that Jiftip is such a novelty and has prompted global headlines and giggling coverage on countless radio talk shows, we were unable to find a single Facebook or Twitter post or photo by a member of the public who had decided to experiment with the widely-publicized product or signed up as a beta tester, nor have we found any product reviews written by journalists or published on consumer web sites. The product is not available for purchase on Amazon, eBay, or Google.\n\nThe Jiftip web site itself features two comments from men who present themselves as having either used or ordered the product. We asked the makers of Jiftip for some figures relating to sales and beta-testing signups, as well as possible plans for future retail marketing, but we did not receive a response in time for publication.\n\nWhile Jiftip does exist, the prevalence of its usage appears to have been greatly exaggerated in some news reports, and there is absolutely no evidence that \u201cteens\u201d are opting for it at all, much less at a higher rate than their older counterparts, which is probably a good thing.", "lang": "en"}
