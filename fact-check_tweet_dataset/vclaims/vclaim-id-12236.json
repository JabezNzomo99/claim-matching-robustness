The first month of 2019 has passed us by in the blink of an eye. With this being an election year, fake news factories have gone into an overdrive, spinning false and misleading narratives to further an agenda. Before we step into the second month of 2019, here's a look at some of the fake news stories WebQoof helped bust.\n\nWest Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's party, the Trinamool Congress, organised a mega opposition rally at the Kolkata's Brigade Ground on 19 January. A lot of misinformation and misleading claims were made after the rally concluded. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while addressing a rally in Dadra and Nagar Haveli's Silvassa the same day, claimed that the Opposition parties had gathered in Bengal against the BJP, where the saffron party had only 'one MLA'. However, when The Quint checked the website of the West Bengal state legislature, we found that there were three BJP MLAs in the state \u2013 Manoj Tigga, Swadhin Kumar Sarkar and Dilip Kumar Ghosh. Assuming that the prime minister meant MP, instead of MLA, we checked the Lok Sabha website to verify that as well. BJP has three MPs in the Lok Sabha \u2013 of which two are elected representatives, while one is a nominated member. SS Ahluwalia represents Darjeeling while Babul Supriyo is the BJP MP from Asansol and George Baker is the nominated anglo-Indian MP.\n\nDays after the rally, another video on social media claimed that TMC workers brandished guns to threaten people into attending the rally in Kolkata. In the video, which carried an India Today logo, a masked man can be seen pointing a gun at people, mostly women, and making them walk in a line. The small crowd can be seen carrying flags of TMC and walking in a line. While the video is true, it is actually from April 2018, when violence had engulfed Bengal ahead of panchayat polls. Violence reported across West Bengal during panchayat polls. @iindrojit joins in for more. #ITVideo\n\nMore videos: https://t.co/NounxnP7mg pic.twitter.com/q6Pgem7w6K \u2014 India Today (@IndiaToday) May 14, 2018 It had been shared to mislead people into showing as if people were forced to attend the rally at gunpoint. Meanwhile, BJP President Amit Shah, while addressing a rally in Malda, targeted Banerjee for not chanting slogans of \u2018Bharat Mata ki jai\u2019, and \u2018Vande Mataram\u2019. \"In a mahagathbandhan rally, where no one chanted \u2018Bharat Mata ki jai\u2019 and \u2018Vande Mataram\u2019, how will they benefit the country,\u201d asked Amit Shah. However, this is where Shah got his facts wrong. The three-hour long rally had ended with Banerjee asking the crowd to chant the slogans with her, including: \u201cBadal do, Dilli mein sarkar badal do (change it, change it, change the government in Delhi). Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind!\" She also chanted Vande Mataram thrice.\n\nAnother video shared on social media showed Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who was at the rally, saying, \u201cThe more I think about it, the more I am scared. If Modi and Amit Shah come back to power, then my friends, Pakistan will not remain safe.\u201d However, this claim was false as the video has been doctored to make it appear as though Kejriwal said \"Pakistan would be destroyed.\" The original footage from the Kolkata 'United India' rally \u2013 where Kejriwal was speaking \u2013 showed him saying, \"India would be destroyed if the duo was voted back to power,\u201d and not Pakistan.\n\nCongress President Rahul Gandhi\u2019s Dubai trip \u2013 coming just ahead of the general elections in May \u2013 was the subject of many fake/misreported news stories and social media posts. Among the many claims made, one was that Gandhi had a lavish \u00a31,500-breakfast at a five-star hotel, where he also reportedly consumed beef. Rahul Gandhi met Sam Pitroda led delegation today in the Hilton Banquet hall where they had \u00c2\u00a31500 Breakfast per head & discussed the Poverty pic.twitter.com/FGSHcbezcN \u2014 Rishi Bagree \u00f0\u009f\u0087\u00ae\u00f0\u009f\u0087\u00b3 (@rishibagree) January 11, 2019 A Google search about the details of the event led to a tweet put out by Congress\u2019 official Twitter handle. It revealed that breakfast was not hosted at a five-star hotel but rather at Dubai-based education entrepreneur Sunny Varkey\u2019s house. The Quint reached out to AICC Secretary Himanshu Vyas, who was also present at the venue, to clarify the details of the event. \u201cThere was no beef served at the breakfast... only continental food was served. I can confirm that Gandhi did not consume any beef there. The news is fake,\u201d he said. Another video, posted by the Facebook page 'Phir Ek Baar Modi Sarkar' claimed that Rahul Gandhi, while addressing the Indian diaspora in Dubai, said Mahatma Gandhi took the concept of non-violence from Islam. However, the video has been edited out of context to make it appear as though he had said Mahatma Gandhi was inspired by Islam. Addressing the Indian diaspora at a cricket stadium in Dubai, Rahul Gandhi commented on rising intolerance citing Mahatma Gandhi's book. In the original video, Gandhi is heard saying: \"Mahatma Gandhiji picked up the idea of non-violence from our great religions, from our great teachers. Mahatma Gandhiji picked up the idea of non-violence from ancient Indian philosophy, from Islam, from Christianity, from Judaism, from the great religion where it is clearly written that violence will not help anyone achieve anything.\"\n\nOn 2 January, two women \u2013 Bindu (42) from Koilandy and Kanakadurga (44) from Angadipuram in Malappuram district \u2013 had entered the sanctum sanctorum of the Sabarimala temple, triggering reactions across the political spectrum. However, some misleading \u2013 if not false \u2013 claims also took shape in the course of the development. Soon after Bindu and Kanakadurga entered the shrine, reports suggested that the women had links with far-left political outfit CPI(ML). However, speaking to The Quint, Kanakadurga, one of the women, clearly denied any political affiliation. \u201cI don\u2019t have any political background. Since the day the Supreme Court lifted the ban on women\u2019s entry at Sabarimala, I have wanted to go to the temple... in fact, even before,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, speaking to The Quint, KN Ramachandran, General Secretary, CPI (ML) Red Star, confirmed that Bindu Ammini was no longer associated with the party. He said: \u201cShe was a member a decade back. She was a student activist first, then she became a Kerala state committee member. However, she wanted to concentrate on her studies, so she became inactive in politics, and is now not a member of the party. She has a progressive outlook, and participates in progressive movements. But she is no longer actively involved with the party.\u201d Meanwhile, another tweet put out by the handle @PartyVillage017 claimed that a man by the name Jayarajan from Valanchery in Kerala ended his life after being \u2018heartbroken\u2019 as the two women who had entered the temple had \u2018desecrated\u2019 it. Another Ayyappa devotee commits suicide.\n\n\n\nJayarajan of Valancheri committed suicide after the desecration of the #Sabarimala temple by Maoist women activists. He is the fourth devotee to die brokenhearted in 2 months. #SabarimalaTemple is such an emotive issue here. pic.twitter.com/0tLhx7xZCv \u2014 Sabarimala keeps South India 'Hindu' (@PartyVillage017) January 3, 2019 However, Valanchery Police confirmed to The Quint that the claim was false. \u201cJayarajan did commit suicide three days ago. But his daughter has confirmed that it had nothing to do with the Sabarimala issue. Neither was he an Ayyappa devotee. He was going through financial and mental issues.\u201d\n\nAfter PM Narendra Modi was awarded the 'first-ever' Kotler Presidential Award for his 'outstanding leadership', a slugfest ensued between the Opposition and the ruling party, with the latter accusing Nehru and Indira Gandhi of awarding themselves the Bharat Ratna during their tenure as prime ministers. Conventionally, the prime minister recommends names to the president, who then accepts these nominations and confers the awards. However, following Nehru's sojourn from the Soviet Union in July 1955, where he had successfully established India as an international player in the context of the ongoing Cold War, then President Rajendra Prasad held a banquet dinner. At the dinner, Prasad announced that he would award the Bharat Ratna to Nehru. Similarly, Indira Gandhi was given the award for steering India to victory in the 14-day-long war with Pakistan over East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, whereupon then President VV Giri \"took full responsibility for conferring the honour on Indira.\"\n\nYes, Munnar Recorded Sub-Zero Temperatures But It Never Snowed A photo circulating on Twitter showed cars covered in snow, implying that it had snowed in Munnar, Kerala. The post was shared by popular cinematographer Santosh Sivan on Twitter, who claimed in his tweet that the photo was from Munnar, a popular hill station in Kerala. Munnar recorded sub-zero temperatures on 4 January, but there was no snowfall in the region. Kerala Tourism also clarified on Twitter that the photo was possibly clicked in Himachal Pradesh\u2019s Manali or some other location by a group travelling from Kerala. Sir, the photo in your tweet, we think it was shot in Manali by a group travelling from Kerala.\n\n\n\nIt didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t snow in Munnar. \u2014 Kerala Tourism (@KeralaTourism) January 8, 2019", "lang": "en"}
