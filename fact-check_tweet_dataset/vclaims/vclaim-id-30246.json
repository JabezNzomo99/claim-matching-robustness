The video has been taken from a YouTube edit that was created by someone who said it was \u201cjust for fun\u201d. The edit includes footage of a BBC newsreader and of a countdown clock.\n\nThe footage of a newsreader that appears to be from the BBC is real footage taken from a news broadcast in 2017, during which the presenter struggled to find his positioning in the studio\n\nWe don\u2019t know the details of how exactly the government would warn the public in a crisis scenario, but it would likely involve a cross-media effort.\n\nIt should also be noted that if this video was real, the UK would have at the time of publication experienced an attack. This has not happened.", "lang": "en"}
