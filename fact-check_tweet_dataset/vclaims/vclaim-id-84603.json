The statement by International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) said, \u201cIndia is ranked 100th out of 119 countries, and has the third highest score in all of Asia \u2014 only Afghanistan and Pakistan are ranked worse\u201c. It further stated, \u201cAt 31.4, India\u2019s 2017 GHI (Global Hunger Index) score is at the high end of the \u2018serious\u2019 category, and is one of the main factors pushing South Asia to the category of worst performing region on the GHI this year, followed closely by Africa South of the Sahara\u201c. This news was reported by all major mainstream media houses.\n\nWhile quoting the Business Standard article that has been underlined in the image above, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi took a dig at the ruling Government\n\nSocial media was also flooded with posts, like the one below, comparing India\u2019s GHI rank in previous years and especially 2014 as compared to 2017. The aspect that was particularly highlighted was India\u2019s GHI rank falling from 55 in 2014 to 100 in 2017.\n\nHowever, a Twitter handle Nesenag pointed out that the fact about India falling 45 ranks is incorrect. Based on the tip, we studied the GHI reports of the years 2013-2017. A plain reading of the reports of these five years would indicate that India\u2019s GHI ranking was 63 for 2013, 55 for 2014, 80 for 2015, 97 for 2016 and 100 for 2017. However, for the years prior to 2016, the reports included an additional table next to the main table which tabulated all countries which had GHI index less than 5. Only those which had a GHI index more than 5 were tabulated in the main table. Lower the GHI index, better is that country performing at feeding its citizens. The image below is the page in 2014 GHI report which shows country wise rankings and at the bottom left is the table with all the countries with GHI index less than 5.\n\nThe GHI reports starting 2016 included the countries with GHI index less than 5 in the main table thus causing a shift in the rankings. The image below is the page in 2017 GHI report which shows country wise rankings. The highlighted portion on the top of the table are the 14 countries which have GHI index less than 5. The countries with GHI greater than 5 are assigned ranks with the base rank being 15.\n\nFor the year 2013, the GHI report had a table consisting of 42 countries that had a GHI index less than 5, 44 countries in 2014 and 13 countries in 2014. Thus the correct absolute ranking for a country for the years prior to 2015 would be calculated as by adding the rank in the main table and the count of the countries whose GHI is less than 5 in that year. According to the above formula, India\u2019s GHI rank was 105 (63+42) in 2013, 99 (55+44) in 2014 and 93 (80+13) for 2015. The number of countries that were tabulated in these years also varied depending on which country\u2019s data is available. The following tweet by Nesenag details the country rankings from 2011-2017.\n\nThus, the reports by Times Now and Business Standard that claimed that India\u2019s ranking dropped by 45 places are misleading.\n\nHowever, one data point that still doesn\u2019t make sense is that the number of countries with GHI less than 5 were 44 in 2014 and changed to 13 in 2015. As we stated earlier, lesser the GHI score, better fed are the citizens of a country. While the GHI reports consistently claim that world hunger has reduced over the years, what explains the number of countries with GHI under 5 reducing drastically from 2014 to 2015, thus indicating that world hunger has somehow increased. The answer to that lies in this note on IFPRI website which states that the formula for GHI was changed in 2015 to reflect the current thinking in nutrition measurement.\n\nWhile India has not fallen 45 places in the Global Hunger Index, our rank continues to be dismal relative to other countries.", "lang": "en"}
