Here, the survivor narrated his family\u2019s experience of contracting and then recovering from the disease.\n\nIn the original interview, which ran for almost an hour and 45 minutes, the survivor said his symptoms, that made him feel like he was being \u201cpulled by death,\u201d were not relieved by any over-the-counter medication. This led him to try home remedies commonly used in the Philippines to alleviate cold, cough and flu symptoms -- drinking ginger brew, taking fresh lemon juice with honey and inhaling salt water steam.\n\nHe highlighted his experience with the steam inhalation, which he believes saved him and his family.\n\nBut in the shortened footage, Establish Your Own added the caption \u201cGamot sa COVID-19? Hindi vaccine kundi asin ([The] cure for COVID-19? Not a vaccine, but salt),\u201d making two wrong assertions; that vaccines are the same as medicines, and that inhaling salt water steam is actually the cure for the disease.\n\nVaccines do not treat diseases -- they prevent it. (See VERA FILES FACT SHEET: Five questions on COVID-19 vaccines, answered)\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States explains the basics of a vaccine:\n\n\u201c(It) stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies, exactly like it would if you were exposed to the disease. After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first.\u201d\n\nCurrently, no cure exists for the novel coronavirus. Clinical trials are underway for four existing medicines to be used as COVID-19 treatment.\n\nIn an April 22 VERA Files article disproving a similar claim that salt water steam \u201ckills\u201d COVID-19, the World Health Organization (WHO)- Philippines warned of inhaling \u201cextremely hot steam\u201d which \u201ccan be harmful, as there is a risk of burn injury.\u201d\n\nIn another VERA Files article published April 23 debunking a claim that \u201cdrinking salt water\u201d can cure the novel coronavirus, WHO-Philippines said while some home remedies may \u201cprovide comfort\u201d and alleviate COVID-19 symptoms, there is still no evidence that these can prevent or cure the disease.\n\n\u201cWHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19,\u201d WHO-Philippines added.\n\nA 2012 research from the Netherlands and a 2014 study in Spain reflect that inhaling salt water steam is not quite effective. The former also found that steam inhalation therapy has no proven benefit.\n\n\u201cUntil there is sufficient evidence, WHO cautions against recommending or administering unproven treatments to patients with COVID-19 or people self-medicating with them,\u201d WHO Philippines said.\n\nEstablish Your Own\u2019s video has been viewed more than 19,000 times.
