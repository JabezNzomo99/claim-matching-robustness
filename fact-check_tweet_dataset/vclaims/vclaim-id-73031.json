This is false; the images of \u201cdancing girls\u201d on the dress were created by fashion students, according to their college and the company that made the garment.\n\n\u201cThe press made fun of Melania's dress that she wore at the Mount Rushmore Ceremony, but it actually was designed with the \u2018scribblings and feelings\u2019 of children who had been sex trafficked. It shows Melania's love of children, and care for those that are abused,\u201d says this July 5, 2020 Facebook post.\n\nThe claim is repeated on Facebook here and here and Instagram here and here, praising the first lady for supporting victims of abuse by wearing the dress and taking aim at either the press or social media posts for criticizing it.\n\nShe wore the dress during a July 3 eve of Independence Day event at Mount Rushmore, during which her husband President Donald Trump bemoaned protests demanding racial justice but said little about an alarming resurgence of coronavirus cases.\n\nHowever, the images on the first lady\u2019s dress are not the work of children.\n\n\u201cThe continuous, spontaneous sketches of dancing girls by Central Saint Martins MA students, created during a life drawing class held at the Alexander McQueen educational space in London this year, is the source of these motifs,\u201d the fashion house said on Facebook along with a video clip of the dress.\n\nCentral Saint Martins also said the drawings were by students during a class. \u201cInspired by the resulting collective sketch formed as though one continuous line, the McQueen team transformed it into an embroidered garment for its SS20 collection,\u201d it said.\n\nNeither the college nor the fashion house made any reference to the design on the dress -- which is part of Alexander McQueen\u2019s Spring/Summer 2020 collection -- being in any way linked to child sexual abuse.\n\nAlexander McQueen continues despite the 2010 death by suicide of its eponymous founder, a British national who also worked at famed French fashion house Givenchy.", "lang": "en"}
