The claim is false; the Philippine Supreme Court said former associate justice Florenz Regalado holds the national record for the highest bar exam score; Marcos topped his class with a score of 92.35 per cent in his bar exam in 1939, according to a genuine newspaper report at the time of his graduation.\n\nThis post was published here on Facebook on September 14, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post's caption states: \u201cDid you know? The man who holds the record, until now, of having the highest score ever in the Bar exam is Ferdinand Marcos. More history @ Philippine Shocking History\u201d.\n\nFerdinand Marcos was the 10th president of the Philippines. He placed the country under martial law in 1972 and was deposed in 1986.\n\nThe post contains a photo which purportedly shows a newspaper's front page with a headline that states: \u201cU.P. TOPS BAR\u201d.\n\nU.P. refers to the University of the Philippines.\n\nBelow the banner, the masthead reads: \u201cThe Philippine Collegian\u201d.\n\nBelow the masthead, the text reads: \u201cMarcos - Bar Topnotcher - 1939\u201d.\n\nBelow this text is a photo of a young Marcos in academic dress.\n\nThe Philippine Collegian is the official student publication of the University of the Philippines Diliman campus. The paper was founded in 1922.\n\nThe claim is false; the Philippine Supreme Court told AFP the highest bar examination grade was earned by Florenz Regalado, a former associate justice of the court.\n\nIn an email, the court told AFP: \u201cTo date, Ret. Justice Florenz D. Regalado still holds the record of having the highest Bar Rating among the Bar Topnotchers\u201d.\n\nRegalado scored an average of 96.7 per cent when he took the bar exam in 1954.\n\nThe Supreme Court did not release Regalado\u2019s and Marcos\u2019 grades to AFP, saying it only provides results to the person who took the test.\n\nBut Regalado\u2019s grade is shown on the website of Philippine Senate Electoral Tribunal, a body that decides on election protests and whose members include Supreme Court justices.\n\nRegalado\u2019s profile here states: \u201cFlorenz D. Regalado (born October 13, 1928, Concepcion, Iloilo, Philippines) was the 14th Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines from July 29, 1988 to October 13, 1998. He graduated magna cum laude in 1954 from the San Beda College of Law, and received his Master of Laws degree from the University of Michigan in 1963.\n\n\u201cHe remains the record holder for the highest average in the Philippine Bar Examinations, with his 1954 mark of 96.7%.\n\n\u201cHe was a member of the Philippine Constitutional Commission of 1986 which drafted the present Constitution of the Philippines. Before becoming Associate Justice, he served as the Dean of San Beda College of Law.\u201d\n\nJoel Ariate, a researcher at the University of the Philippines who has written about Marcos\u2019 fake war medals among others, told AFP that a framed news report of Marcos topping the bar exam for his class in 1939 could be seen at the family-run Marcos museum in Batac.\n\nBatac is a city in the province of Ilocos Norte some 470 kilometers north of the capital Manila.\n\nAriate provided AFP with photos taken from Batac of a framed Philippine Collegian report, dated December 5, 1939.\n\nBelow is the photo from Ariate:\n\nThe photo Ariate showed AFP bears the same banner headline as the photo in the Facebook post, but with different elements below the masthead.\n\nBelow is a comparison of the Facebook photo (L) and the photo from Ariate (R):\n\nSeveral visitors to the Marcos museum in Batac have uploaded their own photos of the framed report by The Philippine Collegian including here, here and here.\n\nA close up photo of the framed report was uploaded here on TripAdvisor.\n\nAccording to the photos of the original news report, Marcos\u2019 bar exam average was 92.35 per cent.\n\nThe report's headline states: \"Marcos and Fernandez Lead New Lawyers.\"\n\nThe relevant portion of the framed article states: \"Again the College of Law of the State University topped the Bar examinations held last August, Ferdinand Marcos, U.P. obtained the first place with 92.35%, trailed by Ramon C. Fernandez also of U.P. and class valedictorian, in a close second with 90.25%.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot, with the average circled by AFP:", "lang": "en"}
