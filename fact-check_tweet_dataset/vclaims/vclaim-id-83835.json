The claim is false, the man in the photo painting black ink onto Modi\u2019s face is a local youth leader in Mumbai.\n\nThe misleading post has been shared repeatedly on Facebook and Twitter since it was posted on December 13.\n\nThe post contains a photograph which shows a man painting black ink onto a poster of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nBecause of the angle of the photograph and the lighting it is difficult to see the man\u2019s face clearly.\n\nThe caption in Hindi says: \u201cHe is the same Sachin Pilot, who is set to become the chief minister of Rajasthan, putting black ink on the face of Narendra Modi. Spread this extensively so that it draws attention of all the media.\u201d\n\nSachin Pilot is a Indian National Congress Party politician who was sworn in as deputy chief minister of Rajasthan on November 17, 2018.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the original video was posted on October 11, 2018 on the verified Twitter account of Youth Congress leader Satyajeet Tambe from the western state of Maharashtra.\n\nThe footage shows Tambe defacing the Modi poster as part of a protest against a fuel price hike.\n\nThe October 11 protest happened in the financial capital of Mumbai and was widely reported on by local media at the time.\n\nThe video was uploaded by Tambe with a caption in Marathi saying: \u201cModi looted through petrol, gas and diesel, there should be a ban on BJP\u2019s publicity.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
