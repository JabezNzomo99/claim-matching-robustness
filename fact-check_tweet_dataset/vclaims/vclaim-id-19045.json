But the \u00a31 billion was money that had already been promised to hospitals but which they were unable to spend previously.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-19045", "url": "https://fullfact.org/health/nhs-money-new-or-not/", "vclaim": "Money for the NHS: is it new or not?\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care has announced that \u201cMore beds, new cutting-edge equipment and additional wards will be delivered at hospitals across the country, as the Prime Minister confirms a new \u00a31.8 billion NHS cash injection.\u201d\n\nThis includes \u00a3850 million for 20 hospitals to receive upgrades to facilities and equipment over the next five years, and \u00a31 billion more for NHS capital funding (money for infrastructure) to be spent this year.\n\nBut debate has been sparked over whether or not this is all actually \u2018new money\u2019\u2014or whether some of it was money the NHS already had been promised but was unable to spend.\n\nExactly how you define \u2018new money\u2019 is the crucial issue here, and from whose perspective. A lot seems to hinge on how the different parties involved are interpreting its meaning.\n\nWhat have the health experts said?\n\nHealth think tank the Nuffield Trust has said that some of this money isn\u2019t new. It says the \u00a31 billion added to the NHS capital budget was actually \u201ccash hospitals and other NHS trusts already have but have been forbidden to spend. They earned it last [year] in incentive payments for cutting their costs\u201d.\n\nThis, according to the Nuffield Trust, relates to a scheme called the Provider Sustainability Fund (PSF). This scheme allowed NHS trusts that reported a surplus in their accounts, (spending less than they earned overall in the year) to receive cash rewards from the Treasury for doing so. The overall aim was to improve the financial position of the NHS and bring it out of deficit.\n\nBut once trusts had this money it couldn\u2019t be spent on the day-to-day running of hospitals (because reducing the amount spent on running costs was the aim of the scheme in the first place) so it had to be spent on capital projects instead: things like IT, equipment or new hospitals.\n\nMoney for capital spending by NHS trusts all counts towards overall capital spending by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). But because a total spending limit had been placed on DHSC capital spending, trusts then found they weren\u2019t going to be allowed spend all the PSF money once they had it.\n\nThe Health Service Journal reported that the \u00a31 billion pledge would not be \u2018new money\u2019, but rather was a reversal of those spending limits: specifically a decision in July telling trusts to reduce their capital spending by 20% in 2019/20 in order to access funds to \u201caddress critical safety issues\u201d. It subsequently published a letter from NHS England and NHS Improvement to trusts confirming that capital spending was being increased by \u00a31 billion and that they could revert to their original spending plans.\n\nThe Health Foundation, another think tank, has also reported this. It says that as a result of these spending limits NHS trusts were asked to reduce their capital spending plans by 20% and \u201cThis meant that some trusts had money available to them which they were being asked not to spend.\u201d The Health Foundation says this 20% reduction has now been reversed with the announcement of money for the NHS.\n\nAs the Health Foundation puts it, from the perspective of NHS trusts, this is \u201cmoney they'd already thought they could spend\u201d.\n\nBut the Health Foundation also says that from the Treasury\u2019s perspective it\u2019s correct that this is \u2018new money\u2019\u2014as it\u2019s an extra \u00a31 billion of spending this year that it hadn\u2019t planned for previously.\n\nThe Nuffield Trust had the same view. It told us that it \u201cwill feel like a new spending commitment for the Treasury. That is because it will no longer be able to recycle NHS trust cash stored in government coffers to fund other bits of government funding, and the total amount of money going out will therefore increase. However Mr Hancock was wrong to claim this was \u2018new money\u2019 to the NHS. From the point of view of trusts it is not.\u201d\n\nWhat has the government said?\n\nIn a number of interviews on August 5 both Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock said that the money for the NHS was \u2018new money\u2019. On Radio 5 Live Breakfast, Matt Hancock was asked about the Nuffield Trust\u2019s analysis that this was not new money and he said it was on \u201cthe wrong track\u201d and on Twitter has said \u201cit\u2019s not quite right\u201d.\n\nOn Twitter Matt Hancock later added that \u201cIt is new cash or new spending or whatever else you might want to call [it]. It\u2019s a \u00a31.8bn increase in the NHS budget... Some of it goes to unblocking spending that has been blocked because we didn\u2019t have the budget - which we now do, thanks to the new cash\u201d.\n\nHealth minister Chris Skidmore was asked on Channel 4 News whether it was untrue that the \u00a31 billion was money that NHS trusts had saved by reducing spending on services that they\u2019re now able to spend on capital projects. Mr Skidmore said \u201cit\u2019s not untrue\u201d.\n\nWe asked the Department of Health and Social Care on 6 August for more detailed information on where the money is coming from, and precisely how it relates to the Provider Sustainability Fund. The department replied to us on 29 August, saying: \u201cThe NHS has an extra \u00a31.8 billion of new funding to invest in projects, money which the NHS did not previously have to spend. This is a brand new injection of capital that enables the NHS to get on and release urgent planned investment this year. This includes \u00a3850 million which will directly fund 20 new hospital upgrades\u2014money that had not been previously allocated.\u201d\n\nThe Department did not provide us with any information that contradicted the position of the Nuffield Trust or suggested it was wrong, as the Health Secretary claimed on Twitter.\n\nIn the absence of any contradictory evidence from the department, we see no reason to doubt the conclusions of the various health expert bodies. From the perspective of NHS trusts, this is not \u2018new money\u2019\u2014it\u2019s money earned under the PSF scheme that they had previously been told they would be able to spend. From the government\u2019s perspective, it counts as \u2018new money\u2019 because the Treasury had not previously budgeted for the trusts to be able to spend all the money they had earned under the scheme.", "lang": "en"}
