President Trump has been accused of attempting to coerce Ukraine into providing damaging information about the elder Biden, Trump\u2019s potential adversary in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIvanka Trump was pointedly asked about impeachment during a Fox News interview in early October 2019, but instead of tackling the question directly, Ivanka sidestepped it by responding that she was staying focused on her duties in the White House and pushing policies through Congress that she believed would benefit the American people:\n\nHer brother Donald Jr., on the other hand, has been openly critical of the Bidens, a stance that has drawn scorn:\n\nAs Democrats claimed President Trump had been leveraging his office to push a foreign government into potentially benefiting his political campaign, Trump and his defenders attempted to shift the focus onto Biden, accusing the former vice president of using his own office to benefit his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.", "lang": "en"}
