As the crowd repeats after him, the Congress leader says, \"Brothers, repeat after me: Allah-hu-Akbar.\" The crowd chants Allah-hu-Akbar once again.\n\nHowever, while addressing a gathering in Kishanganj on April 12, 2019 Sidhu also urged the crowd to chant other slogans such as 'Jo Bole So Nihal' and 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' along with Allah-hu-Akbar.\n\nThe cropped video has been shared from several Facebook pages.\n\nBOOM checked the video of Sidhu's Kishanganj rally and found that towards the end of his speech, Sidhu raised other religious and nationalist slogans.\n\nAs the Congress leader is speaking from the dais, towards the end of the speech the crowd points out that it's the time for Azaan. To this, Sidhu says, \"Is it the time for Azaan. Okay then. Raise both hands and chant the slogans. For the Sikhs and for Muslims and then for Hindus. We'll raise all the slogans.\"\n\nSidhu then raises the slogan of Jo Bole So Nihal and the crowd chants Sat Sree Akaal. After this, the Congress leader says Allah-hu-Akbar and Bharat Mata Ki Jai, and the crowd reciprocates by repeating the same.", "lang": "en"}
