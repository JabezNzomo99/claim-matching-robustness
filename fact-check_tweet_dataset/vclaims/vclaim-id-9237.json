One expert called Manafort\u2019s remark a \u201ctotal fabrication.\u201d\n\nManafort, appearing on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d accused the media of ignoring major news stories last week and instead covering stories that were critical of Trump. He cited, for example, the extensive media coverage of Trump\u2019s comment that perhaps \u201cSecond Amendment people\u201d could stop Hillary Clinton from making Supreme Court appointments.\n\nTrump\u2019s Second Amendment comment, which he made Aug. 9, was perceived by some as a threat against Clinton. Trump later said he only meant that gun-rights supporters could deny Clinton an election victory if they mobilize to elect him. Manafort told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that \u201cyou covered this aside about the Second Amendment for three days.\u201d\n\nManafort, Aug. 14: I mean, there\u2019s plenty of news to cover this week that I haven\u2019t seen covered. You had information coming out about pay-for-play out of emails of Hillary Clinton\u2019s that weren\u2019t turned over, by the way, to the Justice Department for her investigation. That\u2019s a major news story. You had \u2014 you had the NATO base in Turkey being under attack by terrorists. You had a number of things that were appropriate to this campaign, were part of what Mr. Trump has been talking about.\n\nLet\u2019s first dispense of Manafort\u2019s comment that Clinton\u2019s emails weren\u2019t covered. They were widely covered, as Tapper said.\n\nManafort is referring to emails and other State Department documents that were released on Aug. 9 by Judicial Watch. As part of its ongoing freedom of information lawsuit against the State Department, the conservative group disclosed that it had obtained \u201c296 pages of State Department records, of which 44 email exchanges were not previously turned over to the State Department.\u201d That email release was widely covered by the media, including CNN, which reported that the emails \u201craise questions about the Clinton Foundation\u2019s influence on the State Department and its relations during her tenure\u201d as secretary of state.\n\nThe coverage may not have been as extensive as Manafort would have liked, but he was wrong to say that it wasn\u2019t covered.\n\nWhat about the failure of the media to cover a \u201cNATO base in Turkey being under attack by terrorists\u201d?\n\n\u201cThere was no terrorist attack on a NATO base in Turkey that I am aware of,\u201d Steven A. Cook, a Middle East expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, told us in an email.\n\nOther experts said the same thing. \u201cThere was no attack on the American base by anyone in Turkey,\u201d Henri J. Barkey, director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C., said in an email. \u201cTotal fabrication.\u201d\n\nWhat was Manafort talking about? We don\u2019t know because the Trump campaign did not respond to our requests for information.\n\nThere was, of course, a failed military coup in Turkey on July 15. The Turkish government claims Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who lives in self-exile in Pennsylvania, plotted the coup attempt. Turkey describes Gulen as the leader of the \u201cFethullah Terrorist Organization,\u201d and it has asked the U.S. to extradite Gulen, as the New York Times has reported.\n\nKemal Kirisci, director of the Turkey Project at the Brookings Institution, said Manafort may be referring to the coup attempt and the Fethullah Terrorist Organization, but he said the U.S. does not consider the group to be a terrorist organization.\n\n\u201cThe term \u2018terrorism\u2019 is being used these days in a very loose fashion,\u201d Kirisci told us. \u201cThe Turkish government defines this group as a terrorist organization. And in some ways it is a terrorist organization. The West does not define this group as a terrorist group.\u201d\n\nAlso, the coup attempt happened a month ago (not a week ago) and it was widely reported (not ignored by the media).\n\nThe experts with whom we consulted also told us that there were anti-American demonstrations in late July at the Incirlik Air Base in Turkey. Turkey is a NATO member, and Incirlik is sometimes misidentified as a NATO base. But it is not, Cook told us. It is operated jointly by the U.S. and Turkey.\n\nThe anti-American demonstrations sprung from the belief widely held in Turkey that the U.S. was behind the coup attempt \u201ceither directly or simply because the man widely suspected to be the leader of the conspiracy, the Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, lives in self-exile in the United States,\u201d as the New York Times explains.\n\nStars and Stripes, a Department of Defense authorized news outlet, reported that there were at least 1,000 demonstrators on July 28, but operations at the base were not disrupted. There were protests again on July 30, and this time Turkish police blocked access to the base amid inaccurate speculation of a second military coup, Stars and Stripes reported.\n\n\u201cMr. Manafort may be referring to the fact that Turkish police surrounded Incirlik airbase, which is not a NATO facility,\u201d Cook said. \u201cThat happened about 2.5 weeks ago.\u201d\n\nThe anti-U.S. demonstrations at the base did not receive much U.S. attention that we could find. But Barkey told us they were \u201cpeaceful.\u201d\n\nThere simply is no evidence that we could find of a \u201cNATO base in Turkey being under attack by terrorists,\u201d as Manafort claimed.", "lang": "en"}
