Also I have not heard or read about any news of this sort recently,\" APCC spokesman Abdul Khalique told BOOM.\n\nA search on Google with \u2018Amjat Ali Seb Congress\u2019 also does not throw up any relevant results\n\nA reverse image search of the photo of grenades lying beside some apples showed stories published on October 29, 2018 about a police encounter in Kashmir where three militants were arrested from Narbal area in the state.\n\nThe same image was published by many local news outlets in Kashmir (Read here and here). Wire agency PTI and an English daily Kashmir Observer also ran stories detailing the incident.\n\nBOOM further analysed the other two images and found the police officers in the photo wearing a dark blue uniform unlike the khaki uniform worn by Indian police forces. BOOM was able to ascertain that the policemen in the photo are from Bangladesh.\n\nLocal news stories from Bangladesh showed that the man in both photos is 28-year-old Mobarak Hossain, a Madrasa teacher arrested in May this year. Mobarak was arrested for allegedly sexually harassing a 13-year-old girl who later committed suicide, according to local news reports in Bangla (Read here and here)and English newspaper The Daily Star of Bangladesh.", "lang": "en"}
