The claim is that the boy is Sami Abu Dyak (aged \u2013 17 years) and he died in Israeli prison today due to medical negligence after being incarcerated for 11 years. Let\u2019s check the authenticity of the claim.\n\n\n\nClaim: The boy in the image is Sami Abu Dyak (aged -17 yrs) and he died in Israeli prison today due to medical negligence after being incarcerated for 11 years. Fact: The boy in the image is American actor \u2018Ian Nelson\u2019 and he is active in movies for the past 9 years. A man named \u2018Sami Abu Dyak\u2019 died of cancer in an Israeli prison but his age is 36 years. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image in the post is subjected to Google reverse image search technique, many search results were obtained.

Also, no news reports were found about his death. \n\n\n\nWhen searched about \u2018Sami Abu Dyak\u2019 on Google, many news articles about his death were found in the search results. But, he is not the one shown in the photo and his age is 36 years, not 17 years.
