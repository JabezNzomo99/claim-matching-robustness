This video is from Kalyanpur, Rajasthan, look how this woman is being harassed by her family, media should take the lead in unearthing the truth, and please share this video so that the guilty may be punished and atrocities against women may stop (This video was sent to me by a friend, you are requested to forward it).\n\nThe above message accompanies a disturbing video, showing a man slapping a young girl. Also seen in the video is another young girl crying in despair, with a toddler in her lap. The video is of disturbing nature. Alt News is not including it in the article.\n\nThe video has gone viral on Facebook, with numerous users posting it with identical text.\n\nApart from Facebook, it has also been circulated on WhatsApp.\n\nAlt News found the narrative accompanying the video is false. The video is not from Rajasthan as claimed, but from Brazil.\n\nThe language spoken in the video makes it evident it is not from India. With the use of InVid, a video verification tool, Alt News broke the relevant video clip into multiple frames. Upon reverse-searching one of the frames, we came across articles published on Brazilian websites. According to the reports, the video was recorded at Indaial, in the province of Santa Catarina in Brazil. The young girls assaulted by the man are his daughters, and was on the run soon after the video went viral in Brazil. The incident came to light in October 2019.\n\nIn the latest development, the assailant has been arrested. Investigation revealed the man had recorded the video in order to send it to his ex-wife.\n\nIt may thus be noted that the video in question is not from Kalyanpur, Rajasthan as claimed. It is from Brazil. In the past, several videos from Brazil have been passed off as incidents in India.\n\n[Update: The previous version of the article had incorrectly referred to another similar case of assault. The error is regretted.]", "lang": "en"}
