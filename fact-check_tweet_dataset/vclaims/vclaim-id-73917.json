The Hindi caption of the Facebook post reads \u201cThis is a rare photo of Bhagat Singh ji where he is seen getting flogged. And we are taught that Nehru and Gandhi had given us freedom.\u201d\n\n\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War room (AFWA) found this to be a misleading claim. The man seen in the picture getting flogged is not freedom fighter, Bhagat Singh. This picture was taken at Kasur railway station (now in Pakistan) around 1919. Singh was only 12 then and was studying at D.A.V school in Lahore. Bhagat Singh did not participate in the freedom movement and was not arrested by the British before 1920.\n\nThe archived version of the post is saved here\n\nWith the help of the reverse image search, we found a tweet posted by Kim A. Wagner in 2018. According to the Twitter bio, he is the professor of Global and imperial history at the Queen Mary University of London.\n\nThe user posted the viral image along with another image and wrote: \u201cHere are two of the photographs of public floggings at Kasur, in Punjab, that were smuggled out of India and published by Benjamin Horniman in 1920 #AmritsarMassacre.\"\n\nWe found the archive version of Benjamin Horniman\u2019s book named \u2018Amritsar and our duty to India\u2019. On the 120th page, this viral photo appears with a caption, \u201cAnother picture of an India tied to a ladder at Kasur railway station being flogged\u201d. Bhagat Singh\u2019s name is not mentioned here.\n\n\n\nWe found the same image published in an article on a website called \u201cSab Rang\u201d in 2019 on the occasion of 100 years of completion of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.\n\nThe article gave details of the documents and pictures of British era repression and torture kept in the records of the National archives and now open to the public.\n\nThe viral image also appears in the article with a caption that read \u201cFlogging in the erstwhile Punjab, 1919\u201d.\n\nAccording to the book, \u201cThe jail notebook and other writings\u201d by Bhagat Singh and annotated by Bhupender Hooja, in 1919 Bhagat Singh was only 12 and was studying in D.A.V school in Lahore.\n\nIn April 1919, only days after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre that killed thousands of unarmed Indians by the British force, Bhagat Singh visited the place. There is no information about him being flogged or arrested by British soldiers in 1919 in the book.\n\n\n\nAccording to the book \u201cDictionary of Martyrs. India\u2019s freedom struggle (1857-1947)\u201d released by the central government, Bhagat Singh actively participated in the freedom movement from the year 1920.\n\nThough we cannot ascertain the identity of the man who was seen getting flogged in the viral picture but it can be said that as per the historical evidence, it is certain that the man in the viral picture was not Bhagat Singh.", "lang": "en"}
