When the policy was announced, Labour criticised the government\u2019s prediction that the overall cost would be \u00a3100 million a year, calling the assumptions behind the figure \u201cheroic\u201d.\n\nThe total amount of tax collected from additional rate taxpayers rose from \u00a338 billion in 2012/13, to \u00a346 billion in 2013/14\u2014a rise of \u00a38 billion.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t mean that the lower tax rate has brought in \u00a38 billion in extra revenue, as experts such as tax barrister Jolyon Maugham and the Institute for Fiscal Studies have pointed out.\n\nAt least some of the \u00a38 billion rise can be explained by the \u2018deferral\u2019 of income by additional rate taxpayers between 2012/13 and 2013/14. They pushed some earnings back to 2013/14, when the 45p rate took effect, so that they would pay the lower rate of tax on it.\n\nHMRC said last year that the reduction of the additional rate of tax in April 2013 had led to the postponement or \u2018deferral\u2019 of income from 2012/13 to 2013/14. It predicted this would happen when the change was being planned, forecasting that roughly \u00a36 billion would be delayed.\n\nSo, as Mr Maugham puts it,\n\n\u201ctax receipts were in 2012-13 (because people delayed receiving income until rates fell) and were in 2013-14 (when those delayed receipts were received).\u201d\n\nHe says this delaying tactic \u201cis likely to explain most or all\u201d of the difference.\n\nThe government predicted that the rate reduction would cost \u00a3360m over five years\n\nMr Maugham argues that the best way of seeing what effect the reduction in the rate has had is by comparing receipts now to what receipts would\u2019ve been if the tax rate hadn\u2019t been reduced.\n\nThe government did some projections of this before the cut. It predicted that cutting the rate would cost \u00a3360m over five years\u2014with a loss of \u00a350 million 2013/14, \u00a3100 million in both 2014/15 and 2014/15 and \u00a3110 million in 2016/17.\n\nThose estimates include predictions of how people might change their behaviour as a result of the change. High earners were expected to increase the amount of taxable income they declared as a result of the rate reduction. These were and are still uncertain estimates.\n\nHead of the IFS, Paul Johnson, told the BBC Daily Politics earlier this week that\n\n\u201cThe best estimate is that it looks like by cutting the top rate from 50p to 45p, it might have cost you a very small amount, probably\u2026 it\u2019s not bringing in lots of additional revenue but it\u2019s probably not costing much either.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
