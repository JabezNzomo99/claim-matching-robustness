There is no record of Obama ever tweeting this.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Sept. 24 that the House would move forward with a formal impeachment inquiry after a whistleblower complaint alleged that President Donald Trump pressured the Ukrainian president into investigating Trump\u2019s political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. The Facebook post alludes to this inquiry, as well as the conspiracy theory that Obama was ineligible to be president because he wasn\u2019t born in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re at it,\u201d reads the allegedly screen-grabbed tweet, \u201cask Ukraine if they found my birth certificate.\u201d (RELATED: Did Rashida Tlaib Say, \u2018Americans Have Spent Decades Raping And Pillaging My People\u2019?)\n\nAt first glance, it could appear authentic to some. The tweet bears the Twitter handle of Obama\u2019s personal account, his current profile picture and blue verification check mark.\n\nHowever, there is no record of Obama ever tweeting this statement from his verified Twitter account. An internet search failed to turn up any evidence corroborating the tweet as well.\n\nThe 44th president is not the only politician who has fallen victim to inauthentic tweets. In recent months, Check Your Fact has debunked fake tweets believed by many to be from Trump, Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and several others.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
