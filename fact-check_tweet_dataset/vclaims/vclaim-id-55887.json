Beijing has not disclosed the causalities suffered on the Chinese side yet.\n\nAlso read No, Photo Does Not Show Indian Soldier Injured In India-China Clash\n\nThe viral clip shows injured men of the armed forces lying on the ground while a person, who is recording the incident, keeps boosting their morale. The post has been shared with a caption 'viral video from Ladakh Galwan valley Indian Army Thrashed by Chinese Army on LAC #KASHMIR'.\n\nBOOM has chosen not to include the video because of its graphic nature. However, the post can be viewed here and its archived version can be accessed here.\n\nThe same video has been shared from several Pakistani Twitter handles with the same claim.\n\n\n\nBOOM ran a reverse search on one of the key frames from the viral clip and found a Facebook post from November 2019 sharing the longer clip of the same footage.\n\nAlso read No, Video Does Not Show Col. Santosh Babu Arguing With Chinese Soldiers At Galwan\n\n\n\nThe post, shared from the profile 'Pak Army', has an Urdu caption which when translated, reads 'After the martyrdom of 1 civilian by the firing of the Indian Army in the Pakistani territory, the Pakistani army retaliated, the whole bus full of Indian troops was blown up. #Share the video and #Follow or #friend_Request for more videos Please. Thank you'.\n\n\n\nThis confirmed that the video is not related to the Galwan valley standoff between Indian and Chinese soldiers.\n\nWe further noticed that several Twitter users, in their reply to the one of the viral tweets, had mentioned that the incident is from Meghalaya and the soldiers seen in the clip 'might be the jawans of CRPF or BSF'.\n\nWe then did a keyword search with 'Meghalaya', 'BSF', 'Bus', and 'Gorge' and found several reports published in locals news portals carrying images from the accident that took place in the wee hours of October 30, 2019.\n\nAccording to news reports, the unfortunate incident took place on October 30, 2019 when an over-speeding bus fell into a 100-feet deep gorge at Umtyra in East Jaintia Hills district of Meghalaya.\n\nThe bus, carrying 20 soldiers of the Border Security Force, was requisitioned by the BSF. The co-driver lost his life in the accident while the BSF personnel and the driver were shifted to North East Indira Gandhi Regional Institute of Health and Medical Sciences, said reports.\n\nBOOM compared the images shared in the reports with screenshots from the viral video and found them to be one and the same.\n\nThis apart, the terrain shown in the viral clip does not match with the terrains of Galwan valley where the Indo-China face off reportedly took place.", "lang": "en"}
