Raj had also visited a temple, a mosque and a gurudwara, which he claims he did, to promote religious inclusivity.\n\n\n\nHowever, his visit to the church was taken out of context by many, who believed that this signified he was a Christian.\n\n\n\nBOOM also found the footage of the incident which inspired the conspiracy claiming that Raj did not believe Ayyappa to be a god.\n\n\n\nIn the footage, he is heard saying that any god that forbids women to worship is not considered a god by him, in order to extend solidarity towards women protesting for the right to enter the Sabarimala temple.", "lang": "en"}
