After initially serving in an informal capacity for the first two months, she took the formal title of \u201cfirst daughter and advisor to the president\u201d in March 2017.\n\nRecently, a story has been circulating on Facebook with the headline: \u201cBREAKING: Ivanka Trump Is Finally Being FIRED From The White House \u2014 And It Has Trump In A RAMPAGE!\u201d\n\nBut there is no breaking news about Ivanka Trump leaving the White House. Facebook users flagged the story as potentially false. The headline is false, but most of the story is based on a CNN story detailing tension in the White House over Ivanka Trump\u2019s role.\n\nThe story with the false headline originated on a group of websites that go by the name of The Political Voice. There are at least five identical sites with that name that ran the story.\n\nIt also ran on a pair of sites called Realtime Politics \u2014 which look very similar to The Political Voice \u2014 and on a site called Bernie Believers, which is registered to an owner in Macedonia. The other sites are registered through a company that hides the identity of the owner.\n\nThe Political Voice and Realtime Politics use a lot of click-bait headlines \u2014 like \u201cJUST IN: Donald Trump Just Got Hit With Some VERY Bad News About His Finances \u2013 And He\u2019s Furious!\u201d \u2014 that are attached to stories based on coverage from legitimate news sources. In that case, it was a story about Trump dropping from No. 544 to No. 766 on Forbes\u2019s list of billionaires.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nDunn Tenpas, Kathryn. \u201cWhy is Trump\u2019s staff turnover higher than the 5 most recent presidents?\u201d The Brookings Institution. 19 Jan 2018.\n\nExecutive Office of the President.
