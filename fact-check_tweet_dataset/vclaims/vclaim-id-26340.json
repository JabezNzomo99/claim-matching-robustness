On seeing people, he was running away from men towards the fields. He was later handed over to the police -translated)\u201d, reads the message posted by Facebook page Dausa Times on August 7, 2019. The video shows an angry mob pushing around a man whose hands they\u2019ve tied with a rope. In the video, a person from the mob can be heard asking the man, \u201chow many children have you butchered so far with this\u201d, while pointing to an object.\n\nThe message shared along with the video suggests that a member of a child-lifting gang was arrested by the police in Dausa district\u2019s Sikrai town, Rajasthan. Facebook page \u2013 JK Meena Saray \u2013 posted a longer version of the video taken from a different angle but shared with the identical message. The mob relentlessly inquires about an object purportedly carried by the man. Throughout the video, the man kept changing his responses which were sometimes even unrelated to the questions.\n\nMENTALLY-CHALLENGED MAN BEATEN OVER FALSE ACCUSATION OF BEING A CHILD-LIFTER\n\nOn looking for news reports from Dausa district, Rajasthan with some generic keywords, we were unable to find any. Alt News contacted Manpur police station regarding this matter. We sent the video to SHO Surendra Kumar Bakolia. He watched the clip and informed us that the man was mentally unstable. He said, \u201cThe incident took place on August 7. He was mentally unstable. He said anything in response to their questions. He was sent for a medical check-up and there were no [major] injuries. This man was later sent to an NGO based in Bharatpur which takes care of mentally challenged people.\u201d\n\nAlt News reached out to Apna Ghar, an NGO based in Bharatpur district, Rajasthan that looks after homeless and mentally challenged people. \u201cYes, a man came to us from Manpur, Dausa. He is mentally-ill. He said his name is Jaichand. He hasn\u2019t spoken about anything else\u201d, said a member of the organization.\n\nIn conclusion, a video of a mentally-challenged man falsely accused of being a child-kidnapper and taken hostage by a mob in Rajasthan\u2019s Dausa district was shared by some Facebook pages to spread child-lifting rumours. Earlier, a video of a mentally-ill woman in Sri Ganga Nagar district, Rajasthan, held captive by a mob over suspicion of child-lifting, was also shared to stoke the rumours.", "lang": "en"}
