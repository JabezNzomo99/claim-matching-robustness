Mitch McConnell in the driver\u2019s seat to become majority leader next year.\n\nBut first, the Kentucky Republican needs to get through a tough re-election campaign.\n\nBoth Republican primary challenger Matt Bevin and Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, the presumptive Democratic nominee, have sought to paint McConnell as a Washington insider after three decades in the Senate.\n\nAlong those lines, in an email to her supporters on March 17, 2014, Lundergan Grimes claimed that McConnell is \"the No. 1 recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle.\"\n\nThere\u2019s going to be a lot of mudslinging in this race and a lot of claims about who is raising money from whom and where. We thought we would start by checking whether McConnell is getting more contributions from lobbyists than anyone in Congress.\n\nCampaigns and candidates use \"lobbyists\" like a dirty word, but you may be asking, \"what exactly is a lobbyist?\" Glad you asked.\n\nLobbyists are people who are hired to persuade members of Congress on a particular issue. They are brought in by many different industries, from private companies like Microsoft or ExxonMobil, to associations representing local governments, to nonprofits focused on hot-button legislation. Some organizations have in-house lobbyists, and others hire large firms that lobby Congress on a variety of topics.\n\nWe first checked in with the Lundergan Grimes campaign to see where they got their numbers. They to a report by Open Secrets, a nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog website run by the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nThe report, titled \"Sincere or Strategic, Lobbyists Give Big,\" looked at trends in donations from federally registered lobbyists. If a company or organization spends a certain amount of money lobbying Congress, they\u2019re required to register with the federal government. Open Secrets checks this database against the campaign finance disclosure reports that candidates file.\n\nOpen Secrets found that the 25 lobbyists who have contributed the most money to campaigns this cycle have already donated $1.9 million. Contributions are not party exclusive; five of those 25 gave strictly to Republicans, 11 gave to Democrats and a handful gave to both.\n\nOpen Secrets also released a list of the members of Congress who have received the most donations from lobbyists during the campaign cycle (since the start of 2013).\n\nWith $281,301 in contributions from lobbyists, McConnell topped the list, followed closely by House Speaker John Boehner at $278,380. McConnell has also received another $50,000 from family members of lobbyists.\n\nAs you can see, it\u2019s a hodgepodge of Democrats and Republicans rounding out the list, but the two most powerful Republicans in Congress lead the way, by quite a bit.\n\nThis list doesn\u2019t count the Massachusetts special election race in 2013 to replace Secretary of State John Kerry, won by Democrat Ed Markey. Markey raised about from lobbyists between that special election and his 2014 re-election race, so he technically leads the cycle. A spokeswoman for Open Secrets said that when Lundergan Grimes made her statement, the organization had not yet updated their website with Markey\u2019s contributions. Markey's situation, though, is a quirky anomaly, because he was in the unusual position of running twice in one campaign cycle.\n\nMcConnell isn\u2019t just the top congressional recipient of donations from lobbyists. According to his , he has also received more money than any other lawmaker since 2013 from a number of industries.\n\nHe\u2019s No. 1 in campaign donations from people who work in the fields of \u2014 deep breath here \u2014 agriculture services, air transportation, auto dealers and manufacturers, building materials, business associations, coal mining, commercial banks, commercial TV and radio stations, electric utilities, food and beverage, food stores, general contractors, health services, home builders, insurance, medical devices and supplies, mining, mortgage bankers and brokers, pharmaceutical and health products, railroads, retirees, steel production and trucking.\n\nWhen he last ran for re-election , McConnell, who was minority leader at the time, topped the list in two industries, coal mining and tobacco. He was fourth in contributions from lobbyists.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that in 2010 when Majority Leader Harry Reid was up for re-election, he benefited most from lobbyist contributions as well. With , Reid received nearly $300,000 more from lobbyists than the next closest lawmaker. So it\u2019s not uncommon for party leaders to receive significant financial backing during their re-election fights.\n\nFor her part, Lundergan Grimes has received $54,699 from lobbyists, 51st among candidates running in 2014.\n\nLundergan Grimes said McConnell is \"the No. 1 recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle.\" Based on the analysis from Open Secrets, McConnell tops the chart for 2014. That\u2019s probably a perk of his party position more than anything. As noted, Speaker Boehner is right behind him and Reid was the No. 1 recipient during his 2010 campaign.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t change the accuracy of the claim. We rate it True.", "lang": "en"}
