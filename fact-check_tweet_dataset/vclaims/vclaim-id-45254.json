Trump regularly boasted at these briefings about how the United States led the world in COVID-19 testing until he finally stomped out of one after being challenged by a reporter to explain why it was important to cast virus testing as if it were a global competition. CNBC reported that:\n\nPresident Donald Trump stormed out of a coronavirus press conference at the White House on Monday after becoming angry with two reporters, one who asked a question about testing, and another who didn\u2019t get to ask a question at all. The event in the Rose Garden was meant to give the president a chance to boast about the recent increases in testing, and Trump spoke and answered questions for nearly an hour. At around 5:15 p.m., CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang asked Trump, \u201cYou have said many times that the U.S. is doing far better than any other country when it comes to testing,\u201d to which Trump said, \u201cYes.\u201d Jiang, who is Chinese American, continued, \u201cWhy does that matter? Why is it global competition to you, if every day Americans are still losing their lives, and we are still seeing more cases every day?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re losing their lives everywhere in the world,\u201d Trump replied, \u201cAnd maybe that\u2019s a question you should ask China. Don\u2019t ask me. Ask China that question, okay? If you ask them that question, you may get a very unusual answer.\u201d As Trump proceeded to call on another reporter, Jiang followed up. \u201cSir, why are you saying that to me, specifically?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not saying it specifically to anybody,\u201d Trump responded, growing visibly irate. \u201cI\u2019m saying that to anyone who would ask a nasty question like that.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s boasts about America\u2019s being the world leader in testing led to many debates over the tests\u2019 accuracy, particularly in how \u201cmost\u201d was being reckoned \u2014 was it more accurate to count the gross number of tests being performed (which would generally be higher for countries with larger populations), or to measure the proportion of a country\u2019s population that had been tested to date, otherwise known as per capita testing (which is a better gauge of efficiency). CNN reported that:\n\nSome critics asserted that, based on responses offered by Trump when questioned about testing rates, that the president didn\u2019t even understand what \u201cper capita\u201d meant:\n\nThe remarks offered in the above meme are accurately reproduced. During a May 20, 2020, meeting with Governor Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas and Governor Laura Kelly of Kansas, Trump reiterated his common pronouncement that increased testing made the U.S. look bad in comparison by revealing a greater number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. than in other countries:\n\nTRUMP: But when you do 14 million tests, you\u2019re going to find more cases. If instead of 14 million tests we did 3 million \u2014 like, Germany is at about 3 million; South Korea is at 3 million, and they\u2019ve done a very good job. It\u2019s not a knock, but we\u2019re at almost 14 million. We\u2019re going to be passing 14 million very soon. So you\u2019re going to have more tests. If we do 3 million, everyone would say, \u201cOh, we\u2019re doing great,\u201d you know, in terms of cases. We\u2019re going to have more cases. If we did 3 million \u2014 maybe that\u2019s what we should\u2019ve done. I said \u2014 if I would\u2019ve done 3 million, they\u2019d say, \u201cOh, they have very few cases. United States is doing well.\u201d We\u2019re finding a lot of people. By doing testing, you\u2019re finding people. So we\u2019re doing 14, Germany is doing 3, South Korea doing 3, and I think they\u2019re number two and three. So we\u2019re way ahead of everybody. But when you do that, you have more cases. So a lot of times, the fake news media will say, \u201cYou know, there are a lot of cases in the United States.\u201d Well, if we didn\u2019t do testing at a level that nobody has ever dreamt possible, you wouldn\u2019t have very many cases.\n\nWhen asked about how U.S. testing compared to that of other countries on a per capita basis, Trump strangely asserted that \u201cthere\u2019s many per capitas\u201d and questioned \u201cper capita relative to what?\u201d:\n\nQ: How does [testing] compare to a per capita basis? Obviously, the United States is much larger than a lot of these European countries. How does our testing compare per capita to those nations? TRUMP: And, you know, when you say \u201cper capita,\u201d there\u2019s many per capitas. It\u2019s, like, per capita relative to what? But you can look at just about any category, and we\u2019re really at the top, meaning positive on a per capita basis, too. They\u2019ve done a great job.\n\nTrump appeared to be making the point that whichever metric one used, number of tests or per capita testing rate, the U.S. ranked as the highest in the world (although the latter claim was false). But his proclaiming that \u201cthere\u2019s many per capitas\u201d and questioning what \u201cper capita relative to what\u201d was cryptic beyond explanation.\n\nThe term per capita literally means \u201cby heads,\u201d or \u201cper person.\u201d Many different concepts can be measured on a per capita basis (anything from car ownership to hamburger consumption), but such measurements are always relative to one thing (i.e., number of people), as many commenters pointed out:", "lang": "en"}
