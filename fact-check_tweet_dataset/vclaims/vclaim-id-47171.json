Kristin Kroepfl, vice president and chief marketing officer of Quaker Foods North America, told NBC News:\n\nThis decision caused some online outrage as social media users accused Quaker Oats of erasing its history and diminishing the accomplishments of Nancy Green, the woman who portrayed Aunt Jemima in promotional materials in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Many of these posts claimed that Green was one of the first African American millionaires because of the amount of money she earned playing Aunt Jemima:\n\nBut Green did not die a millionaire. In fact, she could not live off the earnings she made from her portrayal of Aunt Jemima, and continued to work as a housekeeper until a few years before her death in 1923.\n\nThe origins of Aunt Jemima can be traced back to 1889 when Chris Rutt and Charles Underwood created a self-rising pancake mix. The product originally carried the name \u201cself-rising pancake flour,\u201d but Rutt was inspired to change the name of the mix after he attended a minstrel show and saw men dressed in blackface perform a song entitled \u201cOld Aunt Jemima.\u201d\n\nWhile Rutt and Underwood developed this self-rising mix and contributed the \u201cAunt Jemima\u201d name, they were unable to turn their product into a commercial success. The duo sold their milling company to R.T. Davis, who, with Green\u2019s help, would go on to create the persona of Aunt Jemima and turn the brand into a national product.\n\nDavis hired Green, who was born a slave in Kentucky in 1834, to portray Aunt Jemima at the World\u2019s Fair in Chicago in 1893. Green, as Aunt Jemima, served pancakes to the crowd and told romanticized \u201cstories\u201d of her time on the plantation. While these stories were presented as if they were the genuine memories of Aunt Jemima, Green was, of course, just playing a fictional character.\n\nIn \u201cMammy: A Century of Race, Gender, and Southern Memory,\u201d author Kimberly Wallace-Sanders writes:\n\nAt one point the most reliable means of consolidating the country involved inducing a kind of national amnesia about the history of slavery. Aunt Jemima was created to celebrate state-of-the-art technology through a pancake mix; she did not celebrate the promise of post-Emancipation progress for African Americans. Aunt Jemima\u2019s \u201cfreedom\u201d was negated, or revoked, in this role because of the character\u2019s persona as a plantation slave, not a free black woman employed as a domestic. An African American woman, pretending to be a slave, was pivotal to the trademark\u2019s commercial achievement in 1893. Its success revolved around the fantasy of returning a black woman to a sanitized version of slavery. The Aunt Jemima character involved a regression of race relations, and her character helped usher in a prominent resurgence of the \u201chappy slave\u201d mythology of the antebellum South. Nancy Green, a former slave from Kentucky, played the first Aunt Jemima. Green was a middle-aged woman living on the South Side of Chicago, working as a cook and housekeeper for a prominent judge. After a series of auditions, she was hired to cook and serve the new pancake recipe at the World\u2019s Fair. Part of her act was to tell stories from her own early slave life along with plantation tales written for her by a white southern sales representative. This combination of historic and mythic plantation was designed to perpetuate the \u201chistorical amnesia necessary for confidence in the American future.\u201d That this amnesia occurred at the expense of African American progress was clearly not an issue for the Pearl Milling Company, the inventor of Aunt Jemima.\n\nA pamphlet detailing the \u201clife\u201d of Aunt Jemima, which portrayed her as a \u201chappy\u201d slave with a \u201csecret recipe\u201d working at a plantation owned by Colonel Higbee of Louisiana, was also created for the 1893 World\u2019s Fair, and laid the foundation for future advertisements to build on the Aunt Jemima myth.\n\nOne artifact from the early days of Aunt Jemima\u2019s fictional history was a set of paper dolls that supposedly showed Aunt Jemima and her family before and after they sold her secret pancake recipe. The \u201cbefore\u201d set included six paper dolls without shoes and dressed in shabby clothing, while the \u201cafter\u201d set included a set of \u201cfancy\u201d clothes.\n\nBut these dolls, like most of the fictional lore surrounding Aunt Jemima, did not accurately reflect reality.\n\nWe have been unable to find any specific details about how much Green was paid for her portrayal of Aunt Jemima. The evidence, however, suggests that Green did not become rich from her work and was likely paid a paltry sum.\n\nIn \u201cClinging to Mammy: The Faithful Slave in Twentieth-Century America,\u201d Micki McElya writes that in 1900, Green listed her occupation as a \u201ccook.\u201d While this may have referred to her job demonstrating pancake mix as Aunt Jemima, in 1910, she was working as a \u201chousekeeper.\u201d\n\nWe reached out to McElya for more information about what monetary payments Green received for her portrayal of Aunt Jemima. McElya couldn\u2019t point to a specific dollar amount, but she did say that she \u201cfound no evidence that Nancy Green died a millionaire in 1923,\u201d and that \u201cthe available evidence suggests otherwise.\u201d\n\nM.M. Manring, the author of \u201cSlave in A Box: The Strange Career of Aunt Jemima,\u201d also told us that \u201call of the available evidence \u2026 would suggest that [Nancy Green] was almost certainly not conspicuously wealthy.\u201d Manring also addressed the notion that Green was given a \u201clifetime contract\u201d to portray Aunt Jemima. This \u201clifetime contract,\u201d according to Manring, was part of the lore created for the character of \u201cAunt Jemima\u201d \u2013 but there\u2019s no evidence that it actually applied to Green.\n\nI\u2019ve been through the J. Walter Thompson archives at Duke, where so much of the papers related to the Aunt Jemima campaign are stored, and never found any reference to her pay. None of her obituaries mention anything regarding her wealth. If she had a $1 million fortune in, say, 1920, adjusted for inflation, that\u2019s the equivalent of about $13 million today, by my calculations. It would be surprising to me if all contemporaneous accounts of her failed to make any mention of her vast wealth. All of the available evidence, such as it is, would suggest that she was almost certainly not conspicuously wealthy. She was comfortable enough to give to her church and do missionary work, but so were plenty of other people of ordinary means. As for the \u201clifetime contract,\u201d that was a big part of the promotion of Aunt Jemima. You see the same language in the ads \u2013 that a milling company in Chicago brought Aunt Jemima north and gave her a lifetime contract, and even paid her in gold. I have never found nor to expect to find proof of a contract, and again, I can\u2019t prove a negative. But I do think you have to put that claim in context with a long-running ad campaign that mixed myth and reality, and people real and imagined.\n\nObituaries for Green published in The Chicago Tribune and Daily Herald also made no mention of her being one of the first African American women to become a millionaire:\n\nWhile no evidence exists to suggest that Green died a millionaire, she did make enough money (as both a housekeeper and for her promotional work as Aunt Jemina) to support the missionary work of the Olivet Baptist Church in Chicago.\n\nIt should also be noted that Green\u2019s descendants (as well as the descendants of another Black woman who portrayed Aunt Jemima) filed a lawsuit against Quaker Oats, arguing that the company exploited Green, and that her family was owed billions in royalties, USA Today reported. The lawsuit was later dismissed after a judge ruled that the plaintiffs did not provide proof that they were related to the women who portrayed Aunt Jemima:\n\nThe rumor that Green died a millionaire is, like much of the folklore surrounding Aunt Jemima, not supported by historical evidence. This claim is unfounded, and all of the material we examined suggests that Green was not conspicuously wealthy. Therefore, we\u2019ve rated this rumor false.\n\nIn February 2021, Quaker Oats announced that it was retiring the \u201cAunt Jemima\u201d brand name and replacing it with the \u201cPearl Milling Company.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
