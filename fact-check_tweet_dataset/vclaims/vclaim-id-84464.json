Google search results for the word \u201cfarrago\u201d show a spike soon after the word was used.\n\nThe word \u201cfarrago\u201d had been introduced to the Indian vocabulary. It became a topic for a flurry of jokes and memes on social media. No sooner had the dust settled over \u201cfarrago\u201d, the word was in the news again. Huffington Post carried a story saying, \u201cYears Before Tharoor, Journalist Mehdi Hasan Said In A Viral Speech: \u2018Farrago Of Distortions, Misrepresentations\u201c. The same was repeated in India Today with the headline, \u201cNot a Tharoor original: \u2018Farrago of distortions, misrepresentations\u2019 was first said by journalist Mahdi Hasan\u201c. Even, ScoopWhoop did a story along similar lines.\n\nTaking a cue from the story, right wingers started trolling Tharoor accusing him of copying the words of Hasan. This particular tweet, accusing Tharoor of copying has been retweeted more than 2.2K times at the time of writing.\n\nTharoor immediately retaliated, saying \u201cpreposterous. I have been using the phrase in debates since my college days, before Mehdi was born.\u201d This led to several tweets saying Shashi Tharoor finds it more important to respond on plagiarism than Arnab\u2019s accusations. Tharoor was quick to respond, but the trolling continued.\n\nImagine if I say the above is \u2018utter nonsense\u2019 and then get trolled saying I copied the phrase \u2018utter nonsense\u2019 from someone. Trolling Tharoor and writing articles saying Hasan used the phrase first is really as ridiculous as that.\n\nThe word \u201cfarrago\u201d has its origins in 17th century meaning a mix fodder for cattle but its modern day usage refers to an inconsistent medley or an irrational or confused mixture. Even though many may have heard it for the first time, the expression \u201cfarrago of misrepresentations\u201d has been around for a long time. It is nothing but an eloquent and more erudite way of saying a \u201cbunch of lies\u201d. It is particularly popular in debating societies and Tharoor must have used it many times in the past.\n\nMuch before Hasan\u2019s 2013 speech, in his 2011 memoir, Lucknow Boy, the author Vinod Mehta has quoted Tharoor saying, \u201cthis farrago of gossip and misrepresentation\u2026\u201d. This was pointed out by Twitter user @yavvee.\n\nHuffington Post, Scoopwhoop, India Today clearly jumped the gun while obliquely accusing Tharoor of plagiarism. However, that doesn\u2019t make this phrase Tharoor\u2019s original either. On Aug 20, 1864, a newspaper The Irish People, from Dublin carried the sentence \u201c\u2026.putting forth a farrago of folly and misrepresentation\u201d. In 1927 a Harvard law professor Felix Frankfurter, summed up a controversial judgment involving Italian immigrants as \u201ca farrago of misquotations, misrepresentations, suppressions, and mutilations . . .\u201d You can still find it quoted in several places with reference to the case.\n\n\u201cA farrago of Lies\u201d is a title of a book and a Google search will reveal gems like a \u201cfarrago of leaks, libels and downright lies\u201d. In 2011, David Morris, an MP from Australia said, \u201cWe heard tonight a farrago of misrepresentation, exaggeration and omission\u2026\u201c. The same year, an article described Al Gore denying Climate change reality as \u201cA farrago of spurious connections, conspiracy theories and misrepresented facts as outlandish as any doomsday cult\u2019s\u2026.\u201c.\n\nAs we can see, the expression, \u201ca farrago of misrepresentations\u201d has been used by many people over the years. To say that Shashi Tharoor copied this phrase is yet another exasperating farrago of distortions. He didn\u2019t copy anyone. Neither did he invent it. It is just one of those phrases of English language that no one can claim a copyright over. So, next time you want to say a \u201ccocktail of lies\u201d, try a \u201cfarrago of misrepresentations\u201d instead. And if you come across a \u201cgallimaufry of falsehoods and misquotations\u201d, remember you heard it first from me.", "lang": "en"}
