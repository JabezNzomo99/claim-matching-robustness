Reuters fed to its affiliates hours of live coverage of French street protests, which turned violent.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "May 01, 2019", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-14093", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-today-reuters/29915005.html", "vclaim": "The chief editor of the Kremlin\u2019s international media corporation Rossiya Segodnya and RT (Russia Today), Margarita Simonyan, claimed on Wednesday the news agency Reuters had been broadcasting a \u201cgreen boulevard\u201d while RT was live from Caracas, Venezuela where supporters of Nicolas Maduro marched on Tuesday.\n\nIn her Telegram channel Simonyan posted two side-by-side screenshots captioned: \u201cWe're showing a rally in support of Maduro in Caracas. Reuters is showing a green boulevard. Q.E.D.\u201d\n\nQ.E.D. is an abbreviation for quod erat demonstrandum used to demonstrate the completion of the proof.\n\nCloser examination shows that Simonyan\u2019s \u201cproof\u201d is untenable. The time stamp on her Telegram post shows 9:38 AM (UTC).\n\nHowever, the live feed was not just a \u201cgreen boulevard\u201d but Reuters\u2019 live stream showing escalation of street protests during the May Day rally in Paris, France.\n\nSimonyan\u2019s post indirectly accuses Reuters of not covering the situation in Venezuela, which is also false \u2013 the reports from Caracas are on the top of the \u201cWorld News\u201d section of the Reuters website.\n\nPolygraph.info has reviewed recordings of the Reuters live channel fed to affiliates. The channel streamed protests in Venezuela on Tuesday, April 30 from approximately 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. EDT, on the day that massive street protests broke out in the country.\n\nOn Wednesday, May 1, Reuters streamed hours of live coverage of street protests in Paris, which turned violent. Reuter\u2019s live feed began in the 7 a.m. EDT hour and was fed continuously through the hour of Simonyan\u2019s posting and well into the next hours.\n\nReuters resumed live coverage from Venezuela in the 12 p.m. EDT hour.\n\nWe cannot speculate whether Simonyan intentionally made a false claim or sincerely mistook Reuter\u2019s live-stream from Paris for a mere \u201cgreen boulevard\u201d view. However, in a previous post \u00ad\u2013 exactly an hour earlier \u2013 Simonyan wrote in all capital letters: \u201cTHE POLICE HIT WITH A BATON THE RIA NOVOSTI CORRESPONDENT, WHO WAS COVERING THE UNREST DURING THE MAY DAY DEMONSTRATIONS IN PARIS.\u201d\n\nSimonyan\u2019s use of the Q.E.D. abbreviation is also a reference to her previous posts, in which she repeatedly promotes the idea, that there is no press freedom in the democratic countries, often drawing a concrete line between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d \u2013 a line that also separates what is trustworthy or not.", "lang": "en"}
