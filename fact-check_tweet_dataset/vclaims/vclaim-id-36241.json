The State shall promote small family norms by offering incentives in taxes, employment, education etc. to its people who keep their family limited to two children and shall withdraw every concession from and deprive such incentives to those not adhering to small family norm, to keep the growing population under control.''\n\nThe viral WhatsApp message includes a screenshot of the proposed Bill reads, \"Constitution amendment bill introduced in rajyasabha, All the benefits / subsidies shall be withdrawn for the family having more than Two Children....\"\n\nBOOM received the screenshot on its WhatsApp helpline number (7700906111) inquiring about the Bill. The screenshot is viral as the Bill proposes to limit subsidies for a family of more than two children\n\nA Twitter user shared the same viral message thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for introducing the Bill in Rajya Sabha.\n\nClick here to view, and here for an archive.\n\nWe searched on Facebook with the same caption and found that the image was viral with the same caption.\n\nThis is viral in the backdrop of speculation that the a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill could of be introduced by the government in the upper house on February 11, 2020, which did not happen.\n\n\n\nAlso Read:Not Taken Any Decision On Nationwide NRC: Lok Sabha Reply\n\nBOOM found that the Bill being cited in the viral screenshot was introduced as a private member Bill by Anil Desai, a Member of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha, belonging to the Shiv Sena.\n\n\n\nWe checked the Rajya Sabha's official website and found that the Bill was introduced on February 7, 2020, and was not brought in by the government as being claimed in viral posts.\n\nThe Rajya Sabha website showed that it was the third Bill to be introduced in the ongoing session of parliament. We also found that the viral screenshot matches the Bill that was introduced by Desai, however the Bill was not discussed in the upper house on February 11, 2020.\n\nThe distinction between private member Bills and government Bills is important as the Bills introduced as government Bills can be discussed on any day, whereas a private member's Bills can be introduced and discussed only on Fridays.\n\nAdditionally, a private member's Bill that is introduced but not discussed in the Rajya Sabha, lapses when the Member retires.\n\nClick here to read the Bill\n\nBOOM contacted PRS Legislative Research, an independent research non-profit body, on the essential difference between the two types of Bills. PRS said in an email that, \"Private member Bills are Bills that can be introduced in Parliament by members who are not ministers. Private member Bills are used by Members of Parliament to highlight gaps in the government Bills and to draw attention to matters of national concern.\"\n\n\n\n\"For example, in 2015, Rajya Sabha passed the Rights of Transgender Persons Bill, 2014, a private member's Bill piloted by MP Tiruchi Siva. In this case, the government then introduced its own version of the Bill and requested the MP to withdraw,\" further said PRS Legislative Research.\n\nHowever in this case the Bill was introduced by an opposition member of parliament and Bills introduced by private members have a slim chance of getting passed. According to data by PRS, only 14 Private Member's Bills have been passed by both the houses of parliament since 1952, and the last Bill to have been passed by both the houses was in 1970.", "lang": "en"}
