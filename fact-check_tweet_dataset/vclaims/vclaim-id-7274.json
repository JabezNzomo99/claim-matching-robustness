The text, accompanied by a photograph of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal cutting a cake, was posted at 8:30 PM on August 16 and has been shared by over 10,000 people. It bears several comments condemning the CM\u2019s \u201cinsensitivity\u201d.\n\n\u201cImpudence itself has more shame than Kejriwal,\u201d reads another post shared by Facebook page I Support Namo that has a following of over 1.5 crores. Kejriwal\u2019s image shared by the page on the night of August 16 attracted over 11,000 likes and 6,700 shares.\n\nFacebook page ModiNama posted the image as well and it was shared over 5,500 times. But the photograph of Kejriwal cutting a cake is not limited to Facebook; it is widespread on Twitter as well. A handle @AMIT_GUJJU, followed by Railway Minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s office, shared Kejriwal\u2019s image juxtaposed with an ABP News tweet, which said that the CM cancelled his birthday celebrations.\n\nA website called \u201cActual News\u201d wrote an article on Kejriwal\u2019s alleged hypocrisy and insensitivity. \u201cDespite the sombre news of Atal ji\u2019s demise, Kejriwal did not shy away from celebrating his birthday with immense pomp and joy (translated),\u201d reads an excerpt from the article.\n\nKejriwal did not celebrate his birthday after former PM Vajpayee\u2019s death\n\nSocial media strategist of AAP Ankit Lal tweeted on the night of August 16 that a photograph of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal taken in the morning and was being circulated as him cutting the cake in the evening to portray him as celebrating his birthday after Vajpayee\u2019s demise.\n\nTo verify Ankit Lal\u2019s claim, we looked for other images taken during the event and stumbled upon one that was taken from a different angle. A wall clock and a wristwatch are clearly visible in the photograph and upon careful observation, one can also tell the time. Both read a little past 11 AM. The announcement of Vajpayee\u2019s demise was made after 5 PM, hence, Kejriwal could not have been celebrating his birthday after the former PM\u2019s death.\n\nThe official Twitter handle of Aam Aadmi Party posted a video of the Chief Minister at 12:09 PM where he can be heard saying, \u201cFormer PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee is admitted at AIIMS hospital in critical condition. At such circumstance, I do not feel like celebrating too much.\u201d Addressing the crowd of party workers, the CM then says that he along with Deputy CM Manish Sisodia will visit Vajpayee at AIIMS following the address.\n\nThere were also several media reports that reported Kejriwal cancelled his birthday celebrations in view of the former PM\u2019s deteriorating health. ABP News tweeted the same at 12:56 PM on August 16.\n\nAn article published by The Indian Express that same day at 1:50 PM reported that \u201cthe Chief Minister along with his Deputy Manish Sisodia visited All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) this morning to inquire about Vajpayee\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nThe aforementioned sequence of events clearly shows that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal did not celebrate his birthday after former Prime Minister Vajpayee\u2019s death. He cut a cake at around 11 AM, announced an hour later that he does not wish the celebrations to proceed and visited Vajpayee at AIIMS between 1 to 2 PM.\n\nIt is commonplace for narratives to be manufactured on social media for political one-upmanship. Unverified information on social media, especially related to an emotionally-charged affair, should always be double-checked.", "lang": "en"}
