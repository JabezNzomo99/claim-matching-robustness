This video is fabricated, with audio from a Trump impersonator edited into a real Fox & Friends clip.\n\nViewable here , the video had 1.3 million views on Twitter at the time of this article\u2019s publication, with posts sharing the video on Facebook found here , here , and here .\n\nThe video seems to be duping some media users, eliciting comments like \u201cThat has made me feel so sick [\u2026] That is one very mentally ill person that should be in an institution not running a country!!!\u201d Another user shared the video on Facebook with the caption, \u201cI can\u2019t believe my ears [\u2026] And the Fox and Friends doofuses smile and nod with approving, knowing, warmth. My brain just melted down. This is Chernobyl level neural overload. #CreepyTrump.\u201d\n\nIn the fabricated video, Fox & Friends host Ainsley Earhardt asks the President about his Mother\u2019s Day plans, and whether he has a message for mothers watching the program. A voice mimicking that of Trump describes a Mother\u2019s Day tradition he shared with his father, \u201cthe great Fred Trump,\u201d of sending his mother to the spa, where \u201cshe\u2019d get pampered,\u201d so that they could \u201cgo out in Queens\u201d to find young, Russian single moms whom they would pay for sex. The voice says that he and his father would run \u201ccredit checks on them to make sure that they were, like, practically bankrupt\u201d and would display \u201ca series of sex acts and a dollar amount to the sex act\u201d on \u201ca big board.\u201d\n\nThe fabricated video has also been edited to include blank, confused expressions from Earhardt and the other hosts, Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade.\n\nJ-L Cauvin, a comedian known for impersonating Trump ( twitter.com/JLCauvin , here ) confirmed to Reuters via email that the voice in the video is his. The audio comes from 25 minutes into the May 9 \u201cMother's Day Bonus Episode\u201d of his podcast, \u201cMaking Podcasts Great Again,\u201d available www.patreon.com/MPGA on Patreon.\n\nThe real Fox & Friends clip, viewable here , is from May 8, 2020. Around the 46:21 timestamp ( youtu.be/gVL9kgl5vi8?t=2780 ), Ainsley Earhardt does ask, \u201cMr. President, this Sunday is Mother's Day. What are your plans? What are you going to do for Melania? And do you have a message for all the moms that are watching this morning?\u201d Trump responds that he will be in Camp David for \u201ca big meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff,\u201d calling Camp David \u201cthis very special place that nobody ever gets to see.\u201d\n\nAt 47:33, Earhardt again asks Trump, \u201cDo you have a message for the moms that are watching?\u201d The president responds: \u201cWell, all I can say is Happy Mother\u2019s Day. And I had a great mom. I loved my mom, and she loved me, which isn\u2019t hard -- which is I must tell you, probably not easy to do, but she was so good to me.\u201d\n\nThe Reuters Fact Check team previously debunked an altered video appearing to show presidential candidate Joe Biden stumbling over his words when asked about sexual misconduct allegations by the hosts of popular ABC show The View here .\n\nFalse. This Fox and Friends segment is fabricated, editing in audio of comedian D-L Cauvin impersonating Trump.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
