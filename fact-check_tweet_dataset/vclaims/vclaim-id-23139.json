No, that's not true: Norway did increase deportation of immigrants who were sentenced to prison, but Muslims were not targeted and the largest number deported were from eastern European countries. The crime rate in Norway -- which was already low compared to the United States -- has dropped over the past several years -- just as it has in the United States.\n\nThe story first appeared in 2014, but was recently copied word-for-word and posted as if new in an article published on June 17, 2019 titled \"Norway Waking up..Norway Deports Muslims; Crime Rate Drops 31%\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe story suggested that Norway's (fictional) experience with deporting Muslims could be an example for other countries:\n\nLiberals everywhere are crying \"Racism!\" Al Jazeera has blasted Solberg relentlessly for her so-called \"Islamophobia\", but she has pressed on by deporting any Muslims who belong to radical mosques or threaten violence against \"non-believers\" -- and sent their entire families home too.\n\nWhile many in America would say this is racist, it's worked in dramatic fashion. Violent crimes are down more than 31% in Norway.\n\nWhat a shocker.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the rest of Europe and the United States could learn a lesson or two about radical Islam here. Deport the radicals, keep the moderates, and everybody wins.\n\nThis 2019 story is identical to an article published on November 15, 2014, by a now-defunct website PoliticalEars.com. That story titled \"IS ANYBODY SURPRISED? NORWAY DEPORTS MUSLIMS, CRIME RATE DROPS 31%\" is now offline, but it is archived here and below is a screenshot:\n\nThe truth about Norway's immigrant deportation program can be found in a report from the Library of Congress titled \"Norway: Government Plans to Crack Down on Returning Foreign Convicts\" published on March 11, 2013.\n\nThe Norwegian government is reforming two aspects of immigration policy related to foreign convicts in the country. As reported on February 22, 2013, the Ministry of Justice and Public Security is formulating changes in the law in order to send returning foreign convicts back out of Norway and to enhance punishments against the offenders. On June 7, 2011, the Norwegian Parliament ratified legislation to accord the police extended powers to send foreign inmates back to Latvia, Lithuania, and Romania, under bilateral agreements signed with these countries.\n\nIt targeted \"foreign convicts,\" not Muslims. In fact, only one majority-Muslim country -- Iraq -- was among the top five origins of the deported convicts, the report said:\n\nThat was a 2013 report. A more recent accounting of deportations in 2018, published on June 26, 2019 said:\n\nSweden tops the list of countries the deportees were sent to with 512 people. Then Italy follows with 394, Poland with 333, Romania with 267 and Russia with 261 people.\n\n\n\nPoland and Russia are at the top of the statistics of the citizenship of the emigration with 284 citizens each. Ukraine is in third place with 278 emigrants, followed by Albania with 272 and Romania by 266.\n\n\n\nIndividuals with citizenship from these five countries alone account for almost one-third of the forced deportations so far this year.\n\nCrime rates have been dropping in Norway, but the 31 percent decline cited in the story is not based on fact. The U.S. Department of State's most-recent assessment of crime in Norway said:\n\nThere is minimal risk from crime in Oslo. Norway has a relatively low level of crime in comparison to the U.S. and most of Western Europe. The total amount of crime reported in Oslo for 2017 decreased from 2016 by 5.6%.\n\n\n\nThe majority of the criminal cases reported to the police continue to be theft-related incidents. In Oslo and the other major urban areas, crime centers on the inner city and high-transit areas. Instances of pickpocketing and petty theft are common in the major tourist areas, hotel lobbies, and in the areas around train and transit stations. Most hotels and tourist areas are located within walking distance of Oslo's higher crime areas, making instances of property crime and/or petty theft more likely to occur.\n\n\n\nThefts are the overwhelming majority of cases reported. There were 94,887 reports of theft in 2017, a 9.8% decrease from the previous year. Violent and weapons-related crimes (including physical/non-physical threats) increased 4.3% from 34,969 reports in 2016 to 36,687 in 2017. These crimes usually occur in areas known to have drug trafficking and gang problems, such as certain parts of Eastern Oslo and elsewhere. Sexual crimes increased the most (11%) from 7,079 reports in 2016 to 7,986 in 2017. Some of the increase in attempted rape and rape statistics is due to of changes to criminal sexual conduct laws.\n\n\n\nOrganized crime does operate in Norway, but on a small scale. Drug trafficking, petty theft, and home burglary rings typify organized crime, which is often associated within immigrant youth communities or transiting criminal rings from outside of Norway. Reports of crimes involving drugs decreased 6.7%, from 50,293 reports in 2016 to 46,930 in 2017.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes trump-feed.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
