Costantino, a former House Finance Committee chairman, was more than a hundred miles away, working in Vermont\u2019s state government, when newly disclosed public records and emails fueled a wave of recent headlines on the $75 million 38 Studios boondoggle.\n\nFrom the other side of the Green Mountains, he could feel the spotlight.\n\nThe state\u2019s financing of the upstart video-game company, to the tune of $75 million in loan guarantees, lured 38 Studios from Massachusetts to Providence in 2010, but left Rhode Island taxpayers vulnerable in the company\u2019s 2012 bankruptcy.\n\nAmid the torrent of new headlines about 38 Studios, Costantino, who is now commissioner of the Department of Vermont Health Access, issued the following statement on Sept. 27:\n\n\"My only involvement in the matter in RI was because of my former position in the RI legislature. I did not play any role in bringing the company to RI as did others in government. I was tasked with handling the legislation affecting the company by my superiors.\"\n\nCostantino acknowledges he was involved with the legislation, but denies \"any role,\" compared with what \"others in government\" did, to \"bring\" Curt Schilling\u2019s 38 Studios to Rhode Island.\n\nHow can he have been both involved and not involved?\n\nUnfortunately, the former lawmaker did not respond to our request for an interview, leaving us to sort out this contradiction on our own.\n\nThe freshly released emails and deposition transcripts hark back to early 2010 when Rhode Island\u2019s courtship of 38 Studios began to get serious. The documents give the public a window into which state officials were driving the 38 Studios deal.\n\nCostantino comes across as a behind-the-scenes facilitator, helping to lay the groundwork for the public financing. The comments recorded in the depositions and other records show that Costantino:\n\nHe was the first to advocate for 38 Studios\u2019 receipt of a $75-million state guaranteed loan, according to Keith Stokes, chairman of the R.I Economic Development Corporation at the time. And J. Michael Saul, then the EDC\u2019s finance director, recalls that Costantino proposed the expansion of an existing loan guarantee program during a visit to 38 Studios\u2019 headquarters in Maynard, Mass.\n\n\"And at the conclusion of the meeting,\" Saul testified, \"he turned to me and asked me the question: If we were to increase the $50-million (loan program) to $125 million would this -- I\u2019m paraphrasing here -- would this be helpful to get this done?\"\n\nIn another email, an EDC lawyer, Robert I. Stolzman advised Carcieri\u2019s chief of staff Andrew Hodgkin that he had sent him several documents including a draft \"authorizing the RIEDC to guarantee 38 Studios\u2019 debt (at the suggestion of House Finance Chairman Costantino, the \u2026 draft reflects a larger authorization for this as a Jobs Creation Guaranty Program).\"\n\nCostantino, in his deposition in 2014, did not to dispute anything in the Stolzman note.\n\nWas among just a few lawmakers in the loop.\n\nOnly House Speaker Gordon Fox, Senate President M. Teresa Paiva-Weed, Sen. Daniel DaPonte, and Costantino knew about the 38 Studios transaction when the General Assembly approved the bill for the guarantees in 2010, according Marcel A. Valois, the EDC\u2019s former director.\n\nAnother email from Stolzman, the EDC\u2019s lawyer, suggests that Sharon Reynolds, the House fiscal adviser, and Costantino were privy to certain background and \"summary information\" on the \"38 Studios transaction\" before Governor Carcieri.\n\nDuring a videotaped discussion of the bill on the House floor on April 13, one lawmaker asked about the origins of the loan guarantee legislation and who was behind it.\n\n\"There's always conversations with lobbyists and small businesses,\" Costantino said. He didn\u2019t name 38 Studios.\n\nLater on in June of 2010, Costantino told Stolzman he hadn\u2019t told a Providence Journal reporter about his visit to 38 Studios. And Costantino said he wanted to know what EDC staffers were saying about the deal.\n\nIn two separate April 2 emails with the numerals \"38\" noted in the subject line, Stokes mentions Costantino\u2019s role in scheduling the legislation, advising others that \"Steven Costantino wants to move on it next week\" and that Costantino has advised him that House Speaker Fox wants to post the item for hearing.\n\nIn his defense, Costantino issued a statement in which he said: \"I did not play any role in bringing the company to RI as did others in government. I was tasked with handling the legislation affecting the company by my superiors.\"\n\nIn other words: Don\u2019t blame me, I was just doing my job.\n\nBut the records and comments of people involved illustrate that Costantino played a key part in Rhode Island's courtship of 38 Studios. The legislation he helped pass, offering valuable loan guarantees, was his idea, according to one former EDC official.\n\nDuring the process, Costantino shielded his idea from the type of full political scrutiny that might have killed it. He did this by not naming 38 Studios on the House floor when he was asked who was pushing for the loan-guarantee program.\n\nWhen the deal was done, the CEO of Schilling's company thanked all members of the General Assembly and singled out five elected officials by name, including the former House Finance Committee chairman.\n\nCostantino played a pivotal role in creating the 38 Studios mess. In some ways, the record shows he bears as much responsibility as the other elected government officials who \"tasked\" him.", "lang": "en"}
