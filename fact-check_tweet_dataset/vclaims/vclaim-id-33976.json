Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Video shows rally in support of CAA and NRC at Ramlila Maidan (Delhi). Fact: The posted video is an old one. The same video was found to be tweeted by a user in July-2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, a similar video can be found in the search results. The video (archived) was tweeted by a user in July-2019. So, it is an old video.\n\nIn the video, in the end, the slogans of \u2018Mandir vahi banayenge\u2019 can be heard and the man in the video also refers to \u2018Ramlila Maidan\u2019 in the video. So, when searched with the relevant keywords, it was found that VHP held \u2018a rally in Delhi\u2019s Ram Leela Maidan for Ram Temple construction in Ayodhya\u2019 in December-2018. The video might be related to that event. But, it can be concluded that the video is definitely not related to any recent rally in support of CAA and NRC.\n\nTo sum it up, an old video is being falsely shared as \u2018rally in support of CAA and NRC at Delhi\u2019s Ramlila Maidan\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
