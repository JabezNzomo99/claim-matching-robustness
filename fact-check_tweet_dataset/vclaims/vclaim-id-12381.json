Putin declared that should Washington deploy intermediate-range missiles in Europe, Russia would be forced to strike at key \u201cdecision-making centers\u201d in the United States. He then spoke of Russia\u2019s progress in developing a hypersonic missile, the Tsirkon, which Moscow claims would have a range of 1,000 km and move with a speed of 11,000 km.\n\nRussian TV host and CEO of the Kremlin\u2019s media arm Rossiya Segodnya, Kiselyov, who is reportedly close to Putin, was quick to identify the U.S. military \u201cdecision-making centers\u201d located along the East and West coasts. But he blundered, listing nonexistent military bases as Russian targets and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitriy Peskov immediately distanced the government from war scenarios presented on its own state-owned television outlet.\n\n\u201cWe never interfere and cannot interfere in the editorial policy of our television channels, even the state ones. Therefore, in this case, the question must be addressed directly to the television channels,\u201d said Peskov.\n\nKiselyov listed the Pentagon as the defense department\u2019s headquarters and Camp David, as the command center of the U.S. president and the Joint Chief of Staff..\n\nBut the remainder of Kiselyov\u2019s list seems to not have been updated for at least two decades. Two of the military facilities he named were closed more than twenty years ago and he misrepresented the functions of the third base.\n\nKiselyov claimed that the U.S. military decision-making centers are \u201cFort Ritchie, Maryland, the command post of the American President and the command center for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. On the West Coast is McClellan (California), where is the command center of the strategic offensive forces, and Jim Creek (Washington) hosting the nuclear command control center.\u201d He then described in detail how Russia\u2019s prospective hypersonic missile, the Tsirkon, would \u201celiminate them in seconds.\u201d\n\nThe former U.S. military base Fort Ritchie was closed in September 1998 pursuant to the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. It is now a census-designated location in Washington County, Maryland, with a population of 314 according to the U.S. Census tabulations for State of Maryland in 2010.\n\nThe Maryland National Guard built Camp Ritchie in 1926 as a training ground. During World War II, it was designated as a War Department Military Intelligence Training Center, where 20,000 intelligence troops were housed and trained over a four-year period. From 1964 to 1975, the post was used as a support installation and eventually headquarters for the 7th Signal Command. In 1995, Fort Ritchie was placed on the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) list; all military activity ceased by 1998.\n\nThe base was never \u201ca command center of the President of the United States and the Joint Chiefs of Staff,\u201d as Kiselyov claimed. But the TV host apparently failed to check the status of the former base before announcing the Russian target in Maryland.\n\nKiselyev made the same blunder in naming the former McClellan Air Force Base, located near Sacramento, California, which has been closed for 18 years. In fact, it has been converted to a public airport general aviation airport.\n\n\u201cAs is part of McClellan Park, Sacramento McClellan Airport is one of the most successful conversions of a former military base in the country,\u201d says the airport\u2019s website.\n\nThe Pentagon slated McClellan Air Force Base for closure in 1993, after serving as the pivotal supply depot on the West coast during World War II and later as one of the five repair and maintenance depots for military aircraft. The Air Force base provided major logistical repair and maintenance support for the Korean War, Vietnam War, and Operation Desert Shield/ Storm.\n\nBut McClelland was never a \u201ccommand center of the strategic offensive forces\u201d of the United States as Kiselyov claims, although it employed 4,250 military personnel and 17,652 civilians at the height of the war effort.\n\nKiselyov\u2019s last gaffe was to claim that Jim Creek is a nuclear command control center. The base actually consists of the Jim Creek Naval Radio Station and a recreation park for military personnel. The radio station is as a very low frequency (VLF) radio transmitter facility with its main mission to communicate orders one-way to submarines of the Pacific fleet while submerged. Its daily functions are controlled by the Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station (NCTAMS) Pacific Command.\n\nThe local newspaper in the area, the Seattle Times, describes it as \u201ca relatively obscure U.S. military site\u201d in an article about the Kiselyov broadcast.\n\nIn 1953, when the Naval Radio Station Jim Creek was dedicated, it was recognized as the most powerful radio station in the world.\n\n\u201cToday it is still among only a handful of radio stations capable of providing more than one million watts of power, allowing the U.S. Navy to communicate with ships, submarines, and aircraft anywhere around the world,\u201d according to Homeport Northwest, the official blog of the U.S. Navy in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nWhile the radio station is indeed a strategic installation, critical for U.S. Navy in the Pacific, it is not \u201ca nuclear command center,\u201d as Kiselyov claimed.\n\nIn the \u201cNuclear Matters Handbook 2016,\u201d which is online and available to the public, the Department of Defense lists fixed command centers at the Pentagon and an Air Force base in the State of Nebraska as part of the Nuclear Command and Control System. The Jim Creek radio location is not listed.\n\nKiselyov, however, went on to describe how the prospective Russian Tsirkon hypersonic missile \u2014 which is still in development with no clear project completion date \u2014 could destroy those American command centers in five minutes. He said that 40 Tsirkons could be mounted on any Russian ship or submarine and launched from 200 miles away in the ocean, just beyond the U.S. territorial waters and target those \"command centers.\"\n\nInternet users noted, however, that the images Kiselyov used to illustrate the Tsirkon are very similar to those of the X-51 missile developed by the American company Boeing.\n\nAccording to Interfax, Russia conducted several tests of the Tsirkon in 2015, but open sources do not include any official images or video recordings of this missile.\n\nAs to Dmitriy Peskov\u2019s separate claim that the Kremlin does not call the shots at state-owned media, that could certainly be a subject of a separate fact check. The last Freedom House report on press freedom in Russia says that \u201cTelevision, which is still the leading source of news and information, often functions as a propaganda tool for the government.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
