The article goes on to say that \"it wasn\u2019t until six months after\" H1N1 became a global pandemic that \"then-President Obama declared a public health emergency on what was already a pandemic. By that time, the disease had infected millions of Americans and more than 1,000 people had died in the U.S.\"\n\nNot only is this timeline wrong, but the story and headline eliminate important facts and distort others, imparting a false narrative that social media users are resharing.\n\nOnline, fact-based news is going to be very important in the coming weeks.

From April 12, 2009, to April 10, 2010, in the United States, there were 60.8 million cases of swine flu, 274,304 hospitalizations and 12,469 deaths, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated.\n\nObama and his administration issued two emergency declarations, but the article refers only to one.\n\nObama\u2019s acting director of health and human services declared H1N1 a public health emergency on April 26, 2009.\n\nThat was when only 20 cases of H1N1 \u2014 and no deaths \u2014 around the country had been confirmed.\n\nTwo days later, the administration made an initial funding request for H1N1 to Congress. Eventually $7.65 billion was allocated for a vaccine and other measures.\n\nH1N1 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on June 11, 2009.\n\nIn other words, the Obama administration\u2019s public health emergency declaration came more than six weeks before the pandemic designation.\n\nNow to Obama\u2019s second action.\n\nOn Oct. 24, 2009, six months after his administration declared H1N1 a public health emergency, Obama declared it a national emergency.\n\nAt that point, H1N1 had claimed more than 1,000 American lives, according to the CDC.\n\nWhen Obama made his declaration, the New York Times reported at the time, thousands of people were lining up in cities across the country to receive vaccinations, as federal officials acknowledged that their vaccination program had gotten off to a slow start, with some states having requested 10 times the amount they have been allotted.\n\nMillions of people in the United States had had H1N1.\n\nThe national emergency declaration allowed the federal government to temporarily waive or modify requirements of the Medicare, Medicaid, and State Children's Health Insurance programs. It also permitted doctors and hospitals to bypass certain requirements as they responded to H1N1.\n\nBy way of comparison, Trump declared the coronavirus a public health emergency on Jan. 31, 2020, also prior to any deaths in the United States. One effect was that U.S. citizens who had been in China's Hubei Province, the source of the outbreak, in the previous 14 days were subjected to 14 days of mandatory quarantine if they traveled back to the United States.\n\nNBC News reported March 3, 2020, that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is planning for the possibility that Trump could make a national emergency declaration to bring in extra funds and personnel to assist the administration's coronavirus response.\n\nThe headline of an article shared on Facebook claimed: \"Obama waited six months to call swine flu an emergency after thousands died.\"\n\nIn October 2009, after more than 1,000 people in the United States had died of swine flu, also known as H1N1, Obama declared a national emergency.\n\nBut six months earlier, his administration declared H1N1 a public health emergency. At that point, no deaths in the United States had occurred.", "lang": "en"}
