The claim is false; Singapore General Hospital (SGH) said the bill was for medical services unrelated to COVID-19; the photo was also taken from a fundraising campaign webpage for a woman who was described as suffering from illnesses unrelated to COVID-19.\n\nThe photo was published on Facebook here on April 26, 2020.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cSGH Hospital Bill For COVID-19 Patient 18 Days Stay. Total bil [sic] amount SD180,143.00. / No joke / Pls Stay at Home & Stay Safe..\u201d\n\nThe photographed hospital bill is dated February 27, 2020 and bears SGH\u2019s letterhead. A logo and a watermark for GIVE.Asia, an online fundraising platform, is also visible in the photo.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe photo was also shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook here, here and here.\n\nIn response to the misleading posts, a spokesperson for SGH said on Facebook on April 28 that the photo had been shared with \u201cfalse claims.\u201d\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cIt has been brought to our attention that a hospital bill (case number: xxxxxxx469H) dated 27 Feb 2020 belonging to one of our patients has resurfaced and is circulating on social media and text message platforms. There was claim that the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. This is not true.\n\n\u201cThe said patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. We urge the public to exercise social responsibility and not to circulate any false claims.\u201d\n\nThe photo of the bill was taken from a fundraising campaign page on GIVE.Asia, titled: \u201cHelp my wife fight for her life in ICU\u201d.\n\nThe campaign was started by a man identified as Gan Chang in order to fund treatment for his wife, Wen Bin, according to the GIVE.Asia webpage. Wen Bin was admitted to SGH in January 2020 and suffered from a number of ailments including severe aplastic anemia, tuberculosis and pneumonia, the website states.\n\nOn the GIVE.Asia post, Gan Chang says: \u201cWen Bin was diagnosed with both severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and tuberculosis in January at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH)... she developed a 40 degree fever, where she was diagnosed with severe pneumonia.\n\n\u201cWen Bin soon needed intubation and support from a medical ventilator to help her breathe, and was admitted into the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on 10 February 2020.\n\n\u201cThe growing cost has been a constant source of stress for Wen Bin, myself and her family, such that it makes her think twice about agreeing to certain treatment procedures.\u201d\n\nCloser examination of the photo in the misleading posts and the GIVE.Asia post shows the bill is addressed to Wen Bin.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the bill, with the addressee's name circled in red by AFP:\n\nThe Singaporean government pays \u201cCOVID-19 testing fees and hospital bill in full\u201d for citizens and long-term residents, according to a Ministry of Health statement dated March 9. The department added in a separate statement released on March 24 that anyone who travels in defiance of the government's travel advisory will not qualify for free treatment.", "lang": "en"}
