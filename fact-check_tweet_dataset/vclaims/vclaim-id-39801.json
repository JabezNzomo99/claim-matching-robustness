No, that's not true: in reality Trump has no plans to introduce such blatantly unconstitutional legislation, the story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to mislead Trump supporters and Republicans into sharing made up stories that are clearly marked as satire when you actually click them. Articles from the site are frequently copied by foreign-run fake news websites. The people liking and sharing these stories are enriching foreign website operators (or a liberal from Maine) via the ad revenue generated with the content which is probably not what they expected or wanted.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by BustaTroll.org on October 1, 2019 titled \"Trump Wants To Make Mocking Jesus Christ A Hate Crime\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe story is a work of fiction: the original website that published it had several disclaimers on the page to explain that and the article was posted under two categories named \"Satire and/or Conservative Fan Fiction\" and \"Satirical Powers of an Orange President\".\n\nThe parts about being jailed for mocking Buddhism, Hinduism or Islam are complete inventions as such laws would go directly against the First Amendment of the United States Constitition. So would a law that prohibited mocking Jesus Christ and Donald Trump (the real one, not the one in this satirical article) presumably knows that.\n\nA hate crime is defined by the FBI as:\n\nSo just mocking a religion is not a hate crime and never will be. Punching someone in the face because of their religion would be a hate crime (and just punching them in the face to rob them would be a \"regular\" crime).\n\nThe site that published the satirical article is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run byself-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry extremely visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nHere is a video of Blair explaining how his process works:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes bustatroll.org as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
