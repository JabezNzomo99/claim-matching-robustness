Secondly, there was no official source or authentic information in the story. In fact, the story is riddled with grammatical and spelling errors.\n\nTake this for example, the story goes on to say that the revelation has been made by \u2018Jianli Yang\u2019 who has been identified as a former Chinese military official and a son of a leader in the Chinese communist party. The article further goes on to spell his name as \u2018Gianli\u2019.\n\nBut in reality, Jianli is a Chinese dissident residing in United States of America. Speaking to The Quint he also clarified that he was neither associated with the PLA nor was his father a leader of the Communist Party of China.\n\nHowever, he recently wrote an opinion piece in The Washington Times in which he argued that admitting the number of casualties might cause \u201cdomestic unrest\u201d. Nowhere in the piece did he mentioned that 100 Chinese soldiers were killed in the Galwan Valley.", "lang": "en"}
