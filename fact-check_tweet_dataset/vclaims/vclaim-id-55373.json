Many of her works, including \u201cMurder on the Orient Express\u201d and \u201cThe ABC Murders,\u201d feature her popular detective character Hercule Poirot.\n\nHowever, the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post appears nowhere in these novels, or any of her others. Searching her autobiography and collections of her short stories and plays turned up no matches either.\n\nTwo experts told the Daily Caller via email that they did not recognize the quote as being Christie\u2019s, though \u201cAgatha Christie at Home\u201d author Hilary Macaskill noted that it sounded like something the mystery writer would say.\n\n\u201cShe did write about her own experience of writing and did give advice,\u201d said Macaskill, \u201cbut after also checking through my files, I can see nothing that approximates this statement.

Forster Say \u2018We Must Be Willing To Let Go Of The Life We Have Planned\u2019?)\n\nThe website Quote Investigator traced a variation of the quote back to a 1923 issue of the Coshocton Tribune newspaper, where it appeared in an advertisement that read, \u201cHalf the game of getting ahead is just getting started.\u201d\n\nIt has also been falsely attributed to author and satirist Mark Twain.", "lang": "en"}
