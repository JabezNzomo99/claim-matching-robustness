No, that's not true, the story was made up by a site that posts fictional stories about bizarre crimes and sex acts and was then copied by another such site where it went viral. It did not happen, the events were not real.\n\nThe story went viral as an article published by Huzlers on May 27, 2018 titled \"Man Kills His Best Friend For Not Saying \"No Homo\" After 10-hour Anal Session\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nIn a bizarre event that happened last night, 21-year old Tyrone Smith kill.ed his so-called best friend, Xavier Johnson, because after a 10-hour anal session between 2 completely hetero.sexual men, Xavier didn't say \"No homo\" or \"No homo bro\", thus, automatically converting it into non-heterosexual sex. The incident happened last night in Florida, in a small apartment in Orlando. Tyrone stabbed his friend 18 times in the chest and then called an ambulance, but it was too late. Before the ambulance came, Tyrone stabbed him one last time, just to make sure he passed away.\n\nThat site copied it from 8shit.net:\n\nAt least one of the people pictured in the mugshots was involved in killing a friend but it happened because a gun went off:\n\nHuzlers styles itself as a \"fauxtire\" website and carries a disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nAccording to Splinter News the site is run by Pablo Reyes and David Martinez and according to Buzzfeed Reyes is involved with several other fake news websites. They tend to shy away from political stories, opting instead to write for a more \"urban\" audience, with stories about rappers, criminals and celebrities.\n\nWe wrote about huzlers.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: White Girl Who Said N-Word At Kendrick Lamar's Concert NOT Beat By Group Of Black Students At School\n\u2022 Fake News: Babysitter On Crystal Meth Did NOT Eat 3-Month-Old Toddler AGAIN\n\u2022 Fake News: Woman Did NOT Shoot Boyfriend For Catching Her Cheating Without Permission To Catch Her\n\u2022 Fake News: Prom Limo Driver Did NOT Crash Intentionally After Students Play Lil Pump's 'Gucci Gang' Via Aux Cord\n\u2022 Fake News: 'BBQ Becky' Did NOT Call 911 On A Black Police Officer Who Pulled Her Over", "lang": "en"}
