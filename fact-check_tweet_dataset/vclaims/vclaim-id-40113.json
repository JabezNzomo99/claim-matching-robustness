But while Planned Parenthood was cleared in resulting investigations, Daleidon and Merritt were criminally charged and are currently facing 15 counts of felony invasion of privacy in California.\n\nThe LifeSite story presents readers with a horror movie-like scenario taken, as it claims, from the testimony of a woman the court identifies only as \u201cDoe 12\u201d but whom LifeSite says is the \u201cCEO of StemExpress\u201d: Beating hearts are being snatched out of live babies in an organ-harvesting scheme. It\u2019s a sensational, graphic claim that reflects cultural tropes. But it\u2019s not true.\n\nThe gist of the story can be distilled from a quote by Peter Breen, an attorney from the Thomas More Society, a conservative legal-activist organization, which is representing Daleiden pro bono.\n\n\u201cIf you have a fetus with an intact head and an intact body, and intact extremities, that is something that would indicate that child was born alive, and then had their organs cut out of them, or that that child was the victim of an illegal partial-birth abortion,\u201d Breen told LifeSite.\n\nOur efforts to reach Breen about this comment were unsuccessful. But here\u2019s what the LifeSite story reports in support of that comment:\n\nBreen told the court that StemExpress was mentioned in connection with Stanford University studies where Langendorff perfusion was used, a technique that \u201crequires a beating heart.\u201d She hesitated to answer because, she said, \u201cthere\u2019s so much targeting of researchers.\u201d However, Judge Christopher Hite told her the question was relevant. \u201cYes, we have provided heart tissue to Stanford,\u201d Doe 12 said. She also admitted that CMP photos are accurate and that sometimes a baby\u2019s intact calvarium is attached to the baby\u2019s body and sometimes it is not.\n\nIt\u2019s a leap to claim that supplying heart tissue to Stanford, \u201cwhere Langendorff perfusion was used,\u201d means that StemExpress supplied beating hearts to the university. In fact, the claim betrays an ignorance of what the Langendorff perfusion is when it is applied in the context of stem cell research.\n\nWe spoke to one researcher whose work has involved fetal heart stem cells as well as the Langerdorff perfusion technique. This researcher, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the topic, explained to us that there are two basic ways a Langerdorff perfusion is used. While one way does involve getting a heart to beat directly after it has been removed from a laboratory animal, the method that is relevant for stem cell research does not. The latter approach uses enzymes to digest away tissue to isolate heart stem cells. These hearts do not arrive at the lab \u201cbeating,\u201d the scientist told us, nor could they be made to beat again, given the time it takes to transport the tissue.\n\nSimilarly, researchers sometimes work with fetal brain tissue to research neurological problems with stem cells. Though it is certainly possible, fully intact fetal heads are uncommon in the samples that arrive for work in research samples. While we do not know what specific testimony led to the discussion of intact fetal heads, its alleged mention in court is not evidence of an illegal partial-birth abortion.\n\nState laws vary, but in California, consent is required prior to the donation of fetal tissue, and it is illegal to profit from fetal donation or procurement.\n\nState prosecutors had requested the judge in Daleidon and Merritt\u2019s criminal case issue a gag order barring their attorneys from speaking to the media, stating that Doe 12 has been subject to intimidation and threats as a result of her testimony. Prosecutors cited Breen\u2019s \u201cinaccurate\u201d portrayal of her testimony in the LifeSite story as well as the CMP Twitter account that has live-tweeted the hearing and identified unnamed witnesses by giving their organizations and job titles.\n\nDoe 12 filed a report with the California Department of Justice alleging that after her Sept. 5, 2019, testimony, a woman pulled up alongside her as she drove home, screamed at her, filmed her, and attempted to collide with her vehicle. The investigator also wrote that one of Doe 12\u2019s neighbors had seen a car parked near her home on several occasions during the hearings and believed someone was \u201ccasing\u201d Doe 12\u2019s home.\n\n\u201cDoe 12 also provided me with a Life Site News link to an article with the heading, \u2018StemExpress CEO admits selling beating baby hearts, intact baby heads in Daleiden hearing,'\u201d California DOJ Special Agent Brian Caldwell wrote. \u201cThis statement is false and further increases security risk to Doe 12.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco Superior Court Judge Christopher Hite denied the prosecution\u2019s request for a gag order, citing the attorney\u2019s First Amendment rights and noting that prosecutors had failed to show a connection between the alleged harassment and statements made by Daleiden\u2019s attorney. But the judge also stated that anyone caught intimidating a witness would be prosecuted.", "lang": "en"}
