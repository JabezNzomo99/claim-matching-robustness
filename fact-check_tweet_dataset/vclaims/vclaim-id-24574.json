Obama wanted \u201csustained, high-level focus\u201d from the White House on that issue, \u201cand then he turned to the vice president and said, \u2018Joe, you know more about Iraq than anyone and I want you to take care of that,\u2019\u201d said Antony Blinken, who was Biden\u2019s national security adviser in the White House and then deputy secretary of state from 2013 to 2015.\n\nPrivately, the various leadership factions in Iraq all confided that they wanted some U.S. forces to remain as a bulwark against sectarian violence. But none was willing to take that position publicly, and Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki concluded that any Status of Forces Agreement, which would give legal protection to those forces, would have to be submitted to the Iraqi parliament for approval. That made reaching agreement very difficult given the internal politics of Iraq, but representatives of the Defense and State departments, with scrutiny from the White House, tried to reach a deal. We had leverage. We could, for instance, have threatened to withdraw reconstruction aid to Iraq if al-Maliki would not support some sort of continued U.S. military presence. My fear, as I voiced to the President and others, was that if the country split apart or slid back into the violence that we\u2019d seen in the years immediately following the U.S. invasion, it could become a new haven for terrorists to plot attacks against the U.S. Iraq\u2019s stability was not only in Iraq\u2019s interest but also in ours. I privately and publicly advocated for a residual force that could provide training and security for Iraq\u2019s military. Under Secretary of Defense Mich\u00e8le Flournoy did her best to press that position, which reflected not just my views but also those of the military commanders in the region and the Joint Chiefs. But the President\u2019s team at the White House pushed back, and the differences occasionally became heated. Flournoy argued our case, and those on our side viewed the White House as so eager to rid itself of Iraq that it was willing to withdraw rather than lock in arrangements that would preserve our influence and interests.\n\nBiden spokesman Andrew Bates said that \u201cunder the vice president\u2019s leadership, the administration decided on and met key milestones along the way to the full drawdown \u2014 for instance, reducing our troop presence to 50,000 and then removing all of them from Iraqi cities.\u201d Bates added: \u201cChallenging negotiations concerning leaving a small residual force for training and counterterrorism purposes occurred in 2011; but the Iraqi government refused to provide our forces with basic legal protections. The subsequent deployment to help the Iraqi government defeat ISIS was a separate mission involving a smaller number of military personnel, with Iraqi forces taking the lead in combating ISIS on the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration had tried to reach an agreement for keeping additional troops in Iraq, with many top officials (including Clinton) believing a troop extension was essential,\u201d we found in a fact check of former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.). \u201cWhen that deal fell through, in part because the White House did not press hard enough, Obama eagerly touted it as a campaign promise that was kept \u2014 until the rise of the Islamic State forced the administration to send troops back to Iraq. Then suddenly it was the Iraqi government\u2019s fault that the troops were no longer in Iraq. Moreover, the reason for rejecting a deal with Iraq in 2011 \u2014 the lack of an immunity agreement endorsed by parliament \u2014 was quietly forgotten.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
