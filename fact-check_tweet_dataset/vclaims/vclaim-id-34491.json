Let\u2019s check the authenticity of the claim. \n\n\n\nFact: The last rites of \u2018Disha\u2019 were performed at the Puranapul Cemetery in Hyderabad. The premises in the viral video do not match with that of the actual video. So, the video is an unrelated video. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched on YouTube with keywords \u2018Disha last rites\u2019, a video of \u2018ETV Andhra Pradesh\u2019 was found. The video dated November 28, 2019, had the title \u2018Disha last rites completed at Puranapul\u2019. When we went through the video, it was found that the premises of cremation in the viral video were different from that of the \u2018ETV Andhra Pradesh\u2019 news video. A photo in the article of \u2018Sakshi Samachar\u2019 that reported about the cremation of Disha even had pictures of similar premises as that of the news video. So, the video in the post is not that of Disha\u2019s last rites.\n\n\n\nTo conclude, an unrelated video is being shared as the last rites of the Hyderabad gang-rape victim. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
