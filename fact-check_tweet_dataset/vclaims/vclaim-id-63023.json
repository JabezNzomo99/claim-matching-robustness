If users wanted their accounts to \u201cremain free\u201d and avoid being billed 0.01 per message, they must, according to the text, forward the message to 10 contacts (red flag #2: good advice doesn\u2019t usually require being shared to a specific number of people):\n\nWe hope no one spent any time looking for little blue lights, because this message is complete nonsense. (Red flag #3: The paper? What year is this?)\n\nIt was nearly identical to one example included in a rolling fact check that we originally published in December 2009 and have updated many times since as different variations of this hoax have emerged over time.\n\nThose who attempted to exempt themselves from the charge thereby spread the lie even further, thus doing the leg work of the hoaxsters. (The logical disconnect of the practical joke seemed to evade many: If Facebook were bent upon extracting fees from its users, why would it choose to exempt any of them?)\n\nWe rate the newer variation as False, again, because, if Facebook \u2014 one of the most widely used sites in the history of the internet \u2014 had reversed course on its longstanding promise to remain a free site, it would have probably been mentioned somewhere on its website or on the internet at large. We found no such announcement.\n\nFurthermore, the above-displayed message resembles other messages that have been publicly debunked by Facebook representatives in the company\u2019s Help community forum:\n\n\n\nIt may be worth noting that the 0.01 price could conceivably have some tie to reality, but not in the context of Facebook charging user fees.\n\nOn April 24, 2020, Facebook announced it was rolling out or expanding several features, among them the option for users to send video creators some \u201cstars\u201d while they are live streaming. (Imagine sending a video blogger you like a 1-cent tip per \u201clike\u201d \u2014 generous!) But that transaction would be optional, and the money would be sent to the content creator (it\u2019s unclear what, if any, \u201ccut\u201d Facebook receives per star sold). It\u2019s not the same as charging a user a per-message fee to use Facebook.\n\nAlthough Facebook has recently announced plans to expand opportunities for publishers and creators to monetize certain content or raise donations on Facebook, that doesn\u2019t appear to change the fact that users can still generally use Facebook\u2019s basic platform tools for free (unless users really want to offer money).\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, would you send it to 10 friends? (Just kidding. Sort of.)\n\nHave you seen other variations of this claim? Let us know.", "lang": "en"}
