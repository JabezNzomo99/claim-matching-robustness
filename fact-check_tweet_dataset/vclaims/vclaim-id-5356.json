No, that's total nonsense, it is not true. But a post from a French website making that claim went massively viral today even though it carried a disclaimer saying it was made up. A translated version from the English version of the site was also put up but it did not go viral yet.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Science Info on July 23, 2018 titled \"Un \u00e9v\u00e9nement cosmique qui n'arrive que tous les 35 000 ans : le 27 juillet 2018, la plan\u00e8te Mars sera aussi grosse que la Lune\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe English version of the article went like this:\n\nHowever Scienceinfo.fr carries following text on its \"about\" page:\n\nThis is basically the same text which can be found on the \"about\" page of scienceinfo.news, the English version of the site:\n\nThis ScienceInfo.news website is the English version of the French ScienceInfo.fr scientific information website. Now, all you need is to be just a little curious and click on this link to find out that this scientific information site publishes totally false or sensationally fake information, which is, moreover, not true at all. Let it be said once and for all: the site ScienceInfo.news is a parody, satirical, unnerving and shameless site. All information presented herein is, unfortunately for some and fortunately for others, totally fabricated. In short, everything here is false. This includes names and quotes attributed to imaginary people or companies. If the activites and quotes are attributed to real people as well as real facts about them, they are obviously false and devised to emphasize the grotesque nature of articles. In short, do not believe everything you are told and, even more so, everything you read on the internet. Keep alert... and remember to smile\n\nJust for reference: the moon is about 238,855 miles away from Earth, while the shortest distance between Earth and Mars is about 33.9 million miles (but usually it is way more). That's more than 140 times as far. The diameter of Mars is only about twice that of the Moon. So they can't ever have the same size in the sky unless something really dramatic happened to the orbits of either Mars or the Moon.\n\nHowever, don't despair just yet: there will be something to see in the sky on July 27, 2018 because there will be a full lunar eclipse, meaning the Moon will completely pass through the shadow of Earth, making it go dark temporarily.", "lang": "en"}
