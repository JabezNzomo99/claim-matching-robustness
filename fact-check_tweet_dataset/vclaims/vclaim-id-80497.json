However the link (https://www.bbc.com/news/world/asia/india) leads to the BBC\u2019s India page. A spokesperson for the BBC told BOOM that the survey is fake.\n\nThe fake message twists an opinion poll conducted by Jan Ki Baat which announced its results four days ago. The opinion poll by Jan ki Baat was an on-ground survey conducted by speaking to 1.2 lakh respondents in the Karnataka. According to the actual survey, BJP could win 102-108 seats with Congress bagging only 72-74 seats followed by JDS at 42-44 seats. The survey further predicts that even though the BJP will have a considerable edge over the Congress in 224-member assembly, there won\u2019t be a majority for any party with chances of a hung assembly highly plausible. The Jan Ki Baat opinion poll was featured on Republic TV. - Karnataka Elections 2018: Jan Ki Baat Opinion Poll Says BJP Crossing 100 Seats, Congress Reduced To Double Digits\n\nThe fake WhatsApp message twists these results and makes up a fictitious Janta ki Baat survey and claiming a sample size of 10.20 lakh respondents as opposed to only 1.2 lakh respondents in the original survey.\n\nAccording to the fake poll, BJP is set to get 125-135 seats making it the single largest party with a \u201cclear majority over Congress\u201d which will only get 35 seats, it claims. The fake message also states, \u201cPM Modi, Amit Shah ,Yogi Adityanath and former Karnataka CM Yeddyurappa are campaigning relentlessly for the BJP in the state.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
