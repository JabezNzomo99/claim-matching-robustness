During the Covid-19 pandemic free school meal eligibility has been extended to some, though not all, children in this group.\n\n\u201cNo recourse to public funds\u201d is a condition applied to people with temporary immigration status and migrants without leave to remain in the UK. This means they have no access to the majority of welfare benefits, including Universal Credit as Mr Timms said.\n\nOrdinarily, this would mean that children in this category would not qualify for free school meals as it is usually just based on whether the child\u2019s family is in receipt of certain benefits.\n\nHowever the government has said: \u201cDuring the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, we are temporarily extending free school meals eligibility to include some groups who have no recourse to public funds (NRPF).\u201d\n\nThose groups are children of \u201cZambrano carers\u201d (where the child is a British citizen), children of families with a right to remain under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and children of families receiving support under Section 17 of the Children Act 1989.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked the Department for Education what proportion of children with no recourse to public funds this covers and will update this piece if we receive a reply.\n\nFor children not attending school due to the pandemic, and over the holidays, food vouchers are being substituted for meals in school.", "lang": "en"}
