But within a few years, the volume of travelers and flights was up again, leading to significant travel delays at the biggest airports. Federal officials decided that air traffic operations had reached a critical point.\n\nIn December 2003, Congress authorized the FAA to plan for a long-term air traffic control overhaul, to be completed in 2025. In January 2004, then-Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta announced the Next Generation Air Transportation System, or \u201cNextGen.\u201d This program would modernize and expand FAA facilities and technologies by building new air traffic control facilities and computer systems and advanced weather satellite and radar systems.\n\n\u201cI know that we won\u2019t see the full benefits of this activity before my tenure as secretary of transportation has ended,\u201d Mineta said in his January 2004 announcement speech at the Aero Club of Washington. \u201cNevertheless, I am investing my personal time in this initiative because of its critical importance to the future of U.S. aviation.\u201d\n\nThen, 2006 became the worst year for air traffic \u2014 worse than 2000 \u2014 and 2007 saw a return to pre-9/11 figures in the number of air passengers. FAA officials assured Congress and the public that the NextGen developments will be crucial in finding long-term solutions. Yet as of 2008, there was little progress.\n\n\u201cBy all accounts the Federal Aviation Administration is in need of a major overhaul, as called for by the newly announced FAA Modernization Act,\u201d said a January 2008 editorial in the Aerospace America magazine. \u201cAt the same time, however, the agency is currently operating under a continuing resolution, as its budget is bandied about in Congress. And off in the distance stands NextGen.\u201d\n\nFrom fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2016, the FAA received $7.4 billion for programs and activities the agency identified as NextGen, representing 4 percent of Congress\u2019s total appropriations to the FAA during that period, according to a November 2016 Government Accountability Office report. The FAA spent 2004 through 2006 planning for its transition to NextGen, and began its research and development by fiscal 2007. Of the $7.4 billion, the FAA received $7.1 billion in fiscal 2009-2016.\n\nHas it \u201ctotally failed\u201d? Not quite. The project has changed over time, and it has faced delays. New technologies emerged, and the industry\u2019s needs changed. But some new capabilities are in place now, or on track to be in place by 2020-2050. The total cost estimate for NextGen evolved but has not increased markedly since the initial projection in fiscal 2004, the GAO found.\n\nHigh-priority projects made progress, but other projects are delayed, according to a May 2017 testimony by Calvin L. Scovel III, the Department of Transportation inspector general: \u201cOur work continues to demonstrate that while FAA has taken some action to implement the reform authorities Congress granted almost two decades ago, it has not achieved the large-scale efficiencies, productivity enhancements, and cost savings intended for these reforms.\u201d\n\nNational Air Traffic Controllers Association President Paul Rinaldi said through collaboration with the aviation industry, FAA is on or ahead of schedule with some of the most critical NextGen programs, such as developing a system to automate communication between controllers and pilots to increase efficiency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to point out that since 2009, we have focused on working together to modernize the system while simultaneously maintaining the safety and efficiency of the world\u2019s busiest, most complex, most diverse, and safest airspace. This is no simple task,\u201d Rinaldi said.\n\nTrump characterizes this program as an Obama-era error, but the planning for the massive overhaul began in 2000. Congress authorized the FAA to tackle these changes in 2003, and the Department of Transportation launched the NextGen program in January 2004. This was always going to be a long-term project to be completed in 2025. There have been delays and changes in the project, but high-priority projects have made progress. Some new capabilities under NextGen are already in effect or on track for 2020-2025, the GAO found.\n\nWhile the majority of $7.4 billion the FAA received for NextGen was given to the agency in fiscal 2009-2016, it represents just 4 percent of the total money appropriated to the FAA between fiscal 2004 (when the program began) and fiscal 2016.
