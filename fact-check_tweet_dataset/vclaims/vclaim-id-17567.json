But this calculation is flawed because some of the money is counted twice or even three times. Oxford Economics confirmed to us that much of it can\u2019t be counted as a \u201ctaxpayer saving\u201d.\n\nHow the \u00a320 billion figure was calculated\n\nThe first element of the \u00a320 billion is the \u00a33.5 billion Oxford Economics estimates it would cost the state per year to educate students who are currently independently schooled. The majority of this is day-to-day spending (like teacher salaries) and the remainder is an estimate for capital spending (like spending on new buildings or land for new schools). Oxford Economics calls this a \u201ctaxpayer saving\u201d.\n\nAs with all these figures, this is only an estimate (and we\u2019re not looking in detail at Oxford Economics\u2019 methodology in this article). For example, it assumes that all independently schooled pupils would need to be educated in newly-built school sites\u2014which wouldn\u2019t necessarily have to be the case.\n\nThen there\u2019s the amount independent schools contribute to the economy. Oxford Economics estimates independent schools to generate \u00a313.7 billion of pre-tax spending, known as Gross Value Added (GVA), of which just over half (\u00a37.1 billion) is direct spending by independent schools (e.g. on teachers\u2019 salaries). Most of the remainder is the day-to-day spending by people who are employed either by independent schools or by companies working with those schools. Put simply, this includes teachers and other employees spending their salaries on food, recreation, and household goods.\n\nIn addition to that \u00a313.7 billion of pre-tax spending is an estimated \u00a34.1 billion of associated tax. Most of this is the income tax and national insurance contributions of school employees or employees in other sectors supported by school spending.\n\nAdding the \u00a33.5bn, \u00a313.7bn and \u00a34.1bn gets you to around \u00a321.4bn. But adding these numbers up and describing that figure as \u201ctaxpayer savings\u201d is wrong on many levels.\n\nFirstly, it is wrong to describe most of this money as taxpayer savings.\n\nOxford Economics, who published the report, say private schools generate \u201ctotal quantifiable taxpayer savings\u201d of \u00a33.5 billion per year (that\u2019s the calculation of what it would cost the state to educate the students instead).\n\nIn getting a figure of \u00a320 billion, the Times included the estimated \u00a313.7 billion of economic activity by independent schools and the businesses and people they support. But the amount of money going into the economy as a whole is not the same as taxpayer savings.\n\nThey also count the estimated \u00a34.1 billion of tax revenue derived from spending by independent schools. But much of that spending would also have to occur if the pupils were educated by state schools instead, and so tax revenue would still be generated.\n\nSome of the money is double or triple counted\n\nSecondly, you can\u2019t add up these figures and describe the result as the \u201ceconomic benefits and taxpayer savings\u201d of independent schools, as the Times did in its article.\n\nThat\u2019s because, as we\u2019ve noted already, it double counts (or even triple counts) money across the three figures.\n\nFor example, the \u201ctaxpayer saving\u201d of \u00a33.5 billion estimated by Oxford Economics includes the salaries the state would need to pay teachers to educate these children. But teacher salaries are also part of the \u00a313.7 billion independent schools put into the economy, and contribute to the \u00a34.1 billion they put into taxes, directly or indirectly. So if you just add up all three figures, you\u2019re effectively counting some of the same (or equivalent) money three times over.\n\nThis money wouldn\u2019t all disappear if independent schools didn\u2019t exist\n\nFinally, it\u2019s important to stress that\u2014apart from the \u00a33.5 billion estimated taxpayer saving\u2014these figures estimate the existing contribution of independent schools, not the amount that would be lost if they didn\u2019t exist.\n\nTake the \u00a313.7 billion independent schools contribute to the economy pre-tax. If independent schools didn\u2019t exist, it\u2019s unlikely that \u00a313.7 billion would disappear from the national GVA. Parents would likely spend most of this money on other things, and many of the teachers employed by private schools would presumably find jobs elsewhere.\n\nSo while you could argue the independent school sector contributes \u00a313.7 billion to GVA currently, it\u2019s important to note that this doesn\u2019t mean the national GVA is \u00a313.7 billion higher because of them.", "lang": "en"}
