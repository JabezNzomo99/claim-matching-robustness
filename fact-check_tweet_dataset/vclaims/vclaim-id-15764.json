BJP minister Smriti Irani replied to Bhaudauria tweet saying that Congress\u2019s \u201csleight of hand\u201d depicts the party\u2019s corrupt mindset. \u201c\u091c\u092c \u0907\u0936\u0924\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0939\u0940 \u2018 sleight of hand \u2018 \u0928\u091c\u093c\u0930 \u0906\u090f \u0924\u094b \u0935\u093f\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0930\u0947\u0902 CONgress \u0915\u0940 \u092d\u094d\u0930\u0937\u094d\u091f \u092e\u093e\u0928\u0938\u093f\u0915\u0924\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u091c\u0921\u093c\u0947\u0902 \u0915\u093f\u0924\u0928\u0940 \u0917\u0939\u0930\u0940 \u0939\u0948\u0902 (When advertisement itself has a \u201csleight of hand\u201d, one can only imagine how deeply corrupt is Congress\u2019s mindset.)\u201d read her tweet (archive).\n\nWhat is the mystery of the \u201cthird hand\u201d?\n\nThe photograph used by Congress for the advertisement of NYAY (Nyuntam Aay Yojana) is part of a larger image where several other people are visible in the background. Keeping the focus on Gandhi and the old woman, the background was blurred out in the picture used in the advertisement.\n\nThe photograph was tweeted by Congress in 2015.\n\nSocial media claims regarding the authenticity of the image are, thus, misleading. The photograph is from an actual interaction during Rahul Gandhi\u2019s visit to flood-affected areas of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in 2015. The background has been blurred but the man\u2019s hand was not cropped by Congress before publishing the picture as an ad for NYAY.", "lang": "en"}
