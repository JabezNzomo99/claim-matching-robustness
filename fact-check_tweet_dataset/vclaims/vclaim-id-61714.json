Mike Huckabee for supporting a bill that would have allowed illegal immigrants who graduated from Arkansas high schools to be eligible for in-state tuition rates at state schools.\n\nRomney, on the other hand, has said repeatedly that he opposed a similar measure when he was governor of Massachusetts. He does so in a television ad. That claim is accurate.\n\nRomney vetoed a bill in 2004 that would have allowed illegal immigrants who graduated from Massachusetts high schools to pay in-state tuition at state-run colleges and universities.\n\n\"I hate the idea of in any way making it more difficult for kids, even those who are illegal aliens, to afford college in our state,\" Romney said at the time. \"But equally, perhaps a little more than equally, I do not want to create an incentive to do something which is illegal.\"\n\nIn 2006, the Massachusetts legislature tried to pass the measure again in order to override his veto, but was unsuccessful.\n\nThe Truth-O-Meter says Romney's statement is True.", "lang": "en"}
