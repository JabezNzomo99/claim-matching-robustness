A spokesperson for DeVos refuted the claim.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Trump administration has been vocal about its commitment to reopening schools in the fall, despite risks associated with the coronavirus pandemic. DeVos, in particular, has spoken publicly about that goal multiple times in the last week.\n\n\u201cEvery state and every community has school leadership that can sit down and can figure out solutions to the problem of reopening,\u201d DeVos told Fox News\u2019 Sandra Smith in a July 9 interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if, it\u2019s just a matter of how.\u201d\n\nA viral Facebook post now claims DeVos publicly admitted this decision would likely result in the deaths of children, saying, \u201cSo Betsy Devos today said \u2018only\u2019 .02% of kids are likely to die when they go back to school. That\u2019s 14,740 children.\u201d\n\nBut the Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence to support the claim that she made the comment. Had she made such a remark, major news outlets likely would have reported on it, yet none have.

She appeared on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d and CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d July 12 but made no such admission about potential deaths in either instance. Nor did she make the remark July 9 during appearances at the White House and on Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d\n\n\u201cThe secretary has never and would never say such a thing,\u201d Angela Morabito, the press secretary for the Education Department, told the DCNF in an email. \u201cThis is a total lie. She would not be working to get kids back to school if it were unsafe.\u201d\n\nDeVos has been adamant that the plan to return children to school is sound, asserting that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing in the data that suggests that kids being in school is in any way dangerous,\u201d during her appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d with host Chris Wallace.\n\nWhile the available data suggests children are less likely to develop COVID-19 and less likely to be hospitalized or die if they do, that is not to say they are completely immune from the dangers associated with the disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that tens of thousands of American children under the age of 18 have contracted the disease, and a small percentage of those children have died. There is also a risk that children might spread the disease to adults who are more at risk for it.\n\nDr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus coordinator, warned in early July that the role children play in the spread of the outbreak remains unknown in part because the data on school-aged children is limited.\n\n\u201cIf you look across all of the tests that we\u2019ve done, and when we have the age, the portion that has been the lowest tested portion is the under-10-year-olds,\u201d said Birx during a press conference last week.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
