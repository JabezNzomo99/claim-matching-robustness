On September 4, a Moscow court extended his house arrest indefinitely.\n\nSerebrennikov has been charged with embezzling about $1.1 million in government grants. He denies the charges, saying he and his colleagues spent the money on funded projects that he developed into popular productions.\n\nSerebrennikov\u2019s arrest has been widely criticized, both inside Russia and internationally, with critics accusing the Russian government of tightening censorship and putting political pressure on the arts and cultural community.\n\nA petition calling for Serebrennikov\u2019s release that was posted on the Change.org website has been signed by 36 leading members of the European arts world. \u201cThe charges against him are untenable and indicative of the fact that the intention is to silence an internationally renowned director,\u201d the petition reads.\n\nThe PEN American Center has also focused on Serebrennikov\u2019s plight, describing him as \u201can activist who has espoused views critical of the Russian government\u201d thus a \u201cdesirable target of repression by the Russian government.\u201d\n\nIn response to the criticism, the Kremlin has categorically denied that Serebrennikov is a target of state censorship.\n\nOn September 5, speaking at a press conference in China, Putin said: \u201cThe authorities have no issues with Serebrennikov except for one: legal compliance in using budget money.\u201d The Russian president added that Serebrennikov\u2019s arrest had nothing to do with politics, and that only a court can determine his guilt.\n\nPutin\u2019s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said that \u201cto call this some kind of manifestation of censorship would be wrong.\u201d He added that when the state funds arts projects, \u201cof course\u2026 the state has the right to designate certain topics that are of particular interest to the state.\u201d\n\nA strong indicator that the embezzlement case against Serebrennikov has a political subtext is the fact that it has been assigned to the FSB\u2019s 2nd Service, which is tasked with \u201cprotection of the constitutional order and the fight against terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe Russian business daily RBC quoted several informed sources who indicated that the FSB\u2019s 2nd Service is involved in overseeing the arts and culture.\n\n\u201cCultural institutions can be used by the enemy for propaganda, as structures forming a hostile attitude toward the Russian Federation,\u201d a former top FSB official, Aleksandr Mikhailov, told RBC. On the basis of these cultural institutions, he added, \u201crecruitment can be carried out.\u201d\n\nGiven that the charges against Serebrennikov amount to a relatively minor corruption case, the involvement of the FSB\u2019s 2nd Service makes little sense.\n\nDespite the Kremlin\u2019s denial that the charges against the director amount to censorship, it is by no means the first case in which the Russian government has been accused of persecuting cultural figures. Another recent example is that of Natalya Sharina, director of the state-run Library of Ukrainian Literature in Moscow, who was convicted of extremism on June 5.\n\nLast October, Konstantin Raikin, a leading Russian theater director and actor, accused the Russian authorities of taking the country back to Stalin-era censorship.\n\nIn response, Dmitry Peskov, in an interview aired on state television in December, denied that the government is engaging in censorship in culture and the arts.\n\nMany observers, both inside and outside Russia, do not share that view.\n\n\u201cNo one doubts that we are witnessing a political show trial that marks the end of the independence of post-Soviet culture,\u201d wrote Irina Prokhorova, a prominent literary critic and cultural historian, in a Moscow Times op-ed about the Serebrennikov case. \u201cThis was an unequivocal message to the cultural community: Their hopes to protect even a small part of their personal autonomy from state pressure had gone up in the air like smoke.\u201d\n\nBoth Andres Aslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, and Jeffrey Mankoff, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told Polygraph.info that they found Peskov\u2019s statement \u201cmisleading.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Russian government wants to keep fine art dependent on the state, not on private commercial financing or donations,\u201d said Aslund. \u201cIn doing so, it can influence cultural expressions, and they do so. The less private financing that goes into theater and other expressive arts, the greater the state control of expression.\u201d\n\nMankoff said Peskov was being \u201cmisleading by focusing on the conditions for the receipt of state funds.\u201d\n\n\u201cSerebrennikov was arrested and his studios have come under physical attack,\u201d he added. \u201cThe arrest and the attack, which the state has not been particularly eager to investigate, are what amount to censorship here, not haggling over the award of funds.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
