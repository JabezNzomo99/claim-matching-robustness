Biden Jr., Senator Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar on Tuesday before the debate.\n\nOur reporters followed all of the exchanges and fact-checked the candidates, providing context and explanation.\n\nSix of the candidates vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination took the stage on Tuesday night in Des Moines for their last debate before the Iowa caucuses kick off the primary season in less than three weeks. Here is how the candidates\u2019 remarks stacked up against the truth. Senator Bernie Sanders said that his \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan would cost \u201csubstantially less\u201d than the current health care system, a characterization that many serious analysts contest. \u201cMedicare for all, which will guarantee comprehensive health care to every man, woman and child, will cost substantially less than the status quo.\u201d This is exaggerated. Medicare for all would be an enormous change to the health care system, and many key details are still unsettled. That makes it very difficult to provide precise estimates of what such a system would cost. A number of serious economists have considered the question in a rigorous way. Some believe that a Medicare for all system could cost less over the long run than the future under current policy. But several believe it will cost more. Medicare for all would be able to squeeze savings out of the current system. It could pay lower prices to doctors, hospitals and drugmakers. It would eliminate health insurance profit. And it could eliminate spending on administration and paperwork by simplifying the system.\n\nBut it also has features that would tend to increase spending. By covering Americans who currently are uninsured, it would incur new costs. It would also expand benefits beyond what health insurance typically covers, by including dental care and long-term care, among other services. Once those services are covered, economists assume more people will use them. Last year, The Upshot published a summary of several serious estimates of the cost of Mr. Sanders\u2019s program. That summary gives a sense of the range of estimates and the variables that drive the differences between them.\n\nMr. Sanders said that his health care plan would eliminate the large differences between the prices paid for health care in the United States and peer nations, a statement without much evidence to support it. \u201cMedicare for all will end the absurdity of the United States paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and health care in general.\u201d This is exaggerated. Mr. Sanders is correct that nearly every kind of medical service costs more in the United States than in other developed nations. Many health economists believe it is these higher prices paid in the United States that explain the bulk of why the American health care system is so unusually expensive.\n\nA Medicare for all plan like the one Mr. Sanders has proposed would have the power to lower such prices by making the government the only purchaser of health care services. But just because the government could pay less for health care than insurers and patients pay now does not mean that the government could easily reduce American prices to match those of other nations. The health care system in the United States is organized around our current prices, meaning that huge reductions in payments could be disruptive, with the potential to cause hospitals to close or doctors to default on their debts. That\u2019s why most serious analysts believe that even a Medicare for all system could only cut medical prices by so much. The countries with lower payment rates set up systems to limit health care prices decades ago, before the gap with the United States became so large. A Medicare for all system would almost certainly narrow that gap. But the United States would probably continue to pay the highest prices in the world for many health care services. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. tried to explain his vote to authorize the Iraq war. \u201cI said 13 years ago it was a mistake to give the president the authority to go to war.\u201d Mr. Biden was one of 77 senators who voted to authorize the war in Iraq in October 2002 \u2014 and he called that vote a mistake in 2005. The New York Times reviewed how he made that decision nearly two decades ago and found that the episode reveals how he operates \u201cas a Senate dealmaker at heart.\u201d Later in the debate, Mr. Biden suggested that he began to oppose the war in 2003 after weapons inspectors had left the country saying they had found no evidence of illegal weapons. But Mr. Biden continued to justify his support for the war until 2005. On other military engagements, potential and actual, Mr. Biden has exercised more caution. During his bid for the presidency in 2008, for example, Mr. Biden warned that war with Iran \u201cis not just a bad option. It would be a disaster.\u201d When he became vice president, Mr. Biden was a lonely voice in the White House who argued against increasing troop levels in Afghanistan in 2009 \u2014 a fight he ultimately lost. He then repeatedly pushed to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by 2014 and, though President Barack Obama shared that aim, the United States still had troops in Afghanistan when the two men left office.\n\nMr. Sanders said he objected to the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement because it did not address climate change. \u201cEvery major environmental organization has said \u2018no\u2019 to this new trade agreement because it does not even have the phrase \u2018climate change\u2019 in it.\u201d This is true. Democrats fought for language calling for a commitment to the Paris Agreement on climate change, as well as for binding climate change standards, but those provisions did not make it into the final measure that passed the House. That bill, which awaits a vote in the Senate, does not include any mention of climate change.\n\nThis is true. After the Iran nuclear deal was approved by the Obama administration in 2015, Congress voted to require the American president to issue regular certifications that Iran was complying with the agreement\u2019s limits on uranium enrichment and other nuclear activity. Mr. Trump twice approved such certifications, affirming findings of American intelligence agencies that Iran was in compliance. He stopped doing so in October 2017 without citing specific Iranian violations. In May 2018, Mr. Trump abandoned the deal altogether. He made no claim that Iran was in violation but that the \u201chorrible\u201d agreement expired too soon, failed to limit Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program and did not constrain its foreign interventions across the Middle East. Defenders of the deal argue that it was focused narrowly on preventing Iran from acquiring a bomb within 10 to 15 years rather than fundamentally changing Iran\u2019s behavior. Mr. Sanders said that Mr. Biden\u2019s previous support for NAFTA and normalizing trade relations with China damaged the American work force. \u201cAnd the end result of those two, just P.T.N.R. with China, Joe, and Nafta, cost us some four million jobs, as part of the race to the bottom.\u201d This is mostly true. As we reported when this issue came up last September, while NAFTA often receives much of the blame from Democrats for the loss of American manufacturing jobs, it is P.N.T.R. \u2014 Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China \u2014 that economists tend to point to as the cause of more job losses. A 2014 report from the Economic Policy Institute estimated that 851,000 jobs were lost because of the trade deficit with Canada and Mexico. The same group found that the trade deficit in goods with China cost 3.4 million jobs from 2001 to 2017. Still, most economists say that it is difficult to pinpoint blame on specific trade relationships for jobs losses, as trade creates winners and losers across the work force and generally boosts economic growth.
