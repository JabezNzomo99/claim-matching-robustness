No, that's not true: the entire thing was made up in 2016 by a site that habitually invents stories about weird crimes and bizarre sex acts for entertainment purposes. It was not real. Despite this fact the story has reappeared on several websites since.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on April 6, 2016 titled \"Man claiming to be \"the real Prince Harry\" found dead in Irish hotel\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nDublin, Ireland | A British man who claimed to be the \"real\" Prince Harry and to have been forcibly replaced as a child by an impostor, was found dead this morning in his hotel room, in the seaside town of Dun Laoghaire, near the Irish Capital. The Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Irish police) was called on the site early this morning, after some neighbors complained about the smell emanating from his room. They found the body of 31-year old, James Francis Alexander, a young British nobleman mostly known for his claim to be a member of the Royal British family. According to the spokesman of the Irish police, Lt. Seamus O'connor, the young man had multiple bullet wounds, and the police found some signs of struggle in his room, suggesting that he was victim of a violent crime.\n\nThe picture used to illustrate the story was a Dublin crime scene, but it was from a 2016 shooting in connection with a boxing match:\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories.

All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Couple NOT Stuck Together For 16 Hours After Mistaking Super Glue For Lubricant\n\u2022 Fake News: Black Lives Matter Leader NOT Exposed As White Man Using Tanning Injections\n\u2022 Fake News: Florida Man Did NOT Drop Down Pants, Did NOT Sodomize Pink Flamingo To Death\n\u2022 Fake News: Drug mule NOT Arrested After Diarrhea Ejects Cocaine in Middle of Airport\n\u2022 Fake News: Blind Man Did NOT File For Divorce In Texas After Learning His Wife Is Black", "lang": "en"}
