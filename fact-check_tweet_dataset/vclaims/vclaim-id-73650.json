The video shows a few persons beating others. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of Muslims opposing the installation of Ganesh statue in Hyderabad and damaging it. Fact: Moghalpura Police Station SHO has confirmed to FACTLY that both the groups in the video are Hindus. They are also distant relatives and that there is no communal angle to the incident. A minor scuffle broke out when one group opposed the installation of the Ganesh state in front of their house while the other group argued that there were installing the statue at the same place for many years. Also, the statue was not damaged during the fight. It was damaged during transport i.e. before the fight took place. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen we searched about the video, it was found that the same video was posted (archived) by many users on social media claiming the incident happened at Lal Darwaza in Hyderabad.\n\nTo know the factual status of this issue, FACTLY contacted Moghalpura Police Station SHO for further information regarding the incident. He has clarified that there is no communal angle to the incident. He said, \u2018both the parties in the video are Hindus. They are also distant relatives. A minor scuffle broke out when one group opposed the installation of the Ganesh in front of their house while the other group argued that there were installing the statue at the same place for many years. Later, both the groups came to a compromise and no case has been registered\u2019. Also, he clarified that the statue was not damaged during the fight. It was damaged during transport i.e. before the fight.\n\nTo sum it up, both the groups in the video are Hindus. There is no communal angle to the incident.", "lang": "en"}
