The government has also raised the level of advice for those travelling to Italy, Japan and Mongolia in a bid to stop the spread of the disease.\n\nIn NSW, there were 26 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of March 6, including one at a school in northern Sydney, six at a northern Sydney nursing home and two traced to an event at a south-western Sydney hospital.\n\nThe screenshotted post claims staff at an unnamed hospital in the central NSW town of Dubbo say there may be a confirmed COVID-19 case in the area.\n\nAAP FactCheck contacted NSW Health via email on March 2 to ask if there had been any report of a COVID-19 case in Dubbo.\n\nA spokesperson for the agency confirmed in an emailed response that there had been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 coronavirus in Dubbo.\n\nAuthorities say the best way for people to protect themselves and their families against the virus is to clean their hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub, cover their nose and mouth when coughing and sneezing with a tissue or a flexed elbow, avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms, and to stay home if they are sick.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the Facebook post to be false. There have been no confirmed cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus in Dubbo as of March 2, according to the NSW Health, contrary to the claim made in the Facebook post of February 28.
