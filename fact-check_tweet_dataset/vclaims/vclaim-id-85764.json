Contrary to Trump\u2019s tweet, there is nothing illegal about seeking asylum; it would be up to U.S. authorities to decide whether the migrants qualify for asylum. Obviously, if the migrants attempted to cross the border without authorization, that would be illegal, and they could be deported.\n\nMexican authorities have rejected Trump\u2019s complaints that they have not acted against migrants. In a tweet on April 1, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray Caso said: \u201cEvery day Mexico and the U.S. work together on migration throughout the region. Facts clearly reflect this. An inaccurate news report should not serve to question this strong cooperation. Upholding human dignity and rights is not at odds with the rule of law.\u201d\n\nIn any case, even if the filibuster were eliminated, Trump\u2019s immigration proposals would not become law. His proposal was voted down in the Senate on Feb. 15 by a vote of 39 to 60, with 14 Republican senators opposed. In fact, a bipartisan immigration compromise that Trump opposed earned 54 votes, meaning it would have passed if the \u201cnuclear option\u201d were in place.\n\nThe majority of the illicit drugs enter the United States through legal ports of entry, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Traffickers conceal the drugs in hidden compartments within passenger cars or hide them alongside other legal cargo in tractor-trailers and drive the illicit substances right into the United States. Increasingly, traffickers are using more sophisticated methods such as dissolving methamphetamine and cocaine into innocuous liquids.\n\nTrump\u2019s wall proposal addresses neither the reality of drug trafficking into the United States nor key facts of the nation\u2019s drug crisis. In 2014, prescription drugs killed more than twice as many people as heroin and almost five times as many people as cocaine, according the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Center for Health Statistics. Unlike cocaine and heroin, prescription drugs are not as widely trafficked from Mexico.\n\nTrump rescinded President Barack Obama\u2019s executive order protecting undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children with their parents. His action threw the matter to Congress, which has been unable to reach an agreement on how to protect the 700,000 people who had signed up under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program (DACA). Another 1.1 million might also qualify.\n\nUnder NAFTA, the supply chain of the auto industry became integrated between the United States and its immediate neighbors. Auto parts and vehicles produced in each country freely flow over the borders, without tariffs or other restrictions, as thousands of part suppliers serve the automakers that build the vehicles. An estimated 40 percent of goods sent to the United States by Mexico incorporate U.S. content, according to the International Trade Administration.\n\nAs for Mexico having \u201cvery strong border laws,\u201d PolitiFact reported that the White House pointed to a 2010 Washington Times article as evidence \u2014 but the Mexican law was changed in 2011 to decriminalize the act of entering the country without documentation and to allow undocumented immigrants to use education and health services. Moreover, Mexico\u2019s own southern border is much more porous than the U.S. southern border.\n\nTrump appears to have been reacting to criticism of Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns or operates 173 television stations in 108 markets, after Deadspin put together a viral video of various news anchors who were required by the Trump-friendly company to read the exact same script about the fact that \u201csome members of the media use their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda to control \u2018exactly what people think.\u2019 This is extremely dangerous to a democracy.\u201d\n\nAmazon gets bulk shipping rates from the post office. According to Josh Sandbulte, the co-president of a money-management firm that owns FedEx stock, this arrangement gives Amazon below-market rates and effectively subsidizes the online retailer at a rate of $1.46 per box. [Update: Sandbulte\u2019s analysis was based on an estimate in a Citigroup research note. Josh Barro of Business Insider found that Citigroup\u2019s estimate was flawed and that the post office actually offers Amazon below-market rates of 11 cents per box, not $1.46.]", "lang": "en"}
