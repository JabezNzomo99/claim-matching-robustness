Jensen Walcott, 17, was hired at a pizza restaurant in Kansas. The same day, her friend Jake Reed, 17, was hired for the same job. They had the same level of experience. But Walcott found out Reed was making 25 cents per hour more than she was.\n\nWalcott shared her story on social media, and it went viral. Clinton tweeted about it: \u201cGood for you, Jensen. Every woman deserves equal pay, no matter what her age. Keep up the hard work \u2014 and courage!\u201d The teens were invited to the Democratic National Committee, where they spoke out for equal pay.\n\nClinton called on equal-pay legislation to close wage gaps and to protect workers from retaliation for asking about pay. To her credit, Clinton listed three exceptions to fair-pay gaps, in jobs where employees have set salaries and know how much others are being paid: government jobs, military jobs and jobs under union contracts. But in the vast majority of jobs, Clinton said, employees have no idea whether they are being paid fairly.\n\nThis law doesn\u2019t cover \u201csupervisors,\u201d broadly defined as those who have \u201cauthority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action.\u201d Courts have held that \u201csupervisor\u201d applies to university faculty, nurses, bus line dispatchers and seasonal workers.\n\nThe remedies are limited to back pay and reinstatement for the fired employee. So if the retaliation is anything other than firing the employee, there\u2019s no real recourse, according to the law center. Plus, employees need to file such complaints to the National Labor Relations Board, rather than taking it to court. There is no private right of action like other federal statutes that deal with workplace issues, according to the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nWeak remedies and the lack of an explicit protection of all employees make the law a \u201cpaper tiger in many instances,\u201d Greenberger said. Not enough employees and employers know about the protections, she said, as shown by the 62 percent of women and 60 percent of men in private-sector jobs that reported their employers discourage or prohibit them from talking about wage and salary information.\n\n\u201cQuite honestly, there is a lot of confusion about this topic,\u201d said Angela Cornell, director of the Labor Law Clinic at Cornell Law School. \u201cMany people don\u2019t believe they are protected, and many employers think that they have the right to tell employees not to discuss pay amongst themselves and to take disciplinary action against those that violate those kinds of policies. It\u2019s very, very commonplace. . . . But in fact, workers are protected when they are discussing pay.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fair to question how effective this law is, or whether it\u2019s being enforced. Several labor law experts said there\u2019s a lot of confusion about how it\u2019s applied, and that employers and employees believe the protection only applies to union-protected jobs. Employees may not complain about it to the National Labor Relations Board out of fear of retaliation, or because they are unaware they can. And employers may enact pay-secrecy policies, believing it is legal to do so.\n\nAs shown by the exceptions she described in her speech, Clinton clearly knows there is no blanket prohibition or protection of employees when it comes to equal pay or pay transparency. She is calling on an explicit ban on companies from enacting pay-secrecy policies. Even the existing protections are murky, as shown by the fact that the pizza restaurant manager fired the teens while citing a company policy that didn\u2019t exist.\n\nClinton goes too far saying that it\u2019s \u201clegal\u201d for employees to be retaliated against or fired after discussing their pay with co-workers. Had she avoided the word \u201clegal,\u201d this claim may qualify for One Pinocchio, since there are existing gaps in the law and inconsistent application of it that have led to the types of retaliation she describes.", "lang": "en"}
