But, he told us, because brown recluse spiders aren\u2019t native to northern Kentucky, where he lives, and because his customer\u2019s home is regularly serviced, he suspects the spiders came in with a delivery of an artificial Christmas tree, which was where the infestation was concentrated.\n\nOhnefloss told us he initially posted the images with the cautionary tale for his friends and family to see on Facebook, but obliged when someone asked that he make the post public. He woke up the next morning to find the post had been shared thousands of times. People viewing the post outside its context began to ask questions like, \u201cAre brown recluse spiders being found in Amazon delivered boxes?\u201d\n\nThat is very unlikely, Ohnefloss told us. The point of his post, he said, was just to urge people to open newly arrived boxes outside, if they can. \u201cIf you guys are ordering on the internet, just be aware of what could be coming in the box. You don\u2019t have to freak out, but be wary, because we really don\u2019t know where these products originate.\u201d\n\nBut he also wanted to encourage people not to panic about internet rumors of a rash of spiders being delivered into people\u2019s homes via delivery boxes. \u201cSomething like this is probably a one-in-ten-thousand chance,\u201d Ohnefloss told us by phone.\n\nBrown recluse spiders have poisonous bites, but as their name implies, they aren\u2019t aggressive and like to hide in dark places. They only thrive in certain parts of the U.S., namely the Midwest and South Central regions. Generally, as the entomology department at the University of Kentucky reports, \u201cThese spiders are widely over-reported and less common than perceived.\u201d But the venomous bites, when they occur, should be treated seriously.\n\nWe consulted with Rick Vetter, a retired research associate in entomology at the University of California at Riverside, and author of the book \u201cThe Brown Recluse Spider.\u201d Vetter told us it\u2019s not impossible for a spider to make its way into a delivery box, but he agreed that the scenario is unlikely.\n\n\u201cBoth Amazon and Chewy have such high volume, disturbance and illumination in their buildings that it\u2019s not a place that spiders are going to want to be around,\u201d Vetter told us. You\u2019re more like to encounter a brown recluse in a garage or an attic than a busy retail warehouse, he said. Vetter also noted that purchased items shipped from Amazon or Chewy would likely be placed in new boxes that were flattened before they were prepared for shipment.\n\nGenerally you should be aware of your surroundings if you live in a region where brown recluse spiders live, and exercise appropriate caution. The post above wasn\u2019t intended to claim that the poisonous spiders are being sent to homes en masse by retailers via delivery boxes, or that this should be cause for widespread public concern, although it appears many interpreted it that way. It\u2019s unknown whether an errant spider might enter a box, but it\u2019s unlikely. We therefore rate the claim \u201cUnproven.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
