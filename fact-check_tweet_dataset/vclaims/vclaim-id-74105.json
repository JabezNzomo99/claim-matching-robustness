However, the blood-brain barrier is a closed network of blood vessels that cannot be reached simply by introducing a swab into the open nasal cavity and touching the back of the nasopharynx. Nasal swabs are used to collect biological samples from the back of the nasopharynx in order to test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The nasal swab has to be inserted far into the nasal cavity until it reaches the nasopharynx located behind it. The human brain is separated from the nasopharynx by several layers of hard tissue, including bone. It is therefore not possible for nasal swabs to reach the brain or the blood-brain barrier.\n\nA Facebook post shared more than 16,000 times claims that the nasopharyngeal swab (nasal swab), which is widely used to collect biological samples for testing for active SARS-CoV-2 infection (the virus responsible for COVID-19), scrapes and damages the blood-brain barrier (BBB) leading to serious health problems. This claim is incorrect because it is anatomically impossible.\n\nThe BBB is composed of specialized endothelial cells that form the walls of blood vessels in the brain[1]. In contrast, the blood vessels located in the tissues of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx are not made of cells that form a BBB. The structure and function of the cells of the BBB ensure tight regulation of the exchange of molecules between the circulating blood and neurons in the brain. This is crucial to the proper functioning of the brain. Any disruption to the BBB, which can result from stroke or neurological disorders, can lead to severe dysfunction of the central nervous system[1]. Likewise, any medical intervention that causes damage to the BBB could result in neurological dysfunction.\n\nThe nasopharyngeal swab, commonly referred to as a nasal swab, has been widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic[2]. During testing for the presence of active SARS-CoV-2 infection, the swab is introduced into the nose and through the nasal cavity until it reaches the nasopharynx behind it. The swab is then pressed against the back of the nasopharynx and rotated to obtain a sample of nasal mucous which in infected individuals would contain large amounts of virus[3]. While the procedure causes discomfort and may even look alarming, it is anatomically impossible to reach the BBB during this procedure.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, the nasopharynx is separated from the brain by the sphenoid bone and sinus cavities. It is therefore anatomically impossible for the swab to reach the brain without perforating several layers of hard tissue, which is physically impossible using a testing swab considering the materials used to make them and the force needed to perforate the layers of tissue.\n\nIn summary, the brain and the nasopharynx are separated by several layers of biological tissues that cannot be perforated using swabs. In addition, the brain\u2019s network of blood vessels forms a closed circuit, which is not accessible through the nasal cavity and nasopharynx.\n\nThis claim has also been debunked by USA Today, Politifact, and many others.\n\u2022 1 \u2013 Daneman and Prat.
