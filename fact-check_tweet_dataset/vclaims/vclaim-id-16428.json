Six of those votes were on other specific issues. One was voting against the whole Bill.\n\nDuring that debate Diane Abbott asked Theresa May, then Home Secretary and the Minister in charge of the Bill, this question: \u201chas she given no thought to the effect that her measures that are designed to crack down on illegal immigrants could have on people who are British nationals, but appear as if they might be immigrants?\u201d\n\nTheresa May\u2019s reply started: \u201cWe have given a great deal of thought to the way in which our measures will operate.\u201d She did not mention British nationals specifically and concentrates on the complexity of the system the Bill was designed to change.\n\nThe Commonwealth, the Caribbean, or the Windrush generation were not mentioned specifically in this debate.\n\nThe British Nationality Act 1948 made citizens of Commonwealth countries citizens of the UK and Colonies. The Immigration Act 1971 changed the law to grant only temporary residence to most new arrivals, but still allowed people who'd arrived before 1973 to remain in the UK indefinitely.\n\nThe practical effect of the change in the Immigration Act 2014 is disputed. The government says it didn\u2019t remove protection. In a recent debate the current Home Secretary Amber Rudd said that the exemption from deportation for commonwealth citizens was taken out \u201cbecause it was not necessary; those people had the rights under the 1971 legislation.\u201d The problem, she argued, was \u201cthe information to confirm\u201d that people had those rights.", "lang": "en"}
