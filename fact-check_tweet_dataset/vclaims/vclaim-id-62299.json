The claim first appeared in a satirical article.\n\nSocial media platforms are replete with misinformation surrounding Pelosi. One such rumor shared on Facebook alleges Pelosi was removed from the House floor after she yelled at Republicans lawmakers while intoxicated.\n\n\u201cDo you know who I am?!\u201d Pelosi supposedly said while being removed. \u201cYou\u2019re violating my rights you fascist brown shirt! I\u2019m the Speaker of the House! You\u2019re going to regret this.\u201d (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi Say, \u2018Social Security Recipients Are Just A Burden On Society\u2019?)\n\nIn reality, none of the quotes attributed to Pelosi in the Facebook post are authentic, nor was she removed from the House floor in such a scenario. Had there been such an incident, media outlets would have reported on it, yet none have. The congressional record also has no record of the alleged incident.\n\nThe sergeant at arms, the principle law enforcement officer charged with maintaining the security on the floor and the House side of the Capitol, is not Joe Barron, further adding to the post\u2019s dubiousness. Paul Irving has held the position since 2012, according to his biography on the U.S. House of Representatives website.\n\nThe Facebook post appears to have been lifted nearly word-for-word from an article published on Bustatroll.org, a website that describes itself as part of a \u201cnetwork of parody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d While Bustatroll.org includes several disclaimers about the satirical nature of its content on its website, the Facebook post fails to include a warning, passing the claim off as true.", "lang": "en"}
