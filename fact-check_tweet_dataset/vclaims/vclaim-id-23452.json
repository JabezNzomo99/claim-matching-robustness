The answer is a little complicated: A 17-month-old girl was repeatedly bitten by another toddler at a play center in Leeds on November 2, 2018, and the mother tells us she believed, based on the clothing worn by their mother, that the young attackers were of Somali heritage and Muslim. However, she said she didn't ask and could be wrong. Also, there was no \"media blackout\" as it was well covered by the major media outlets in London.\n\nThe story originated from an article titled \"Muslim Boys Attack Toddler Leaving 15 Bite Marks On Her Face - Media Blackout\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nFirst, as for the claim of a \"media blackout\" on the toddler biting story, many of the major publications in London wrote about it. The Daily Mail's story titled \"'It's like she's been savaged by a DOG!': Toddler is scarred for life with 15 bites on her face and neck after CHILDREN attack her at soft play centre\" was published on November 8, 2018. It opened:\n\nMirror's article titled \"How mum of blood-covered boy reacted after he 'savaged' girl at soft play centre\" said the mother of the biting boy did not initially come forward:\n\nBut when she did, she defended her son, Becky says. \"She kept shouting 'That's what kids do, that's what kids do!' over and over,\" the single mum-of-three recalled. She added: \"She looks like she's been savaged by a dog, not a child.\" Becky believes the boy was two and was with his brother, aged four.\n\nA spokeswoman for The Sun told Lead Stories their writer as \"not aware of the ethnicity of the accused.\" There is no mention of the child's religion or ethnicity in any of these stories. Journalism ethics call for no mention of race unless it is relevant to a story. Read the full Editors' Code of Practice here. This is section 12 titled \"Discrimination\":\n\nThere is no obvious relevance of a two-year-old child's nationality to their proclivity to bite another child during play. This is not a \"black out.\" It is just ethical journalism.\n\nConservativeflash.com has not yet responded to Lead Stories' inquiry about their lack of sourcing for the Muslim/Somali claim. Another publisher who included the \"Somali\" and \"Muslim\" references told Lead Stories their writer got those details from a Facebook post by the young victim's mother. They've recently updated their article to reflect that the post cannot be found on her timeline. There is an image of a purported Facebook post by the mother on a racist website's version of the story, titled \"GHOULISH: Somali Niglets Chew Little British Girl's Face to Pieces.\" The mother wrote her \"baby girl willow-ivy\" was attacked by \"a 3yr old samarlian boys.\"\n\nLead Stories contacted the mother on May 22, 2019 about this and she explained that she did post but later took it down. This is what she told us:\n\nI'm not 100% they were Somali as I didn't ask them but myself and my sister in law believe they work. They spoke little English and were definitely Muslim as they were waring the clothing. Their was 6 mother's all together and they were all either family or close friends and from the same place I'm pretty sure it was 2 boys they were brothers aged 3 and 4. When I saw it happening I only saw the younger one stood over her the older brother ran away but the mother did nothing she was denying the children belonged to her and claiming she didn't know them until staff said they were calling the police. Then she was shouting saying she didn't see the problem as kids bite!\n\nWe did find this message posted by the mother of the bitten child on Facebook six days after the attack. It said \"Your peace is more important than driving yourself crazy trying to understand why something happened the way it did.\"\n\nWe wrote about conservativeflash.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Old News: Muslim Students At Public School Walk Out When Australian National Anthem Plays\n\u2022 Fake News: Pelosi Did NOT Issue Order to Place Barr Under 'Congressional Detention'", "lang": "en"}
