Robert Menendez out of office this year, but she doesn\u2019t seem to know much about the Democratic senator\u2019s record when it comes to increasing the federal debt.\n\n \n\n On her campaign website -- \"Little for Senate\" -- the former Monmouth County freeholder sounded the alarm about Menendez\u2019s spending habits with a message entitled \"Stop Debt! Stop Bob Menendez!\"\n\n \n\n \"Bob Menendez just voted to increase the government's debt ceiling to $1.9 TRILLION! In his 19 years in Congress, Menendez has helped overspend America over $15 TRILLION into debt,\" the message continued. \"Who will pay? Your children? Your grandchildren? Menendez doesn't seem to care.\"\n\n \n\n After reviewing Menendez\u2019s voting records, PolitiFact New Jersey found that Little\u2019s statement is far from the truth. The senator voted against the most recent debt ceiling increase and he has opposed some of the legislation that experts say contributed to the rising federal debt.\n\n \n\n However, Menendez has voted for other bills -- such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the stimulus) -- that helped put the nation in greater debt. Menendez served as a congressman between 1993 and 2006, when he joined the Senate.\n\n \n\n Larry Cirignano, Little\u2019s campaign manager, acknowledged that the message should not have said Menendez just voted for a debt ceiling increase, but he maintained that Menendez is \"spending money we don\u2019t have.\"\n\nMenendez spokeswoman Tricia Enright said the senator has always taken the nation\u2019s deficit seriously, but he believes the issue must be addressed in a way that protects the middle class and \"asks the wealthiest Americans and big corporations to pay their fair share.\"\n\n \n\n First, let\u2019s explain the most recent debt ceiling increase.\n\n \n\n In early August, President Barack Obama and Congress reached an agreement to raise the nation\u2019s debt ceiling by up to $2.4 trillion for a new limit of about $16.6 trillion. But Menendez voted against that deal.\n\n \n\n The senator supported a previous debt ceiling increase of $1.9 trillion, but that vote occurred about two years ago. Little\u2019s statement claims Menendez \"just voted\" for a debt ceiling increase, giving readers the impression that she is referring to the most recent increase.\n\n \n\n Now, let\u2019s turn to Little\u2019s other claim that \"Menendez has helped overspend America over $15 TRILLION into debt.\"\n\n \n\n The total federal debt has exceeded $15 trillion, the result of military conflicts, legislative actions and overall economic conditions. We focused on Menendez\u2019s voting record in regard to previous debt ceiling adjustments and certain legislation that contributed to the higher debt.\n\n \n\n In both categories, Menendez comes away with a mixed record.\n\n \n\n Before the most recent debt ceiling deal, there were 16 debt limit adjustments during Menendez\u2019s tenure. Menendez supported 11 of those measures, and rejected five.\n\n \n\n The nonpartisan Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative in April identified various legislative actions that contributed to debt increases between 2001 and 2011. Those changes include tax cuts enacted in 2001, 2003 and December 2010; the Medicare Part D program; and the stimulus.\n\n \n\n Of those five examples, Menendez voted against three of them -- the tax cuts in 2001 and 2003; and the Medicare Part D program. But he supported the stimulus bill and the December 2010 tax legislation.\n\n \n\n Two experts we contacted also pointed out how the weak economy contributed to the higher debt, given the reduction in federal revenues and greater spending on items like unemployment benefits.\n\n \n\n Jason Peuquet, a policy analyst with the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, added in an email: \"But one of the largest single factors has been the economic downturn, which is difficult to assign blame for.\"\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n On her campaign website, Little claimed Menendez \"just voted\" for a debt ceiling increase and that he \"has helped overspend America over $15 TRILLION into debt.\"\n\n \n\n But Menendez voted against the most recent debt ceiling increase, and he has a mixed record in regard to past legislative actions that contributed to the higher debt. For example, he rejected tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, but supported the stimulus bill in 2009 and tax cuts in December 2010.\n\n \n\n We rate the statement Mostly False.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "lang": "en"}
