As of writing, the post had over 2,300 shares, 636 reactions, and 105 comments.\n\nThe facts: In a press briefing on Tuesday, January 28, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III clarified that the 2019 nCoV belongs to the Coronaviridae family of viruses. Meanwhile, rabies is from Rhabdoviridae.\n\n\"It is actually close to ridiculous to think that this (2019 nCoV) is now falling within the family of the rhabdovirus. It's not, it's a totally, completely different family of viruses. This is Coronaviridae, this is the family under which 2019 nCoV belongs,\" Duque said.\n\nCoronaviruses can cause a range of diseases in humans and animals. Other diseases that belong to this family are pneumonia-like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

Studies suggest bats and snakes play a role in the outbreak, but this hasn't been confirmed yet as of posting. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
