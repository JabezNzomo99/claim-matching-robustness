Now conspiracy theorists are wrongly speculating that she was murdered for writing a story critical of the FBI.\n\nOn Dec. 13, 2018, The Federalist published a seven-paragraph story by Bre Payton in which she wrote about an 11-page report from an Office of Inspector General investigation into text messages exchanged between two FBI officials.\n\n\"The Department of Justice wiped text messages between former FBI employees Lisa Page and Peter Strozk from their cell phones before the Office of the Inspector General could review them, a new report from the DOJ watchdog reveals,\" Payton wrote. \"Page and Strozk\u2019s involvement with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation has been heavily scrutinized after it was revealed they had sent numerous anti-Trump text messages back and forth to one another.\"\n\nAbout two weeks later, The Federalist published another story, this one reporting on Payton\u2019s death. Some bloggers seized on the news.\n\n\"Reporter who broke story about Mueller destroying text messages found dead!!!\" reads one Facebook post accompanying a picture of Payton on Dec. 31.\n\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nSome comments on the post agree with the suggestion that Payton was killed because of her reporting.\n\n\"You go against the Clinton\u2019s (sic), or give information about criminal activity from the Democrats and you are risking your life,\" one Facebook user wrote. \"Lots of whistle blowers have mysteriously died.\"\n\nAnother user posted a link to a Jan. 3 blog post on LewRockwell.com, a self-described repository for \"anti-state,\" \"anti-war\" and \"pro-market\" thought. There, a story by Richard Enos on Payton\u2019s death reads: \"I don\u2019t have definitive \u2018proof\u2019 for the notion that Payton was killed because she was going to disclose some type of sensitive information against the Deep State; however, it must be said that the cause and circumstance of her death are befuddling enough for one to consider such an idea.\"\n\nOther users weren\u2019t buying it. One posted a link to a Dec. 30 obituary in The New York Times that said Payton \"had H1N1 flu, also known as the swine flu, and encephalitis, according to her family.\"\n\nEarlier in December, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that flu activity was elevated across the country. By Dec. 21, seven flu-related pediatric deaths had been reported.\n\nThe New York Times obit cites a tweet from a friend, Morgan Murtaugh, who had asked Payton to stay with her for Christmas.\n\n\"24 hours ago I found my friend unconscious and called 911,\" Murtaugh tweeted on Dec. 28, before Payton died. \"She\u2019s been in a coma since and really needs a miracle right now. Please, if you\u2019re religious at all, send prayers this way. We really need them.\"\n\nOn Jan. 3, Murtaugh retweeted DC McAllister, a contributor to The Federalist among other publications.\n\n\"People who are saying Bre Payton was murdered bc she reported that texts were wiped from Strzok & Page\u2019s IPhones needs to stop,\" McAllister wrote. \"We are grieving her death and don\u2019t need this nonsense. She reported what was already in the OIG report. No cause for murder. She died of an illness.\"\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
