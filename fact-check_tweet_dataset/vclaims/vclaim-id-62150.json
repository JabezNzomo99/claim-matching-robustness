It will be an mRNA vaccine which will literally alter your DNA. It will wrap itself into your system. You will essentially become a genetically modified human being.\u201d\n\nThe August 21 post has attracted more than 360 shares and has been viewed more than 32,000 times.\n\nIt\u2019s true that mRNA vaccines are among many being tested around the world by companies such as Moderna in the US and institutions like Oxford University and Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle. However, the post\u2019s primary claims that mRNA vaccines will alter a person\u2019s DNA and genetically modify humans are false, experts told AAP FactCheck.\n\nIn addition, the post\u2019s RNA and DNA diagram has been previously published to illustrate their differences and is unrelated to vaccines.\n\nRNA (Ribonucleic acid) vaccines work by introducing an mRNA sequence into the body which instructs cells to produce disease-specific antigens, according to a University of Cambridge briefing. An article in The Lancet from July 2020 details how a potential COVID-19 RNA vaccine would instruct cells to produce proteins with specific spikes that are found on the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The article says it\u2019s \u201choped these proteins will trigger an immune response that would then be able to kill the virus\u201d.\n\nShould an mRNA vaccine be approved for human use against COVID-19 it would be the first of its kind, according to Professor Isabelle Bekeredjian-Ding, head of the microbiology division of Germany\u2019s Paul Ehrlich Institut.\n\nRegarding the post\u2019s claims, Dr Gaetan Burgio, a geneticist and infections researcher at the Australian National University in Camberra, told AAP FactCheck that mRNA sequences have a short lifespan in the body and are converted into disease-specific proteins for the immune system to target.\n\n\u201cMRNA encodes a piece of the virus but does not integrate into the human DNA, therefore it does not alter DNA whatsoever,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Burgio said an mRNA vaccine won\u2019t result in people becoming \u201cgenetically modified\u201d as the MRNA sequence doesn\u2019t integrate into the genome, an organism\u2019s complete set of DNA.\n\nDr Kylie Quinn, an immunologist from RMIT University in Victoria, told AAP FactCheck: \u201cMRNA vaccines are basically delivering instructions to the cells in our body to make that protein for us so we don\u2019t have to make it in a vaccine production facility ourselves.\u201d\n\nDr Quinn said genetic modification is an alteration to DNA which is not what a mRNA vaccine does.\n\n\u201cRNA is just expressed by the cell for a short period of time and then the cell degrades it, so it doesn\u2019t become a permanent feature of the cell and doesn\u2019t integrate into DNA, so it\u2019s not genetic modification.\u201d\n\nProfessor Dale Godfrey, head of immunology from the Doherty Institute at the University of Melbourne, agreed that mRNA vaccines do not incorporate into a person\u2019s DNA.\n\n\u201cThey work in a different part of the cell (cytoplasm rather than nucleus) and mRNA is eventually cleared,\u201d he told AAP FactCheck.\n\nClaims that mRNA vaccines alter a person\u2019s DNA have been previously debunked here, here and here.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the Facebook post to be false. MRNA vaccines are among many being tested to protect against COVID-19 but claims they will alter a person\u2019s DNA and genetically modify humans are false, experts told AAP FactCheck. False \u2013 The claims in the post are factually inaccurate. Updated August 31, 2020 \u2013 Amends verdict and clarifies scope of the check is to determine whether MRNA vaccines alter a person\u2019s DNA and genetically modify humans.
