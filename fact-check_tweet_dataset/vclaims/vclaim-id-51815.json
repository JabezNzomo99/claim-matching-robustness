While Putin claimed that the vaccine was safe \u2014 even noting that his daughter had taken it \u2014 news of this vaccine was met with trepidation by some in the scientific community who believed that Russia may have cut corners to rush the production of this vaccine.\n\nIn the days after the announcement, social media was flooded with hot takes and fake news. A video supposedly showing Putin\u2019s daughter taking the vaccine, for instance, actually showed a volunteer unrelated to the Russian president:\n\nOn Aug. 15, another unverified claim about Putin\u2019s daughter started to circulate on social media. The website TorontoToday.net published an article claiming that Putin\u2019s daughter had died after taking her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine:\n\nVladimir Putin\u2019s daughter DIES after second dose of COVID vaccine Vladimir Putin\u2019s daughter suffered unexpected side effects to the experimental Russian COVID vaccine, and has passed away in Moscow. The Kremlin has yet to make a statement on her death. A source within Russia\u2019s inner circle stated that Putin\u2019s daughter \u2013 Katerina Tikhonova \u2013 suffered a rise in temperature shortly after her second injection, and then suffered a seizure. Doctors were not able to reverse the side-effects of the vaccine, and she was pronounced dead late yesterday evening.\n\nWe\u2019re skeptical of this article\u2019s claims, to say the least.\n\nFor starters, this news did not originate with a report from the Kremlin, a statement from Putin, or from genuine reporting by credible news outlets. It originated with a website that was created just a few weeks before this article was published.\n\nFurthermore, the \u201cevidence\u201d provided by this website to support the claim simply isn\u2019t credible. TorontoToday.net offers two sources for this claim. The first, an unnamed \u201csource within Russia\u2019s inner circle\u201d who provides practically no details about the incident. And second, a \u201cTarot card reading\u201d YouTube video.\n\nThe tarot card video has since been deleted but an archived version shows that this video was accompanied by a disclaimer noting that \u201cTarot Reading is subject to interpretation and should not be taken as absolute,\u201d and that the information in these videos \u201cmay or may not be accurate.\u201d\n\nThere isn\u2019t much genuine information about Putin\u2019s daughter and her alleged experience with a COVID-19 vaccine. All we know, as of this writing, is what the Russian president said during a news conference. Putin claimed that his daughter took the vaccine, that she had a slight fever, and that she is now \u201cfeeling well and has a high number of antibodies.\u201d Neither the Kremlin nor Putin nor any credible news agencies have reported that Putin\u2019s daughter died from this vaccine.", "lang": "en"}
