Don\u2019t miss out on this once in a life time opportunity,\u201d the page wrote before signing off as \u201cChick-fil-A.\u201d\n\nThis Facebook post is not associated with the Chick-fil-A brand and does not represent a real, ongoing contest.\n\nChick-n mini lovers will have to look elsewhere to get their fill, because sharing, liking or commenting on this post is not going to earn them any free product from Chick-fil-A.\n\n\u201cThat is not a legitimate account or giveaway associated with Chick-fil-A, Inc,\u201d Leigh Jackson, with Jackson Spalding, a press company representing Chick-fil-A, told The Daily Caller.\n\nThe post, which had received over 19,000 shares at time of publication, claims that the contest\u2019s previous winners failed to claim their prize. However, there are no other posts about such a contest on the page. In fact, Friday\u2019s post is the only post on the entire page.\n\nThe page was created on March 5, 2019 and has more than 34,000 likes. While categorized as a \u201cJust for Fun\u201d page, the account contains no disclaimers that it is not a legitimate page for the company, nor does it identify itself as a parody account.", "lang": "en"}
