And a vaccine to fight coronaviruses that have infected dogs won\u2019t work on COVID-19 in humans.\n\nThe confusion seems to stem from a misunderstanding of the word \u201ccoronavirus,\u201d which actually refers to a family of hundreds of viruses, not just one type of sickness. Politicians and journalists frequently \u2014 and misleadingly \u2014 used the term in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the novel coronavirus was first reported in humans in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.\n\nBut the reality is this: Most of us will catch at least one type of coronavirus in our lifetime and suffer cold-like symptoms while others may suffer more severe and sometimes fatal infections, including the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Listing all of the types of coronaviruses that can cause disease in humans, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states:\n\nOne of the seven is SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 the strain for which epidemiologists are scrambling to create a vaccine to end the 2019-2020 global health crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, some types of coronaviruses cause illness in animals, including cattle, camels, cats, and dogs. Of that type, some remain exclusively in the animal world, while others \u2014 on rare occasions \u2014 mutate in such a way that allows them to infect humans, according to the CDC. That was the case with the COVID-19 outbreak, though scientists have yet to pinpoint the exact source of the virus as of this writing.\n\nThe popular Facebook photo does show a real vaccine used to help dogs fight a specific strain of coronavirus unique to that species. The type of shot, however, is not effective in humans and will not help scientists fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe vaccine, called Nobivac Canine 1-Cv, is \u201cdesigned to enhance the immune response and offer protection against canine coronavirus,\u201d according to Merck Animal Health, which is the manufacturer of the vaccine. The product is \u201capproved for the vaccination of healthy dogs as an aid in the prevention of disease caused by canine coronavirus infection,\u201d which can cause intestinal and respiratory sickness.\n\nThe manufacturer\u2019s website also states canine coronaviruses \u201care not the same virus as SARS-CoV-2 that is responsible for causing the COVID-19 infection\u201d \u2014 the same web page includes an image of a product that looks similar to the one featured in the viral Facebook post.\n\nAlthough government officials and the news media often referred to the virus at the center of the COVID-19 pandemic as simply \u201ccoronavirus\u201d in the early days of the outbreak, scientists have urged the use of a more accurate name. According to the World Health Organization, the virus is called SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and the disease it causes is referred to as COVID-19.\n\nIn conclusion, the word \u201ccoronavirus\u201d refers to a group of viruses, and any vaccine that has been effective fighting the spread of one particular strain of the virus family \u2014 including canine coronavirus, MERS, or SARS \u2014 is not necessarily going to provide immunity against other variations in this group. As of May 4, 2020 no vaccine exists for SARS-CoV-2. And for these reasons, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
