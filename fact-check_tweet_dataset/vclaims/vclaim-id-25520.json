{"title": "Did Norway Legalize Marriage Between Humans and Animals?", "subtitle": "A two-year-old Cameroonian blog post found itself going viral in August 2019, especially among American readers with one eye on the end of days.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2019-08-23T14:57:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-25520", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/norway-marriage-animals/", "vclaim": "In August 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers asking about the veracity of an article that claimed Norway had made it legal for humans to marry animals.\n\nThe June 2017 article was published on a Cameroonian blog called The Watch Dog Web and bore the headline \u201cNorway: The Marriage Between Humans and Animals Is [sic] Been Legalised!\u201d It\u2019s not clear what prompted a wave of social media sharing of the blog post more than two years later. Another website, My Africa Today, published a short version of the story on Aug. 22, but it\u2019s unlikely that accounts for the viral spread of The Watch Dog Web\u2019s version.\n\nMany of the Facebook and Twitter posts presented The Watch Dog Web\u2019s article, apparently in earnest, as a harbinger of a coming apocalypse. For example, a Facebook page called True Biblical Christians shared the article along with biblical verses concerning the city of Sodom, and \u201cthe day when the son of man is revealed\u201d:\n\nOthers made similar claims, writing that the story was evidence that \u201cJesus is soon to come,\u201d and \u201cthe end is near,\u201d among other pronouncements:\n\n\u201cAccording to an article published in the Norwegian newspaper Dagens N\u00e6ringsliv of March 10, 2017, as well as several sites, Norway legalized marital unions between humans and domestic animals (bush animals and marine animals are excluded). Barbar\u00e4, a 23-year-old woman who was met by a team of journalists, would be the first to celebrate a zoocontractual union.\n\n\u201cBarbar\u00e4 Tr\u00fcdlosmek seems delighted to introduce her husband: Rudolf, an abandoned doberman she found in an animal shelter In January 2015 and with whom she claims to be bound by a sincere and reciprocal love. They have already married.\u201d\n\nThe article was a hoax that ultimately derived from SecretNews, a French website that presents itself as satirical. Along with the English-language version that went viral in August 2019, The Watch Dog Web published a French-language version back in June 2017.\n\nThat version was almost entirely copied from SecretNews\u2019s original November 2016 article. The graphic below shows a side-by-side comparison of a section of the original post (on the left) with the version published seven months later by The Watch Dog Web (on the right):\n\nThe only difference between the content of the two versions was that The Watch Dog Web presented the fictional change in Norway\u2019s law as having already happened and the fictional \u201cBarbara\u201d as having already married her dog \u201cRudolf,\u201d while SecretNews said those developments would be coming soon.\n\nAdditionally, The Watch Dog Web falsely claimed to have based its report on a \u201c10 March 2017 article in the Norwegian newspaper Dagens Naeringsliv,\u201d a claim that SecretNews did not make but that likely added to the credibility of the story for some readers, especially since Dagens Naeringsliv is a real Norwegian newspaper.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, neither the English- nor French-language versions of The Watch Dog Web\u2019s article made it clear that the story had been lifted from a website that presents its content as \u201csatire.\u201d The Watch Dog Web did list \u201cSecretNews.fr\u201d as a source, underneath its own article, but did not link to the original. Therefore, only a reader who was willing to do some digging online or was already aware of SecretNews would know of the \u201canimal marriage\u201d story\u2019s satirical origins.\n\nBy contrast, SecretNews does present its content as \u201csatire,\u201d although the disclaimer at the bottom of the website can only be reached if a reader scrolls down through a series of repeatedly refreshing advertisements, not something an average reader would do in the normal course of events. In any case, that disclaimer reads (translated from French):\n\n\u201cSecretNews is a free, independent, collaborative satirical publisher which involves several contributors. Most of the information presented on this website is probably false, published with a satirical and humorous aim. It should not be taken seriously.\u201d\n\nSo a fictional story published in 2016 by a French website that labels its content \u201csatire\u201d was picked up by a Cameroonian blog in 2017, embellished and stripped of its \u201csatire\u201d disclaimer, and then translated into English. The latter went viral in August 2019, when American readers mistook it for real and shared it widely as supposed evidence of the imminent end of the world.", "lang": "en"}
