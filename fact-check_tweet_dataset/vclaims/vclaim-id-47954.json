{"title": "Evening Standard wrong to say wages aren\u2019t rising", "subtitle": "Reporting on the latest jobs data, the Evening Standard seemed to confuse flat wage growth with flat wages. Wages are growing at 1.9% per year in real terms.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-47954", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/standard-wage-growth-october-2019/", "vclaim": "Following the release of the latest labour force statistics the Evening Standard reported that employment is falling and wages have stopped rising.\n\nIt\u2019s correct that the number of people in employment fell by 0.2% between the three months to May and the three months to August 2019. However the employment rate remains close to a record high.\n\nIt\u2019s incorrect to say that wages have stopped rising. Wages for employees in Great Britain are growing at the same level they have been growing for several months.\n\nThe Standard seemed to confuse wage growth being flat (meaning wages continue to grow at the same speed) with wages being flat (meaning wages aren\u2019t growing at all). Later in the article it says: \u201cThe figures on pay remain solid, with earnings rising at an annual rate of 3.8%. However, that was the same rate as last time, suggesting pay rises have stalled.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s technically accurate, but it\u2019s incorrect to say this means \u201cwages have stopped rising\u201d, as the Standard does in the article\u2019s first paragraph and on its twitter account.\n\nPutting this aside, the Evening Standard doesn\u2019t seem to have adjusted its wages figures to account for the change in how much things cost over time (inflation). It\u2019s better to look at wage growth in real terms (adjusting for inflation) because it tells us whether wages are growing faster than prices are rising.\n\nAverage employee wages are growing in real terms by 1.9% per year which has been fairly constant for the past few months. Average wages are still below their pre-financial crisis high and you can read more about how wages have changed in recent history here.", "lang": "en"}
