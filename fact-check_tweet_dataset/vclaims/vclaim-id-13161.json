Social media users are circulating this text in the backdrop of the recent Christchurch mosque shooting where a white supremacist gunned down at least 50 Muslim worshippers in a terrorist attack.\n\nThe viral message reads, \u201c\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0942\u091c\u0940\u0932\u0948\u0902\u0921 \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0928\u0947 \u0906\u091c \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092c\u0928\u0940 \u0924\u092e\u093e\u092e \u092e\u0938\u094d\u091c\u093f\u0926\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u092c\u0902\u0926 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u0926\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0906\u0926\u0947\u0936 |\u0915\u0939\u093e.. \u092e\u0938\u094d\u091c\u093f\u0926\u094b\u0902 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0939\u0940 \u092a\u0932\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u0906\u0924\u0902\u0915\u0940! (New Zealand government today ordered for the shut down of mosques across the country. They said that terrorists breed in mosques.)\u201d Below is a screenshot of the message shared on a Facebook group DR. SAMBIT PATRA FANS CLUB.\n\nThe message has been circulated on several other right-wing Facebook groups as well \u2013 We Support Zee News ( \u0910\u0921 \u0939\u094b\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0940 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u092e\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u091c\u094b\u095c\u0947\u0902), \u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935 \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0942 \u090f\u0915\u0924\u093e \u092e\u0902\u091a, I support modi ji, and Narendra Damodar Modi Supporter, among others.\n\nSeveral Twitter handles have also posted the message.\n\nThat the New Zealand government has ordered for the closing down of all mosques across the country is blatant disinformation.\n\nA week after the terrorist attack, Christchurch mosque Al Noor, one of the two places where the mass shooting took place, will hold its Friday prayers on March 22. \u201cThe Deans Ave mosque\u2019s religious leader Imam Gamal Fouda, who survived New Zealand\u2019s worst ever terror attack, said the move will show the world that Muslims, and all New Zealanders, will not bow down to terror\u2026The majority of people, including myself, we decided to come and prayer close to our site. We will never forsake it to please those people who actually attacked us.\u201d reported New Zealand Herald.\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that Friday\u2019s call to prayers at the Christchurch mosque will be broadcast nationally and a two-minute silence will be observed.\n\nMosques across New Zealand were asked to remain closed on March 15 \u2013 the day of the attack. This was a police advisory as a safety precaution and not a government order to shut down mosques.\n\nAs the first funerals began on March 20, for the ones who died in the Christchurch terrorist attack, PM Arden visited the victims and also spoke at Cashmere high school that had lost two students and one former student in the terrorist attack.\n\nAlt News recently debunked another misinformation related to Christchurch where old photographs were being shared to claim that people in New Zealand are converting to Islam.", "lang": "en"}
