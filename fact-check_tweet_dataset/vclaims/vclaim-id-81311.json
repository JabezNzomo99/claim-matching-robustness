Rand Paul\u2019s claim \u2014 twice in one day \u2014 that he has a biology degree\n\nPaul did not complete his undergraduate degree at college, though he earned a medical degree from Duke University. Previously Paul\u2019s staff has accused the media of misunderstanding his unusual educational background, but twice during a conference Paul asserted that he had a \u201cbiology degree.\u201d Paul studied biology and English at Baylor University, but he didn\u2019t earn a degree. We thought this was worthy of Three Pinocchios, but many readers thought we were being unfair.\n\nFormer New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani insisted that he had never heard President Obama describe the United States as exceptional or great \u2014 or even say how much he loved America. We took up the challenge and found numerous examples over an 11-year period. Giuliani earned Four Pinocchios.\n\nThe Republican National Committee, in a tweet, asserted that under Obama, health-care premiums have risen more than $4,000. But the RNC used fuzzy math that we have previously exposed before \u2014 and then even made it worse, in part to disguise the fact that health-care inflation now is at its lowest rate in decades. We plaintively asked if the zombie stat could finally be put to rest.\n\n4. Obama\u2019s claim that one in five American women has been a victim of rape or attempted rape\n\nA number of readers questioned a statistic asserted by President Obama in a public service announcement that aired during the Grammy awards: that \u201cnearly one in five women in America has been a victim of rape or attempted rape.\u201d We explored in depth the survey that produced this statistic and found the president erred by citing as fact the results of a survey that may be overstated.\n\n5. Sarah Palin\u2019s inaccurate claim about suicides of veterans of the \u2018war on terror\u2019\n\nFormer Alaska governor Sarah Palin (R) took the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference and delivered an impassioned speech about taking care of veterans. In remarks devoted to the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, she asserted that 23 take their lives each day. But there are many problems with that figure. In fact, the Army says the suicide rate of veterans of the most current wars is not quite one person a day.", "lang": "en"}
