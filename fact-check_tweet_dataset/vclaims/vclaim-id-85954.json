She does mention raising the retirement age for younger workers \u2014 something that even AARP had indicated it might support as part of a budget deal \u2014 but what does \u201cinvest part of their benefits for higher returns\u201d mean? We consulted with an expert on Social Security who said it could refer to any one of different proposals, including one for add-on accounts proposed by Al Gore in the 2000 campaign.\n\n\u201cWe have to keep the promises we\u2019ve made to our seniors and protect the retirement benefits they\u2019ve earned. At the same time, we have take measures to strengthen and sustain it for future generations because it is currently unsustainable. For younger workers, we need to consider approaches such as gradually increasing the retirement age and allowing them to invest a portion of their Social Security payments in ways that will allow them to maximize their returns.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we look at options to protect and secure Social Security and Medicare for the future, we need to protect the promises we have made to seniors that are at or near retirement. We need to be innovative about ways to sustain those programs for the future, because otherwise they will go bankrupt and they will Pac Man out the rest of the budget. So how do we do that? Some innovation and ideas are on the table, which are worth looking at, for people to keep some money in their pockets when it comes to Social Security.\u201d\n\nNote that all of these comments are from the 2012 race. It\u2019s unclear what her actual position is, given that at one point she refers to investing \u201cbenefits\u201d and at another point refers to investing \u201cpayments,\u201d which could refer to existing payroll taxes, but also to an add-on contribution, or Social Security trust fund assets. And \u201ckeep some money in their pockets\u201d is even vaguer \u2014 it could mean something as general as dealing with the rising cost of Social Security, as the baby boom generation retires, so that taxpayers don\u2019t get hit with higher general tax burdens.\n\nDuring the 2012 campaign, House Majority PAC hit McSally hard on the Social Security issue, with one portraying the former Air Force pilot as having a bad \u201crecipe\u201d for Social Security. With such a close race, it\u2019s possible these ads made a difference. This new ad is essentially a reprise of that line of attack, as shown in two ads below, which McSally at the time decried as false. One television station stopped running the House majority PAC ads after McSally\u2019s campaign said she has \u201cnever supported privatization of Social Security.\u201d\n\nFor the sake of argument, let\u2019s assume McSally advocates a concept similar to what Sen. John McCain (who is an Arizona Republican) once supported in 2005\u2014when it was proposed by then President George W. Bush. That plan would have been voluntary, for workers younger than 55, and would have permitted a diversion no more than a third of payroll taxes into investments other than Treasury bonds (which Social Security is now invested in). The system would still be government-managed; it would not be \u201cin the stock market\u201d or \u201cprivatized.\u201d\n\nThe AARP report mainly tries to assess whether private accounts would yield better returns for workers and concludes that claims that many workers can expect better returns is an overstatement. \u201cThere is a fairly substantial probability that some cohorts of retirees would be worse off under a privatized Social Security system than they are under the current system,\u201d the report says. That\u2019s basically Stock Market 101: The performance of private accounts depends on the investments that are chosen. As we said, the Bush plan was voluntary, meaning workers could avoid the stock market entirely if they desired.\n\nMcSally certainly could be more specific about her proposal. She has spoken of improving the solvency of Social Security by raising the retirement age, but only for younger workers, presumably in exchange for different investment options that she has only vaguely described. (Note: The private-account plan advanced by Bush would have require a massive bridge loan to finance the transition and at least initially would have done little to address solvency. See The Fact Checker\u2019s popular Guide to Social Security for more information.)\n\nThe concept has absolutely no chance if a Democrat is in the White House. Bush could not even get a committee vote on his idea when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress; Peter Baker\u2019s magisterial history of the Bush administration, \u201cDays of Fire,\u201d makes it clear that the Republican Speaker of the House killed Bush\u2019s proposal. Even the most recent GOP presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, backed away from the idea in 2012, saying the 2008 stock market collapse showed \u201cwe can\u2019t always count on positive returns from these investments.\u201d He instead supported private accounts as an add-on to Social Security, similar to the Gore concept of \u201cSocial Security Plus.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
