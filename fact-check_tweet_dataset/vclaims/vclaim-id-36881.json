{"title": "Did Fox News Change Its Accreditation from 'News' to 'Entertainment'?", "subtitle": "There's a lot to unfold in this meme, including the fact that Fox News (and CNN and MSNBC) are not \"accredited news stations\" to begin with.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2020-01-13T11:37:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-36881", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fox-news-entertainment-switch/", "vclaim": "In 2013, an entertainment website published a fictitious article that claimed Fox News had been reclassified as \u201csatire\u201d by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and that the network would start displaying a disclaimer reading: \u201cThis is not a valid news source.\u201d While that fictitious article was clearly not genuine news, the general idea that Fox News was not an \u201caccredited news station\u201d has often been repeated.\n\nIn January 2019, we were notified about a meme claiming that Fox News changed its accreditation from \u201cnews\u201d to \u201centertainment,\u201d and that it had no legal obligation to report the facts:\n\nThis may not make you happy; Fox News it not an accredited news station. They have changed their accreditation to \u201centertainment.\u201d They legally don\u2019t have to provide any facts in their reporting. Fox News is in the same category as Saturday Night Live, Laugh-In, and Swamp People. You don\u2019t have to believe me, look it up yourself.\n\nWhile the term \u201caccredited news station\u201d may sound official, no regulatory body even exists that would accredit Fox News (or CNN, MSNBC, etc.) as a \u201cnews\u201d station. In addition, a spokesperson for Fox News said the meme\u2019s claims were false.\n\nAmong other issues, the meme is a bit nonsensical because it conflates over-the-air broadcasts and cable broadcasts, as well as Fox Broadcasting Company and Fox News Channel.\n\nThe Fox Broadcasting Company is an over-the-air television network licensed by the FCC. This is the station where you find programming such as \u201cThe Simpsons. The Fox News Network is a cable news channel. The latter is where you\u2019d find programming such as \u201cFox & Friends\u201d and \u201cHannity.\u201d While the FCC licenses and regulates over-the-air broadcasts, it has no authority over cable news channels.\n\nA spokesperson for the FCC told us that, \u201cWe do not have any rules or licensing requirements in which a cable channel might categorize itself as news vs. entertainment.\u201d\n\nJohn Bergmayer, senior counsel at Public Knowledge, an intellectual property group based in Washington, D.C., talked to the New York Daily News in 2017 after the FCC received hundreds of complaints about another cable news channel, CNN. Bergmayer explained that because cable news channels are run by private providers, the FCC has no authority to control the programming:\n\nThe FCC regulates broadcast networks, since the airwaves are free and public. But cable channels, which rely on subscribers, viewers and advertisers, are beyond government control. Since cable runs through private providers, the FCC plays no role in issuing or revoking licenses, and it has no say on what the channels can air. \u201cThe hook for (broadcast) content regulation \u2026 is the fact that broadcasters have government-issued licenses that allow them to use the airwaves, and that it\u2019s freely available to anyone with a receiver,\u201d said John Bergmayer, senior counsel at Public Knowledge, an intellectual property group based in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe FCC does have regulations regarding the distribution of false information, but again, this only applies to over-the-air programs on networks such as ABC, CBS, NBC, or Fox Broadcasting (but not the Fox News Channel). Furthermore, the offense would have to be pretty egregious and well-documented in order for the FCC to step in.\n\nThe FCC explains on its website that it has a \u201cvery narrow scope\u201d to police news programs because it is prohibited by law from \u201cengaging in censorship or infringing on First Amendment rights of the press.\u201d\n\nThe FCC\u2019s authority to respond to these complaints is narrow in scope, and the agency is prohibited by law from engaging in censorship or infringing on First Amendment rights of the press. Moreover, the FCC cannot interfere with a broadcaster\u2019s selection and presentation of news or commentary. The FCC is prohibited by law from engaging in censorship or infringing on First Amendment rights of the press. It is, however, illegal for broadcasters to intentionally distort the news, and the FCC may act on complaints if there is documented evidence of such behavior from persons with direct personal knowledge. For more information, please see our consumer guide, Complaints About Broadcast Journalism.\n\nFox News (as well as CNN and MSNBC) is not an accredited news station because no regulatory body exists in the United States that has the authority to make such a classification.\n\nBut while the meme is false, it is reminiscent of a genuine news story from 2017, when Ofcom, the United Kingdom\u2019s communications regulator, ruled that the shows \u201cHannity\u201d and \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d had breached their impartiality rules while reporting on the Manchester Arena bombing and President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban:\n\nWe should note this ruling only pertained to specific reporting on two Fox News shows and not to the network as a whole. The ruling was also made after Sky had already pulled Fox News from the airwaves and therefore did not result in fines or in official changes to the classification of the network.\n\nIn sum, cable news networks aren\u2019t accredited as \u201cnews\u201d by any official regulatory body in the United States, and the above meme is false on its face.", "lang": "en"}
