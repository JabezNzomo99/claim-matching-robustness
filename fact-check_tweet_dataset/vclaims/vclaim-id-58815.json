The primary context omitted here is that both Manuel and Stephens were initially arrested on suspicion of negligent homicide, but prosecutors \u2014 who deliberated for two years \u2014 ultimately felt they could not determine who was more at fault for the child\u2019s death, nor could they meet the burden of proof needed to successfully bring criminal charges against Manuel. In the end, they took no action against either party.\n\nThe crash occurred when the driver of the SUV turned left onto Florline Boulevard while Manuel was traveling northbound on Airline Highway. According to Manuel\u2019s arrest report, investigators estimated his vehicle\u2019s speed at the time of the accident at 94 MPH based on calculations from data recorded by his car\u2019s airbag control module. Both cars had green lights, so the primary issue was determining whether the SUV\u2019s driver failed to yield, or whether the Corvette\u2019s excessive speed would have made it extremely difficult or impossible for the driver to safely judge the turn. Investigators came down on the side of the latter, and Manuel filed a civil suit alleging that the driver of the SUV was at fault for turning \u201csuddenly and without warning\u201d into his lane.\n\nAdditional complicating factors were that the driver of the SUV was unlicensed, the vehicle was carrying too many occupants, and no one in the SUV was wearing a seatbelt. Police also stated that Stephens did not properly secure her daughter\u2019s car seat, instead placing it on the SUV\u2019s center console between the two front seats, which is considered an act of \u201cgross negligence\u201d that was a \u201ccontributing factor in the death\u201d of the child.\n\nAs the Baton Rouge Advocate reported, the district attorney felt his office could not fairly determine whom, if anyone, to prosecute:\n\nEast Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore III said his office decided not to bring charges against either Manuel or Stephens, reasoning that both had contributed to the tragic outcome even though \u201cone suffered a bigger loss.\u201d \u201cIt becomes a conundrum of \u2018Who\u2019s at fault?'\u201d Moore said. \u201cDo you really want to charge the mom with her child\u2019s death? Of course not. Which act truly caused the death, speeding or lack of proper restraint? Is one more culpable than the other? We couldn\u2019t really determine that based on the facts of the case and what the law requires.\u201d \u201cThis is a trying decision,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt weighed on me as a parent with children.\u201d\n\nOne aspect of the controversy surrounding the crash was Manuel\u2019s status as a member of the Baton Rouge Police Department, which some critics maintained may have influenced the DA\u2019s decision not to prosecute a criminal case against him. Another was that no one involved in the accident was even cited:\n\n[Marcus Allen, an attorney] volunteered to represent Stephens for free after news of her case went viral within some circles online. He said Moore\u2019s \u201cunilateral decision\u201d not to prosecute \u201chas the look of impropriety\u201d because the case involves a law enforcement officer and argued prosecutors could have avoided that by going forward with the case and allowing the criminal justice system to decide the officer\u2019s fate. Police recommended citations for several other people in the SUV with Stephens after finding various safety issues, including that there were too many occupants, none were wearing seatbelts and the driver was unlicensed. Prosecutors had two years to issue those citations but instead let the tickets expire without doing so. They did the same for a misdemeanor speeding count against Manuel, which also expired. Moore said prosecuting Manuel for speeding would have meant essentially forfeiting the option to charge him with negligent homicide because of double jeopardy laws at the time. But once prosecutors ruled out the more serious charge, they could have chosen to issue the speeding ticket then with no major impacts on the case. [Allen] said that\u2019s the least Moore\u2019s office could have done. \u201cHow can you overlook the glaring fact that he was going almost 100 mph?\u201d Allen said. \u201cYou just cannot operate a vehicle that fast. For him to walk away from this with no criminal charges \u2026 it almost appears he\u2019s above the law.\u201d\n\nAlthough prosecutors decided to take no action in the case, some online reports nonetheless mistakenly reported that Brittany Stephens had been convicted and sentenced to prison.", "lang": "en"}
