The post stated that only drive-through and takeaway services would be available. A Facebook post from the UK and Ireland page for the restaurant chain (here) on April 1 stated that this was not true.\n\nThe posts with the false information were all shared as images. The text and graphics were in the style of an official McDonald\u2019s UK and Ireland Facebook post that was made on March 22. That post announced that its stores were to close on March 23 in response to the coronavirus pandemic (here).\n\nThe fake post stylized McDonald\u2019s as \u2018Mc Donald\u2019s\u2019. This error was referenced in the official McDonald\u2019s post that read: \u201cLots of people getting in touch about a certain post circulating tonight. It\u2019s fake, we are not reopening next week and any official announcements would come from this page and would spell the brand name correctly\u201d.\n\nSome of the posters referenced April\u2019s Fools Day in the comments, though many of the posts and shares suggested the uploaders believed they were sharing genuine news. Reuters has not been able to verify the original uploader of the fake post.\n\nFalse: the UK and Ireland branches of McDonald\u2019s restaurant will not reopen on April 6.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
