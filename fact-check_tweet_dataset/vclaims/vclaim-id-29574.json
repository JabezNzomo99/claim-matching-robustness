The claim is false: the election commission has not yet tested and sealed the vote counting machines, and the names of the two candidates are on same side of the ballot.\n\nThe false claim has circulated widely on Facebook, for example here, where it has been shared more than 9,000 times since it was uploaded on March 3, 2019, and here, where it has been shared more than 10,000 times.\n\nAn English translation of the post says: \u201cRepost! Don't vote for LITO LAPID. I was once a VCM technician here in Davao tell the people you know, your friends, etc. not to vote for lito lapid because the ink of the pen will seep through from the front page where the name of MAR ROXAS is\u2026 if you shade lapid, what will appear in the receipt is mar roxas even if you shaded lapid\u2026that is what happened in the final testing and sealing here\u2026 if ever the wrong name will appear on the receipt, inform the BEI so they can include it in their minutes. Pls. spread\u2026Guys, kindly spread..thru msgr only. Forwarded\n\nAccording to a template of the ballot that will be used, which can be seen here on the election commission's official website, Lapid is listed No. 40 on the list, Roxas No.57.\n\nWhen translated to English, the tweet says: \u201cYou will just lie, you will even do it erroneously. first, both the names of Lapid and Roxas are on the front page. How will it \"seep through?\" 2nd, the ovals in the front and back page are not on the same columns. How will the permeation of shades be a problem? And hey! The final testing and sealing has not been done yet! You think too much in advance! LOL\u201d \u2013 Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
