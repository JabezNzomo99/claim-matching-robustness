No, that's not true: fake news website imitating Fox News by using their logo and a similar domain name simply rewrote a real story that took place in Grafton, Australia and moved the setting to Paducah.\n\nThe falsified story originated from an article published on foxnews-us.com (not foxnews.com)on August 27, 2018 titled \"Paducah Man who had sex with horse said it gave consent by winking at him\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA Paducah man jailed for having sex with a horse told police the horse gave him consent by winking at him, a court has heard. A Paducah horse trainer said the filly was left \"traumatised\" after Daniel Raymond Webb-Jackson, 41, committed two sexual acts with the horse when he broke into stables earlier last month. Webb-Jackson pleaded not guilty to committing an act of cruelty to an animal when he broke into stables on July 22. The trainer said he and his staff suspected disturbances at the stables in the month before, and installed CCTV cameras as a security measure.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail and might have thought it was a real Fox News article:\n\nThe events in the story are mostly real, up to and including the name of the perpetrator. But the events happened in Grafton, Australia on January 22, 2018:\n\nWARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT A GRAFTON horse trainer has said a filly was left \"traumatised\" after a 31-year-old man committed two sexual acts with the horse when he broke into stables on Turf St earlier this year. Daniel Raymond Webb-Jackson, 31, pleaded not guilty to committing an act of cruelty to an animal committed when he broke into stables in Grafton on January 22.\n\nThe hoax site further spiced up the story by using a famous mugshot from an unrelated Florida man:\n\nBack in 2009, Dale Alan Lee was busted for alleged aggravated battery and selling of marijuana. Dale subsequently laid his claim to the mug shot hall of fame with the above unforgettable image. Just over a year later Dale was back at breaking the law and destroying the mug shot competition when he got popped for the alleged sale and possession of marijuana.\n\nAnd then doubled down by publishing yet another version of the story placing the events in Manitowoc:\n\nWe wrote about foxnews-us.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Myrtle Beach Man NOT Arrested For Hanging On Traffic Light And Sh*tting On Cars Passing Underneath\n\u2022 Fake News: Bloomington Police Did NOT Discover Over 200 Penises During Raid At Funeral Employee's Home\n\u2022 Fake News: Bartlesville Woman NOT Awarded $1.4 Million After Suing Male Co-Workers For Excessive Farting.\n\u2022 Fake News: Battle Creek Woman NOT Arrested For Stinking Up Toilet And Closing Down Restaurant\n\u2022 Fake News: Syracuse Groom's Genitals NOT Blown Off by Best Man After Firework Explodes.", "lang": "en"}
