In 1997, the International Association of Genocide Scholars unanimously passed a resolution recognizing the Armenian genocide.\n\nThe U.S. Holocaust Museum\u2019s archives provide detailed evidence of the systematic mass extermination and expulsion of the ethnic Armenians, with estimates of the number of victims ranging from several hundred thousand to 1.5 million.\n\nAccording to the Armenian National Institute in Washington, DC, as of 2019, the governments of 29 countries recognized the Armenian genocide, including the United States, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Russia.\n\nWhile the governments of Switzerland, Greece, Cyprus and Slovakia adopted laws criminalizing denial of the Armenian genocide, the United Kingdom has refused to recognize the massacre of ethnic Armenians as genocide, saying the 20th century events did not fully meet the conditions of the United Nation\u2019s Genocide Convention.\n\n\u201cThe massacres were an appalling tragedy, which the British Government of the day condemned. We fully endorse that view. However, neither this Government nor previous British Governments have judged that the evidence is sufficiently unequivocal to persuade us that these events should be categorized as genocide as defined by the 1948 UN Convention on Genocide, a convention which is, in any event, not retrospective in application,\u201d the UK said in 2007.\n\nHowever, the UK\u2019s three devolved legislatures \u2013 Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales \u2013 have recognized the Armenian genocide.\n\nAlthough most of sources list the U.S. among the nations that recognized the Armenian genocide, the question of whether the United States has officially recognized it, as the House resolution states, remains a matter of dispute.\n\nThere is no vote scheduled in the Senate on the resolution and the U.S. Senate Historical Office has identified no instance when the upper chamber approved a similar resolution recognizing the genocide.\n\n\u201cThere have been a number of resolutions introduced over the years, but it looks like the closest one came to passage was in early 1990 when a resolution introduced by Bob Dole of Kansas made it to the floor for consideration,\u201d Assistant Historian Daniel Hold wrote to Polygraph.info. Dole\u2019s resolution failed two procedural votes. At the time, Sen. Dole was minority leader in the Senate, as the leading Republican Party member.\n\nDespite President Reagan\u2019s use of the term in the 1981 proclamation, the Obama White House never referred to the 1915 Armenian atrocities as \u201cgenocide,\u201d with the former ambassador to the U.N. now calling the failure a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\nErdo\u011fan\u2019s recent comments are not out of character. During his presidential campaign in 2014, Erdo\u011fan, then Turkey\u2019s prime minister, said in interview with the national TV channel NTV: \"I was called a Georgian. I apologize for this, but they even said [something] worse: They called me an Armenian,\" sparking outrage and accusations of racism.\n\nIn 2016, reacting to the German Bundestag\u2019s recognition of the Armenian genocide, Erdo\u011fan said: \"I am addressing the whole world. You may like it, you may not. Our attitude on the Armenian issue has been clear from the beginning. We will never accept the accusations of genocide.\"\n\nIn their October 2006 open letter, the leaders of the International Association of Genocide Scholars said historians who deny the Armenian genocide are pursuing a political agenda.\n\n\u201cScholars who deny the facts of genocide in the face of the overwhelming scholarly evidence are not engaging in historical debate, but have another agenda. In the case of the Armenian Genocide, the agenda is to absolve Turkey of responsibility for the planned extermination of the Armenians\u2014an agenda consistent with every Turkish ruling party since the time of the Genocide in 1915,\u201d the letter said.", "lang": "en"}
