Tammy Baldwin\u2019s extreme far left approach leaves this country in jeopardy.\"\n\n \n\n And this: \"It\u2019s a very dangerous path Tammy\u2019s leading us on.\"\n\n \n\n The ad concludes with a veteran stating: \"What would you do if these were your children? How would you feel?\"\n\n \n\n Let\u2019s look at the core claim in this ad: That Baldwin, a U.S. House member from Madison, voted against a tribute to Sept. 11 victims.\n\n \n\n The claim stems from a Sept. 14, 2006, vote on a resolution commemorating the fifth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. Baldwin was one of 22 House members -- 21 Democrats and one Republican -- to vote against the resolution.\n\n \n\n Thompson campaign spokeswoman Lisa Boothe said the matter was pretty cut and dried.\n\n \n\n \"It is simple, she was one of 22 members that voted against it, an incredibly small margin. This was a near unanimous vote.\"\n\n \n\n So there is some truth in Thompson claim.\n\n \n\n But that\u2019s far from the entire story.\n\n \n\n At the time, Baldwin delivered a speech on the House floor denouncing Republicans for adding language to the routine commemoration that she did not agree with.\n\n \n\n According to the Congressional Record, here\u2019s what she said Sept. 13, 2006:\n\n \n\n \"Mr. Speaker, on the fifth anniversary of the worst attack on American soil, my Republican colleagues have disgracefully politicized what should have been a solemn and sincere resolution.\n\n \n\n \"This week we are mourning the tragic losses of innocent lives as well as commemorating the unsurpassed heroism that was on display that day.\n\n \n\n \"We are expressing our gratitude to our nation\u2019s law enforcement officers for their tireless dedication to make our country safer; and we are reaffirming our nation\u2019s resolve to combat terrorism and secure our homeland. But rather than offering a bipartisan resolution that unites us on this solemn occasion, the Republican leadership converted the bill into an endorsement of the Patriot Act, punitive immigration bills, and other highly controversial measures, which many of my constituents oppose.\n\n \n\n \"This bill was cynically transformed from a memorial resolution to an endorsement of President Bush\u2019s failed policies. The Republicans show enormous disrespect to the 9/11 victims and families by playing election year politics with something as solemn as the fifth anniversary of 9/11; I will vote against the bill.\"\n\n \n\n The publication CQ Weekly, which covers Congress, described the resolution this way in a Sept. 18, 2006 piece:\n\n \n\n \"But this year\u2019s version was different. Taken up 54 days before one of the most pivotal elections in a decade, the measure afforded Republicans and Democrats a platform from which to argue about which party is more determined to prevail in the war on terror.\"\n\n \n\n The story added: \"Republicans stuffed the bill with references to GOP-crafted measures that they say improve national security. Democrats, who voted for some of the bills listed in the resolution, wanted no references to new laws, and complained that framing the resolution that way made it too much of a political document.\"\n\n \n\n Thompson\u2019s ad shows a portion of a Sept. 14, 2006, headline from Baldwin\u2019s hometown Capital Times -- \"Baldwin rejects 9-11 tribute\" -- but not the entire headline, which read: \"Baldwin rejects 9/11 tribute, saying it insults victims, families.\"\n\n \n\n The Baldwin campaign notes that she has voted in favor of a similar resolution honoring 9/11 victims nine times -- in 2001, \u201802, \u201804, \u201805, \u201807, \u201808, \u201809 \u201810 and \u201811.\n\n \n\n The campaign also points out that one day before the 2006 vote, Baldwin voted in favor of a resolution calling for \"establishing a national memorial at the World Trade Center site to commemorate and mourn the events of February 26, 1993, and September 11, 2001.\"\n\n \n\n Our rating\n\n \n\n Thompson said his Democratic challenger voted against a resolution honoring 9/11 victims. Technically he\u2019s correct. Baldwin voted against the measure in 2006 -- and criticized Republicans for adding in references to the Patriot Act, immigration bills, and other controversial matters.\n\n \n\n But Baldwin has voted nine times in favor of similar resolutions and the day before the vote in question supported creation of a memorial at the World Trade Center site.\n\n \n\n Thompson\u2019s statement contains an element of truth, but leaves out critical information that would give a different impression. That\u2019s our definition of Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
