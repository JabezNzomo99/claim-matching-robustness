And as we noted the last time we fact-checked a similar claim, the tax bill passed last December doesn\u2019t stack up as the largest cut ever.\n\nOn the eve of its passage, the Joint Committee on Taxation \u2014 Congress\u2019s nonpartisan arbiter of tax analysis \u2014 said the tax bill would cost about $1.5 trillion over 10 years, or about $150 billion a year.\n\nHow does that compare historically?\n\nThe Treasury Department has published a list of the biggest tax bills between 1940 and 2012, measured not only by contemporary dollars but also by inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product (a measure of the size of the overall economy).\n\nDepending on what projection of the current bill you use and what yardstick you measure it by, several bills since 1980 were larger. Here\u2019s the list by inflation-adjusted dollars:\n\nBy this measurement, the recent tax bill ranks as the fourth-biggest since 1940.\n\nThe Trump-signed legislation falls lower on the list when the cuts are ordered from highest to lowest as a percentage of GDP:\n\nBy this measurement, the recent tax bill ranked seventh.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has noted that an even earlier tax cut from 1921, not included in the Treasury Department analysis, accounted for 1.1 percent of GDP.\n\nThe group added in a blog post that \"if President Trump wanted to pass a tax cut that exceeds the record 2.9 percent of the economy in 1981, it would cost roughly $6.8 trillion over ten years.\"\n\nTrump said, \"we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.\"\n\nIn inflation-adjusted dollars, the recent tax bill is the fourth-largest since 1940. And as a percentage of GDP, it ranks seventh.", "lang": "en"}
