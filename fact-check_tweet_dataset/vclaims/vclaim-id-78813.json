It was an online, opt-in survey, which tend to produce less reliable samples because respondents choose to participate. In traditional polling methods, everyone in a population has a chance of being selected for the survey, meaning the results generally reflect the country\u2019s demographics.\n\nNumerous respected polling groups, like Survey Monkey, use opt-in surveys, said Christopher C. Hull, a former adjunct professor at Georgetown University who now works with the Center for Security Policy and answered an inquiry from PolitiFact on the group\u2019s behalf. He added that the method is useful for reaching small populations, such as U.S. Muslims, who only make up about 1 percent of the population.\n\nHull did caution, however, that \"one cannot extrapolate directly from an online, opt-in survey to the broader U.S. population.\"\n\nOne notable finding buried in the full survey data: It found that 23 percent of the U.S. Muslims surveyed said they are \"not at all familiar with\" the terrorist group known as the Islamic State, and 18 percent said they are not familiar with al-Qaida. Experts said it seems illogical that such a large percentage of American Muslims would not have knowledge of the two groups.\n\n\"The al-Qaida number seems entirely implausible and likely a canary in a coal mine as to the unrepresentativeness of this survey,\" said David Dutwin, executive vice president and chief methodologist at SSRS, a research firm.\n\nThere may be further problems with the poll, including the reality that many American Muslims are immigrants and not fluent in English, and that the survey asked leading questions with limited response choices, according to a critique by the Washington Post\u2019s Philip Bump.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the head of the Center for Security Policy, Frank Gaffney, has articulated a variety of theories about Muslim extremists that verge on conspiracy, such as the idea that the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated the United States government and the false narrative that President Barack Obama is Muslim.\n\nRobert Oldendick, executive director of the Institute for Public Service and Policy Research at the University of South Carolina, reviewed the survey methodology made available by the Center for Security Policy but said he still didn\u2019t have enough information to assess whether it\u2019s a good or bad poll. The group has not disclosed how the surveyors targeted participants and what the response rate was.\n\n\"I would view these results very cautiously,\" Oldendick said. \"It may be right, but it may not be. But the information to identify the quality of the sample is just not there.\"\n\nTrump also mentioned research by the Pew Research Center as support for his proposal.\n\nOn a key point, the results of the Center for Security Policy study diverge from the results of a 2011 Pew Research study, a traditional telephone survey of 1,033 U.S. Muslims. The methodology of the Pew poll, and the organization\u2019s reputation, is considered solid by public-opinion experts.\n\nThe Pew survey asked whether \"suicide bombing/other violence against civilians is justified to defend Islam from its enemies.\" Just 1 percent said it is \"often\" justified, while 12 percent said it is \"sometimes\" or \"rarely\" justified. Eighty-one percent said it is \"never\" justified.\n\nAccording to Pew in 2011, about 13 percent of American Muslims said they believe that violence in the name of Islam is justifiable. That\u2019s half the rate of the Center for Security Policy finding of 25 percent.\n\nThe 2011 Pew study also found that a \"significant minority\" -- 21 percent -- of American Muslims feel that there is a great deal or a fair amount of support for extremism in the American Muslim community.\n\nThe Center for Security Policy survey results do not directly back up Trump\u2019s proposal to stop Muslims from entering the United States, said Kellyanne Conway, president of the Polling Company, which conducted the survey on the center\u2019s behalf.\n\n\"We did not -- nor would we -- ask whether the U.S. should ban all Muslims,\" she said.\n\nThe Center for Security Policy poll has touched a nerve because it \"asked questions that other polling firms are refusing to ask,\" Hull said, defending the results.\n\n\"When people do not like the results of a poll, they attack the poll\u2019s methodology and sponsor,\" he said. \"This situation is no different.\"\n\nTrump said that 25 percent of U.S. Muslims \"agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad.\"\n\nTrump is referring to a poll conducted by the Center for Security Policy. However, polling experts raise numerous questions about the validity of the poll\u2019s results, including its \"opt-in\" methodology and the dubiously large percentages of respondents who said they were unaware of ISIS or al-Qaida. Moreover, an official with the Center for Security Policy cautioned against generalizing the poll results to the entire Muslim-American community.\n\nAnother survey, which experts consider credible, found levels about half as high as what the Center for Security Policy poll found.", "lang": "en"}
