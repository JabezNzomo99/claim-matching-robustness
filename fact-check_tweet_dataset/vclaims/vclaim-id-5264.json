(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe false claim comes on the heels of Trump\u2019s July 13 meeting with Queen Elizabeth II in England. Neither Trump nor the queen made public statements during their televised meeting.\n\nAs head of state, Queen Elizabeth II \"has to remain strictly neutral with respect to political matters\" and the ability to make and pass legislation rests with Parliament, according to the monarch\u2019s website.\n\nIn a July 13 press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May, Trump linked terrorism to immigration, said immigration has \"been very bad for Europe\" and that it was \"changing the culture.\" Trump won the U.S. presidential election touting a hard-line immigration stance, promising to ban Muslims from entering the United States and to remove Syrian refugees from the country (both promises are Stalled).\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that Queen Elizabeth II made any comments about deporting Muslim refugees.\n\nWe rate this fabricated story Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
