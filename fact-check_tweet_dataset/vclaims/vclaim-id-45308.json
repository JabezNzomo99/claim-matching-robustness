In the backdrop of this incident, some images are being linked with this case from Himachal Pradesh.\n\nOn June 6, former journalist and a member of Samajwadi party Preeti Chobey tweeted two images with the message, \u201cHighly condemnable, Heinous crime. People (who did these) be damned, where are the people who took oath for cow vigilantism. Those who were still screaming over the incident in Kerala. A pregnant cow was fed with explosive material in the Himachal Pradesh\u2019s Bilaspur which is considered to be a holy place. The cow was brutally injured. #HimachalPradesh\u201d. At the time of writing this article, the tweet had amassed over 400 retweets.\n\nFacebook page \u2018@Hinduarmychief\u2019 posted the images with a similar narrative. The post has been shared more than 300 times so far.\n\nOn June 7, \u2018Tamil Express News\u2018 also published an article on the incident along with the same images. Bengali website \u2018Pratifalak\u2018 also carried the images in their article.\n\nThe images are widely circulating on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nWith a reverse image search with keywords, we found a post by a Facebook page \u2018Baba Mungipa Gaushala n Hospital Tosham\u2018 on July 3, 2015. The post said that the images are from Lilamba village of Rajasthan\u2019s Raipur tehsil. Moreover, we performed a keyword search on Facebook with time filter and found a post by Facebook page \u2018Savecowslife Vrindavan\u2018 which gave the same information.\n\nA subsequent keyword search on Google led us to a report published by Hindi news outlet Patrika on June 27, 2015. According to the report, a cow was grazing in a garbage disposal area when an explosive went off and the cow\u2019s jaw blew off. The villagers started a ruckus and then accused miners of hiding the explosive material. Soon after, the police reached the spot, pacified the enraged locals and started searching for the explosives in the garbage. The report also stated that there was a blast in the village two months before the incident. At the time, the villagers had investigated the matter but found no clue. Taking cognizance of this matter, then station in-charge at the local police station had ordered an inquiry. We couldn\u2019t find any news article related to the investigation or the accused in this incident.\n\nHence, the three images being circulated as that of a recently injured cow in Himachal Pradesh are actually old and unrelated. These images depict a cow that was injured in an explosion at a village in Pali district, Rajasthan in 2015.", "lang": "en"}
