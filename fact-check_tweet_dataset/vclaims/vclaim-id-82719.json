After all, this study was titled, \u201cDo Voting Rights Notification Laws Increase Ex-Felon Turnout?\u201d\n\nFrom the start, one can see something fishy is going on with Cruz\u2019s claim. The study is a survey of party registration of ex-felons, not people in jail. Moreover, while Cruz spoke of \u201cviolent criminals,\u201d not all felonies (such as fraud or drug-related convictions) involve violent acts \u2014 and the study did not break down the types of crimes committed by the former prisoners.\n\nThe study actually examined a relatively narrow question \u2014 whether voter registration and turnout are increased when ex-felons are notified that they can regain the right to vote. The research suggested that notification notices did not increase the turnout of ex-felons, at least in the states that were the subject of the study. (In fact, 60 to 75 percent of ex-felons did not even register to vote.)\n\nAnd how many states were studied? Just three \u2014 New York, New Mexico and North Carolina. So that\u2019s two blue states and one purple state, which is not an especially representative sample of the United States.\n\nIn those three states, the party registration of the ex-felons studied was heavily Democratic. But that may have more to do with race than anything else. African Americans vote overwhelmingly for Democrats, and Hispanics also lean toward the Democrats. \u201cAbout half of the discharged population is black in both New York and North Carolina, with Hispanics making up an additional quarter of the discharged population in New York,\u201d the study noted. (Racial data were not provided for New Mexico, and North Carolina did not break out Hispanics.)\n\nIndeed, a follow-up study by Meredith and Morse looking at Iowa, Maine and Rhode Island found that, in those states, discharged felons are actually more likely to not affiliate with any party than anything else. In Iowa, the unpublished data indicate that only about 12 percent of the discharged population between 2002 and 2012 was convicted of a violent crime, which further demonstrates why Cruz cannot reach such broad conclusions about \u201cviolent criminals.\u201d\n\nA 2012 study by Traci Burch, a Northwestern University professor, looked at the registration rates of ex-felons by race in North Carolina and Florida in 2000 and found that while African American ex-felons do overwhelmingly register as Democrats, white ex-felons do not. \u201cThe conventional wisdom assumes that in the absence of felon disfranchisement, a large number of ex-felons would have turned out to vote and that this group would have been overwhelmingly Democratic,\u201d Burch wrote. \u201cThis paper will show that previous research overestimates the turnout rate of Florida\u2019s ex-felons and underestimates the share of the vote George W. Bush would have won among them.\u201d\n\nIn other words, when it comes to political beliefs, the race of felons is more of a factor than any crime they committed. (Burch\u2019s findings also suggest that Democrats pushing for ex-felon voting rights are going to be disappointed in the results.)\n\nIt is certainly an undeniable fact that a huge percentage of African Americans vote for Democrats, just as white males tend to favor Republicans. But Cruz is wildly off base when he claims that across the United States the \u201coverwhelming majority of violent criminals are Democrats.\u201d\n\nThe data that are the source of his statement were based on the party registrations of mostly black and Hispanic prisoners in just three states \u2014 and do not make a distinction between violent and nonviolent felons. In other words, the study does not show what Cruz claimed; in fact the authors specifically rejected his statement as a misinterpretation of their findings. He can\u2019t prove what he claims with such great certainty and thus earns Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
