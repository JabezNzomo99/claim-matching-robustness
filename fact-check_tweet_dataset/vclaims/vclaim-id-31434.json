Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of \u2018Jatayu\u2019 bird sighted at Sadayamangalam forest in Kerala. Fact: The bird seen in the video is not \u2018Jatayu\u2019, it is an \u2018Andean condor\u2019. The video shows it being freed by rescuers in Argentina in 2014. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were subjected to reverse image search technique, a certain keyframe was found in an article of \u2018The Dodo\u2019. As per the article, the bird seen in the video is an \u2018Andean condor\u2019 named \u2018Sayani\u2019 and it was freed by rescuers in Argentina after its treatment in 2014. In 2012, \u2018Sayani\u2019 was found close to death in Catamarca (Argentina) after being poisoned by the ranchers in the region. Other articles about the incident can be read here and here. The complete video of \u2018Sayani\u2019 being set free by rescuers can be seen here.\n\nTo conclude, the bird seen in the video is an \u2018Andean condor\u2019 and the video was shot in Argentina.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
