According to the report, the man seen in the video is Nurul Alam who was beaten up and stripped by a local leader of a Bangladeshi youth organisation called Jubo League.

The incident took place in Chakoria area of Bangladesh\u2019s Cox\u2019s Bazaar on May 24. Jubo League president Ansoor Alam had beaten up 62-year-old Mohammed Nurul Alam after which Ashraf Hossain, the son on Nurul Alam had registered a case at the Chakoria police station. The report further stated that Nurul Alam was returning home after Eid shopping when Ansoor Alam apprehended the old man and started abusing him. He took away Nurul Alam\u2019s phone and cash worth Rs 7,500. The elderly man was later rescued by his younger son Ashraf Hossain who came to the spot after hearing his screams.\n\nIt is also informed that the accused Ansoor Alam didn\u2019t respond to calls initiated by the police for inquiring about the matter. According to a report, police have arrested three people involved in the case. However, the report also claimed that the main accused Ansoor Alam and a few other accused were in hiding.\n\nTherefore, a video of a leader with Jubo league publically thrashing an old man in Bangladesh is getting widely shared on Indian social media.", "lang": "en"}
