So we took our own look.\n\n \n\n The health care law took effect in 2010, and taxes began then to support the measure. Key parts of the bill don\u2019t kick in until 2014.\n\n \n\n In an item about Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, PolitiFact National noted that the 10-year aspect of the claim was correct.\n\n \n\n The item read, in part:: \"The CBO said this about the health care law back in 2010: It lowers the deficit, by about $124 billion over 10 years. And in 2011, when Republicans offered a bill to repeal the health care law, the CBO said that increased the deficit, by about $210 billion over 10 years.\"\n\n \n\n That estimate was updated in July 2012, when the CBO said the law would cost $84 billion less than it had previously predicted.\n\n \n\n On Jan. 6, 2011, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virg., made virtually the same claim as Hovde, saying the law \"offset 6 years of benefits with 10 years of tax increases\" and it was Half True.\n\n \n\n PolitiFact Virginia noted: \"Cantor\u2019s argument that the \u2018benefits\u2019 don\u2019t kick in until 2014 is true if you\u2019re looking at the biggest provisions of the law. But many other, smaller provisions to boost coverage have already taken effect.\" Those include small business tax credits, coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, assistance for early retirees and coverage for dependents until they\u2019re age 26. Also, not all of the taxes kicked in immediately.\n\n \n\n On March 1, 2011, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli said the law has \"six years of costs against 10 years of tax revenue.\" PolitiFact Virginia also rated Cuccinelli\u2019s claim Half True.\n\n \n\n \"The bill is is a bit front-loaded. About 10 percent of the taxes for health care reform will be levied in the first four years to pay for an estimated 1 percent of cost,\" it wrote. \"But Cuccinelli is flat wrong to say health care reform offers no benefits before 2014.\"\n\n \n\n So, yes, the taxing began in 2010, and key parts of it don\u2019t kick in until 2014. But, like so many claims, it\u2019s not as simple as that. Some benefits already kicked in, and some of the taxes don\u2019t take effect until later.\n\n \n\n Our rating\n\n \n\n Hovde repeats a claim that\u2019s been a routine part of the GOP attack on Obamacare: that there are 10 years of taxes charged for six years of benefits. It\u2019s true that the tax money began to come in starting in 2010. But it\u2019s false that the benefits don\u2019t kick in until 2014. There are numerous parts of the bill that have already taken effect.\n\n \n\n Hovde joins the crowd who have made the same claim. It\u2019s Half True.", "lang": "en"}
