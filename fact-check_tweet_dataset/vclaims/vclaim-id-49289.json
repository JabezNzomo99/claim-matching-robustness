But these Christines are two different individuals.\n\nChristine Grady, Fauci\u2019s wife, was born in New Jersey in 1952, attended Georgetown University, authored hundreds of papers in the field of bioethics, served on the President\u2019s Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues from 2010 to 2017, and is currently the Chief of the Department of Bioethics for the National Institutes of Health.\n\nChristine Maxwell, Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s sister, was born in France in 1950 and co-founded Magellan, one of the internet\u2019s early search engines. According to The Daily Beast, Maxwell was a doctoral candidate at the The University of Texas at Dallas in 2019.\n\nLorraine eventually deleted her tweet and admitted that she had been wrong about Dr. Fauci being married to Maxwell\u2019s sister:", "lang": "en"}
