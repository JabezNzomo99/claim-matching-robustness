Moreover, to receive a 72 percent contribution from the federal government for the premiums, members and staff must purchase plans offered in the Gold tier.\n\nBut when we looked on the SHOP exchange at the Gold plans, many had no deductibles. At most, we could find a deductible of $3,500. So how did Mulvaney\u2019s deductible get so high?\n\n\u201cMick\u2019s family has health-care needs that could not be met with any single policy on the D.C. exchange,\u201d an aide said in an email. \u201cWith his triplets living at home in S.C. (with mom), and Mick splitting time between D.C. and S.C., there was no single provider that met their specific needs. (i.e. a plan that included the children\u2019s existing doctors, Pam\u2019s doctors, and care if it was needed by any of them in D.C.). As a result, like many other families, they needed two plans. Those plans together resulted in deductibles in the range he has described.\u201d\n\nNow let\u2019s look at that worker making $34,800. As with Mulvaney, we assumed he was married and had three children and lived in Lancaster, S.C. With the help of Cynthia Cox, associate director for the Program for the Study of Health Reform and Private Insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation, we calculated the premiums and out-of-pocket costs for this worker and his family, both under Obamacare and under the House Republican plan.\n\nIt turns out that a person making one-fifth of Mulvaney\u2019s salary would actually be able to afford to go to a doctor. In 2017, he would only have to pay $57 a month for his premiums on a Silver plan because Obamacare would provide $1,620 a month in premium support (tax credits). The total premium would be $19,439, but under the ACA, he would only have to pay 2.04 percent of his income on health-insurance premiums.\n\nSouth Carolina is one of the states that refused to expand Medicaid, or else our worker and his family would have qualified for Medicaid. It\u2019s also likely his children would have qualified for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, but to keep it simple we will assume a five-person family on the plan.\n\nTo compare with the House bill, Cox ran the numbers for 2020. Under the Affordable Care Act, the base premium is projected to be about $22,040, while the tax credit would be about $21,300. That results in a yearly cost of $740, or $62 a month. The Silver plan would also have reduced cost sharing, again bringing their deductible below $1,000 and possibly as low as zero, depending on which plan the family picked.\n\nUnder the proposed House bill, Cox said the premiums would be more or less the same, as the adults would have higher premiums but the children lower premiums. But the family would only receive a tax credit of about $12,000, so the monthly premium would jump to $837. That\u2019s 13 times higher than under Obamacare. Moreover, the family would no longer receive cost sharing, so their deductible would be much higher.\n\nRepublicans have said they would usher in insurance-market reforms that they claim also will help bring costs down but that would require 60 votes in the Senate, a still dubious prospect given there are only 52 Republicans. So, based on the legislation that\u2019s written, the House replacement bill would be a bad deal for the worker and his family.\n\nBut it turns out that for people making below the median household income in the United States, the ACA is often a pretty good deal. There is certainly no premium support for someone making Mulvaney\u2019s salary, and his particular deductible situation does seem rather high. But he was talking about the combined cost of two plans, not just a plan purchased as a member of Congress (who already receives a substantial reduction in premiums).", "lang": "en"}
