Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: A Swedish newspaper reported about the various events that took place before Abhinandan\u2019s release. Fact: Neither any Swedish source nor any other credible source was found on the internet for the story posted on Facebook. Hence the claim that a Swedish newspaper has written about it is FALSE.\n\nThe events and story narrated in the post cannot be fact-checked as they are all back-door talks between the diplomats of various countries. But, it can be checked whether any Swedish newspaper has really published the story narrated in the Facebook post. When searched for the news related to Abhinandan in Swedish newspapers, no such article was found on the internet. For further clarity, FACTLY has written to the Swedish embassy in India. This article will be updated if there is any reply from the embassy.\n\nTo sum it up, no Swedish newspaper has published the story narrated in the post.\n\nUpdate: The Swedish Embassy has responded saying that they do not have any knowledge about such media report.", "lang": "en"}
