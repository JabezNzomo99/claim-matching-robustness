He was sympathetic to their plight, citing his father\u2019s arrival as a refugee. But he also expressed security concerns, saying the United States needs to thoroughly vet Syrians seeking refugee status or applying for visas.\n\nDuring the hearing, Cruz said: \u201cI\u2019m the son of a refugee from Cuba who fled oppression, and to the refugees who\u2019ve come here today, let me say welcome. And I think the United States should always be a clarion voice for freedom and a voice against the oppression of the innocent.\u201d\n\nIn February 2014, Cruz was quoted in a Fox News segment about Syrian refugees. During the portion of the segment addressing U.S. plans to accept more refugees, the clip cut away to Cruz saying: \u201cWe have welcomed refugees \u2014 the tired, huddled masses \u2014 for centuries. That\u2019s been the history of the United States. We should continue to do so. \u2026 We have to continue to be vigilant to make sure those coming are not affiliated with the terrorists, but we can do that.\u201d\n\nCruz said he changed his mind because the landscape had changed since early 2014, citing the rise of the Islamic State militant group and what he called the \u201cenormous failures\u201d of the Obama administration\u2019s intelligence operations. \u201cSadly, it appears that at least one of the terrorists who committed these attacks in Paris came as a refugee in Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what does President Obama and Hillary Clinton want to do? Bring tens of thousands of them to America and put them here.\u201d (Actually, as we have noted, Obama has committed to accepting only 10,000 refugees from Syria.)\n\nIn the ad, the woman says Cruz \u201cwanted to let in more Syrian refugees.\u201d That was the case in 2014, but Cruz has a different policy stance now. Great America PAC spokesman Jesse Benton accused Cruz of a \u201cconvenient political flip-flop\u201d: \u201cThe ad does not say when he supported it, just that he did, which is factually unassailable.\u201d\n\nBenton also cited Cruz\u2019s role in the debate over the 2013 Gang of Eight comprehensive immigration reform bill. Cruz had introduced five amendments to the bill, including one that expanded legal immigration, and gave passionate speeches in support of his amendments. But now he says that he never supported legalization and that he introduced those amendments only as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would kill the Gang of Eight bill.\n\nThere is evidence that his amendments contained specific elements that may have been designed to dismantle the Gang of Eight coalition. But there\u2019s no way to prove which version of the story is the truth; what we can say is that Cruz was being disingenuous then or disingenuous now. Benton said both scenarios \u201care troubling and call his credibility into question.\u201d\n\nIn this ad, Great America PAC uses two former policy stances held by Cruz to attack his credibility. The woman\u2019s statement is cleverly scripted; she says Cruz \u201cwanted\u201d to accept more Syrian refugees and give amnesty to undocumented immigrants, indicating Cruz once held these views. But then she switches to present tense, indicating that Cruz\u2019s past stances jeopardize her family: \u201cThat won\u2019t protect my family.\u201d\n\nPoliticians have a right to change their policy views when faced with new information, or if the desires of their constituency change. The PAC should know that its own candidate, Trump, has changed his mind on too many issues to count. Cruz appears to have changed his stance on Syrian refugees out of new information \u2014 the rise of the Islamic State. Cruz did once propose legalization (which some call \u201camnesty\u201d) of undocumented immigrants, as the ad claims, but he now says he never really meant it.\n\nCruz has done voters a disservice with his \u201cpoison pill\u201d explanation of his 2013 stance, since the public is now left with two completely conflicting statements the senator has made on the pathway to legalization of undocumented immigrants. As we have noted before, Great America PAC has solid ground to criticize Cruz\u2019s statements about his immigration amendments in 2013 \u2014 the comments he made then and now don\u2019t jibe.", "lang": "en"}
