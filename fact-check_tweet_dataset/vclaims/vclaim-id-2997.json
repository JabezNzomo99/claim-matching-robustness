Misinformation about him has been spreading rapidly on the internet since then.\n\nOne story circulating on Facebook claims that Cruz is a registered Democrat. He is not. According to records from the Florida Department of State, he is not a registered voter.\n\nThe story making that claim originated on a conservative website called Gateway Pundit with the headline: \u201cBREAKING: Don\u2019t Let The MAGA Hat Fool You, Hispanic Shooter \u2018Nicolas de Jesus Cruz\u2019 Was A Registered Democrat.\u201d\n\nThat site has since changed its original post and replaced the headline with this one: \u201cUPDATE: Nicolas de Jesus Cruz was not Registered as Democrat as Some Sources Reported.\u201d\n\nBut, several other websites had already copied the inaccurate version and promoted it on Facebook. Users of the social media site rightly flagged it as potentially false.\n\nOthers, though, believed the claim and made comments like this: \u201cIt is beginning to appear, from all these shootings, that being a democrat or having an affinity to progressive thought, is a red flag indicator of a potential mass shooter!\u201d\n\nThe story also gets the shooter\u2019s name wrong \u2014 according to the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s arrest report, his name is Nikolas Jacob Cruz.\n\nIt also refers to a picture that has been used in a number of media reports and is purported to show Cruz wearing a red cap bearing President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d The photo came from a now-deleted Instagram account under the name \u201cnikolascruzmakarov.\u201d There is a snapshot of the account on the Internet Archive, but it was captured on Feb. 14, the day of the shooting, and there has been no official verification that the account belonged to Cruz.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nAnderson, Curt. \u201cLife or death main decision for school shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz.\u201d Associated Press. 18 Feb 2018.\n\nWintrich, Lucian. \u201cBREAKING: Don\u2019t Let The MAGA Hat Fool You, Hispanic Shooter \u2018Nicolas de Jesus Cruz\u2019 Was A Registered Democrat.\u201d Gateway Pundit. 14 Feb 2018.", "lang": "en"}
