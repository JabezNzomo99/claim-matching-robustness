{"title": "PolitiFact - No, someone wasn't paid $3,500 to protest Donald Trump; it's fake news", "subtitle": "Donald Trump has suggested that paid protesters targeted his rallies during the 2016 campaign, and even stronger charges", "author": "www.politifact.com", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-72373", "url": "http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/17/blog-posting/no-someone-wasnt-paid-3500-protest-donald-trump-it/", "vclaim": "Donald Trump has suggested that paid protesters targeted his rallies during the 2016 campaign, and even stronger charges from conspiracy websites such as Infowars have flooded the Internet.\n\nIf such claims piqued your interest and you plugged \"paid protesters\" into Google at mid-day on Nov. 17, at the top of the list is this one: \"Donald Trump Protester Speaks Out: 'I Was Paid $3,500 To Protest Trump's Rally.' \"\n\nThe link cites not one but two seemingly mainstream media outlets. It\u2019s credited to \"abcnews.com.co\" and includes the abbreviation \"(AP),\" which is how the Associated Press marks its stories.\n\nBut the story doesn\u2019t have anything to do with ABC News, and it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the Associated Press. It is 100 percent fake.\n\nIt was created by Paul Horner, who posts fake news on a variety of websites. Some of his posts go viral, presumably boosting his standing with Google\u2019s news algorithm. The fake news posts typically earn Horner -- according to an interview with the Washington Post -- $10,000 a month in ad sales.\n\nIn the Post interview, Horner took credit for the fake news item about the protester being paid $3,500.\n\n\"His followers don\u2019t fact-check anything \u2014 they\u2019ll post everything, believe anything,\" Horner said. Referring to then-Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, Horner said, \"His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. Like, I made that up. I posted a fake ad on Craigslist.\" Here\u2019s a screenshot of Lewandowski\u2019s since-deleted tweet:\n\nAsked by the Post\u2019s Caitlin Dewey why he posted the fake story, Horner responded, \"Just \u2019cause his supporters were under the belief that people were getting paid to protest at their rallies, and that\u2019s just insane. I\u2019ve gone to Trump protests \u2014 trust me, no one needs to get paid to protest Trump. I just wanted to make fun of that insane belief, but it took off. They actually believed it.\"\n\nThe story\u2019s high position on Google search results after the election likely stems from Horner\u2019s decision to re-date the post, which originally ran in March. The current version is dated Nov. 11.\n\nAutomated algorithms may not be able to tell fact from fiction, but a human with minimal understanding of typical news articles might have noticed, after clicking into it, that the article eventually degenerates into a rant against Snopes.com, the urban-legends site that has regularly debunked articles from websites operated by Horner.\n\nHorner even quoted himself by name in the fake story, something he does in many of his posts.\n\nPolitiFact has also debunked at least three fake Horner stories in recent years. PolitiFact was unable to reach Horner independently.\n\nA web posting headlined, \"Donald Trump Protester Speaks Out: 'I Was Paid $3,500 To Protest Trump's Rally,' \" ranks high on Google searches for the phrase \"paid protesters.\" But the article is 100 percent fabricated, as its author acknowledges.
