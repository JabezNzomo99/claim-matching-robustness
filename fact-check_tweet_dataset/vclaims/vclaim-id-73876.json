However, the claim is false; the video actually shows a fire caused by a crude oil pipeline that ruptured last month in a suburb of Cairo, Egypt.\n\n\n\n\"Pls pray for Lebanon country (sic),\" reads the caption of the footage published on Facebook.\n\nScreenshot of the misleading Facebook post, taken on August 10, 2020\n\nThe 30-second video clip shows clouds of dark smoke billowing from a large fire on the side of a road where vehicles are parked. Several people can be seen dragging what appears to be an injured person away from the inferno.\n\nAlso Read: Aftermath Image Of 2015 Warehouse Explosion In China Shared As Beirut\n\nThe video was also published in another Facebook post with the same claim.\n\nHowever, it does not show the scene of the two explosions that devastated Beirut on August 4, 2020. This video was shot along Ismailia Road in a suburb of Cairo on July 14, 2020, when a fire broke out due to a leaking crude oil pipeline.\n\nUsing the InVID WeVerify tool, AFP Fact Check ran reverse image searches on keyframes of the video and found it was published by several news channels that reported on the incident, including American broadcaster ABC News.\n\n\n\n These reports explained that the video shows blazes along the Shuqair-Mostorod crude oil pipeline in Cairo.\n\nBBC journalist Mohamed Yehia also posted the footage on Twitter, explaining that it was filmed along Ismailia Road.\n\nAt the 46th second of a longer version of the video published by Global News, AFP Fact Check observed a blue signpost along the road with an indicator for \"Cairo Airport\".\n\nScreenshot taken on August 10, 2020, showing the indicator for 'Cairo Airport'\n\nGoogle Maps shows that Cairo International Airport is indeed situated along the same road where the fire broke out.\n\nTwo news agencies, Reuters and AP, also reported on the incident.\n\n\"A major fire broke out after a leak of oil from the Shuqair-Mostorod pipeline next to a busy highway in a Cairo suburb on Tuesday and 17 people were injured, authorities said,\" Reuters reported on July 14, 2020.\n\nThis video thus has no link to the explosions in Beirut.\n\nAlso Read: Video Claiming Missile Strike Caused Blast At Beirut Port Is Doctored\n\nAt least 150 people were killed and more than 6,000 injured in major blasts resulting from the ignition of a huge depot of ammonium nitrate in Beirut's port, as AFP reported here.\n\nNumerous photos and videos of the Beirut blasts circulated on social media, including photos taken by AFP journalists.\n\nSince the Beirut explosions, several false and misleading claims have circulated on social media, including that they were caused by a nuclear explosion. AFP Fact Check has debunked this claim.", "lang": "en"}
