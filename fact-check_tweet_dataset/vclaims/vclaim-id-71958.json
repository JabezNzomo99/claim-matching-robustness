PolitiFact Oregon decided to check.\n\nSeveral newspaper opinion pieces, including one written by former Hillsboro Police Chief Ron Louie, say driver cards will not be valid for boarding an airplane.\n\nCausa Oregon, a leading immigrant-rights group, agrees. \"Ballot Measure 88 clearly states that it will be issued only to grant driving privileges, and prohibits use of the driver cards for anything other than the listed purposes,\" spokesman Erik Sorensen wrote us in an email.\n\nBut Oregon\u2019s Driver and Motor Vehicles Services division added confusion in a \"frequently asked questions\" document prepared for Measure 88.\n\nIn response to the question, \"Can I use a Driver Card as identification to board an airplane?\" the document says: \"It will be up to the TSA or the individual airport to determine whether to accept the Driver Card as identification.\"\n\nA TSA spokesman in Washington D.C. wrote to Larson, according to an email he shared with us: \"Driver\u2019s licenses are a valid form of ID for TSA.\"\n\nWe contacted a TSA official on our own, Nico Melendez, a Western Region TSA spokesman in California.\n\nMelendez, after checking with Oregon officials and administration attorneys, said in a telephone interview: \"State-issued driver cards would be acceptable forms of identification for our document-checkers at the airport. At this point, the understanding is that a card like this would be an acceptable form of identification.\"\n\nWhether an air passenger shows a TSA representative a driver\u2019s license or driver card doesn\u2019t matter, he said.\n\n\"What we are doing is verifying that the person who shows the card is the person who is traveling,\" Melendez said. \"It\u2019s not an immigration check.\"\n\nOregon voters on Nov. 4, 2014, will decide the fate of Measure 88, which, if passed, will allow DMV to issue driver cards to Oregon residents who can\u2019t prove legal residency.\n\nSupporters and the ballot measure itself say the cards could not be used to board airplanes. But TSA officials \u2013 the people checking passengers onto planes -- say otherwise.", "lang": "en"}
