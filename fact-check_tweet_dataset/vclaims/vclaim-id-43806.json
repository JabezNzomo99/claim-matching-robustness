The posts claim that first responders in New South Wales, an Australian state devastated by recent bushfires, have discouraged people from displaying ribbons at their homes, as firefighters use them to locate people in distress and mark fire hydrants. This claim is not true, but other states across Australia do use ribbons during rescue efforts.\n\nOne of the Facebook posts was published here on January 5, 2020.\n\nThe claim reads: \u201cNSW Fire and Rescue have asked to NOT, repeat NOT put yellow or orange ribbons on your gates or letterbox. As much as it is appreciated, the rescue services have not been approached with this initiative and THE ONLY WAY TO FIND PERSONS IN DISTRESS OR FIRE HYDRANTS IS BY RED OR ORANGE RIBBONS TIED TO GATES OR POSTBOXES. OBVIOUSLY THIS WILL DEEPLY IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO FIND HYDRANTS AND HELP AS NEEDED. PLEASE HELP SPREAD THIS MESSAGE . Many thanks xx. Safety first everyone\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe message was posted in response to numerous Facebook posts encouraging residents to display coloured ribbons at their homes in order to show their support for firefighters during an intense bushfire season.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nOther Facebook posts with similar claims about rescue practices in New South Wales have been shared thousands of times and can be seen here, here, here, here, here, here, here and here.\n\nBut in New South Wales and Northern Territory, ribbons are not used by firefighters. In states including Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania, ribbons are used by first responders to mark potential hazards or identify water supplies.\n\nRibbons are not used by Fire and Rescue New South Wales (FRNSW). Instead, firefighters rely on signage to direct them to water sources.\n\n\u201cFire and Rescue NSW do not use ribbons as part of their practice, we use HR or HP hydrant signs on poles which tell us if the street hydrant is on the road or footpath, we also use the [Static Water Supply] signs to check for available water sources,\u201d a FRNSW spokesperson told AFP via email on January 6. \u201cWe encourage anyone who has a Static Water Supply (pool, dam, large water tank) to instead fix a SWS sign to their mailbox or front fence.\"\n\nThe New South Wales Rural Fire Service also told AFP that its firefighters do not use ribbons.\n\n\u201cRibbons tied at the front of house don\u2019t signify anything in particular for the NSW Rural Fire Service. It is possible that some local brigades may ask their local communities for a signal but none that we are aware of,\u201d an agency spokesperson said via email on January 7.\n\nColour-coded ribbons are used by Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) to denote certain property characteristics, such as a static water supply or potential hazard.\n\n\u201cColoured ribbons can play an important role in alerting firefighters of what to be aware of when responding to an incident,\u201d an agency spokesperson told AFP via email on January 6. \u201cQFES appreciates the community\u2019s support for our firefighters and their desire to pay tribute to them. However, we discourage residents from fixing ribbons to their letterbox in the event it may incorrectly represent a property\u2019s characteristics.\u201d\n\nThe South Australia Country Fire Service (CFS) does use flagging tape as an indicator for firefighters, but it is \u201cnot easily confused with ribbons.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring major incidents the CFS may use flagging tape to indicate places of significance, however this only in very specific circumstances. Flagging tape is very clearly identifiable for firefighters, and not easily confused with ribbons,\u201d a CFS spokesperson told AFP via email on January 6.\n\nThe spokesperson added that while the solidarity ribbons campaign is not a \u201cCFS approved or endorsed activity,\u201d the agency is \u201cthankful to the community for any acknowledgement they would like to make towards our volunteers.\u201d\n\nThe Tasmania Fire Service does use ribbons to indicate whether a property has been assessed for damage.\n\n\u201cTFS uses ribbons on letterboxes during Rapid Impact Assessments to signify whether the property has been assessed for damage after fires have passed,\u201d a Tasmania Fire Service spokesperson told AFP via email on January 6.\n\nThe Country Fire Authority (CFA), which serves Victoria outside of Melbourne, told AFP that ribbons are used in some areas to signal distress or water availability.\n\n\u201cRibbons are used in some areas to signal various situations including distress, availability of water etc. Colours may vary in different districts. To avoid any confusion to our emergency workers, we ask that support or fundraising ribbons not be used,\u201d a CFA spokesperson said via email on January 7.\n\nThe Metropolitan Fire Brigade, which provides services to Melbourne, told AFP that ribbons are not used by its firefighters, but also discouraged the practice.\n\n\u201cMFB does not use ribbons as a means of communications during firefighting operations,\u201d a spokesperson told AFP via email on January 8. \u201cThe bushfire firefighting effort involves a number of emergency response agencies, therefore the placing of ribbons on the front of homes is not advised as it may cause confusion to teams on the fireground, particularly those from interstate or overseas.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) of Western Australia said its first responders do not use ribbons.\n\n\u201cOur Community Preparedness team are unaware of ribbons signifying anything to firefighters,\u201d a DFES spokesperson told AFP via email on January 10.\n\nThe Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Emergency Services Agency, which includes the ACT Rural Fire Service, said it is not aware of any \u201cformal significance\u201d regarding ribbons.\n\n\u201cThe ACT Emergency Services Agency (ESA) is not aware of any formal significance connected to ribbons being displayed on houses or in garden areas,\u201d a spokesperson told AFP via email on January 8. \u201cESA does not suggest people mark their home with ribbons.\u201d\n\nRibbons are not used by Northern Territory Police, Fire and Emergency Services.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t something that we have seen in the NT and it isn\u2019t something that has a significance to our agency,\u201d an agency spokesperson told AFP via email on January 6.", "lang": "en"}
