Given that this \u201cquote\u201d originated on a thread dedicated to showing why Hillary Clinton should not be elected president of the United States, and that no reputable publication had ever linked Carter to this phrase prior to its publication on this forum, it\u2019s probable Jimmy Carter never said it.", "lang": "en"}
