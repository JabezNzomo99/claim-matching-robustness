(Many people are likely sharing it as a joke, but some people seem to have taken it seriously.)\n\nThe post includes an image of a lion walking freely in a residential area. The image is about four years-old and was\u2014according to UK news reports from 2016\u2014taken in South Africa, not Russia.\n\nMailOnline reported at the time that the lion was part of a local film production in Johannesburg. Africa Check debunked a different story in 2019 that used the same image.\n\nThe text accompanying the image says \u201cRussia unleashed more than 500 lions on its streets to ensure people are staying indoors during this pandemic outbreak\u201d.\n\nThere are no actual reports that Russia has taken this drastic measure to stop the spread of Covid-19 (the infection caused by the new coronavirus).\n\nAt the time that the post was shared on Facebook (22 March), no widespread lockdown measures had been reported in the country, with Vladamir Putin declaring that the outbreak in Russia was \u201cunder control\u201d.\n\nAs at 24 March 2020, 438 cases of Covid-19 and one death from the virus had been officially reported in Russia (although there have been questions raised about the reliability of these figures).", "lang": "en"}
