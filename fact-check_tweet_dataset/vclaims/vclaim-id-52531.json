The speaker pointed out that despite the measures taken to tame the pandemic, the number of confirmed cases does not cease to rise. He, therefore, relates the rise in infections to Naira notes, from where the virus spreads to handlers of the paper money.\n\nSimilarly, on 30th of April, a message circulating on WhatsApp informs readers about how naira notes put them at risk of contracting the new coronavirus despite obeying the lockdown directives. The Broadcast Message \u2013 BC \u2013 draws attention to the fact that money travels a lot and establishes the probability of possible contamination as it moves from one hand to another across different locations. Hence, it encourages readers to wash their hands after every contact with a currency.\n\nThe President of Nigeria has placed the nation on lockdown for over a month. Although there has been social media and physical rebellion against the move, many Nigerians are still obeying the necessary confinement put in place to prevent a rapid spread of COVID-19. As Nigerians keep safe indoors, should they worry about the naira notes in their possessions?\n\nBanks Notes and the Novel Coronavirus\n\nSpeculations abound that physical transactions contribute to the spread of the new coronavirus, which has become a threat to the young and old as it travels around the globe.\n\nThere have been different thoughts about how the virus spreads, one of which is the one that says physical currencies aid its transmission. Consequently, various institutions have suggested solutions. Additionally, countries like China and Korea reportedly sterilised cash to mitigate the spread.\n\nWhile studies have shown that banknotes may transmit disease, there\u2019s no conclusive scientific study that suggests that COVID-19 may be spread through contaminated currency notes.\n\nAdditionally, many have raised the possibilities of transmitting COVID-19 through physical currencies and advised the use of contactless technologies for payments. The World Health Organization has however stated that:\n\nRecall that coronaviruses remain viable on surfaces for hours, even days, depending on the type of surface and that merely touching an infected surface does not guarantee infection. The contaminated hands have to come in contact with the eyes, nose or mouth before one can be infected. Hence, the rationale to always wash and disinfect the hands, and to always try as much as possible not to touch those parts of the body.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the concerns of the claim-sources and appreciate their efforts to encourage the hand-washing habit, stating that banknotes are the reasons for the spread of the coronavirus is not factual as there is no scientific evidence or credible reportage to support the claim.\n\nMoreover, experts have not established how long the new coronavirus can survive on banknotes, nor informed of its transfer potential. Therefore, merely touching currency notes does not guarantee transmission, especially if one maintains proper hygiene after handling\u2013thorough, hand-washing, and refraining from touching the face.", "lang": "en"}
