In fact, the pictures come from the pope\u2019s visit to Abu Dhabi in February. He did meet with one of the world\u2019s most important Islamic leaders to celebrate the creation of a new church and mosque on a shared site, but the document signed at the event was a call for inter-religious tolerance, not an agreement to form a new world religion.\n\nOne of the posts, archived here, has been shared nearly 5,600 times since it was posted on July 8. \u201cSoon many false charismatic and evangelical preachers will join the Pope to join with Islam and all other religions to form the one world religion,\u201d reads part of the post.\n\nThe same text and pictures of the pope signing a document were shared by many other Facebook accounts, some of which we have archived here, here, and here.\n\nWe ran a reverse image search on Google to trace the source of the pictures, and quickly found that they were taken on February 4, 2019, during the pope\u2019s historic visit to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. You can find them, among other places, on the official website for the trip.\n\nAs reported by AFP, the trip was the first by a Christian pope to the Gulf, the birthplace of Islam. It included a mass for an estimated 17,000 Catholics as well as the signing by the pope and Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, imam of Cairo's Al-Azhar, Sunni Islam's prestigious seat of learning, of a document on \"human fraternity for world peace\".\n\nThe first of the photographs shows the pope and al-Tayeb signing the foundation stone for a new church and mosque to be built alongside each other in Abu Dhabi -- you can read more here in UAE newspaper The National.\n\nThe second shows them signing the Human Fraternity document, which can be found in full here. While it aims to foster peace and tolerance between the world\u2019s major world religions, it does not, contrary to the Facebook posts, include any kind of agreement on founding a single world faith.\n\n\u201cWe call upon intellectuals, philosophers, religious fig res, artists, media professionals and men and women of culture in every part of the world, to rediscover the values of peace, justice, goodness, beauty, human fraternity and coexistence in order to confirm the importance of these values as anchors of salvation for all, and to promote them everywhere,\u201d the document reads.\n\nAbu Dhabi's crown prince, Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, also signed the foundation stone of the new church and mosque as part of the inter-faith initative -- you can see one of the photographs in his tweet below.", "lang": "en"}
