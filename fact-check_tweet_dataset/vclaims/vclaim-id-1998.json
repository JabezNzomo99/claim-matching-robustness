According to Jeff Derpinger of the White House Office of Information and Propaganda, President Trump talked to J.L. Meshner for about five minutes and told him he can either find a new host for the Late Show or kiss his network\u2019s White House press credentials goodbye. \u2026 Colbert\u2019s lawyer says the comedian will be filing suit against CBS and President Trump. He claims that not only is CBS in breach of contract but that Trump violated federal law when he used the Office of the President to carry out an act of \u201crevenge.\u201d What he doesn\u2019t [seem] to get is that Trump is the chief executive and can pretty much do whatever he wants if it\u2019s in the best interest of the country, which this is.\n\nIn his 1 May 2017, Colbert insulted Trump repeatedly and made a joke about him performing fellatio on Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Last Line of Defense claim appeared as news broke that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is investigating Colbert over the monologue. But the claim, like all other information published on that site, is fabricated.
