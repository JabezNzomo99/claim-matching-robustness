A proud example: The push to get media outlets, governments and airlines to refer the capital of Ukraine by its proper Ukrainian name \u2013 spelled in English as \u201cKyiv\u201d \u2013 and not the Russian version \u2013 spelled in English \u201cKiev.\u201d Government officials and civic activists have helped popularize the idea with the hashtag #KyivnotKiev.\n\nMany international news outlets have made that change. The BBC amended its style guide on October 14, 2019. The Washington Post did so on October 16. The New York Times initially held out, then switched to Kyiv on November 18. Airlines and international airports have also made the change.\n\nBut while the English world has begun embracing the new spelling, pronunciation is another matter. And now that Ukraine and Kyiv are at the center of high-profile impeachment hearings in the U.S. House of Representatives, global TV viewers have turned to Twitter to deplore witnesses pronouncing \u2018Kyiv\u2019 as \u2018KEEV\u2019.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s Daily Mail ran a story on it, declaring that \u2018KEEV\u2019 was correct.\n\n\u201cTwitter users were left absolutely stumped upon hearing diplomats Bill Taylor and George Kent pronounce the city as 'Keev' rather than the more typically pronunciation of 'Key-ev' during their testimony on Capitol Hill,\u201d the Daily Mailwrote. \u201cBut it turns out their pronunciation is authentic to the Eastern European country, and real Ukrainians pronounce their capital as 'Keev', as the diplomats did.\u201d\n\nMieke Eoyang, vice president of the National Security Program at Third Way, a Washington D.C. think tank, also weighed in. \u201cUkrainians pronounce it KEEV,\u201d he tweeted, calling it a matter of \u201cUkrainian patriotism to reject Russian pronunciation.\u201d Matthew Yglesias, co-founder of Vox, also bought in.\n\nOnly one problem: \u201cKEEV\u201d is incorrect. How so?\n\nIn Ukrainian (spoken by many here at Voice of America), the sound of the letter \u0418 in \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432 (Kyiv) does not have an exact English equivalent. But the closest accepted is like the \u2018i\u2019 in words like \u2018sit\u2019 or \u2018fish\u2019 (not an \u2018e\u2019 like in \u2018we\u2019).More importantly, the word is actually two syllables, Ki\u2019-yeev, with stress on the first syllable. In our video you can see a native speaker pronouncing Kyiv in Ukrainian.\n\nOn November 13, The New York Times wrote about the matter. The article included an audio file by Yuri Shevchuk, a Ukranian lecturer at Columbia University, pronouncing Kyiv.\n\nWhile the Times article stressed that the final \u2018v\u2019 in Kyiv is pronounced more like a \u2018w,\u2019 it failed to note an important nuance: It is also common and acceptable in Ukraine to pronounce the \u2018v\u2019 as a \u2018v\u2019. The vowel sounds of the two syllables, and the stress on the first, are more important.", "lang": "en"}
