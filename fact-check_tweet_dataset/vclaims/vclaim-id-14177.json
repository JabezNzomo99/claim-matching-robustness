The video is available online since June, last year.\n\nWe were directed to a YouTube video by a local news channel Channel 9, which narrated an incident of lathi-charge on Hindu Jagran Manch karyakartas at the Aligarh SSP karyalay gate, as the muted video played.\n\nWe looked up news reports and found that the incident happened in Aligarh, in June last year. The Aligarh police resorted to lathi-charge when activists of Hindu Jagran Manch locked the Special Superintendent of Police (SSP) office gate while protesting - The HJM was demanding the arrest of a man who was booked for an attempt to murder in 2018.
