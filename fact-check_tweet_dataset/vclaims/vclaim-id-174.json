The posts show a screenshot of a CDC job posting for a \u201cPublic Health Advisor (Quarantine Program)\u201d made in November 15, 2020. Examples can be seen on Facebook, ( here , here , here , here ), Instagram ( here , here ) and Twitter ( here , here ).\n\nPosts read: \u201cThis was a planned virus, don\u2019t play yourself\u201d and \u201cYou don\u2019t believe this was planned? Why did the CDC need people for quarantine programs all over the United States right before this came out\u201d.\n\nWhile the posts reference an authentic CDC job posting (still visible archive.ph/ZwZA3 ), the claim that the CDC knew in advance that a COVID-19 pandemic would strike is false. The CDC confirmed to Reuters the job posting is part of its regular hiring process. The role of Public Health Service Officer in quarantine stations has existed for at least a century.\n\n\u201cThis particular job posting was to fill vacancies at our quarantine stations, which is part of a regular hiring process when positions are vacant,\u201d a CDC spokesperson told Reuters.\n\nThe CDC explained that these quarantine stations, located at 20 ports of entry and land-border crossings where international travelers arrive ( here ), are part of a system intended to limit the introduction and spread of infectious diseases in the United States.\n\n\u201c[Quarantine stations] are staffed with quarantine medical and public health officers from CDC. These health officers decide whether ill persons can enter the United States and what measures should be taken to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.\u201d\n\nFor centuries, quarantine stations have been part of a national mechanism to protect against imported diseases. A video by the CDC ( youtu.be/3Tt9-Tvoz5w?t=71 ) mentions the first quarantine station in the U.S. was built in 1793 during the yellow fever epidemic in Philadelphia. A photo provided by the National Library of Medicine ( here ) shows U.S. Public Health Service Officers performing quarantine station duties around 1912.\n\nFalse: Public Health Advisors are part of the CDC\u2019s regular hiring process; this job ad does not mean the CDC knew of the COVID-19 outbreak in advance\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
