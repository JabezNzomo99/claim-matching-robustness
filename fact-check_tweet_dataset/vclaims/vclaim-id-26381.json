As several of the stories go on to note, this refers to non-urgent GP appointments. It\u2019s still the case, for example, that just over 40% of appointments at GP surgeries in England are for same-day slots and over two thirds are within seven days, according to estimates from NHS Digital.\n\nBut even for non-urgent appointments, these figures can\u2019t reliably tell us how long patients are waiting on average, and certainly not to what extent patients are getting the speed of service they want.\n\nWhere the number comes from\n\nThe findings are based on an annual survey by Pulse Magazine, a magazine for GPs across the UK. It advertised a survey to its readers and email subscribers asking different GP practices, among other things: \u201cHow long is the average waiting time for non-urgent appointments at your practice?\u201d\n\nThe options practices were given spanned week-long periods: so \u201cless than a week\u201d, \u201c1-2 weeks\u201d, and so on, ending in \u201cmore than 5 weeks\u201d. Pulse Magazine then took the mid-points of each range to get the average time (so if the average was 1-2 weeks, that would count as 10.5 days).\n\nBased on responses from about 900 practices, it found an average time of just under 15 days, which is the highest figure it has found based on surveys in recent years.\n\nThis figure can\u2019t tell us how long patients wait for a GP\n\nThere are several reasons why these findings can\u2019t really tell us how long people are waiting for GP appointments.\n\nFirstly, there\u2019s no way to know whether the GP practices who responded to the survey are representative of practices across the UK.\n\nPulse told us it received responses from a range of practices across the UK and asked several questions in the survey, which it says was to avoid selection bias on one issue (in other words, to make it less likely they only got responses from practices that had particular issues with waiting times, for example).\n\nIt\u2019s also true that Pulse has been asking this question consistently for several years, and found an upward trend in the average waiting time nonetheless.\n\nBut the second issue is that we don\u2019t know how large the practices who responded to the survey are, and so how many patients they represent. Without knowing this, we can\u2019t conclude how long patients across the UK are waiting on average. All we can really say is that these findings show that the average GP practice responding to this survey sees a waiting time of roughly two weeks, and that this has been rising in recent years.\n\nA final point to note is that we can\u2019t say how many of these appointments were to see an actual GP (which was implied by some of the reporting of the survey), as opposed to another healthcare professional based at the practice, for example a nurse. Data on surgeries gathered by the NHS, for example, shows only around half of all appointments at practices are with GPs.\n\nIn England just over half of patients see a GP on the day they book an appointment.\n\nWhat do \u201cwaiting times\u201d even mean?\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to see figures on GP waiting times and picture frustrated patients waiting several weeks to get appointments when they would rather get one within days.\n\nThis kind of experience will certainly be reflected in the figures, but the reality is a bit more complicated.\n\nSometimes patients will want or expect a later appointment, due to their own availability or because the appointment is a scheduled follow-up from a previous one. Pulse Magazine said it expects GP practices will not have included follow-up appointments in their figures when responding to the survey, although given the wording of the question, there\u2019s no guarantee every practice will respond in the same way.\n\nThis issue doesn\u2019t just affect these figures. The NHS Digital data presented in the graph above similarly includes follow-up appointments and doesn\u2019t really give an indication of how many patients are receiving the service they want, at least in terms of the convenience and speed with which they can get an appointment.\n\nThe only source we\u2019re aware of that actually measures whether patients are getting what they want in terms of appointments is the GP Patient Survey for England, which we\u2019ve written about recently.\n\nRecent findings from that show that in 2019, 11% of patients said they \u201cnever or almost never\u201d speak to their preferred GP when they would like to, with another 41% saying they succeed \u201csome of the time\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
