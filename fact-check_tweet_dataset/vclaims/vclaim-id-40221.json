In the caption given along with the photo that is being shared, these social media users claim that the youngster is a policeman and that he found his lost uncle when Delhi Police lathicharged students of Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), protesting against a recent fee hike. They also claim that the old man is a student of JNU.The photo that is being shared widely is also digitally altered. The attempt was to make it appear as if the youngster is wearing a police hat, implying he is a cop.A Facebook user who goes by the name Shastra Veer posted a graphic card that had the photo in question along with text that said, \"Cop finds his lost uncle studying in JNU campus during a brawl between PhD students\", with a caption saying, \"Free loaders knows where free food/free stay will be available-free loaders will jump there. 70yr Moinuddin coming from JNU after completing his PhD.\"Many other Facebook users shared the same image along with the same caption.The old man seen in the photo has nothing to do with JNU or the protests happening there. The youngster seen in the photo is not a Delhi policeman.The old man seen in the photo is one Rehat Ali. Ali, an Indian citizen, was detained in Assam 's Goalpara Central Jail for three years after a quasi-judicial Foreigners' Tribunal (FT) declared him a 'Bangladeshi' owing to discrepancies in his age in the documents he submitted to prove his citizenship. The youngster seen in the photo is Lukman Ali, Rehat Ali's son.A simple reverse-image search of the image on Google will lead you to an article published in The Hindu on May 11, 2019, titled 'Held as 'Bangladeshi', Assam villager returns as 'Indian' after 3 years', which carries the original version of the photo.The photo is credited to The Hindu itself.We then searched on Google using the text in the graphic card that is going viral and found an article published on a website called Satire Today. It's clearly specified that the incident never happened, and that the photo has nothing to do with the article. The website said, \"Ps: Above incident never happened. And the picture along with this article has nothing to do with this article either. (sic).\"The Facebook users, however, assumed what is written in the article is true and started sharing the digitally-altered photo along with the headline with their own comment on it. We cannot confirm if this was a genuine mistake or a deliberate attempt to spread fake news.Times Fact Check has found many social media users sharing the screenshot of a satirical article with a claim that the old man seen in the image is a JNU student and that his nephew, working with Delhi Police, found him during a brawl between Delhi Police and JNU students.Both the claims are false.", "lang": "en"}
