The video has been in circulation for many months.\n\nWe found the video posted by Facebook user 'Ridouan Soumaa' on January 29, 2020, a couple of months before the Tablighi Jamaat conference at Nizamuddin.\n\nYouTube account 'sahibg official' uploaded the same video on January 31, 2020, with the caption, \"Corona virus big attack in Pakistan/fani\".\n\nPeople in the video are performing Zikr or Zikir, a method of praying mostly followed in Sufism. Usually during Zikir, people repeat the prayers.\n\nHowever, we could not trace the origin of the video.\n\nBut it is certain that the video has nothing to do with the faithful purposefully sneezing to spread novel coronavirus at Hazrat Nizamuddin mosque in Delhi.\n\nIndia Today Fact Check is part of IFCN Alliance on Covid-19", "lang": "en"}
