Actually, the pens, which are made mostly of brass, have a suggested retail value of about $20.\n\nVarious claims about the pens that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi used to sign the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump have been circulating on Facebook. Some of the posts say the pens:\n\u2022 Or cost $5,000 to $15,000 in total.\n\nNone of that is true.\n\nThe pens are made by Garland Writing Instruments in Coventry, Rhode Island. The suggested retail price per pen is about $20, but it varies depending on how many are purchased.\n\nAlso, Garland doesn\u2019t sell its promotional pens directly to consumers, the company\u2019s president and owner, Rick Becker, told FactCheck.org in an interview. Rather, it sells them through third-party distributors who may offer discounts, so we don\u2019t know exactly how much they cost.\n\nPelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, told us in an email that \u201cthe cost per pen is just under $15.\u201d\n\nThe pens, which were engraved with Pelosi\u2019s signature, are made of brass with a thin plating that includes some gold, Becker said, explaining that any pen costing $20 won\u2019t include much gold.\n\nIt\u2019s not only Pelosi who has used Garland pens. Becker said that his company has filled orders for the White House under both Trump and former President Barack Obama. However, Trump also has reportedly used gold-plated Cross pens to sign executive orders, after which he\u2019s followed tradition and distributed the pens as souvenirs.\n\nPelosi used 30 pens to sign the articles of impeachment before handing them out to other House Democrats. That would make the total cost about $450, if the pens cost $15 each, as Hammill said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
