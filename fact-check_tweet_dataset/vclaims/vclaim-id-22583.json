Let\u2019s try to analyze the claims made in it.\n\nClaim: PM Modi has launched a Scholarship program for 10th and 12th class pass out students who have secured more than 75% of the marks Fact: PM Modi hasn\u2019t launched any such scholarship programme for 10th and 12th class pass outs. Moreover, the website link mentioned in the post is that of the \u201cDepartment of Ex-Servicemen Welfare\u201d. Hence the claims made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen tried to get the information about the scholarship scheme described in the post using the website link \u2018www.desw.gov.in/scholarship\u2019, it directed to the Ministry of Defence\u2019s, \u201cDepartment of Ex-Servicemen Welfare\u201d site. When looked for any scholarship programme offered by it, it was found that there is a \u2018Prime Minister Scholarship scheme for the academic year 2016-2017\u2019 but the eligibility criteria to avail the scheme is not as described in the Facebook post. As per scheme guidelines, \u2018applications are invited only from eligible wards/widows of Ex-servicemen and Ex-Indian Coast Guard personnel pursuing professional Degree Courses, recognized by the respective government regulatory bodies such as MCI, AICTE and UGC etc. The scheme will be applicable only to those candidates who have joined the professional Courses in the Academic Year 20l6-2017\u2019.\n\nTo conclude, Narendra Modi hasn\u2019t launched any Scholarship scheme on the name of Kalam and Vajpayee for 10th and 12th class pass out students.", "lang": "en"}
