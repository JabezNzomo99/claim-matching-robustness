The story originated on a website known for sharing misinformation.\n\nThe lengthy post claims Bieber, a Canadian pop singer, told hundreds of people at church that unnamed \u201cHollywood elites\u201d tried to corrupt him and \u201ckilled his unborn child and destroyed the relationship he had with the child\u2019s mother, Selena Gomez.\u201d Bieber and Gomez dated on-and-off for several years, according to Elle magazine.\n\n\u201cThis completely flipped me out and I lost my way for a long time. I went off the rails,\u201d Bieber purportedly told the Bible study group. \u201cThey murdered my unborn child. Me and Selena\u2026 we were driven apart by these people and the trauma.\u201d (RELATED: No, Ellen DeGeneres Isn\u2019t Under House Arrest For Child Sex Trafficking)\n\nBieber told the Bible study group that he also went to a \u201ctop-secret party\u201d attended by record industry executives, where people wearing animal masks attempted to convince him to drink the blood of a dead baby, the post further claims.\n\nThe post\u2019s outlandish claims are baseless. The Daily Caller News Foundation found no news reporting to corroborate Bieber\u2019s alleged confession, a tell-tale sign the story was fabricated. The media often covers Bieber, and it\u2019s unlikely that outlets would not pick up such statements from the pop singer.\n\nThe viral post appears to lift word-for-word from an article published by YourNewsWire, a now-defunct website that has been fact-checked at least 80 times. YourNewsWire now goes by NewsPunch, and the article the claim originated from is not available on the new domain.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time social media users have shared a false claim that originated on YourNewsWire. Check Your Fact recently debunked a viral post claiming singer Katy Perry said cannibalism is \u201cmore popular than you might think.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
