Explaining this decision, the journal editors stated that: \u201cThere were undeclared competing interests on the part of the author which compromised the peer review process. Furthermore, post-publication peer review raised concerns about the validity of the methods and statistical analysis, therefore the Editors no longer have confidence in the soundness of the findings.\u201d\n\nSnopes fact-checked this claim in 2014, and found it to be false: \u201cDid collected data actually prove that the MMR vaccine produces a 340% increased risk of autism in African-American boys? The answer is no, it did not.\u201d\n\nA ScienceBlogs article dissected the methodological flaws of the reanalysis:\n\n\u201cHooker analyzed a dataset collected to be analyzed by a case-control method using a cohort design. Then he did multiple subset analyses, which, of course, are prone to false positives. As we also say, if you slice and dice the evidence more and more finely, eventually you will find apparent correlations that might or might not be real. In this case, I doubt Hooker\u2019s correlation is real.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, there\u2019s no biologically plausible reason why there would be an effect observed in African-Americans but no other race and, more specifically than that, in African-American males. In the discussion, Hooker does a bunch of handwaving about lower vitamin D levels and the like in African American boys, but there really isn\u2019t a biologically plausible mechanism to account for his observation, suggesting that it\u2019s probably spurious.\u201d\n\nA 2014 ABC News article also covered this subject, in which experts also criticized Hooker\u2019s study, calling it \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d:\n\nAs explained in our article (and many others): Vaccines do not cause autism.\n\nAlthough the study was retracted in 2014 because its methodological flaws invalidate its findings, some groups persist in making this claim, with a meme going viral on Facebook in Jan. 2020. Some claims go as far as to accuse the CDC of hiding the data, which is false\u2013in 2014, the CDC published a statement regarding the 2004 Pediatrics study, clarifying that \u201cthe data CDC collected for this study continue to be available for analysis by others.\u201d\n\u2022 1 \u2013 Hooker BS.
