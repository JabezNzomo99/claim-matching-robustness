But the image is a fake; Trump did not tweet about Ramaphosa as claimed.\n\nThe screenshot claims Trump tweeted on February 6, 2019 that he was \u201cextremely happy with the leadership of President Ramaphosa, he is a great deal! Business community is happy too! And don\u2019t make mistakes by voting useless leadership on this coming election!!\u201d\n\nAs well as on Whatsapp, the same image can be found on social media, for example here and here.\n\nIt has become very easy to create fake Trump tweets through websites which allow online users to insert their own text and save a screenshot, such as the one made by AFP Fact Check in a debunk about Trump tweets in Canada.\n\nHowever the misleading Ramaphosa screenshot appears to be further altered and lacks the finesse of modern fake Trump tweets. The alignment and pixelation of the text is wrong, and the border of the tweet itself is uneven.\n\nUsing Trump Twitter Archive, a tool that allows you to trace back tweets made by the US president, we found that no tweets about South Africa or Ramaphosa were published on February 6.\n\nTrump last tweeted about the country in August 2018, discussing what he called government \"land and farm seizures\u201d. This led to a backlash from South Africa\u2019s International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) minister, Lindiwe Sisulu.\n\nThe South African elections mentioned in the fake tweet are due to take place on May 8.", "lang": "en"}
