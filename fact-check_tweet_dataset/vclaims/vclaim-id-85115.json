In fact, a delegation was sent to my office to see me because I was so vocal about it. I\u2019m a very militaristic person, but you have to know when to use the military. I\u2019m the only person up here that fought against going into Iraq. I think it is very important. I think it is important because it is about judgment. I didn\u2019t want to go into Iraq. It is about judgment. Because what I said, \u2018You\u2019re going to destabilize the Middle East,\u2019 and that\u2019s what happened.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump, with Amazonian beauty Melania Knauss at his side, pronounces on the war and the stock market: \u201cIf they keep fighting it the way they did today, they\u2019re going to have a real problem.\u201d Looking as pensive as a \u201cNightline\u201d talking head, the Donald concludes, \u201cThe war\u2019s a mess,\u201d before sweeping off into the crowd.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump has pointed several times to a July 2004 Reuters article as proof he opposed the war from the outset. The Reuters article is a preview of the August 2004 Esquire cover story. Trump wrote in a Sept. 8, 2015, op-ed in USA Today that he \u201cwas against the war from the very beginning, all the way back in 2004.\u201d When he recounted this a week later during the GOP debate, 2004 had turned to 2003 and there even was a White House meeting.\n\n\u201cI have no recollection of any such outreach and believe it unlikely any White House staffer visited Mr. Trump. There is no evidence Mr. Trump spoke against the Iraq War while the Congress was debating the Authorization of the Use of Force resolution in September and October 2002, nor any evidence he spoke against it after Congress voted and before military action began March 20, 2003. When Mr. Trump was first quoted in opposition to the war in the August 2004 Esquire \u2014 nearly 23 months after the Congressional vote and roughly 17 months after the war began \u2014 President Bush was engaged in a tough re-election battle against Sen. John Kerry and Mr. Trump\u2019s late-forming opinions would have mattered little to the debate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t recall him saying much of anything until 2004 \u2014 way after the debate to authorize force took place and way after the war began. If he chimed in when it mattered, I don\u2019t recall it,\u201d Fleischer said. \u201cI also think if his staff can\u2019t name who he says the White House sent to him, then perhaps his memory is faulty.\u201d\n\nThere is scant media coverage of his supposed opposition ahead of the Iraq War, though he claims there are \u201c25 different stories.\u201d There is no evidence the White House sent a \u201cdelegation\u201d out of concern over his \u201cvocal\u201d opposition, though he publicly said at least twice that it happened. Trump has made no effort to clarify his statements or prove he was telling the truth, after repeating this claim to millions of debate watchers and in subsequent TV interviews.", "lang": "en"}
