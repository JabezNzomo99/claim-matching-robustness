No, that's not true: Laws vary by state, but authorities in several states have issued guidance making it clear that their law does not prohibit someone from lawfully carrying a concealed weapon while wearing a mask to help to stop the spread of COVID-19. Lead Stories could find no examples where it would be illegal.\n\nThe claim appeared in a post (archived here) on Facebook on June 24, 2020. It read:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nAlthough wearing a mask to hide one's identity is illegal in some states in certain obvious situations -- while committing a crime, for example -- that's not what we're talking about here. We're talking about wearing a mask for the purposes of public health, as this sheriff in Humboldt County, California, has stressed. Sheriff William Honsal said:\n\nAuthorities in other states have similarly addressed the confusion around masks and concealed carry permits.\n\nIn Macon County, Illinois, for example, the state's attorney's office wrote this on Facebook:\n\nIn Marion County, Oregon, the sheriff's office posted on Facebook, saying:\n\nFinally, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division said this:\n\nAnne Teigen, who covers state firearms policy for the National Conference of State Legislatures, offered a broader perspective. She told Lead Stories that 18 states and the District of Columbia have provisions prohibiting masks in certain situations. But that \"these provisions in state law do not have anything to do with concealed carry, they are prohibitions in general for wearing a mask.\"\n\nIn North Carolina, for example, it's against the law to wear a mask in public, according to the Nash County Sheriff's Office. But authorities there have no plans to arrest anyone wearing a mask and lawfully carrying a concealed weapon, so long as that person isn't committing a crime. Here's what the sheriff's office wrote on Twitter:\n\nBottom line, it is not illegal to wear a mask while lawfully carrying a concealed weapon.", "lang": "en"}
