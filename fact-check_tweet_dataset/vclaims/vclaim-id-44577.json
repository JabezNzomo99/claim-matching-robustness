But this is false; the footage, which features what appear to be armoured vehicles covered in tarp being moved atop transport carriers, was actually filmed in Namibia. A South African defence expert believes it shows Botswana Defence Force equipment getting delivered via Namibia.\n\nA Facebook post shared the video on May 17, 2020, along with a caption that uses obscenities to describe South Africa as being in trouble. It reads: \u201chundreds of armed cars and tanks offloaded in cape town and thousands of Chinese troops in the twilight hour\u2019s of the morning (sic).\u201d\n\nSimilar claims are shared on Facebook here and here using the same video as well as several photos showing military vehicles atop transport carriers.\n\nBut in a thread of tweets on the same day, defence expert and director of African Defence Review Darren Olivier explained why he believed the video is from Namibia and \u201cnothing to worry about\u201d.\n\n\u201cI'm fairly certain this is a normal delivery of vehicles for the Botswana Defence Force. Because Botswana is landlocked, it has to have vehicles delivered by sea to a neighbouring country & sent overland by road or rail and it often uses South African ports,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOlivier said the wrapped vehicles appeared to be MOWAG Piranhas, which the Botswana Defence Force (BDF) already operates.\n\n\u201cIn 2016 it ordered an additional 45 Piranhas, which have been arriving in small batches over the past few years in convoys just like this,\u201d wrote Olivier.\n\nOlivier said the trucks seem to be part of the \u201cMICA VL ground-based air defence system, which we know that the BDF recently acquired, and the Panhard VBL looks to have a Mistral launcher assembly fitted which again is something we know the BDF has recently acquired.\u201d\n\nA Defence Web article on August 3, 2017, corroborates this in a report about Botswana purchasing more than 300 million euros worth of military hardware from France in 2016, including the aforementioned MICA-VL and Mistral missiles.\n\nAs Olivier noted, there is no indication of when the video was recorded.\n\nBut on May 9, 2018, The Namibian Ministry of Defence shared a press release announcing BDF military equipment would be moving from Walvis Bay on the Trans-Kalahari highway to Mamuno Border Post on the border with Botswana from May 9-10, 2018.\n\nA few of the misleading posts, such as here, also share the image below of a truck with a yellow number plate. It starts with an \u201cN\u201d and ends with a \u201cW\u201d, which indicates a Windhoek, Namibia number plate.\n\nCaptain Jaco Theunissen, joint operations division spokesperson at the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), dismissed the claims made in the misleading Facebook posts to South Africa\u2019s News24.\n\n\"This is fake news. I saw some of these messages on social media myself. One of the videos, for example, was taken when military equipment was delivered in Walvis Bay nearly three years ago. In that instance, the equipment was destined for Botswana and the SANDF was not involved,\" said Theunissen.\n\nAnd according to the electronic edition of the Botswana Gazette published on May 20, 2020, the BDF had in that week received the second instalment of its war equipment from French company MBDA.\n\n\u201cYes, it is true we have received some of our military equipment this week,\u201d Acting BDF Commander, Gotsileene Morake, told the Botswana Gazette. \u201cIt is just half of the consignment we ordered four years ago. We are expecting the last batch sometime next year. It takes two years to design these vehicles.\u201d\n\nAFP contacted the BDF for comment but has not yet received a response.\n\nOlivier and a Twitter follower used the railway-level crossing sign in the video, labelled \u201cHigh Risk Accident Zone Ahead\u201d under the image of a train, to deduce that the location was at this Shell Service Station in Walvis Bay, Namibia.\n\nAs the Twitter user points out, a railway line can be seen northwest of the station in Google Maps satellite imagery. Other elements in the video, such as roads, buildings and trees, also match the satellite imagery.\n\nAFP Fact Check confirmed the location with a Walvis Bay resident who sent pictures of the scene that match the visuals in the video -- such as the palm tree, the red flag and the railway warning sign on a small island.", "lang": "en"}
