The same story appeared on several other conservative blog sites.\n\nObama trying to take over the White House? It's not like that, based on what's been reported.\n\nFacebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\n\"Obama is continuing to break former president protocol by trying to infiltrate current administration,\" the story said, citing a report from the Washington Examiner detailing Obama\u2019s private, one-on-one meetings with prospective Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nThe story said Obama was eager to play a role in advising leading Democrats and shaping the party\u2019s future. The story said he has insisted that 2020 hopefuls continue framing discussions around the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election because it \"sticks with voters in the long run.\"\n\nWe decided to take a look at the story and see how its claim checked out. We found that its contents can be traced back to a June 11, 2018, report from Politico. (The Washington Examiner story cited Politico as its source).\n\nBut the few discrepancies between the original Politico report and the post from Redstate Watcher cast a misleading light on the latter\u2019s narrative.\n\nFor one, the Politico report said of the Russia investigations: \"Many of the conversations have circled around Obama holding forth about how much Democrats should be heading into the midterms talking about the investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election versus focusing on kitchen table issues \u2026 Think about what\u2019s going to stick in the long term.\"\n\nThe Politico story also said nothing about Obama breaking any formal or informal protocol for past presidents or attempting to \"infiltrate\" President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. We searched Google and Nexis and could not find any credible reports saying that.\n\nRedstate Watcher responded to a Facebook message by noting that the story featured \"a clickbait title\" and criticizing readers and fact-checkers who \"pick and choose which words you feel like taking literally and which words you take figuratively.\"\n\nObama did arrange multiple private meetings with potential Democratic presidential candidates. But the former president was never \"busted\" for working in secret to \"infiltrate\" and \"overtake\" the Trump White House.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
