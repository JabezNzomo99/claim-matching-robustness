We\u2019ve been unable to verify the claim yet.\n\nWe spoke to the producers of BBC Question Time who said that Mr Dimbleby was referring to an article published in The Times saying that the Prime Minister has been told that the deal on exiting the EU would have to be agreed before any deal on a new trading relationship with the EU can be started. It said this could include paying the EU \u201ca bill of up to \u00a360 billion\u201d\n\nThe Times told us that this figure refers to an estimate of what the UK might have to pay towards the EU up to 2020/21. This is the date that the current EU budget lasts until. It also includes other outstanding payments to the EU and contributions towards the pensions of EU officials. It worked out that could cost \u00a360 billion or \u20ac70 billion.\n\nWe contacted the European Commission about the figure, but they told us they couldn\u2019t comment.\n\nExperts have told a committee of MPs that payments could include any outstanding contributions to the EU budget. They also said that, because of the way the EU\u2019s spending works, some of this money may even be paid after that date, as far ahead as 2023 or even 2030. There may also be payments which have spilled over from previous years.\n\nThey said there are a number of ways that the UK\u2019s pension contributions could be calculated so it's hard to come up with an exact figure. Altogether the experts said it could be anything between \u20ac20 and \u20ac60 billion.\n\nProfessor Iain Begg, writing for UK in a Changing Europe, said that it\u2019s still an open question whether or not the UK will have to pay the full amount to the EU after the date of Brexit.\n\nWe\u2019ve written before about the likelihood of the UK having to pay over \u00a320 billion over the next two years while we negotiate our exit from the EU.", "lang": "en"}
