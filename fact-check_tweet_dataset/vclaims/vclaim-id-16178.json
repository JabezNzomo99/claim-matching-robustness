Trump has defeated Hillary Clinton (although losing the popular vote) to become the next president elect, many Americans are wondering if President Obama will pardon Clinton for her use of a private email server in which highly sensitive, classified material was compromised while she served as Secretary of State.\n\nAlthough FBI Director James Comey said, right before the election, that he didn\u2019t find anything in Clinton\u2019s emails to warrant charges, a new FBI director might feel differently, especially one muscled by a vengeful Justice Department under President Trump.\n\nInsiders on Capitol Hill are saying President Obama will issue a \u201cblanket pardon\u201d for Clinton, pardoning her for any crimes committed in the past but have not yet been discovered.", "lang": "en"}
