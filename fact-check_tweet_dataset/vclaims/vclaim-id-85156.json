That was the case for this image; a quick Google Image search turned up the truth. In fact, our friends at Snopes.com, a website dedicated to debunking online rumors and memes, beat us to the punch and found the comparison was false.\n\nThe top map shows the Republican and Democratic majorities by county in the 2016 election, but it looks to be incomplete. You can see a similar map by our colleague Philip Bump of The Fix, which is a more detailed version that shows various gradations of red and blue by county:\n\nThe bottom map in the Facebook image is not of the 2013 crime rate. Instead, it is a map of 2012 election results by county, published by Mark Newman of the University of Michigan\u2019s Department of Physics and Center for the Study of Complex Systems:\n\nNewman has made similar maps for the 2004, 2008 and 2016 elections. Here is Newman\u2019s version of the 2016 election, and his map is a more complete version than the one that is included in the online image that our reader sent:\n\nThe fake version of Newman\u2019s 2012 map has been circulating online since as early as Nov. 30, 2013, as shown in this blog post that incorrectly says the State Department released the map to \u201cadvise tourists to stay away from any county which voted for Obama (blue) and particularly precincts which voted 80+% for Obama.\u201d\n\nNewman\u2019s maps are quite distinct, which makes it easier to unearth his research as the original source of the map that is incorrectly used in the Facebook image. In fact, Newman co-invented the \u201cdiffusion-based method\u201d used to make these maps. He explained the technical details here.\n\n\u201cYou are exactly correct and the map at the bottom is just a map of the 2012 election results, nothing more,\u201d Newman told The Fact Checker.\n\nIf it\u2019s too good to be true, it usually is \u2014 especially when it\u2019s on Facebook. When it comes to viral, sensational images on social media, it usually takes no more than a healthy sense of gut-checking and some time searching on Google to debunk them as false.
