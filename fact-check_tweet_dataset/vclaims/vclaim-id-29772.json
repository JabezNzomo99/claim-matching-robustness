A Jan. 6 Facebook post wrongly alleges presidential candidate Joe Biden \"murdered U.S. Navy Seals.\"\n\n\"He revealed the names and the unit that killed bin Laden,\" the post continues, \"on May 3, 2011, at a national event in Washington. His reckless action put at risk the lives of every member of Seal Team 6. The Taliban and other jihadists eager to avenge bin Laden now knew which unit to target. Stunned and shocked, Seal Team Six members immediately realized they were going to be hunted by al Qaeda sympathizers. Soon after Biden\u2019s reckless idiotic speech, an American CH47 Chinook was shot down by a rocket propelled grenade in the Tangi Valley, Maidan Wardak Provience, Afghanistan, all 38 aboard were killed including most if not all of Seal Team 6.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nAs we previously reported, Biden praised the Navy SEALs in an address two days after the death of Osama bin Laden, al-Qaida\u2019s leader. But he didn\u2019t say the specific SEAL unit or name any of its members. And his speech came after it was already publicly known that the SEALS were part of the operation.\n\nHere\u2019s the timeline: On May 2, 2011, Bin Laden was killed during a military raid carried out by an elite, highly classified unit of the U.S. Navy SEALs called SEAL Team 6. President Barack Obama announced the 9/11 organizer was dead during a televised address, saying \"a small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability.\" He didn\u2019t mention the Navy SEALs or SEAL Team 6.\n\nAfter Obama\u2019s address, media outlets, including the New York Times, reported that the SEALs were involved in the operation. The paper didn\u2019t name the individuals who were a part of that team, only reporting that Obama \"gave the final order for members of the Navy SEALs and C.I.A. operatives to strike.\"\n\nThe Washington Post, meanwhile, ran a story with this headline: \"Navy SEALs who killed Osama bin Laden are from the elite \u2018Team 6,\u2019 May 2, 2011\n\nOn May 3, after news organizations publicly disclosed the SEALs\u2019 role, Biden, then vice president, gave a speech at the Atlantic Council Awards Dinner, where U.S. Navy Admiral James Stavridis received a military leadership award.\n\n\"Admiral Jim Stavridis is the real deal,\" Biden said. \"He could tell you more about and understands the incredible, the phenomenal, the just unbelievable capacity of his NAVY SEALs and what they did last Sunday.\"\n\nHe mentioned the SEALs again later in his speech, adding that he was \"in absolute awe \u2014 awe \u2014 of the capacity and dedication of the entire team, both the intelligence community, the CIA, the SEALs.\"\n\nHe didn\u2019t mention SEAL Team 6 or any of its members by name, as the Facebook post claims. Still, his remarks and the Obama administration drew criticism for publicly crediting the SEALs with bin Laden\u2019s killing after a helicopter carrying 30 American military members \u2014 including 15 from SEAL Team 6 \u2014 was shot down by Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan.\n\nBut an investigation concluded there was no evidence the helicopter was targeted as part of a pre-calculated attack. In 2014, Garry Reid, then a deputy assistant secretary for special operations and low-intensity conflict in the Department of Defense, told Congress that officials didn\u2019t think the mission was compromised.\n\n\"There was no external coordination so there\u2019s no possibility of information going up the chain and somehow going out to the Taliban,\" Reid said.\n\nSnopes, which fact-checked a similar claim last year, reported that it asked Stavridis by email if he felt Biden\u2019s words put SEAL team members\u2019 lives at risk.\n\n\"The Navy Special Warfare community is generally (and appropriately) tight lipped about their operations,\" Snopes quotes Stavridis as saying by email. \"That said \u2014 I did not believe that night in May 2011 \u2014 or today \u2014 that Vice President\u2019s Biden\u2019s comments were in any way inappropriate or that they put at risk the lives of those who conducted that historic operation. I think he kept it at a level of generalization that made is completely acceptable in my view.\"", "lang": "en"}
