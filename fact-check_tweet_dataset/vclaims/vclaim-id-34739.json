It was actually written by author Henry Stuber.\n\nThis quote has been circulating online for years. The attribution to Franklin, however, is incorrect. There is no record of him ever making this statement, and it appears nowhere in his collected works.\n\nCarla Mulford, a historian and Franklin expert at Penn State University told The Daily Caller that the statement \u201chas a particularly contemporary ring and is nothing like anything Franklin would have said.\u201d\n\nIt is one of several misattributed sayings that has come to the attention of the Franklin Institute, a science education center founded in his honor; it includes the quote in a list of \u201c7 Things Benjamin Franklin Never Said\u201d on its website.
