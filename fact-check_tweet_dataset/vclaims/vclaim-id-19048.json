So, what is the origin of all this apparent digital unrest? The uproar in the media space surfaced after Mr Omoleye Sowore, the presidential candidate for the African Action Congress (AAC) was arrested by the State Security Service (SSS) on accounts of calling on and mobilizing the public for a revolution against the government.\n\nThis is perhaps what sparked the responses from many on social media. The consensus being the question \u2013 if President Muhammadu Buhari had severally, during his failed presidential bids, called for a revolution against past governments, why is Mr Omoleye Sowore facing arraignment on similar charges?\n\nThis is of course contrasted against the statement published by the President\u2019s then Spokesman, Yinka Odumakin in February 2011. In the statement, Buhari asked Nigerians to make exceptional sacrifices to assert their collective will in the country, referencing Egypt\u2019s 18-day peaceful revolution.\n\n\u201c\u2026Muhammadu Buhari, has urged Nigerians to draw lessons from the 18-day peaceful revolution which saw Hosni Mubarak quit as Egyptian President last Friday and effect a regime change in Nigeria using the ballot box in April.\u201d\n\nOn another occasion, three years later, the President would be found inciting the same revolutionary actions Sowore is being arraigned for.\n\n\u201cAPC is out to make sure that we stop lousy system by voting PDP out. Vote out the PDP next year. If you want a secure and efficient Nigeria, you just have to do that. No alternative. Make sure you get your permanent voters\u2019 cards.\u201d\n\nThese were some of the remarks made by Buhari in Nov. 2014 at a mega protest tagged ` Salvation Rally\u2019 with thousands of party supporters in Abuja. He accused the People\u2019s Democratic Party, PDP-led Federal Government of playing politics with Boko Haram. He also accused President Goodluck Jonathan and the PDP of gross incompetence and unprecedented display of impunity.\n\nYet another instance, the All Progressives Congress (APC) with President Buhari as their flag bearer, supported \u201crevolution inciting\u201d comments by party members. Here, Governor Rotimi Amaechi of Rivers State said that if the 2015 elections are rigged, the party will not recognize the outcome and will go ahead and form a parallel government. The then National Publicity Secretary, Lai Mohammed, said that what Mr. Amaechi said at the APC\u2019s \u2018Salvation\u2019 in 2014 was simply to reiterate the stand taken by the party before the last Osun State Governorship election.\n\n\u201cFor us, the gloves are off. We will no longer engage in any nicety as long as some people are bent on thwarting the will of the people through electoral fraud. All we are demanding is a free, fair and credible election. All we are saying is that no one should incite the people by stealing their mandate. How these demands can be construed to mean treason is as baffling as the do-or-die disposition of the ruling PDP to elections,\u201d the party said.\n\u2022 None August 5 marks the beginning of Days of Rage until the regime of intolerance, oppression and corruption is put to final shame!\u201d\n\u2022 None \u201cOn August 5th we are going to ask our terrible leaders to \u201ctake a bow and get out\u201d \u2026we can\u2019t allow this to continue, this country is not working for a majority\u201d \u2013 Comrade Nosa addressing #\n\u2022 None \u201cMonday August 5 is the D-Day. Join the # movt. Occupy the highways, waterways, occupy the market square, city centers, government offices, march, rally, protest, #Revolt against the wicked, insensitive, corrupt, barbaric and unjust system of oppression in Nigeria\u201d\n\u2022 None \u201cWhen they done with the Shiites, they will go after everyone! Only a # can help put an end to the @MBuhari regime\u2019s impunity\u201d\n\nOutright call to acts of violence and general misdemeanour are themes that are absent from Sowore\u2019s tweets. Such themes are requisite for said acts (actions or words) to be deemed revolutionary in nature. However, going by the second definition of revolution in the Cambridge Dictionary, his actions would be deemed revolutionary \u2013 consequent on the fact that the ethos of his message is basically a call to change.\n\nConversely, from the tweets, it was not outrightly called a \u201cpeaceful-protest\u201d. This, however, is not grounds for prosecution as the messages are subject to opinionated interpretation as to what it is or isn\u2019t.\n\nNonetheless, the police have already deemed the planned protest an act of terrorism and threatened a clampdown on participants. It was further remarked that Mr Sowore had been in touch with foreign actors to destabilize Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe was taken into custody because he called for a revolution in Nigeria\u201d, SSS spokesperson, Peter Afunanya, told reporters in Abuja Sunday afternoon. His exact whereabouts remain unknown as no official statement has been made by the SSS regarding this, and a court date for arraignment has not been set.\n\nHaving already established the subjectivity around the matter of whether Mr Sowore\u2019s incited a \u201crevolution\u201d, the next logical question would be if it is a crime.\n\nMike Ozekhome, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria in a Channels TV release gave his two cents on the matter.\n\n\u201cDancing on the street saying we don\u2019t want bad governance; how does that amount to treason? Unreasonable felony?\u201d\n\nIllogical was the word he used to describe the allegation made by the Nigerian police with regards to describing the planned protests as \u2018treasonable felony and acts of terrorism\u2019.\n\n\u201cThat allegation is most plural, most damning and most illogical from the government or security spokespersons\u2026\u201d he remarked. He further goes on to reference the Nigerian constitution for a more accurate definition of treason as the act of overthrowing the sovereign government of a state.\n\nHuman rights lawyer, Femi Falana also had much to say on the issue\u2026\u201dIf revolution has become a criminal offence in Nigeria why were the leaders of the APC not charged for claiming to have carried out Nigeria\u2019s democratic revolution which terminated the 16-year rule of the PDP in 2015?\u201d He remarked that the Force had capitalized on the use of the word \u201crevolution\u201d to criminalize the protests.\n\nCiting from the established definitions of revolution, we can see that both parties are technically guilty as they both urge people to change their paradigm. More so, according to the constitution, treason is an act of overthrowing the sovereign government of a state\u2026 whether or not the actions of both parties could have led to this is debatable.\n\nHowever, what is clear is that the only difference between the revolution Sowore called for and Buhari\u2019s revolution was that President Buhari during his protest asked for revolution through the ballot while Sowore called for his after the elections had been conducted and won. So the question of whether his actions would have eventually led to destabilizing (or overthrowing) the government (albeit a stretch) \u2013 giving the Police grounds for prosecution on the charges of treason \u2013 remains a matter to be contemplated.\n\nThis fact-check was done by a Dubawa Fact-checking Fellow in collaboration with The News Agency of Nigeria, a news reporting agency owned and run by the Federal Government of Nigeria with substantial reach and mobility across the 36 states of the country.", "lang": "en"}
