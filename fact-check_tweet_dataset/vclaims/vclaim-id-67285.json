Just do the math.\n\n\"9,241 New Jobs + $295,000,000 in Wages + $0 Tax Increase for Homeowners + $3,000,000 Annually for Cobb Schools = 1 Great Deal for Cobb Residents,\" the ad said.\n\nPut this way, bringing the Braves to Cobb does seem like a no-brainer. But we here at PolitiFact Georgia know enough to question any number we meet. We asked the Truth-O-Meter to check Revitalize Cobb\u2019s arithmetic.\n\nPolitiFact will check Revitalize Cobb\u2019s jobs and wages figures in an upcoming story.\n\nThe additional schools money would come from a $400 million retail and entertainment district that the Braves plan to build adjacent to the stadium, a representative for the group explained in an email.\n\nThe group says there will be no tax increase for homeowners because the stadium won\u2019t cause their tax bills to rise.\n\nBoth estimates are conservative, the spokesman said, especially since the money for schools does not include income from sales taxes.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s consider the claim that there would be no property tax increase.\n\nIt isn\u2019t as straightforward as it might seem. Before the Braves stadium plan, property taxes were set to decrease.\n\nCobb homeowners currently pay taxes to pay for parkland. Once this bill is paid off in 2017 and 2018, these taxes are gone.\n\nIf Cobb commissioners do nothing, homeowners\u2019 yearly tax bill would drop by about $20 for a $200,000 home.\n\nBut now that the Braves stadium is in the works, to pay the county\u2019s $300 million share of the bill, commissioners will have to vote to increase property taxes for the general fund by the amount they would have decreased.\n\nWhether this counts as a \"$0 tax increase for homeowners\" is debatable. In 2019, a Cobb homeowner\u2019s tax rate may be the same as it is now, but it will be higher than it would have been if the Braves had stayed in downtown.\n\nNow, let\u2019s consider the claim that the Braves will bring $3 million annually for Cobb schools.\n\nThese funds would come from property taxes on the Braves\u2019 planned retail and entertainment district, which is slated to open ahead of the 2017 season.\n\nEarly plans for the first phase of the project describe a pedestrian boulevard with stores, restaurants and maybe a hotel. A second phase is supposed to have residences and office space.\n\nRevitalized Cobb made its education dollars claim based on a back-of-the-envelope calculation. Its calculations show that under current tax rates, a $400 million property would produce some $6 million each year in additional property tax revenue.\n\nSchools would receive about $3.02 million, which is some $3 million higher than the $143,000 the land currently produces for schools.\n\nBut there is no guarantee in the Braves\u2019 agreement with Cobb that the team will invest $400 million for the entertainment district.\n\nThis could pose a problem. Early visions for other mixed-use projects near sports venues have proved to be too optimistic.\n\nThe proposal for Brooklyn\u2019s Barclays Center included 4.4 million square feet of residential property, 2.1 million square feet of commercial office space and 300,000 square feet in retail space, according to posted on a watchdog blog devoted to the stadium project.\n\nDevelopers originally said it would take 10 years to build. The state has since agreed to give them decades more to finish the project. Construction has begun on only one of the apartment towers.\n\nOn the other hand, there\u2019s San Diego. In the 1990s, the Padres\u2019 owner guaranteed $487 million in new real estate development for the struggling neighborhood surrounding the team\u2019s planned ballpark. It would include features specified by the city.\n\nA 2012 study found that the number of higher-income residents has increased and real estate values were more stable than those in other intown neighborhoods.\n\nBut the Padres\u2019 impact on downtown San Diego may be nothing like the Braves\u2019 impact on Cobb. As we mentioned previously, the Braves\u2019 investment is not guaranteed. And the Padres invested in downtown development as inner-city neighborhoods across the country are revitalizing. The Braves\u2019 planned development does not have this advantage.\n\nAnother strike against Revitalize Cobb\u2019s claim is that even if the Braves do invest $400 million into a development, the property\u2019s tax value may not equal that amount. The value for tax purposes could be higher or lower, depending on sales values, rents and other factors.\n\nAnd if the Braves build it, will they come? Game attendance might tank if the team falters.\n\nStadium goers might pass up the entertainment district\u2019s restaurants if they fill up on hot dogs and beer inside the stadium, said Lake Forest College professor Robert Baade, an expert on the economics of sports.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, even the Braves\u2019 most die-hard fans might think a condo by the stadium is not their idea of Home Sweet Home.\n\n\"People do not want to deal with drunken louts on game day and people walking on their lawn. Or doing worse on their lawn,\" Baade said.\n\nIn sum, Revitalize Cobb\u2019s statement is accurate but leaves out loads of important details that would give a reader a different impression if known.\n\nThe projected $3 million increase for schools is difficult to predict and depends on many factors all lining up.\n\nThe tax increase angle is more clear-cut. A homeowner\u2019s overall 2019 property tax rate may be the same as it is now. But a reasonable person may consider the Braves deal a tax increase over the amount he or she would have paid if the team had stayed in downtown Atlanta.\n\nBy PolitiFact\u2019s definition, this amounts to a Half True.", "lang": "en"}
