[1]\n\nMs King was touting Labor\u2019s $2.4 billion Pensioner Dental Plan which targets senior voters by offering up to three million pensioners \u201cfree dental\u201d valued at $1000 over two years under Medicare. Labor describes the plan as the next step towards universal access to dental care in Australia. [1] [2]\n\nMs King has held the seat of Ballarat since 2001. At the 2016 election she retained the inland Victorian seat by a margin of 7.4 per cent.\n\nThe Ballarat electorate extends east towards Melbourne as far as Bacchus Marsh and north-east of Ballarat including Creswick and Daylesford. [3]\n\nMs King\u2019s office told AAP FactCheck the source for her claim was the 2018 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) report.\n\nThe AIHW report found that for people aged 15 and over, one in 20 (4.4 per cent) had no natural teeth, For people aged 65, the figure was one in five (19 per cent) . The figures were drawn from self-reported information for the National Dental Telephone Interview Survey in 2013.\n\nThe report said the proportion of people aged 75 and over who had lost all their teeth had declined from 36 per cent in 1987-88 to 28 per cent in 2010. [4]\n\nGum disease, also known as periodontitis, is the inflammation of dental tissue and bone caused by bacteria.\n\nAccording to the same AIWH report, the last National Survey of Adult Oral Health 2004-2006 showed almost one in four Australians (23 per cent) had moderate or severe gum disease, which increased to more than one in two (53 per cent) among people aged 65 and over. [4]\n\nBased on figures contained in the report, AAP FactCheck concludes Ms King\u2019s claims are true.", "lang": "en"}
