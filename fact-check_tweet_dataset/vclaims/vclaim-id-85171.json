Now, in a tragic twist, an off-shoot of pizzagate has conspiracy theorists speculating that Monica Petersen, an activist for sex-worker rights, was killed because she was investigating links between the Clinton Foundation and sex trafficking in Haiti.\n\nPetersen, 32, passed away on Nov. 13, in Haiti. Claude d\u2019Estree, the executive director of the Human Trafficking Center at the University of Denver, had employed Petersen until June as a researcher and as his assistant, after which she moved to Haiti. He said she had been teaching at private pre-kindergarten-through-12 school, Union School Haiti, mainly to support herself, and had been exploring setting up a nongovernmental organization in Haiti. He said she committed suicide but the circumstances are not clear.\n\nD\u2019Estree said Petersen had gone to Haiti a number of times, but she was not there to research human trafficking and was not investigating the Clinton Foundation. He said she had been a \u201cbrilliant\u201d research fellow, working the past two years to produce a still unpublished article that critiqued a controversial book on the business of sex trafficking by Siddharth Kara.\n\nAn acquaintance named Bella Robinson, a sex worker and activist in Rhode Island, in January had posted a blog post that Petersen had shared on Facebook that had been critical of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s work in Haiti. Shortly after Petersen\u2019s death, the blog post appeared in a Reddit discussion thread. This then resulted in a flurry of \u201cnews stories\u201d falsely claiming that Petersen had written the blog post and was killed for investigating the Clintons.\n\n\u201cSome guy from Reditt found an old Facebook post on the Clintons and screen shot it and tagged it in to this, and even after I confirmed that her death had nothing to do with the Clintons, he made up stories that the family couldn\u2019t get answers,\u201d Robinson wrote The Fact Checker in a Twitter message.\n\nBut others say Robinson, in some fashion, helped fan the flames. Elle said she was shocked to find private comments she had made in an email to Robinson on Nov. 15 about the death apparently cut and pasted into Twitter feeds a day later.\n\nRobinson said her comments were taken out of context, and that she actually was trying to end the speculation. She said that more than 100 people contacted her looking for gossip on Petersen. \u201cDozens of people are putting this fake story on blogs and even making youtubes and they keep doing it even after I confirm her death had nothing to do with a conspiracy,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMonica Petersen\u2019s death is a PRIVATE family matter and it had nothing to do with the Clinton scandal.\u201d\n\nIn any case, what would have once been private gossip among friends was suddenly an international sensation, with increasing misinformation and misinterpretation. The blog post Petersen shared months ago with Robinson, for instance, morphed into a blog post she allegedly wrote herself about the Clintons. (Chantal Laurent, who writes \u201cThe Haitian Blogger,\u201d confirmed Petersen never contributed to the blog. \u201cI never heard of her until I read the Reddit article,\u201d she said.)\n\nPetersen\u2019s grieving family was hounded as #MonicaPetersen started trending and her name was added to a list of people allegedly murdered by the Clintons over the years. A faux investigator showed up at the University of Denver memorial service, asking questions and taking photographs. A comment made by d\u2019Estree at the memorial service \u2013 that Petersen \u201cdecided to take on one of the demagogues in the field of human trafficking\u201d \u2013 was interpreted as referring to Clinton when in fact he was talking about Siddarth Kara. Suddenly, the non-existent investigation was supposedly confirmed. Efforts to correct the record often were dismissed.", "lang": "en"}
