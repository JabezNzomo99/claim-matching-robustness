It turns out there are layers of complexity behind each of these numbers.\n\nThe White House said this fact came from the Census Bureau\u2019s Supplemental Poverty Measure, which is a long-term effort to update the current official poverty statistic. Critics have said the current measure is out of date because it does not reflect either the effect of government policies, such as food stamps, that alleviate poverty or the impact of expenses, such as medical costs or transportation costs to work, that reduce income.\n\nSo, this is a different way to measure poverty, and it results in about 6 percent more people deemed as being in poverty than the official measure. But what the White House has done is pluck one figure out of the survey\u2014out-of-pocket medical costs\u2014to say all those people (10.6 million) have been thrown into poverty. But a) it is not the official poverty measure and b) it is just one element of this alternative measure. Here\u2019s how it breaks down:\n\nThe White House originally gave as its source a 2002 study by the Institute of Medicine, which was updated in 2008 by the Urban Institute. The IOM study estimated that 18,000 Americans died in 2000 because they were uninsured; the updated study concluded that 22,000 people died because of a lack of health insurance in 2006. This important study built on previous work, and has been the basis for other, later work that is often cited.\n\nKronick showed that the underlying data were different in each, with one controlling for health status and smoking behavior, while the other did not. If similar control data had been used, he concluded, the IOM study \u201cwould almost certainly have found no difference in survival between the uninsured and similar insured respondents.\u201d As part of his study, Kronick took a sample of more than 600,000 people, interviewed from 1986 to 2002, with follow-ups, and then controlled for a variety of factors, including how long they went without insurance. He consistently found no difference in the outcome.\n\nOne interesting theoretical problem is that only a percentage of people chronically lack health insurance, whereas as most people lack insurance for relatively short spells. That can affect care at the time a person is uninsured (Exhibit 13), but it makes it harder to track the impact of insurance on death rates over time. (The ratios may be changing as a result of the economic crisis. A new study just published by the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that about 20 million people, or nearly 8 percent of the population under age 65, were uninsured for the four-year period from 2008 through 2011.)\n\nKronick could not definitely determine why there appeared to be little difference in health outcomes, but he wrote that \u201cpart of the answer may be that the safety net catches some uninsured people before illness and restricted access to medical care lead to premature death.\u201d He said that \u201cthe results of this work strongly suggest that arguments in favor of universal coverage should not focus on the beneficial effects of that policy on the life expectancy of the currently uninsured.\u201d (In other words, the president\u2019s use of the data to advocate for the Affordable Care Act is potentially misplaced.)\n\nKronick is a respected researcher and not a partisan. In fact, since 2010 he has been a senior official at the Department of Health and Human Services, where he now heads the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, a type of in-house think tank. In other words, one of the the administration\u2019s senior health-care officials has criticized a key study used by the president to make his claim.", "lang": "en"}
