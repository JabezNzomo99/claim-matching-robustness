We found that Clinton stretched the facts on a few points.\n\u2022 Clinton said an independent economic analysis found that Trump\u2019s proposals would lead to a loss of 3.1 million jobs while hers would \u201ccreate more than 10 million new jobs.\u201d The report forecast the economy would create most of those jobs under current law, and another 3.2 million if all of Clinton\u2019s plans were enacted, which the report called unlikely. Most likely, it said, the economy under Clinton would be \u201csimilar to that experienced under current law.\u201d\n\u2022 Clinton misrepresented Trump\u2019s plan for a child care tax deduction, saying it benefits \u201crich people like him\u201d while \u201chard-working families\u201d would get \u201clittle to nothing.\u201d But Trump aides say wealthy people wouldn\u2019t be eligible for the deduction, and low-income taxpayers who pay no federal income tax would be able to take the deduction against payroll taxes.\n\u2022 Clinton said that \u201cmillions\u201d of \u201cundocumented\u201d workers in the U.S. are paying $12 billion a year into the Social Security program. Only half of that is paid by those workers. The other half comes from their employers.\n\u2022 Clinton said the U.S. has the \u201cmost \u2026 productive workforce in the world, bar none.\u201d U.S. workers are productive, but the U.S. ranks third behind Luxembourg and Norway by the standard measure for worker productivity.\n\nClinton cited analyses by the macroeconomic firm Moody\u2019s Analytics of the entirety of the campaign proposals by Trump and Clinton, which concluded Clinton\u2019s plans would be better for jobs. But she puts some spin on those reports.\n\nMoody\u2019s Analytics concluded that if Clinton were able to fully implement the plans she has outlined in her campaign, the economy would add 10.4 million jobs during Clinton\u2019s presidency. But that\u2019s just 3.2 million more than it projects would be added under current law.\n\nMoreover, Moody\u2019s Analytics doesn\u2019t expect Clinton would likely be able to pass all of her proposals through a divided Congress. \u201cGiven the current political discord\u201d Moody\u2019s expects Congress would put up \u201csubstantial roadblocks\u201d to Clinton\u2019s policy proposals, and under its \u201cmost-likely scenario,\u201d a Clinton presidency would result in employment going just \u201ca bit higher\u201d than it otherwise would \u2014 putting the U.S. on a path to create 1.5 million more jobs over 10 years than is expected under current law.\n\nClinton accurately described the dire economic projection Moody\u2019s forecast if Trump were able to implement all of his proposed policies at face value. If his policies were fully implemented, Moody\u2019s predicts the economy would suffer an extended recession beginning in early 2018. The policies would also result in 3.4 million job losses over the course of Trump\u2019s presidency. (Given that Moody\u2019s forecast the economy would add 6 million jobs under current law, that\u2019s a swing of more than 9 million jobs).\n\nThe jobs projection under the \u201cmost-likely scenario\u201d under Trump \u2014 again assuming Congress would balk at many of his proposals \u2014 is not as dire. According to this scenario, \u201cEmployment barely budges in the first two years, and over his four years as president just over 2.8 million jobs are created. This is about half as many jobs as would be created if there were no changes to current economic policy.\u201d\n\nClinton derided Trump\u2019s announcement on Aug. 8 that he would allow people to deduct the cost of child care from their taxes. The way it is designed, Clinton argued, it would be a boon to the wealthy and of little to no value to \u201chard-working families.\u201d\n\nTrump offered few details about his plan when he announced it during a speech on economics in Detroit on Aug. 8, saying only, \u201cMy plan will also help reduce the cost of child care by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of child care spending from their taxes.\u201d\n\nBased on that brief description, many economists did criticize the plan for providing little to no benefit for low-income workers. That\u2019s because while married joint filers in the top tax bracket pay 39.6 percent on income over $466,950 in 2016, nearly half of the country\u2019s workers pay no federal tax at all. Currently, 44 percent pay no federal income tax, according to the Tax Policy Center.\n\nUnder Trump\u2019s plan, the top rate would be cut to 33 percent. So without any further detail than Trump provided, those in the top tax bracket could write off up to 33 percent of their child care cost \u2014 provided they spent the average cost for child care in the state. Those in lower tax brackets would realize a lower percentage deduction. And low-income people who already pay no federal income tax would see no benefit from the deduction at all.\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s campaign has provided a few more details about the plan (and promised more to come). For one, the campaign website says the plan would be structured so that \u201clow-income taxpayers [would be] able to take deduction against payroll tax.\u201d\n\nIn a statement provided to the New York Times, the Trump campaign stated the plan would provide \u201ccredit to stay-at-home caregivers\u201d and that \u201cto provide benefits to lower-income taxpayers who may not benefit from the deduction, the plan also allows parents to exclude childcare expenses from half of their payroll taxes \u2014 increasing their paycheck income each week.\u201d\n\nCurrently employees pay 7.65 percent of their pay toward Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes. Companies match that with an equal amount. If low-income workers are able to deduct the cost of child care from their share of payroll taxes, that would benefit low-income workers who pay no federal income tax (but do pay payroll taxes).\n\nAs for the wealthy, Trump aides told the Associated Press there would be an income limit for eligibility. No details were provided about the cutoff, but presumably it would exclude from the tax deduction \u201crich people like [Trump],\u201d as Clinton put it. Also, Clinton said the plan would allow wealthy families to write off \u201c30 or 40 cents on the dollar for their nannies.\u201d Trump said the deduction would be capped at the average cost of child care in a state for the age of the child. If the cost of a nanny were to exceed the average cost of child care in that state, then the household would not be able to write off the full cost of the nanny.\n\nStill, too many details are missing to provide an accurate analysis of how the plan would affect taxpayers at various income levels, said Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center.\n\nFor example, Williams said, will people be able to deduct the average cost of child care in the state even if they pay less than that for child care? Would families with a stay-at-home parent also be able to write off the average cost of child care in that state?\n\nSaid Williams: \u201cThe real problem is that we don\u2019t know the details of his plan.\u201d\n\nClinton said that \u201cmillions\u201d of \u201cundocumented\u201d workers in the U.S. are paying $12 billion a year into the Social Security program. That\u2019s not exactly accurate. Half of that money is paid by the employers of people working in the U.S. illegally.\n\nIn an actuarial note from April 2013, the Social Security Administration estimated that, for 2010, \u201cthe excess of tax revenue paid to the [Social Security] Trust Funds over benefits paid from these funds based on earnings of unauthorized workers is about $12 billion.\u201d\n\nSSA estimated that out of the 10.8 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. in 2009, about 3.1 million of them worked and paid payroll taxes on an average of $34,000 in earnings in 2010. Workers and employers each pay a Social Security tax rate of 6.2 percent. Therefore, \u201cwe estimate $13 billion in payroll taxes from unauthorized immigrant workers and their employers in 2010,\u201d the administration wrote.\n\nSSA pegged the overall contribution at $12 billion after it subtracted $1 billion in benefits paid to the \u201crelatively small portion\u201d of unauthorized workers eligible to receive them.\n\nClinton said the U.S. has the \u201cmost \u2026 productive workforce in the world, bar none.\u201d U.S. workers are productive, but the U.S. ranks third behind Luxembourg and Norway by the standard measure for worker productivity.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics says, \u201cGDP [gross domestic product] per hour worked is a general measure of labor productivity for the entire economy.\u201d\n\nBy that measure, the U.S. ranked third behind Luxembourg and Norway, as of 2014, among more than three dozen countries, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The measure was $62.40 per hour worked in the U.S., while it was $79.30 in Luxembourg and $78.90 in Norway.\n\nBLS came to a similar conclusion in a 2012 report called \u201cInternational Comparisons of GDP per Capita and per Hour, 1960-2011.\u201d That report said the U.S. ranked third among 20 countries at $60.59 per hour worked in 2011. It trailed only Norway ($81.47) and Ireland ($66.74). BLS has since discontinued that statistical series.\n\nThe World Bank uses a different measure: GDP per employed person. By that measure, the World Bank ranked the U.S. 11th in 2014 among dozens of countries and territories. Using international dollars, which the World Bank says has \u201cthe same purchasing power over GDP\u201d as a U.S. dollar in the United States, the World Bank ranked the Chinese peninsula of Macao, or Macau, as first at int\u2019l $231,317, followed by Luxembourg at int\u2019l $201,748.\n\nThe U.S. (int\u2019l $109,314) also trailed several oil-rich countries, such as Qatar (int\u2019l $173,967), Kuwait (int\u2019l $158,302), and Saudi Arabia (int\u2019l $143,968), according to the World Bank, as well as Norway (int\u2019l $124,555) and others.\n\nThe Clinton campaign did not respond when we asked for the data to back up Clinton\u2019s claim.", "lang": "en"}
