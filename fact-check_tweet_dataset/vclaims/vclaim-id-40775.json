The EU would almost certainly reject this without significant re-negotiation.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-40775", "url": "https://fullfact.org/europe/labour-customs-union-single-market/", "vclaim": "What is Labour\u2019s policy on the customs union and single market?\n\nWhat is Labour\u2019s policy on the customs union?\n\nThe crucial word here is \u201ca\u201d. The EU customs union is a free trade area in which countries can\u2019t put tariffs on goods and services imported from each other, and set the same tariff for countries outside the union. All EU member states must be a part of the customs union.\n\nLabour wants to leave the customs union, but negotiate a new one on very similar terms. Back in February, Jeremy Corbyn said this would \u201censure that there are no tariffs with Europe\u201d and \u201cwould depend on Britain being able to negotiate agreement of new trade deals.\u201d\n\nMs Nandy specified that Labour\u2019s desired customs union would be UK-wide. This is probably because there has been some talk of only Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union, while the rest of the UK leaves it. The government has ruled out only Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union.\n\nWhat is Labour\u2019s policy on the single market?\n\nThe EU single market is more wide-ranging: member countries sign up to the free movement of goods, services, people and money across their borders. The single market is made up of all EU member states plus a few others.\n\nLabour has ruled out remaining in the single market, but still wants access to it. In July, Labour tabled an amendment (which didn\u2019t pass) to the EU Trade Bill, stating that the government should aim \u201cto ensure the United Kingdom has full access to the internal market of the European Union, underpinned by shared institutions and regulations, with no new impediments to trade and common rights, standards and protections as a minimum\u201d.\n\nWhat exactly this would mean in practice is not completely clear. Some commentators have suggested that Labour\u2019s position is to be as close as possible to the single market (following things like EU court rulings and regulations on workers rights) without allowing the free movement of people from the EU. In June Labour\u2019s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said freedom of movement would \u201chave to be part of the negotiations\u201d, and also that \u201cin our manifesto we made it clear that freedom of movement will end when we leave the EU. The gritty details of Labour\u2019s policy haven\u2019t been fully spelled out.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to judge how feasible this stance would be as a negotiating position is, for the simple reason that Labour are not the ones negotiating Brexit.\n\nBut much as the EU have rebuffed aspects of the government\u2019s \u201cChequers proposal\u201d for \u201cundermining the Single Market\u201d, it\u2019s plausible that Labour\u2019s policies on both the customs union and single market would also fall foul of the EU\u2019s red lines.\n\nOn the customs union proposals, there\u2019s precedent which suggests it is feasible to negotiate a customs union similar to the one we\u2019re currently in, but it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019d also be able to have the freedom to strike wider trade deals.\n\nThe EU does have a separate customs union with a few other countries, for example Turkey. The union with Turkey isn\u2019t as extensive as the EU customs union, or the union Mr Corbyn suggested he wanted in February (services and some non-agricultural goods are not covered). The terms of the EU-Turkey customs union mean that Turkey has limited freedom to strike trade deals with non-EU countries, and must also follow EU rules on things like industrial standards.\n\nThe EU said it will not accept a \u201cpick and mix approach\u201d which gives Britain the same rights in terms of customs union access as other EU states, without the same obligations not to strike wider trade deals on its own.\n\nOn single-market access, it seems implausible that we could remain as close to the single market as Labour wishes to, without accepting freedom of movement. In June 2016 the EU said \u201caccess to the single market requires acceptance of all four freedoms, including the freedom of movement\u201d. President Tusk summed it up with another culinary metaphor: \u201cThere will be no single market \u00e0 la carte\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
