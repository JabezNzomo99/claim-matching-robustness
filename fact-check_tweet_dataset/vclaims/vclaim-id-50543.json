The claim is false; experts told AFP that there\u2019s no proof this is effective in preventing the disease and that practising good hygiene is the best way to stay healthy. The posts also include several other false claims.\n\nThe claims have been shared more than 40,000 times on Facebook in countries including Australia, India and South Africa.\n\n\u201cCorona virus (sic) arrives in any country, sooner or later...so please use as much as possible of natural vitamin C to strengthen your immune system,\u201d the post reads.\n\n\u201cSlices of lemon in a cup of lukewarm water can save your life\u201d.\n\nMany Facebook users commented on the posts, expressing gratitude for the \u201clife-saving advice\u201d.\n\nMore than 4,600 people have died from the novel coronavirus disease, or COVID-19, with most cases in China.\n\nSimilar claims have been circulating in French, Spanish and Portuguese.\n\nContacted by AFP, Henry Chenal, director of the Integrated Bioclinical Research Centre (CIRBA) in Abidjan, Ivory Coast said that consuming a high amount of vitamin C \u201chas never proved effective against coronavirus\u201d.\n\n\u201cKiwis actually provide more vitamin C than lemons, so if this theory was correct, lemons wouldn\u2019t be the fruit to consume,\u201d the said.\n\nThe World Health Organization\u2019s recommendations include washing hands regularly and thoroughly, coughing and sneezing into a disposable tissue, and staying at home if you feel unwell.\n\nSome posts incorrectly claim that drinking water and lemon can fight not just COVID-19, but also cancer.\n\n\u201cHot lemon can kill cancer cells!\u201d reads a post on the Facebook page of a \u201chealth coach\u201d in Ghana with more than 60,000 followers.\n\nThe post recommends drinking hot water with a lemon \u201ccut into three parts\u201d in order to \u201crelease the anticancer medicine\u201d.\n\nHealth organisations say there is little evidence to support alternative or herbal cancer treatments, and warn they can cause harmful side effects.\n\nContacted by AFP, Nicolas Boisel, a hematologist at Saint-Louis hospital in Paris, said there was \u201cno proof\u201d that drinking hot water and lemon could cure cancer.\n\n\u201cDerivatives of lemon, like many other plants, have been shown to exhibit anti-cancer activity. That probably explains the confusion,\u201d he said.\n\nThe posts attribute the false claims to \u201cLaila Ahmadi from China, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Zanjan University\u201d.\n\nWhile there is no such university in China, a Google search revealed a \u201cLeila Ahmadi\u201d working at the department of midwifery at Zanjan University of Medical Sciences in Iran.\n\nAccording to the university's website, Ahmadi is a lecturer and holds a master\u2019s degree in midwifery. AFP contacted her but has not yet received a reply.\n\nPosts also mention a \u201cProfessor Chen Horin, CEO of the Beijing Military Hospital\u201d, who says that that drinking lemon and warm water \u201ccan save your life\u201d. AFP found no trace of the professor.\n\nThe posts also claim that the coronavirus disease \u201cappears to be caused by the fusion of the gene into a snake and a bat\u201d.\n\nThe novel coronavirus is thought to have come from bats, but researchers think it might have spread to humans via another animal.\n\nChinese health officials have said the virus likely emerged from a market in the central city of Wuhan that sold wild animals as food.", "lang": "en"}
