This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Trump, inauguration speech, Jan. 20\n\n\n\nPresident Trump made it clear in his first week in office that he plans to crack down on crime and the \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d plaguing \u201cinner cities.\u201d In fact, this was a recurring topic throughout his campaign, and a major theme of his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention.\n\nThere was a similar trend in 2015: Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Baltimore were three outlier cities that accounted for more than half of the increase in homicide rates in the 30 largest cities. Yet in 2016, homicide rates declined in Washington and Baltimore by 18.6 percent and 6 percent, respectively.\n\nA warning about percent changes in crime: They can exaggerate the magnitude of crimes in a city. For example, the homicide rate in Austin increased by 68 percent in 2016, even though the actual number of homicides increased to 40 from 23. That\u2019s a small fraction of the number of homicides in Chicago (from 478 in 2015 to 732 in 2016), yet Austin saw a bigger percentage increase than Chicago.\n\nCrime trends can randomly fluctuate year to year. Many factors affect such rates, including the weather. This is why criminologists do not make generalizations about crime trends based on short-term comparisons of rates, such as annual or monthly changes. They consider the data over much longer periods of time \u2014 at least 10 to 15 years \u2014 to make conclusions about trends.\n\nIn his Jan. 24 tweet, Trump says \u201ckillings\u201d are up 24 percent from 2016. The percentage is accurate, per Chicago police. But with only one month of data in 2017, it\u2019s too early to use that statistic to call it \u201ccarnage.\u201d Trump also said he would \u201csend in the feds,\u201d although federal agencies already work with Chicago police.\n\nAre crimes worse in \u201cinner cities\u201d led by Democrats? Crime, in general, tends to be higher in larger, urban cities with concentrated populations and greater socioeconomic divides. The cities with the greatest income inequality also are urban cities contained within a small geographic boundary, with bigger, yet more concentrated populations. And urban cities tend to be more Democratic; 25 of the 30 largest cities have Democratic mayors.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s recent references to crime statistics were off the mark. In Philadelphia, he claimed the city\u2019s homicide rate is \u201cterribly increasing.\u201d That\u2019s incorrect. Homicides have declined significantly in Philadelphia over the past decade, from 397 in 2007 to 277 in 2016. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, in 2016, \u201cthere were fewer violent crimes than in any other year since 1979, the fewest number of property crimes since 1971, and the fewest number of robberies since 1969.\u201d\n\nTrump also claimed that two people were fatally shot during President Barack Obama\u2019s farewell speech on Jan. 10. No one was shot and killed in Chicago that day, according to the Chicago Police Department. Four shootings occurred that day, with a total of six people shot, but no one died.\n\nCrime trends are susceptible to cherry-picking, because they fluctuate so much for many reasons. The consensus among criminologists is that two years\u2019 worth of data (i.e., upticks in crime in 2015 and 2016) are not enough evidence to prove a crime wave. So Trump\u2019s claims using data from \u201cinner cities,\u201d or the 30 largest U.S. cities, to make sweeping statements about \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d are misleading.\n\nSome cities have experienced spikes in violent crime in the past two years. Outlier cities drove up the overall violent crime rate in the 30 largest cities, for reasons that aren\u2019t clear. A previous two-year increase in the rates, in 2006 and 2007, showed it was a temporary blip in the overall decades-long downward trend in violent crime. That is important context that is not represented in Trump\u2019s rhetoric on crime.", "lang": "en"}
