Two of these articles have recently been shared hundreds of times on Facebook. Sexual acts with animals excluding penetration are not considered bestiality under Canadian law. Bestiality, defined as interspecies sexual penetration, has been illegal since 1955.\n\nArticles in French and English both state in their headlines that Canada has legalized sex with animals. The articles refer to a Supreme Court court case from 2016. The case was the result of an appeal by a man who was found guilty in 2013 of 13 counts of sexual offences against his two stepdaughters, including one count of bestiality.\n\nThe man, a resident of Prince George, British Columbia, had used peanut butter to make his dog lick his stepdaughter\u2019s genital areas. The count of bestiality was overturned in a 2016 verdict by the Supreme Court of Canada because no penetration was involved.\n\nThe ruling said, \u201cPenetration has always been understood to be an essential element of bestiality.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court judges approved the decision by a vote of six to one.\n\nIn the dissent, Justice Rosalie Abella argued that the definition of bestiality should no longer require penetration and should encompass any sexual activity with an animal.\n\nThe majority opinion argued, \u201cThis submission asks us, in effect, to create a new crime. But that is not our role.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s ruling did not create a new crime. It based its ruling on the definition of bestiality established by the 1955 Canadian Criminal Code. Only a bill passing both houses of parliament and receiving royal assent could amend the Criminal Code to expand the definition of bestiality.\n\nWHAT CONCLUSIONS CAN BE DRAWN?\n\u2022 The Canadian Supreme Court acquitted a man of bestiality because sexual acts involving his dog and stepdaughter did not include penetration.\n\u2022 The Supreme Court does not have the power to create laws.\n\u2022 The Supreme Court did not legalize bestiality.", "lang": "en"}
