Michele Bachmann said, \u201cIf we made Mexican food illegal, illegal aliens wouldn\u2019t be able to eat in the United States and all illegal border crossings would stop.\u201d The image cites an Aug. 4, 2014 appearance on Fox News.\n\nThe Daily Caller found no evidence of Bachmann saying this in August 2014 or at any other time.\n\nDuring her time in office, Bachmann, the former presidential candidate and Tea Party favorite, was often the subject of ridicule on the left. This image attempts to discredit her by claiming that she once proposed a ban on Mexican food to prevent illegal immigrants from crossing the southern border.\n\nThe Caller did not find evidence of Bachmann making this statement on the date included in the image or on any other day. A representative from Fox News told us that Bachmann did not appear on the network that day.\n\nIn a 2017 interview with Breitbart, she signaled her support for a stay on immigration. \u201cWe need to hit the pause button like Calvin Coolidge did for 50 years. Hit the pause button and give people time to assimilate; learn the English language; learn our laws and just settle down and assimilate,\u201d Bachmann said.\n\nShe also condemned President Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration. \u201cThe social cost will be profound on the U.S. taxpayer \u2013 millions of unskilled, illiterate, foreign nationals coming into the United States who can\u2019t speak the English language,\u201d Bachmann said in 2014.", "lang": "en"}
