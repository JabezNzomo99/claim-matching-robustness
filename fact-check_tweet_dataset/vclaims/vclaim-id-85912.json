When a refugee comes here from a foreign country, they get a medical assessment and we know their health. But when they are here illegally, they don\u2019t get medical assessments. And one thing that we don\u2019t want to see is the uptick in hepatitis C, HIV and tuberculosis, but it is here. We are dealing with it. And it is very costly.\u201d\n\nOne of our colleagues noticed that virtually every Washington Post article concerning the measles outbreak is followed by comments that link the outbreak to illegal immigration. As it turned out, a number of prominent politicians have suggested that there might be a link \u2014 or that a link cannot be ruled out. (LePage did not mention measles, but suggested there could be in \u201cuptick\u201d in other diseases.)\n\nThe 2015 outbreak, mostly centered at Disney amusement parks in California, is still under investigation, Anne Schuchat, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on Jan. 29 that the \u201cgenotype of the virus that\u2019s associated with the Disneyland outbreak is causing outbreaks in 14 different countries around the world.\u201d She specifically mentioned Indonesia, India and Dubai as possible sources that were under investigation, but she emphasized that \u201cwe assume that someone got infected overseas, visited the parks and spread the disease to others.\u201d\n\nThe 2014 outbreak was traced to the Philippines, specifically from members of the Amish community in Ohio who had traveled there as missionaries; the community had halted routine vaccinations many years ago after a baby was suspected of getting ill from a shot. In 2014, the Philippines had a measles outbreak, with some 50,000 cases. After the church group came back from the trip, the disease \u201cspread like wildfire\u201d through the community.\n\nAs you can see, in most years, the other countries had better vaccination rates than the United States, though there was a sudden decline in 2013 in every country but El Salvador. Still, these are fairly high vaccination rates, making it much less likely that illegal immigrants from these countries are a source of the outbreak.\n\nBrooks, in an interview, emphasized that he \u201cnever made a statement\u201d that there was a link, just that it was possible. \u201cYou can have a lively debate about the most probable source of the outbreak,\u201d he said, but he said he has made no judgment about whether illegal immigrants are a source. \u201cI certainly think it is a concern,\u201d he added.\n\nBrooks cited a 2012 CDC report on 212 measles cases in 2011, which showed that 90 percent were associated with importations from other countries. Only 72 cases (36 percent) could be specifically linked to travel to or from overseas; 52 were linked to U.S. residents who had traveled abroad, and 20 were linked to foreign visitors. (France had a major outbreak that year, and 13 cases were traced just to it.) The report does not state whether any of the importations were linked to illegal immigrants; the only cases involving the Americas were from Canada (one) and the Dominican Republic (one).\n\nWe should note that CDC\u2019s Schuchat said that in 2014, \u201c79 percent of the unvaccinated cases of measles in the U.S. were unvaccinated due to personal belief exceptions.\u201d So even if one could trace the source to an illegal immigrant, the main source of the problem is a failure to get vaccinated in the first place.\n\nTerry Giles, campaign chairman for the nascent Ben Carson presidential campaign, emphasized that Carson used the word \u201cperhaps\u2019 in his comments. \u201cNon-compliance is anyone who has not been vaccinated,\u201d he said in an e-mail. \u201cWhile the unaccompanied children entering the U.S. from Central and Latin America (we have all heard about) are being screened and you have some good information regarding Latin America, we cannot possibly know how many Mexican and other children are crossing the border that are not vaccinated.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes all of that create a risk \u2014 yes,\u201d Giles said. \u201cBut does that mean the measles outbreak is an \u2018immigration\u2019 issue \u2014 no. It may be a another reason we should be sealing our borders \u2014 but the non-vaccination of American children because of misunderstood or misleading information would still create a potential public health issue even if we reduced the flow of illegal immigrants to zero.\u201d\n\nUnlike Limbaugh, Brooks and Carson did not draw a direct link between illegal immigration and the measles outbreak; they merely suggested it is a possibility. But it\u2019s a tricky balance, given that thus far the CDC has not traced this most recent outbreak \u2014 or previous ones \u2014 to illegal immigration. One cannot have 100 percent certainty in life, and so that always leaves open the possibility of a link.", "lang": "en"}
