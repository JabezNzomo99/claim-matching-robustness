She has also raised concerns about the effectiveness of a ban.\n\nThe independent review called for a \u201cradical rethink of the whole system\u201d, but has been criticised for not calling for an outright ban on cladding. It recommended an \u2018outcomes-based\u2019 system where buildings have to achieve a set level of safety rather than be built according to a set list. It said its aim was to \u201cmove away from telling those responsible [...] \u2018what to do\u2019 and place them in a position of making intelligent decisions\u201d. The review recommends a more robust regulatory framework and, among other recommendations, calls for a more effective product testing regime.\n\nWhen asked by the Housing Select Committee why she did not advocate an explicit ban on combustible materials, she said: \u201cI made it very clear in the early meetings that I had with many people that my role was to look at that system and that I would not be going into the detail of individual regulations or the specifics of the guidance, but creating a framework that would enable others then to do that\u201d.\n\nShe said she welcomed the government\u2019s announcement made in light of the review of a consultation on a ban, which she said was \u201ccomplementary\u201d to her review.\n\nHowever, she has raised concerns about a ban. She told MPs \u201cWe already have clear statements about what can and cannot be done that we know people are navigating their way around, so simply banning something from happening is no guarantee of compliance [...] if people attach too much reliance upon banning activities and particular materials as being a solution to this problem it will create a false sense of security unless we put a robust system around that.\u201d\n\nThe terms of reference for the review stated its purpose was to \u201cmake recommendations that will ensure we have a sufficiently robust regulatory system for the future and to provide further assurance to residents that the complete system is working to ensure the buildings they live in are safe and remain so.\u201d The review was announced following the results of the first large scale tests of different cladding systems\u2014this found the first system tested had failed the tests set out in building regulations. The government said the review would ensure \u201cwe can swiftly make any necessary improvements\u201d.\n\nThe government has said that the cladding believed to have been used on Grenfell Tower was unlawful under existing building regulations.\n\nThe review is separate to the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower tragedy.", "lang": "en"}
