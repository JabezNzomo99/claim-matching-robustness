The Supreme Court ruled in 1898 that this right to citizenship covered Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco to Chinese nationals legally residing in the United States.\n\nThe op-ed incorrectly dismisses relevant parts of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the 1898 Wong Kim Ark case, legal experts told us. Stephen H. Legomsky, a professor at the Washington University in St. Louis School of Law and former chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said \u201cthere is not a shred of doubt as to Kamala Harris\u2019s legal eligibility to be either the vice president or the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cA handful of fringe academics have seized on the requirement that one must be not only \u2018born or naturalized in the United States,\u2019 but also \u2018subject to the jurisdiction thereof,\u2019 \u201d Legomsky wrote in an email, citing language from the 14th Amendment. \u201cBut the latter clause has no applicability to Kamala Harris.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only people to whom that clause denies birthright citizenship are (1) American Indians born on tribal reservations (because Indian lands were considered to be a separate sovereign) and (2) the children of either enemy occupiers or foreign diplomats (because those were the categories included in the English common law from which the phrase was taken),\u201d Legomsky added. \u201cThe Supreme Court in Wong Kim Ark specifically so held, and it has never once departed from that interpretation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Fourteenth Amendment affirms the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory, in the allegiance and under the protection of the country, including all children here born of resident aliens, with the exceptions or qualifications (as old as the rule itself) of children of foreign sovereigns or their ministers, or born on foreign public ships, or of enemies within and during a hostile occupation of part of our territory, and with the single additional exception of children of members of the Indian tribes owing direct allegiance to their several tribes. \u201cThe Amendment, in clear words and in manifest intent, includes the children born, within the territory of the United States, of all other persons, of whatever race or color, domiciled within the United States.\u201d\n\nWe sent questions to the Trump campaign and did not get responses. In a 2018 interview with Axios shortly before the congressional midterms, Trump said he would be releasing an executive order to end birthright citizenship \u2014 which never came. Congressional leaders from both parties and legal experts quickly dismissed Trump\u2019s plan and said it would not pass legal muster because birthright citizenship is in the Constitution.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years, with all of those benefits,\u201d Trump stated falsely at the time. Birthright citizenship is the law in more than 30 countries, including Canada and Mexico.\n\n\u201cOne of the hallmarks of the U.S. Constitution, by virtue of the 14th Amendment, is that it directly grants citizenship to those born in the United States, regardless of the ancestry of their parents,\u201d Richard Pildes, a constitutional law professor at New York University School of Law, told HuffPost in a report documenting how a new strain of \u201cbirther\u201d attacks on Harris has begun to spread. The United States, Pildes explained, adheres to the principle of \u201cjus solis,\u201d in which citizenship flows from birth \u201con the soil,\u201d rather than \u201cjus sanguinis,\u201d in which it flows \u201cfrom blood.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Trump said he would end birthright citizenship. This year, the president and a legal adviser for his campaign are suggesting birthright citizenship perhaps never existed, at least not for some people born to immigrant postgraduate students in California in the 1960s, or at the very least not for one of them: Harris.\n\nWhich one is it? When the last national election was coming up, in 2018, birthright citizenship was real and Trump made empty threats to end it unilaterally. This election year, apparently, it\u2019s not so real now that a California-born woman from Jamaican and Indian parents is running on the Democrats\u2019 presidential ticket.", "lang": "en"}
