Yet his tweets are filled with misleading and inaccurate statistics.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2019-02-04T08:00:03.107Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-26966", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/02/04/president-trumps-texas-sized-whoppers/", "vclaim": "Trump often claims that immigration leads to more crime, even though most studies show that immigrants commit crime at lower rates than the native-born, regardless of whether they entered the United States legally or illegally. The Trump administration has been undeterred by such research and routinely comes up with new, misleading statistics to make the case for a border wall between the United States and Mexico.\n\nThe problem with this list from the Texas secretary of state is that many of the 95,000 registered voters became naturalized citizens after they got driver\u2019s licenses or ID cards and before they voted. The initial advisory said the 95,000 people should be considered \u201cWEAK\u201d matches, and on Jan. 29, two days after Trump\u2019s tweet, Texas state officials began removing thousands of names from the list.\n\n\u201cThe secretary of state\u2019s office would eventually walk back its initial findings after embarrassing errors in the data revealed that tens of thousands of the voters the state flagged were actually citizens,\u201d the Texas Tribune reported Feb. 1. \u201cAt least one lawsuit would be filed to halt the review, and others were likely in the pipeline. And a week into the review, no evidence of large-scale voter fraud would emerge.\u201d\n\u2022 None In the Houston area, nearly 18,000 people have been removed from the initial list. Harris County officials said \u201cmore than 60 percent of nearly 30,000 names on a list the state supplied last week are being removed after new guidance from state officials,\u201d the Houston Chronicle reported\n\u2022 None In Dallas County, an election official said \u201cthe county\u2019s voter-roll database vendor has identified 1,715 people as being incorrectly placed on an initial list of 9,938 registered voters sent to the county over the weekend. The share that was flawed, 17 percent, hasn\u2019t been confirmed by state officials yet but could climb if the officials flag more people as being on the list erroneously,\u201d according to the Dallas Morning News\n\u2022 None \u201cIn Travis County, officials dropped 634 voters off their original list of 4,558. \u2026 In Tarrant County, it was about 1,100 voters cleared from the original 5,800,\u201d the Texas Tribune reported\n\u2022 None Chris Davis, president of the Texas Association of Elections Administrators and the election supervisor in Williamson County, told the Morning News that \u201cmore than half of the 2,033 voters on his county\u2019s list were being removed after the state\u2019s revision.\u201d\n\u2022 None In Cameron County, officials got an initial list of more than 1,600 people and were later told to remove nearly 1,500 names, leaving around 30. The Texas Tribune reported that county officials were then told by the secretary of state\u2019s office \u201cthat the 1,500 number had also been incorrect,\u201d leaving roughly 85 percent of the original list.\n\u2022 None In McLennan County, all 366 voters on the initial list were later removed, according to the Waco Tribune-Herald\n\n\u201cEspecially in the context of voting, we know that distortion of the facts has been long weaponized to suppress voting in communities of color,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and former deputy assistant attorney general for civil rights under President Barack Obama. \u201cThis must stop. Our democracy is stronger when every eligible voter is able to participate. It is weaker when fear, lies and intimidation deter voters from casting a ballot.\u201d\n\nTrump cited the Texas Department of Public Safety for this claim. But Texas DPS data actually say there were 2,837 undocumented immigrants convicted by that state for all sexual offenses \u2014 both against adults and minors \u2014 from June 2011 through 2018. Moreover, the data do not break down how many of these individuals crossed through the southern border, so it\u2019s unclear what basis Trump has for claiming \u201cmost\u201d of them did.\n\nThe other numbers Trump tweeted are from the Texas Department of Public Safety, covering the period from June 2011 through 2018. But he\u2019s using a strange mix of statistics, focusing on charges instead of convictions, and at one point combining both totals. Not all charges result in convictions, so Trump\u2019s fast-and-loose use of numbers here is highly misleading.", "lang": "en"}
