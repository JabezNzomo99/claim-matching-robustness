However, as reported for BBC Earth by Colin Barras, the term is a bit of a misnomer:\n\nWhat we\u2019re talking about here is \u201cbiological immortality\u201d, although many biologists would probably rather we didn\u2019t use the phrase. \u201cImmortal really means you don\u2019t die at all, which is stupid,\u201d says Thomas Bosch at the University of Kiel, Germany. Paradoxical though it might seem, biologically immortal organisms are definitely mortal. They can be killed by a predator, a disease, or a catastrophic change in the environment such as an erupting volcano. But unlike humans, they rarely die simply because they get old. To put it another way, biologically immortal organisms do die, but they don\u2019t seem to age.\n\nThere are two separate questions to investigate: 1) Are jellyfish biologically immortal?; and 2) are lobsters biologically immortal?\n\nNot all jellyfish are immortal, but apparent biologic immortality has been documented in one specific species of jellyfish known as Turritopsis nutricula \u2014popularly referred to as the immortal jellyfish. This phenomenon was first described in a 1996 paper, demonstrated in later laboratory experiments, and is well-described in a 2013 Berkeley Science Review story by Nikki R. Kong:\n\nWhile multiple jellyfish species can revert to earlier life stages, Turritopsis is unique because it can do this even after reaching sexual maturity.\n\nLobsters, however, are not biologically immortal. A discussion on this piece of internet misinformation in Smithsonian Magazine suggested that it has its origins in a 2007 NPR story about how lobsters don\u2019t age in typical ways:\n\nWhat is true, however, is that lobsters do not age in a traditional sense, as discussed in a 1998 study published in FEBS Letters:\n\nA leading hypothesis for this phenomenon is that lobsters have a constant supply of an enzyme called telomerase, which can prevent cell aging. Most vertebrate animals, on the other hand, can produce this chemical ONLY in early developmental stages of life.\n\nBut lobsters do ultimately end up dying, if not from a predator or disease, then simply from the process of non-stop growth. Lobsters grow by molting their exoskeleton\u2014a very energetically demanding process that, as discussed in Smithsonian Magazine, ultimately will get the best of even the most resilient lobsters:\n\nAccording to Carl Wilson, lead lobster biologist with the Maine Department of Marine Resources, between 10 and 15 percent of lobsters die naturally each year as they shed their exoskeletons because the exertion proves to be too much. Each molting process requires more and more energy than the one before it as lobsters grow in size. Finally, older crustaceans stop shedding their exoskeletons altogether\u2014a clue that they\u2019re near the end of their lifespans. They run out of metabolic energy to molt, and their worn-and-torn shells contract bacterial infections that weaken them. Shell disease, in which bacteria seeps into lobster shells and forms scar tissue, adheres the crustaceans\u2019 bodies to their shells. The lobster, attempting to molt, gets stuck and dies. The disease also makes lobsters susceptible to other ailments, and in extreme cases, the entire shell can rot, killing the animal inside.\n\nThose 10 to 15 percent that die from the exertion of molting directly counter the claim that lobsters are biologically immortal creatures, as that would be considered death from senescence. Death from infection later in life, while a bit more of a philosophical debate, could also be argued to be natural death from aging, as College of William & Mary marine science professor Jeffrey D. Shields, said in the Smithsonian piece:\n\nOne thing that is true \u2014 it is really difficult to figure out how old lobsters are due to their perennially young cellular tissue. While lobsters will always die, and probably can\u2019t accurately be described as \u201cliving fast\u201d, one could indeed argue, then, that they will always die young.", "lang": "en"}
