It was a stark and tragic illustration of the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the country.\n\nWe received multiple inquiries from readers about the videos, which were featured in various news articles describing the footage as showing military trucks transporting coffins away from a crematorium in the northern city of Bergamo, because the local death rate from the virus had exceeded its capacity.\n\nTragically, those descriptions were accurate, and the videos did indeed show just such an appalling scenario.\n\nEugenio Iafrate, a resident of Bergamo, posted the following video to Twitter on March 18, along with the caption, \u201cBergamo this evening. Army truck transporting coffins.\u201d\n\nThat footage later formed the basis of a report published by BBC News.\n\nWe cross-referenced using Google Maps; based on the \u201cPizziKotto\u201d restaurant shown in the video and its proximity to a gas station and green space, the footage appears to have been recorded on Via Borgo Palazzo in Bergamo, a northern Italian city located around 30 miles east of Milan.\n\nAnother widely-shared still image posted to Twitter was originally published by the Italian news agency ANSA, which quoted provincial national police (Carabinieri) Colonel Paolo Storini as saying: \u201cUnfortunately, the increased number of deaths has brought about an increased number of bodies, which clearly the [Bergamo] cemeteries could not handle.\u201d Storini said he hoped images of the tragic transport operation would serve as a stark reminder to anyone going out in public too much or \u201cnot respecting the rules coming from civil and health authorities.\u201d\n\nAnother widely-shared video, posted to Twitter on March 19, showed the same army-led transport of coffins. It was captured very close to the site of Iafrate\u2019s footage on Via Borgo Palazzo:\n\nThe national newspaper Corriere della Sera reported that the operation had taken place on March 18 with 18 army trucks transporting around 60 coffins away from Bergamo to be cremated in various cities like Modena, Parma, and Piacenza. A statement from Bergamo\u2019s municipal government, cited in Corriere\u2019s report, explained the stark reality that led to the decision:\n\n\u201cThe crematorium in Bergamo, working flat out on a 24-hour basis, can cremate 25 deceased persons. It\u2019s clear that it could not handle the numbers seen in the past few days.\u201d\n\nAccording to Corriere, the city intends to ultimately return the ashes of the bodies cremated in other locations to their final resting places in Bergamo.", "lang": "en"}
