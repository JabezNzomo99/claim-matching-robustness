It was Pence\u2019s setup line to discuss what he described as the \u201cfeckless foreign policy\u201d of Clinton and U.S. President Barack Obama, which he claims emboldened Russian military action in Ukraine and the Middle East. To date, no evidence has been unearthed that this alleged \u201cold proverb\u201d comes from anywhere other than the mouth of Mike Pence himself. Buzzfeed, Vice News, and other media outlets have noted that Internet searches turn up no trace of any such proverb.\n\nBuzzfeed found a record of Pence referencing a similar version of the alleged \u201cold proverb\u201d in a March 2014 article published by the National Review. That quote is also metaphorically confusing, suggesting that not only does the Russian bear hunker down for the winter, but its ambitions do as well.\n\n\u201cHistory shows the Russian Bear\u2019s ambitions never die, they just go into hibernation,\u201d Pence was quoted as saying.\n\nRussian linguists were perplexed by Pence\u2019s latest claim as well. The bear indeed plays a prominent role in Russian mythology and folklore, and the Russian language has numerous aphorisms involving the animal as well.\n\n These include sayings involving the mortality of bears, including \u201cDon\u2019t sell the bear\u2019s skin until you\u2019ve killed it\u201d -- a Russian version of the English proverb \u201cDon\u2019t count your chickens before they hatch.\u201d\n\nBut Irina Levontina, a prominent Russian linguist, told Polygraph.info that she found no evidence of a saying similar to the one cited by Pence when she searched in prominent Russian reference collections. The entry for \u201cbear\u201d in one of the most famous of these works, the Explanatory Dictionary Of The Living Great Russian Language, by renowned 19th-century lexicographer Vladimir Dal, lists dozens of proverbs involving the animal, but does not mention the word \u201chibernation\u201d once. (It does include the phrase \u201cTwo bears don\u2019t live in one cave\u201d -- the Russian equivalent of \u201cTwo of a trade never agree.\u201d\n\nVladimir Slavkin, a linguist and a journalism professor at Moscow State University, told the state-run RIA-Novosti news agency that there are \u201cdifferent understandings of the Russian bear.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the one that (Pence) delivered in his speech, I don\u2019t know where he got that. It\u2019s not a proverb or a saying,\u201d Slavkin said, adding that other languages are \u201cunlikely\u201d to have such an adage either.\n\nLevontina told Polygraph.info that the only \u201cundying bear\u201d she\u2019s ever encountered is in the popular first-person-shooter computer game Far Cry. The fictional animal is valued by Far Cry players for its \u201cundying bear leather\u201d -- which one probably shouldn\u2019t sell until the beast is killed.", "lang": "en"}
