The post suggests that Salman has called Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput a coward.\n\nThe post is going viral in the wake of outrage amongst people against a section of Bollywood following the death of Sushant Singh Rajput in June 2019.\n\nThe quote attributed to Salman read: \u201cSuicide is not a solution, Sushant is a pure coward, That is why he committed suicide. And some jobless Indian people are supporting Sushant every day. As a result, many more cowards like Sushant will be created in India. Stop supporting Sushant\u201d\n\nAt the time of filing this report, the above post was shared over 1,600 times.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found it to be misleading.\n\nWe started our investigation by putting the exact statement through a Google search, and we did not find any substantial results surrounding the statement.\n\nTaking our investigation further, we ran a search with keywords such as \u2018Salman Khan\u2019, \u2018Sushant Singh Rajput\u2019, \u2018Coward\u2019 etc. In the search, we did not find any authentic report/video suggesting that Salman made the above statement.\n\nMoreover, considering Salman\u2019s popularity, it would have been breaking news if he had called Sushant a coward.\n\nOn scanning Salman\u2019s Twitter handle (@BeingSalmanKhan) we found two tweets by him about Sushant Singh Rajput following his demise.\n\nIn a tweet on June 14, 2020, Salman had condoled the death of Sushant Singh Rajput.\n\nAlso, a few days later on June 20, 2020, he had urged his fans to support and stand with Sushant Singh Rajput\u2019s family.\n\nIn conclusion, the above information establishes that the quote in question has been falsely attributed to Salman Khan.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
