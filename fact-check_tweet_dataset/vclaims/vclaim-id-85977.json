Here\u2019s how economist Paul Krugman, a fan of the president\u2019s proposal to boost the minimum wage, put it in 1998:\n\nSo what are the effects of increasing minimum wages? Any Econ 101 student can tell you the answer: The higher wage reduces the quantity of labor demanded, and hence leads to unemployment. This theoretical prediction has, however, been hard to confirm with actual data. Indeed, much-cited studies by two well-regarded labor economists, David Card and Alan Krueger, find that where there have been more or less controlled experiments, for example when New Jersey raised minimum wages but Pennsylvania did not, the effects of the increase on employment have been negligible or even positive. Exactly what to make of this result is a source of great dispute. Card and Krueger offered some complex theoretical rationales, but most of their colleagues are unconvinced; the centrist view is probably that minimum wages \u201cdo,\u201d in fact, reduce employment, but that the effects are small and swamped by other forces.\n\nThe White House, in support of the president\u2019s comment, pointed to a section of the 2013 Economic Report of the President (pages 120-121). The report noted that most economists had once believed an increase in the minimum wage would reduce employment but that \u201cthe consensus view among economists has since shifted as more evidence has accumulated.\u201d It also cited a 2009 meta-analysis of 64 studies of the minimum wage that found \u201cno evidence of a meaningful adverse employment effect\u201d of the minimum wage.\n\nIn 2006, economists David Neumark and William Wascher published a survey of more than 100 studies, and came to an opposite conclusion, directly contradicting the results of the so-called New Minimum Wage Research. They found that the majority of the studies showed that \u201craising the minimum wage leads to economic distortions and often has unintended adverse consequences for the employment opportunities of low-skilled workers.\u201d\n\nThe Fact Checker obviously is not going to take a stand on this debate, only to note that it exists. Each side can find fault with the methods of the other. Neumark and Wascher were faulted for making judgments about different studies, while the meta-analysis was criticized for treating each study as equal in quality.\n\nEconomist Arindrajit Dube and others came up with a new approach in 2010, looking at the impact in counties adjacent at different states, that bolstered the findings of the new minimum wage forces. But economists Jonathan Meer and Jeremy West this year fired back with a study that found that minimum wage hikes reduce net job growth because of the effect on expanding companies. (In October, Dube responded that their supposed job losses were occurring in the sectors without minimum wage workers, which in turn prompted this rebuttal by Meer and West.) And a 2011 study from economists at the London School of Economics and the Central Bank of Turkey found higher minimum wages increased unemployment.\n\nIn any case, it\u2019s wrong to suggest the debate is settled. Economists remain sharply divided about the issue. Daniel S. Hamermesh, an economist at the University of Texas at Austin who supports indexing the minimum wage to inflation, said the president is making a sharp distinction when the real question is whether the impact will be large or small:\n\nUpdate, Feb. 18: The Congressional Budget Office analyzed the proposal to increase the minimum wage to $10.10 and concluded that, under a mid-range estimate, it would lead to a loss of 500,000 jobs because of two key reasons: consumers buy fewer goods because of higher prices resulting from a minimum wage and because employers hire fewer workers because the cost of labor has increased. This is not an exact science, and CBO said the full range of the impact on employment was a very slight decrease in jobs to as many as 1 million fewer jobs.\n\nA few tweaks to his sentence would have made it more accurate. He could have referred to \u201cmixed evidence.\u201d Or he could have said that increasingly economists are turning up evidence that, especially if the minimum wage just keeps up with inflation, the impact on jobs likely is negligible.", "lang": "en"}
