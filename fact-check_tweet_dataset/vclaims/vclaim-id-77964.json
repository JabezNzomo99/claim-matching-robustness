John Lewis.\n\nThe photo shows a funeral that took place in 2015, roughly five years before Lewis\u2019 death and the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nLewis, a civil rights icon and Georgia congressman, passed away on July 17 at the age of 80, ABC News reported. His funeral service took place on July 30 in Atlanta, according to USA Today.\n\nIn recent days, multiple Facebook users have shared a photo of Clinton, Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and others not wearing face masks, claiming it was taken at Lewis\u2019 funeral. The caption of one such post reads, \u201cJuly 30, 2020 Funeral NOT A MASK IN SITE (sic) WTF IS ANYONE AWAKE YET.\u201d\n\nThe photo, however, was actually taken in September 2015 at the homegoing service for Jackson\u2019s mother, Helen Burns Jackson. It appears in a gallery of dozens of photos taken by Heidi Heilbrunn on the Greenville News website. (RELATED: Does Wearing A Face Mask For 8 Hours Cause Pleurisy?)\n\nThe homegoing service for Jackson\u2019s mother occurred roughly five years before Lewis died and before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended people wear face coverings in public to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. The CDC moved to the current guidance on wearing face masks in early April of this year.\n\nWhile speakers such as former President Barack Obama did remove their masks to deliver remarks at Lewis\u2019 funeral, they appeared to quickly put them back on after stepping away from the podium. Videos and photos from Lewis\u2019 funeral also show attendees wearing face masks during the service.", "lang": "en"}
