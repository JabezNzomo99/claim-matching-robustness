The 2019/20 bill is based on 2014/15 revenue.\n\u2022 None This essentially limits the amount of money available for the counties, while allowing the national government to have more money to run its affairs. \n\n\n\n\n\nA push to amend Kenya\u2019s constitution continues to simmer, with backers of a draft bill\n\nto reduce the number of MPs by nearly two thirds and cap the pay of the president and legislators.\n\nIt also aims to increase the counties\u2019 share of national revenue, from at least 15% to\n\nclaimed parliament used old national revenue data to decide on the 47 counties\u2019 share of revenue, giving them less money.\n\n\u201cThis parliament approves the revenues of five years ago,\u201d Ruto, a former chair of the\n\n, said. \u201cSo, they use revenue [figures] of five years ago to share revenue\u201d with county governments in the current financial year.\n\nIs this the case?\n\nConstitution gives counties at least 15%\n\nAfrica Check asked Ruto for the sources of his claim, but he is yet to respond. We will update this report should we hear from him.\n\nHis recommendation was that parliament instead uses revenue figures of the previous financial year from the auditor general, which are more recent than those approved by parliament.\n\nthat in each financial year, counties must get at least \u201c15% of all revenue collected by the national government\u201d.\n\nThis must be based on \u201cthe most recent audited accounts of revenue received, as approved by the National Assembly\u201d.\n\nhow revenue is shared between the two levels of government every year. It uses\n\nto do this. Once parliament approves its proposals, they\n\non 31 August 2017, two months into the 2017/18 financial year. It has so far approved one\n\n, for 2018/19. This was based on the audited accounts of revenue for 2013/14.\n\nallocating funds for 2019/20 used the audited revenue for 2014/15. It hasn\u2019t been passed because it is the\n\nbetween the two houses of parliament.\n\nFor both financial years, the \u201cmost recent audited accounts of revenue\u201d used to work out how the money is to be shared are five years old. To this extent, the former governor is right.\n\nIn other years the gap has been shorter. For the\n\nrevenue bills, the most recent audited data was three years old.\n\nThe use of older revenue figures instead of the most recent data goes against the intention of the constitution, Kwame Owino, CEO of the\n\n\u201cI think what it shows is that the growth in spending for national government is several times higher than the counties, partly because the national government is not constrained by that view that you need to anchor it on audited accounts,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd the fixed share given to the counties may not be enough for their needs.\n\n\u201cThe threshold in the constitution is about a bare minimum and does not say how much it would grow year on year,\u201d\n\nConclusion: Former governor right that current parliament used five-year-old data to allocate county revenue\n\nIsaac Ruto, a former chair of Kenya\u2019s council of governors, recently claimed that parliament used five-year-old revenue figures to work out how much money should go to the country\u2019s 47 counties.\n\nThe most recent revenue sharing bill, for the 2019/20 financial year, relies on 2013/14 figures \u2013 the most recent audited accounts.\n\nFor 2018/19, parliament relied on 2013/14 audited revenue, another five-year lag.\n\nWe therefore rate Ruto\u2019s statement as correct.", "lang": "en"}
