After 16 weeks, 207,301 deaths had been registered in 2020, compared with 198,943 after 16 weeks of 2018.\n\nAt the time of this update, figures for the first 17 weeks of 2020 show that 229,294 deaths were registered, compared with 209,249 people in the first 17 weeks of 2018.\n\nThe original article text follows below.\n\nA Facebook post compared the deaths recorded by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) so far in 2020 with the deaths in 2018. Some readers have asked us to look into this as well.\n\nThe Facebook post says that \u201cUK currently to date including today 22 April has exactly 2,760 \u2018LESS\u2019 deaths than the exact same period weeks 1-15 in 2018\u201d. The user said that the data came from the website of the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nThese numbers refer to deaths in England and Wales, not the whole UK. Also, they were the latest ONS figures available on 22 April, but they only include deaths registered until 10 April. Otherwise, the figures are correct.\n\nLooking at just the last two weeks of data, the number of deaths is far above what it was in any of the past five years.\n\nHave many people died in 2020 compared to 2018?\n\nThe number of people who die varies from year to year. The winter months usually see more deaths, but as it happens \u2013 perhaps because of the mild winter this year \u2013 2020 saw relatively few deaths in the months before the Covid-19 outbreak started.\n\nThere were 138,916 deaths registered in the first 12 weeks of the year. That\u2019s slightly above 2019 and 2016 but quite a bit below 2015, 2017 and 2018.\n\nThen the number of deaths registered in week 13 of 2020 rose above the number in any of the five previous years. Deaths continued to increase very sharply in weeks 14 and 15.\n\nBy the end of week 15, the total for 2020 had already risen above the totals in any of the past five years, except 2018.\n\nEven though the total number of deaths registered in the first 15 weeks of this year (184,960) is still a bit lower than it was in 2018 (187,720), that doesn\u2019t mean that 2020 is an ordinary year.\n\nIt is likely that the total for 2020 so far will overtake the comparable 2018 figure in the coming weeks.", "lang": "en"}
