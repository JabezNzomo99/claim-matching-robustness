The expression was actually written by L.H. Matthews in his introduction to an 1872 edition of Darwin\u2019s work, \u201cOn the Origin of Species.\u201d\n\nA biologist active during the 19th century, Darwin is widely regarded as a pioneer of biological evolutionary theory. Darwin\u2019s 1859 book \u201cOn the Origin of Species\u201d explains his theory of natural selection, whereby organisms better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce.\n\nWhile Darwin spoke and wrote widely on a number of scientific subjects, he did not author the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. It appears nowhere in Darwin Online, a database of his collected works, nor in any of his letters.\n\nAn internet search reveals that the University of Cambridge\u2019s Darwin Correspondence Project categorizes the statement as misattributed on its list of \u201cSix things Darwin never said.\u201d According to their researchers, the expression actually comes Matthews\u2019 introduction to the 1872 edition of \u201cOn the Origin of Species,\u201d though it has been slightly misquoted.\n\n\u201cThe fact of evolution is the backbone of biology, and biology is thus in the peculiar position of being a science founded on an unproved theory, is it then a science or faith?\u201d Matthews wrote in his introduction.", "lang": "en"}
