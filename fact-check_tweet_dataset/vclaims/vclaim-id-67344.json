The website logs the votes of each member of Congress -- and when they didn\u2019t vote.\n\nHere are the percentages of votes missed for each congressman, according to the website:\n\nThe website says the percentage of votes missed by each of the three Georgia members is above the congressional median of 2.3 percent.\n\nCase closed? Not entirely, we thought.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia looked at the Govtrack.us website and did an apples-to-apples comparsion of the voting records of the four men from the same time period, since each congressman joined Congress in different years. We chose July 2007, since that was the year Broun came to Washington. Broun has the shortest tenure of the four congressmen. Reid, Kingston and Gingrey joined Congress in 1987, 1993 and 2003, respectively.\n\nWhat we noticed is that the three Georgia members had voted nearly three times as often as Reid, a senator from Nevada, since July 2007. The House held more than 5,000 votes since July 2007 while the Senate, where Reid serves, had about 1,850 votes during the same time span. The House has more than four times as many members as the Senate. House members file more pieces of legislation.\n\nSince July 2007, Gingrey missed 4.9 percent of House votes, the highest of the three Georgia members, our review of Govtrack\u2019s records shows. Broun missed 3.5 percent of House votes during that time span while Kingston missed 3 percent of those votes. On the Senate side, Reid missed 0.3 percent of the votes.\n\nStill, since the House votes more frequently than the Senate, is this a fair comparison?\n\nWe mentioned this to the Yu campaign, and the candidate\u2019s Augusta campaign office manager, Cole Watkins, sent us a reply via email.\n\n\"What is important is that our elected officials take the voice of the Georgians to Washington for every vote and every committee meeting,\" Watkins wrote. \"If they feel that they are overworked, then it is time for them to step down.\"\n\nKingston spokesman Chris Crawford said the congressman \"strives to make every vote\" but sometimes can\u2019t do so because of illness and family emergencies. Crawford said Reid\u2019s position as majority leader gives him an advantage in terms of voting.\n\n\"Senator Reid sets the vote schedule in the Senate, which should make it nearly impossible for him to miss votes,\" Crawford said.\n\nTo sum up, Yu claimed on a website that Reid has a better voting attendance record than three Georgia congressmen that Yu is running against for the U.S. Senate. The numbers show he\u2019s correct.\n\nBut Reid votes far less than the House members. To us, it\u2019s akin to comparing a baseball player who\u2019s been up to bat 190 times to another who\u2019s had 500 plate appearances.\n\nYu\u2019s claim needs a little context to be fully explained. Under our rating system, this one meets the definition of a Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
