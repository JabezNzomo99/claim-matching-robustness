Both have a point\u2014the local \u201cprecept\u201d for police funding in England and Wales that Mrs May referred to is the key to understanding why.\n\nPolice funding from central government is going to be cut in real terms over the next few years\u20141.4% between 2015/16 and 2019/20, according to the government\u2019s own figures.\n\nMr Corbyn\u2019s claim covers a shorter timeframe and a slightly narrower definition of central government funding, according to calculations provided by his office.\n\nWe\u2019ve checked these and got almost exactly the same results as Labour: this amount is set to go from \u00a37.6 billion in 2015/16 to \u00a37.5 billion in 2017/18. That\u2019s a reduction of \u00a30.33 billion (or \u00a3330 million) once expected inflation is factored in.\n\nBut a good chunk of police funding is raised through local taxation on top of what central government provides. The government assumes that all local Police and Crime Commissioners will raise the maximum from this precept that they\u2019re allowed to.\n\nIf they do, then police funding overall will remain flat in real terms over the course of the parliament.", "lang": "en"}
