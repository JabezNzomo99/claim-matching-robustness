Qassem Soleimani.\n\nLike most Americans left wondering who to believe, we don\u2019t have access to the intelligence that drove the decision to take Soleimani out. But we reviewed public statements and found that Trump\u2019s team has been inconsistent in describing what the intelligence agencies knew.\n\nOver and over, Trump and his advisers have contradicted themselves and each other on the \"imminent threat\" posed by Soleimani and the need for preemptive action against him.\n\nThe disconnect was on display most recently during the Sunday shows, when Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he \"didn\u2019t see\" any specific evidence showing Soleimani was planning attacks against four U.S. embassies, despite what the president told a Fox News anchor just two days prior.\n\nTrump, however, says they\u2019ve been on the same page all along.\n\n\"The Fake News Media and their Democrat Partners are working hard to determine whether or not the future attack by terrorist Soleimani was \u2018imminent\u2019 or not, & was my team in agreement,\" he tweeted Jan. 13. \"The answer to both is a strong YES.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s claims about U.S. embassies at risk evolved\n\nTrump has described the threat a few different ways: as an attack on a single embassy, as an attack on an unspecified number of embassies, and most recently as an attack on four embassies, including the one in Iraq.\n\nIn a Jan. 10 interview with Fox News talk show host Laura Ingraham, he said four embassies, including the embassy in Baghdad, were at risk of getting hit with attacks orchestrated by Soleimani.\n\n\"I can reveal that I believe it probably would\u2019ve been four embassies,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump said the day before that Soleimani was \"looking to blow up our embassy.\"\n\nThat same day, while speaking to a local TV station ahead of a campaign rally in Ohio, Trump suggested that additional embassies were also at risk. \"In our opinion, our very intelligent opinion, he was going after our embassies, and things could have happened,\" he said.\n\nThen, during the rally, Trump added, \"Soleimani was actively planning new attacks, and he was looking very seriously at our embassies and not just the embassy in Baghdad.\"\n\nTop officials did not substantiate Trump\u2019s \"four embassies\" claim\n\nTrump\u2019s mention of \"four embassies\" seemed to contradict a statement from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who said during a Jan. 9 interview that the intelligence agencies did not know \"precisely when\" or \"precisely where\" any attacks would take place.\n\nThe president\u2019s statements came into question again when Esper and National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien toured the Sunday shows Jan. 12.\n\nIn an interview on CBS\u2019s \"Face the Nation,\" Esper said he \"didn\u2019t see\" any specific intelligence pointing to threats facing four U.S. embassies overseas, but he said he shared Trump\u2019s views.\n\n\"What the president said was he believed that it probably and could have been attacks against additional embassies,\" he said. \"He didn\u2019t cite a specific piece of evidence.\"\n\nWhen CBS\u2019s Margaret Brennan pressed Esper on whether any such evidence existed, he said: \"I didn\u2019t see one with regard to four embassies. What I\u2019m saying is, I share the president\u2019s view that probably \u2014 my expectation was they were going to go after our embassies.\"\n\nThe defense secretary also deflected on CNN\u2019s \"State of the Union.\" \"What the president said was, he believed it probably could have been,\" Esper said. \"He didn\u2019t cite intelligence.\"\n\nO\u2019Brien offered more support for Trump\u2019s claim that intelligence showed Iran had drawn up attacks against four U.S. embassies. But he refused to give specific details.\n\n\"Everything the president has said is consistent with and his interpretation is very consistent with the intelligence which showed that Soleimani was plotting to kill Americans, soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines and our diplomats,\" O\u2019Brien said on ABC\u2019s \"This Week.\"\n\nHe said the United States was taking precautions to protect embassies near Iran.\n\n\"It\u2019s always difficult, even with the exquisite intelligence that we have, to know exactly what the targets are,\" O\u2019Brien added on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"But it\u2019s certainly consistent with the intelligence to assume that they would\u2019ve hit embassies in at least four countries.\"\n\n\"We knew there were threats to American facilities,\" he continued. \"Now, whether they were bases, embassies, it\u2019s always hard until the attack happens.\"\n\nOfficials differed on what intelligence was shared with Congress\n\nTop administration officials also diverged in their accounts of the Jan. 8 intelligence briefing provided to Congress after the strike was carried out.\n\nSeveral lawmakers, including members of both parties, said Esper and Pompeo didn\u2019t mention threats facing four embassies during the classified briefing.\n\n\"If there was evidence of imminent attacks on four embassies, the Administration would have said so at our Wednesday briefing,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., in a tweet. \"They didn't.\"\n\n\"I don't recall being told, look, there were four embassies,\" said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, on CNN. \"I'm sure there was a mention of at least one embassy in that briefing.\"\n\nPompeo disputed this, saying in a Jan. 10 White House press briefing that he and Esper did tell Congress about the specific threats to U.S. embassies.\n\n\"We told them about the imminent threat,\" he said. \"All of the intelligence that we briefed, that you've heard today I assure you in an unclassified setting, we provide in the classified setting, as well.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Esper told Brennan and CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that only the Gang of Eight \u2014 a bipartisan group of congressional intelligence leaders \u2014 was privy to all the intelligence on Soleimani, including the details of a planned attack in Baghdad.\n\nSome specifics were not shared with the \"broader membership of Congress,\" he said.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, a Democratic member of the Gang of Eight, told Brennan he believed Esper\u2019s claim was \"plain wrong.\"\n\n\"There was no discussion in the Gang of Eight briefings that these are the four embassies that are being targeted,\" he said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment.", "lang": "en"}
