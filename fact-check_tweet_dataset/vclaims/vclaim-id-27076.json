A Twitter user said he posted the photo in 2015, even though he had no evidence it was the Clintons, to \u201cstir interest.\u201d\n\nThe confessions of politicians who once dressed in blackface have been littering the headlines recently, which has led to a heap of phony claims on social media that Hillary Clinton was once pictured in blackface.\n\nSnopes first debunked that claim when the picture of two people, apparently at a costume party, began circulating widely online in early 2016.\n\nAt that point, Snopes found the earliest use of the photo came from a Twitter account that posted it in 2015, suggesting that it showed the Clintons without explicitly saying so. We couldn\u2019t find any earlier uses online, but we did talk to Brian Tourville, who runs the Twitter account that posted it in 2015.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t believe it was them,\u201d Tourville said. \u201cI never proffered that it was.\u201d He said that he found the photo online and downloaded it a couple of years before he posted it thinking that it was \u201ccollectable.\u201d Tourville dislikes the Clintons and supported Bernie Sanders when he ran against Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary.\n\nAlthough Tourville didn\u2019t believe that the photo showed the Clintons, he thought it looked similar enough to them that it might stir up some reaction. \u201cIt was close enough that it would be a pebble in still water \u2014 it would put out ripples,\u201d Tourville said.\n\nHe was right. The photo has been shared thousands of times, once prompting an apology from a surrogate for Donald Trump who retweeted it during the campaign.\n\nThat surrogate, Pastor Mark Burns, said at the time, \u201cI didn\u2019t have the correct information \u2014 knowing that it wasn\u2019t Bill Clinton \u2014 and I apologize for that as well, for posting incorrect information.\u201d\n\nThe man in the picture does look similar to a young Bill Clinton, but, as Tourville said, \u201cThe guy\u2019s face looked too finely boned, more finely boned than Bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just put it out there to stir interest, really,\u201d Tourville said of deciding to post the photo even though he had no evidence that it showed the Clintons and didn\u2019t believe that it showed the Clintons.\n\nAlso, Angel Urena, spokesman for former President Bill Clinton, confirmed to FactCheck.org that the photo doesn\u2019t show Bill and Hillary Clinton.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nMerica, Dan and Nobles, Ryan. \u201cNortham denies being in racist photo but recalls darkening his skin in Michael Jackson dance contest in 1984.\u201d CNN. 2 Feb 2019.\n\nSchneider, Gregory and Vozzella, Laura. \u201cVirginia\u2019s three leaders engulfed in turmoil, with Herring disclosure from college days.\u201d The Washington Post. 6 Feb 2019.\n\nLemongello, Steven. \u201cState Rep.
