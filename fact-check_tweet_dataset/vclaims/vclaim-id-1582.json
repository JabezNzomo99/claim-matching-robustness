That means we can\u2019t say for sure how the numbers of people being treated has changed.\n\nThe figures from before 2010/11 do show us that the number of people accessing mental health services was increasing up until that point.\n\nNHS Digital told us that this, combined with the fact that uses of the Mental Health Act increased between 2011 and 2015, probably means that the number of people accessing mental health services has increased in the last few years. We just can\u2019t say by exactly how much.\n\nMore recent figures have been published since the government made its calculations and since Theresa May made her claim. These estimate that the number of patients using NHS mental health, learning disability and autism services was just under 2.6 million in 2016/17. The figure includes children\u2019s mental health services for the first time. The number of adults using mental health services in the same year was just over 2 million.\n\nThese figures aren\u2019t directly comparable with any from previous years because NHS Digital changed the way they were collected in 2016/17, including the addition of data for children and young people and counting a small number of people who changed mental health provider.\n\nNHS Digital says its best estimate is that there has been a 10% increase in the number of people in contact with adult mental health, learning disabilities and autism services between 2015/16 and 2016/17. But it also says that this estimate is \u201cpossibly unreliable.\u201d\n\nThere were around 1.8 million people in contact with NHS adult mental health services in 2014/15 and 2015/16 (these two years are directly comparable).\n\nNHS Digital also told us that these figures don\u2019t include people who just go to their GP about mental health issues or the Adult Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme which provides therapies for people with anxiety and depression.", "lang": "en"}
