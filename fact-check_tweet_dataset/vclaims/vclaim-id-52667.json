This is false; authorities in the US state recommend wearing face masks as a precaution, but say they will not penalize those who do not.\n\nThe post from April 26, 2020 claims residents face the penalties if they are \u201ccaught in public without a mask.\u201d\n\nThe claim was shared by other social media users on Twitter and Facebook, including here, here and here.\n\nBut state health and law enforcement officials said the mentioned penalties do not apply.\n\n\u201cPennsylvanians are expected to, and are doing the right thing, and we do not intend to fine or otherwise penalize an individual if they are not wearing a mask, but all are expected to wear a mask if they will be out in public and could interact with any individuals while out,\u201d Nate Wardle, press secretary for Pennsylvania\u2019s health department, told AFP by email.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Health\u2019s guidelines advise wearing a mask when shopping or interacting with customers or clients at essential businesses, visiting a healthcare provider, when feeling sick, coughing or sneezing, and on public transportation.\n\n\u201cYou have to wear a mask if you go to the grocery store. If you don\u2019t wear a mask in the grocery store, the store would be fined for not ensuring that you\u2019re wearing the mask, it\u2019s not the everyday citizen, not the general public,\u201d Ryan Tarkowski, Communications Director at Pennsylvania State Police told AFP by phone.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the confusion might come from,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re walking down the street, by yourself, getting some exercise, there\u2019s no requirement for a mask,\u201d Tarkowski said.\n\nIn Philadelphia, the state\u2019s largest city, wearing a mask is a recommendation, not a legal requirement.\n\n\u201cThe City neither fines nor jails those who do not comply,\u201d Mike Dunn, the deputy director of communications for the city, said by email.\n\nAs of midday on May 4, Pennsylvania had 50,092 total cases of COVID-19 -- the disease caused by the novel coronavirus -- which has killed nearly 250,000 people worldwide.\n\nThe state\u2019s governor, Tom Wolf, has announced that 24 counties with low per-capita case counts would enter a \u201cyellow\u201d or reopening phase as of May 8, 2020.\n\nUnder the new phase, limitations around large gatherings will remain in place but some businesses will be allowed to reopen. Schools, however, will stay closed.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends \u201cwearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
