This is based on findings published in The Journal of Pediatrics about the amount of coronavirus carried by infected children. The stories in the media are generally accurate reports of what the study\u2019s authors say\u2014however, the study does not prove how likely children are to transmit the infection, and some conclusions it draws have been questioned by other scientists.\n\nThe study at Massachusetts General Hospital in America claims to reveal that children \u201cmay be a potential source of contagion in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in spite of milder disease or lack of symptoms\u201d. It tested the amount (viral load) of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19) in infected patients, and found that children \u201ccan carry high levels of the virus in their upper airways, particularly early in an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet they display relatively mild or no symptoms.\u201d\n\nFrom this, the authors warned that infection control measures such as social distancing, mask use and routine screening for Covid-19 should be introduced in schools, adding: \u201cWithout infection control measures such as these, there is significant risk that the pandemic will persist, and children could carry the virus into the home, exposing adults who are at higher risk of developing severe disease.\u201d\n\nHowever, this study did not test transmissibility. It says it is \u201clikely\u201d that children with high viral loads and symptoms like a cough can transmit the virus \u201cas easily as other viral infections spread by respiratory particles\u201d, but there is no evidence of this presented in the study.\n\nProfessor Adilia Warris, Professor of Paediatric Infectious Diseases at the University of Exeter, told the Science Media Centre that the data in the report \u201cdoes not support the claim that children are silent spreaders of Covid-19\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe study was not designed to assess risk of transmission. Although a high viral load contributes to the level of contagiousness, it is not the only factor playing a role.\u201d\n\nDr Simon Clarke, Associate Professor in Cellular Microbiology at the University of Reading, said the study \u201cdoes not actually demonstrate that children spread the virus\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is already fairly well documented that children do indeed contract the coronavirus causing Covid-19 and that they produce it in large quantities. However it is less clear how much infection they cause in others or how their age may influence that.\n\n\u201cThis study only adds to our understanding of the extent of infection in children, but not the spread of Covid-19. It does not demonstrate, in any way, that children actually spread the virus to adults or other children.\u201d\n\nJust 192 children were enrolled in the study, and only 49 of these were diagnosed with Covid-19. The majority of children in the study\u2014125 patients\u2014did not have Covid-19, and an additional 18 children had confirmed or suspected multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has been linked to Covid-19. This is a relatively small sample to draw strong conclusions from.\n\nThe study did not control for any patient characteristics that may have affected results. For example, the patients taking part were not all children: participants could be as old as 22, and 13 Covid-19 positive participants (around 27%) were aged between 17 and 22. Although the study said there was \u201cno age correlation with viral load, indicating that infants through to young adults can carry equally high levels of virus\u201d, this does mean it is incorrect to say the findings are solely about children.\n\nObesity is known to increase the risk of becoming seriously ill with coronavirus, and around 27% of the Covid-19 positive children in this study were obese. There was also no control for other factors, such as the race or economic background of participants, to see if any of these factors may affect viral load.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the patients enrolled in the study were those admitted to hospital or urgent care clinics with symptoms of Covid-19 or multisystem inflammatory syndrome. This means the children studied were unwell (or suspected to be) with Covid-19\u2014something that we know is less common in children.\n\nDr Andrew Preston, Reader in Microbial Pathogenesis at the University of Bath, told the Science Media Centre it was \u201cmisleading\u201d to suggest that \u201cchildren in general will be walking around with high viral loads, when in fact this study was limited to small numbers of children with symptoms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis study is a valuable contribution to the study of Covid-19 in children, but the paper makes some bold claims regarding the role of children as silent spreaders of the Covid-19 virus. Without studies of transmission, and while focused only on symptomatic children who are a minority of the whole children cohort, these claims are largely unfounded.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
