Any Senator, on either side of the aisle, may object to a vote. And Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) often files cloture on multiple bills or nominations at once to speed things along even if no one is slowing things down.\n\nA close look at the data shows that many of these votes are unanimous or nearly unanimous, but Reid found it easier to file cloture than to allow votes on amendments. Indeed, a chunk of those cloture motions were simply dropped, never actually voted on, or \u201cvitiated\u201d in the senatorial nomenclature.\n\nSo cloture motions \u2014 the 433 figure \u2014 does not really tell you much, especially in terms of one party or the other blocking measures. The Grimes campaign is essentially counting actions taken by Reid and incorrectly declaring these were actions taken by McConnell.\n\nIf you want to measure the extent of \u201cblocking\u201d in the Senate, you first need to look at the number of actual votes on cloture. That adds up to 309 since 2007. Then you have to look at figure for \u201ccloture invoked,\u201d which means that the Democrats prevailed in a vote. That adds up to 189 \u2014 a success rate for the Democrats of better than 60 percent.\n\nBy contrast, during the eight years that Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) was minority leader (not counting a brief period in 2001), here\u2019s how the statistics work out. There were 210 votes in that period, and cloture was invoked 67 times. Thus Democrats blocked 143 actions in that period\u2013meaning the Republican majority had a success rate of only 32 percent.\n\nThe Grimes campaign, in a statement, noted that The Oxford English Dictionary defines \u201cblock\u201d as \u201can obstacle to the normal progress or functioning of something\u201d and to \u201cmake the movement or flow in (a passage, pipe, road, etc.) difficult or impossible.\u201d So the campaign argued that \u201cblocking\u201d is more than when cloture fails, as any filibuster is an \u201cobstacle to normal progress.\u201d\n\nFurther, the campaign cited opinion columns, including in The Washington Post, that counted cloture motions as roughly equivalent to filibusters. \u201cWhile you might have other reasonable interpretations of the facts and words involved, our campaign has certainly provided accurate information to the people of Kentucky,\u201d the statement said.\n\nUpdate: Sarah Binder of the Brookings Institution disputed our reasoning in a column for The Washington Post\u2019s Monkey Cage blog. \u201cCounting cloture votes remains an imperfect \u2014 but still valid \u2014 method of capturing minority efforts to block the Senate,\u201d she argues. Another political scientist who writes at times for The Post, Jonathan Bernstein, objected to the Pinocchio rating\u2013which he said was shocking\u2013but said the column laid out a complex issue in \u201can accurate and easy to understand way.\u201d\n\nMany denizens of the Senate will argue that, simply as an anecdotal matter, the current minority is obstructionist. Case in point: the near-universal vote against Obama\u2019s nominee for Defense Secretary, even though he is a former Republican senator. The only Republican votes that Chuck Hagel received came from his home state senator, Mike Johanns, and three others.", "lang": "en"}
