The warning messages have been shared thousands of times on Facebook and WhatsApp. But the claim is false; both the Sri Lankan and Philippine governments said their air forces were not involved in any such operations.\n\nA purported advisory about the Sri Lankan Air Force's plans to use helicopters to disinfect the country was published here on Facebook on March 24, 2020.\n\nIt has been shared more than 1,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe Sinhala-language text superimposed on the image translates to English as: \u201cNo one should be outside after 11:30 PM tonight.\n\nDoors and windows must be kept shut as disinfectant is due to be sprayed into air to eradicate coronavirus from this country using helicopters.\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. It has since killed more than 21,031 people and infected more than 465,915 others worldwide, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 27, 2020.\n\nThe claim was also shared among WhatsApp users and published on Facebook here, here, here and here.\n\nSri Lanka's Government Information Department refuted the claims in a statement released on March 24, 2020.\n\nIt states: \u201cThere is a false message circulating on social media that disinfectant will be sprayed by helicopters at 11.30 tonight to eradicate coronavirus and the Air Force Spokesperson notes that Sri Lanka Air Force is not involved in any such operation.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the original Sinhala media release:\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s Air Force Acting Director of Media, Group Captain Dushan Wijesinghe, also told Sri Lankan news site EconomyNext that the claim is \u201cfalse\u201d and that the Air Force \u201cwill not conduct any such operation.\u201d\n\nAn advisory claiming the Philippine Air Force will spray pesticide over the country in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19 was published here on Facebook on March 21, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post, which has been shared almost 200 times:\n\nIt states: \"Today, special military helicopters will spray pesticides against the Corona virus in the skies all over the country, so you must stay indoors after twelve o'clock at night. And remove all clothes which are outside . when you hear the sounds of airplanes at night, it is for you to know that it is related to this matter (COVID-19).\"\n\nA similar claim was also shared here, here, here and here on Facebook.\n\nThis claim is also false; the Philippine Department of Health on March 21, 2020 denied the claim circulating online. It urged the public to source information from official accounts only.\n\nThe Facebook statement reads, in part: \"Circulating news on PESTICIDE SPRAYING by military helicopters all over the country after 12 midnight to combat COVID-19 is NOT TRUE.\n\n\"DOH clarifies that there are no military helicopters or airplaine that will be deployed for spraying activities. The Department urges the public to source out information from official DOH channels. The public will also be notified on updates regarding the COVID-19 health event.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Department of Health's release:\n\nThe statement added that pesticides would not be effective in preventing COVID-19.\n\nIt states: \"Pesticides work against pests, not viruses. COVID-19 is caused by a virus.\"\n\nAccording to this March 23, 2020 report by the state-run Philippine News Agency, the Philippine National Police also refuted the misleading claims.\n\nThe report reads, in part: \"PNP spokesperson Brig. Gen. Bernard Banac denied the reports that the government, through the police and the military, will spray pesticides in the country using helicopters in the bid to kill the virus that causes Covid-19.\n\n\u201cThis is patently fake news and must be disregarded outright. The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) has denied any such flight operations,\u201d Banac said in a statement.\"", "lang": "en"}
