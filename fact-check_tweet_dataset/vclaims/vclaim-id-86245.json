That\u2019s where census data comes into the picture. Only citizens have the right to vote, so adding up all the voting-age citizens gives you the total population of eligible voters.\n\n\u201cThe Census Bureau\u2019s own 2018 analyses of the effects of adding a citizenship . . . demonstrate that the decline in self-response will not be uniform across all households, but instead will have a disparately high effect on noncitizen households and on Hispanic citizen households, which will have an adverse effect on the accuracy of the census,\u201d they said. \u201cThat disparate effect could well skew the allocation among the States of seats in the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nU.S. District Judge Richard G. Seeborg ruled March 6: \u201cSecretary Ross violated the APA by failing to disclose the basis for his decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census. As explained in the Findings of Fact Based Exclusively on the Administrative Record, the evidence overwhelmingly shows that Secretary Ross decided to add the citizenship question well before DOJ made the request in December of 2017 and that his reason for doing so was not to improve enforcement of Section 2 of the VRA. This purported purpose was a mere pretext.\u201d\n\nSeeborg also said: \u201cWhile it is of course appropriate for an incoming cabinet member to advocate for different policy directions, to solicit support for such views from other agencies, and to disagree with his or her professional staff, this record reflects a profoundly different scenario: an effort to concoct a rationale bearing no plausible relation to the real reason, whatever that may be, underlying the decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost blatantly, Secretary Ross ignored, and violated, a statute that requires him, in circumstances like those here, to collect data through the acquisition and use of \u2018administrative records\u2019 instead of through \u2018direct inquiries\u2019 on a survey such as the census. Additionally, Secretary Ross\u2019s decision to add a citizenship question was \u2018arbitrary and capricious\u2019 on its own terms: He failed to consider several important aspects of the problem; alternately ignored, cherry-picked, or badly misconstrued the evidence in the record before him; acted irrationally both in light of that evidence and his own stated decisional criteria; and failed to justify significant departures from past policies and practices \u2014 a veritable smorgasbord of classic, clear-cut APA violations. On top of that, Secretary Ross acted without observing procedures required by law, including a statute requiring that he notify Congress of the subjects planned for any census at least three years in advance. And finally, the evidence establishes that Secretary Ross\u2019s stated rationale, to promote VRA enforcement, was pretextual \u2014 in other words, that he announced his decision in a manner that concealed its true basis rather than explaining it, as the APA required him to do.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court decided to review Furman\u2019s ruling on an expedited basis and then expanded the case after Seeborg\u2019s ruling in March to weigh the arguments under the Constitution\u2019s enumeration clause. Usually, the lower-court judges\u2019 rulings would first be reviewed by the appellate courts. But the census questionnaire has to be at the printer this summer, and the Supreme Court decided to hear the case directly.", "lang": "en"}
