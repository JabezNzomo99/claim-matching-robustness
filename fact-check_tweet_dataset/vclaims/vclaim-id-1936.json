The specific ingredients he calls out are mercury, aluminium, propylene glycol and formaldehyde. Secondly, he claims that the safety of vaccines is unknown.\n\nReviewers who examined the video\u2019s claims found it to be inaccurate and misleading. With regards to the first claim, reviewers explained that mercury in its elemental form \u2013 which the video correctly says is highly toxic \u2013 is not used in any vaccine. Another form of mercury called methylmercury, which contaminates seafood, is also toxic, but is not present in vaccines either. However, there is a mercury-containing compound called thimerosal, which is used in vaccines as a preservative and antibacterial. Thimerosal is metabolized to ethylmercury, which is degraded and eliminated by the body quickly, unlike methylmercury, meaning that it does not accumulate in the body at levels sufficient to cause toxicity#. However, mounting public concern over its safety led to the removal of thimerosal from childhood vaccines in the United States in 2001, meaning that mercury is not present in most vaccines, with the exception of certain multi-dose influenza vaccines.\n\nAluminium is also not used in its elemental form in vaccines, but in the form of aluminium salts which act as adjuvants. Adjuvants are used to heighten the immune response upon vaccination and enhance protection during subsequent natural infection. While it is possible for them to trigger side effects if used in excessive amounts, the levels in vaccines are low and safe. No scientific evidence has linked adjuvants with encephalopathy.\n\nIt is true that propylene glycol is used in antifreeze, but it is also used as a food ingredient that is Generally Recognized As Safe by the Food and Drug Administration. The claim that it is toxic at the levels present in vaccines is false.\n\nIt is true that formaldehyde can be toxic and that it is used in vaccine production. However, reviewers have explained that the amount of formaldehyde present in vaccines is extremely low and insufficient for causing toxicity. The Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia has also published a fact-sheet on the use of formaldehyde in vaccines, as well as the concentrations present, which show that the levels are safe.\n\nThe video also shows a segment of the MMR vaccine\u2019s package insert, and claims that encephalopathy is \u201ca known side effect of every vaccine we get\u201d. This package insert appears to be that of the MMR II vaccine, which can be downloaded from the CDC website (as a PDF). Readers can also find the same passage quoted in the video (on page 7 of the PDF version of the insert), under Adverse Reactions. What the video does not show in its cropped image of the insert is the following explanatory header found under Adverse Reactions: \u201cThe following adverse reactions are listed in decreasing order of severity, without regard to causality\u201d (emphasis added). It is therefore erroneous to assert a causal relationship between vaccines and encephalopathy on the basis of the package insert information.\n\nEarlier studies posited an association between pertussis vaccination and increased likelihood of seizures (discussed in an article by Doja[1]), but recent studies have shown that most severe cases are actually the result of an underlying genetic mutation which causes Dravet syndrome[2,3,4], a rare epileptic encephalopathy. An increased incidence of febrile seizures in children has been observed after administration of some vaccines, but these are not associated with long-term health problems or encephalopathy[5,6].\n\nThe claim that vaccine safety is completely unknown is false. The Institute of Medicine \u2013 part of the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine \u2013 reviewed childhood immunization schedules and found them to be safe. Oxford University\u2019s Vaccine Group has also published information on how vaccines are tested and approved for use among the general population. Reviewers have also pointed out that vaccines continue to be subjected to monitoring by regulatory agencies for potential problems, even after approval.\n\n\n\n Neal Halsey, Professor Emeritus, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health:\n\n 1. The statement that aluminum-containing vaccines have not been studied is false. Every vaccine that is approved by the FDA has undergone extensive safety testing and been found to be safe and effective.\n\n 2. Some vaccines do contain very small (trace) amounts of formaldehyde, which is a natural product produced by all mammalian cells. The trace amounts in some vaccines are residuals from the manufacturing process. In high concentrations, formaldehyde is toxic to cells and organisms. It is used to kill some of the organisms that are used to make vaccines and then purification removes all but a trace of the formaldehyde. The trace amounts that are left as a residual in vaccines are considered to have no additive effect to the naturally produced formaldehyde in our bodies.\n\n 3. Thimerosal is a mercury-containing preservative that is only used in some of the many different influenza vaccines that are available today. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, thimerosal was removed as a preservative from all pediatric vaccines with the exception of some influenza vaccines. Thimerosal-free influenza vaccines are available for children and pregnant women upon request in virtually all settings where these vaccines are given.\n\n 4. No vaccine that I know of contains antifreeze or propylene glycol.\n\n 5. All of us are exposed to substances that are potentially toxic when we are exposed to high concentrations for long periods of time. None of the substances in vaccines are considered to be \u201ctoxic\u201d in the concentrations that are in vaccines.\n\nBeate Kampmann, Professor (Pediatric Infection & Immunity), London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine:\n\n This video is completely and deliberately inaccurate. Basically, it is so wrong that it should just be taken off. I would not even know where to start.\n\nThere is ample information on ingredients in vaccines available \u2013 it is in every insert in the vaccine packaging \u2013 not only about what\u2019s in the final product but also what has been used in the manufacturing process \u2013 many of which do not actually get into the end product. The video does not mention why some of these ingredients are necessary to make the vaccine work \u2013 the word adjuvant is not part of their vocabulary. The imagery they use is completely misleading, and it\u2019s not a disease that gets made into a vaccine, by the way. The video just chooses to ignore it and completely exaggerates the harm from vaccine ingredients by either false or hugely exaggerated claims.\n\nJames D Cherry, Professor (Pediatrics), David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles:\n\n There is aluminum salt present in killed vaccines, such as the present DTaP and Tdap vaccines, but it\u2019s a very good adjuvant and it\u2019s been in killed vaccines from the very beginning. The amount and the actual aluminum salt may vary with vaccines. The key thing is that too much aluminum would give you abscesses at the site of vaccination, but no present killed vaccine has excessive amounts. In live vaccines there\u2019s no aluminum at all.\n\nPropylene glycol is very safe. I\u2019m not certain how much is in any vaccine and what vaccines it\u2019s in. It may be in some live vaccines, but it\u2019s perfectly safe. So it\u2019s a non-issue.\n\nMercury is really interesting. Ethylmercury, which is from thimerosal, is very safe, and it degrades so that there\u2019s no problem whatsoever. The problem is that regular mercury is very toxic. Methylmercury, which contaminates fish for example, is also toxic. But ethylmercury acts as a preservative and also as an antibacterial, so it prevents vaccines from being contaminated with bad bacteria. The confusion of roles [between ethylmercury and methylmercury] \u2013 and this happened with people who should have known better \u2013 created the push to get mercury out of vaccines. There was thimerosal in the DTP vaccine and also later when the hepatitis B vaccine came along, which we gave right at birth. Although the amount of mercury appeared to exceed the EPA level, that level is for methylmercury, not ethylmercury. Nevertheless, that prompted the move to take mercury out of vaccines, and so our present killed vaccines have no mercury in any of them, with the possible exception of multi-dose vials of some influenza vaccines.\n\nThe whole idea was wrong from the beginning. Ethylmercury is incredibly safe and we know that because back before we had antibiotics, it was given in an attempt to treat serious infections, in large doses \u2013 a thousand times bigger than what\u2019s in any vaccine. And of course in any live vaccine, there\u2019s no mercury whatsoever.\n\nVaccines are incredibly safe. The things that are blamed on vaccines \u2013 such as sudden infant death syndrome, have been proven to be false[7,8,9,10]. They are also blamed for the so-called \u201cvaccine encephalopathy\u201d, and that\u2019s been proven in studies to be wrong[1,2,3,4,11,12].\n\nThe benefits arising from vaccines can be illustrated by the example of the measles vaccine, which on its own prevents approximately 500 deaths a year in the United States. All our present vaccines are incredibly effective and these claims about vaccine ingredients are wrong.\n\nMore answers by relevant experts addressing a similar claim can also be found on Metafact: \u201cIs there strong evidence to support that any of the ingredients of vaccines are toxic in the concentrations they hold?\u201d\n\u2022 1 \u2013 Doja (2008) Genetics and the myth of vaccine encephalopathy.
