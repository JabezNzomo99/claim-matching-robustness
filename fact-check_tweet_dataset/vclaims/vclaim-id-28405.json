The human body, the post adds, can only bear \u201c45 del (unit) of pain\u201d. The claim is false; health experts said there is no unit called a \u201cdel\u201d to measure levels of pain; medical researchers have used a ten-point scale to measure pain but agree that a person\u2019s experience of pain is subjective.\n\nOne misleading post was published here on Facebook on December 11, where it has been shared 50 times.\n\nAlong with purported images of childbirth, the graphic includes text that reads: \u201cA human body can bear only up to 45 del (unit) of pain. Yet at time of giving birth, a mother feels up to 57 del (unit) of pain. This is similar to 20 bones simultaneously getting fractured at a time.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you imagine it now, the mother\u2019s pain and love?\u201d the text adds.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe same graphic was shared with an identical claim here on Facebook and here on Twitter.\n\nMultiple similar posts have also been published on meme sharing websites, for example here, here, here, here, here and here.\n\nThe claim is false; there is no unit called a \u201cdel\u201d used to measure pain.\n\nIn the 1940s, a system known as the \u201cdol scale\u201d was developed that quantified pain levels using a dolorimeter, an instrument used to measure pain intensity. But unlike the scale of 0 to 45 referenced in the misleading posts, the dol scale assessed pain from 1 to 10. The scale was outlined in this 1947 report by the dolorimeter\u2019s creators, published by The American Society for Clinical Investigation.\n\nA report published here in Oxford University's Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences in 2011 detailed how by the early 1950s, experts began assessing pain individually through clinical trials instead of the dolorimeter.\n\nHealth professionals then began using a 10-point scale that incorporated descriptions and pictures of facial expressions to help assess pain, according to a report published here in December 2018 by Harvard Health Publishing, the consumer health division of the Harvard Medical School.\n\nBut even that system has since been questioned.\n\n\u201cWe now realize the scale is too simple to measure something so complex,\" Dr. Jianren Mao, the chief of the Division of Pain Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital was quoted as saying in the same report.\n\n\"What one person rates as an 8 or 4 may be quite different for someone else, so it is not always an accurate assessment,\u201d he added.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the first part of the Harvard Medical School\u2019s report:\n\nThe same misleading claim about the pain of childbirth was also debunked here by Africa Check, a Johannesburg-based fact-check site, and here by Snopes, a US-based fact check organisation.", "lang": "en"}
