In North Carolina, first-term Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan, is already facing attacks about Obamacare.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity, a conservative political advocacy group, against Hagan. It starts out with a series of claims praising women for being breadwinners and job creators. Then, it pivots: \"But Kay Hagan just doesn\u2019t get it.\"\n\n\"Hagan supports waivers for friends of Obama and special treatment for Congress and their staffs,\" the video continues.\n\nHagan did to pass Obamacare in 2010, but does the law include \"waivers for friends of Obama\" and \"special treatment for Congress and their staffs\"? We\u2019ll look into both parts of this statement.\n\nWe\u2019ve already the claim that the president handed out waivers to his friends. The law did lead to the granting of more than 1,000 waivers, but they weren\u2019t issued to groups on the basis of being Obama\u2019s friends or political allies.\n\nPart of the law allowed for groups to apply for an exemption so that they can keep their cheap insurance plans, even though they don\u2019t typically cover the \"10 essential benefits\" like maternity care and mental health care that Obamacare touts. These waivers expire on Jan. 1, 2014.\n\nSome but not all of these groups could be considered Obama\u2019s political allies, so using the term \"friends\" is at the very least misleading. Many unions, which typically lean Democratic, made the list. They make up about a third of the waivers.\n\nBut the also include groups like the Baptist Retirement Homes of North Carolina, Pepsi and McDonald\u2019s. The common denominator with most of those who received waivers seems to be low-wage workers. As far as we can tell, there\u2019s no reason to think that \"friendship\" played a role, or that these companies are Obama\u2019s political allies.\n\nMore than 100 groups, including several unions, were . There\u2019s also a sizable number of groups that were denied waivers, then were accepted the second time around.\n\nHealth and Human Services issues these waivers. Hagan and other legislators don't have a say. Hagan's spokeswoman told us the senator has never spoken out in favor of the practice.\n\nPolitiFact has also looked at claims to Americans For Prosperity\u2019s assertion that Congress gets \"special treatment.\"\n\nThat implies that legislators and their staffs aren\u2019t subject to the health care reform\u2019s individual mandate when in fact they are. It\u2019s more accurate to say that Congress is one of several special cases under the law.\n\nHowever, this exception actually requires Congress to buy insurance on the marketplace instead of keeping employer-provided benefits from the federal government. Lawmakers still get a subsidy toward their policies. Without the subsidy, the change in coverage would have effectively been a pay cut of thousands of dollars per year.\n\nIn other words, the law singles out Congress and forces members off their employer-provided plan in favor of the marketplace options, even though all other Americans with employee-provided health coverage can keep it.\n\nIn defense of the ad, Americans for Prosperity wrote, \"The \u2018subsidy\u2019 is not the problem. \u2026 Congress and its staff are enjoying an option not available to the rest of the nation.\" They cite the fact that businesses with more than 50 employees can\u2019t yet access group plans on the , the marketplace the legislators will use. But this policy allows legislators to experience Obamacare's individual mandate alongside their constituents. We don't see a case that they're getting special treatment.\n\nMore than 1,000 companies have received Obamacare waivers, but there\u2019s no evidence to suggest that those groups are all Obama\u2019s \"friends.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Congress and their staffs do have to adhere to the reform\u2019s individual mandate, and in a key way are treated worse than other Americans by the law, which is a curious definition of \"special treatment.\"", "lang": "en"}
