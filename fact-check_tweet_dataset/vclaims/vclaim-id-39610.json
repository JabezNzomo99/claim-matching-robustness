Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of that claim.\n\n\n\nClaim: Video of a crocodile seen in floodwater during the heavy rains in Patna(Bihar) Fact: The video is that of crocodile seen in the streets of Vadodara (Gujarat). So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the video in the post was uploaded in \u2018Invid\u2019 plugin, many keyframes were obtained. When these were reverse image searched on Google, a certain keyframe leads us to a longer video of that 20 secs clip. That video was uploaded on YouTube on August 4, 2019, by a channel \u2018Gujarat News Live19\u2019 with a Gujarati a title. The English translation of it is- \u2018Due to heavy rains in Vadodara, crocodiles were seen in the floodwaters of the city\u2019. When the keyframes were again subjected to reverse image search with a filter \u2018Vododara floods crocodile\u2019, a photo of the man with a brown T-shirt and a cap seen in the video was found in an article of \u2018India TV\u2019 that reported about National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) jawans catching a crocodile in Vadodara.\n\nThe same man can also be spotted in the articles of other newspapers which published regarding NDRF teams rescuing crocodiles in the flood waters of Vadodara. Those news reports can be seen here and here. \u2018The Hindu\u2019 has reported that a total of 50 crocodiles were rescued in Vadodara by the Wildlife activists during this monsoon.\n\nTo summarise, the video shared as crocodile seen during rains at Patna is actually from Vadodara.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
