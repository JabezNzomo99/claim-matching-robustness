Washington\u2019s estate at Mount Vernon lists this expression on its page of \u201cspurious quotations.\u201d\n\nWhile quotes from the first president are often used to make political arguments, this quote does not originate with Washington. His estate at Mount Vernon has documented so many cases of misattribution that it devoted an entire page to quotes that did not come from him.\n\nSome of these spurious quotations are incorrect portrayals of Washington\u2019s actual statements, or are taken from writings about him rather than works he wrote himself. For this quote in particular, Mount Vernon \u201chas yet to find an explanation for this misquote or a similar quote of Washington\u2019s that was confused for this statement,\u201d its website says.\n\nNeither the quote nor any variation of it appears in Washington\u2019s writings.\n\nThe 2nd Amendment was ratified in 1791, nearly three years into Washington\u2019s first term as president.", "lang": "en"}
