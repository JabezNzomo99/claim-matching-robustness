Prabhakaran according to his Twitter biography is AIADMK IT wing Joint Secretary and his tweets have been retweeted many hundred times.\n\nThe evidence that Prabhakaran offers regarding Kamal Haasan\u2019s website being registered in Cayman Islands is the WHOIS data for Maiyam.com, Maiyam.com Pvt Ltd being a company in which Kamal Haasan is the director. WHOIS information can potentially reveal name, address, phone number etc of a domain\u2019s owner. The operative word here being \u2018potentially\u2019. We\u2019ll see in this post how Prabhakaran\u2019s tweet displays ignorance about certain basics of domain registration. Here, it must also be mentioned that the Kamal Haasan\u2019s official party website is maiam.com and not maiyam.com.\n\nThe WHOIS data of maiyam.com can be seen below with the alleged Cayman Islands link underlined in red.\n\nAs we stated earlier, WHOIS information can potentially reveal name, address, phone number etc of a domain\u2019s owner. However, there are many services which also help domain owners hide their original identity. In this specific case, the circled text in the above screenshot \u201cPRIVACYDOTLINK CUSTOMER 2802196\u201d is an indicator that Maiyam.com is using one such service. A simple google search for PrivacyDotLink leads us to the website of the company which offers this product \u2013 uniregistry.help.\n\nUniregistry describes Privacy.Link as a FREE WHOIS proxy service to registrants with Privacy.Link\u2122 which masks your personal information in the public WHOIS record.\n\nSo, who does this Cayman Islands address on Seven Mile Beach actually belong to? It belongs to Uniregistrar Corp, the company that offers the Privacy.Link services.\n\nThus the allegation that Kamal Haasan\u2019s party website is registered in Cayman Islands is completely baseless. This misinformation was relayed by several people on Twitter. One of the prominent individuals to popularize this was former AAP MLA Kapil Mishra.\n\nFake news site Postcard.news picked up this hoax and published an article titled, \u201cIs Kamal Hassan working with Christian Missionaries of Cayman Islands, is this the main reason for his hatred towards Hindus?\u201c.\n\nKeep checking altnews.in for more such fact-checks.
