We created a $2 trillion deficit by giving 83 percent of the tax cut to the top 1 percent. And now Republicans are proposing to cut Social Security and Medicare to pay for that. That\u2019s not acceptable.\n\nBartiromo is a conservative, and Cicilline is a Democrat. This is yet another example of how Democrats and Republicans talk past each other when they discuss the Trump tax cut, with Republicans looking at the front end while Democrats tend to focus only on the back end.\n\nIn 2018, most U.S. taxpayers can expect some kind of tax cut, according to just about every analysis. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that initially more than 80 percent of taxpayers would get a tax cut, with less than 5 percent getting a tax increase.\n\nSince the wealthy pay most of the income taxes, they end up with most of the tax cuts. (The top 1 percent in 2014 earned 20 percent of adjusted gross income and paid nearly 40 percent of federal taxes, according to the Tax Foundation.) The TPC report shows that in 2018, the top 1 percent would get 20.5 percent of the tax cuts; the top quintile would get 65.3 percent. In other words, that\u2019s not nearly as lopsided as Cicilline asserted.\n\nIn 2027, the study shows, 82.8 percent of the tax cuts will flow to the top 1 percent. The top quintile actually receives 107.3 percent of the tax changes \u2014 because taxes actually increase for the folks in the lowest, second-lowest and middle quintiles. It\u2019s right there on Page 5 of the report.\n\nWhat happened? The individual tax cuts expire over the course of the decade. Republicans structured the tax cut this way to keep the whole package \u2014 especially the corporate tax cut \u2014 in a budget box that allowed only for a $1.5 trillion increase in the federal deficit over 10 years.\n\nThe assumption \u2014 possibly a big one \u2014 is that Congress will vote to extend the tax cuts when they begin to expire, just as most of the George W. Bush tax cuts were extended, with the eventual support of Democrats who had long opposed the Bush-era cuts.\n\nBut in standing his ground in his Fox News interview, Cicilline failed to make clear that he was talking about 2027, the end of the 10-year window. In fact, he confusingly says that \u201cwe need a tax cut for middle-class families, not 83 percent of it going to the top 1 percent, richest people in this country,\u201d which suggests that there is no tax cut now for the middle class. There is one; the question is whether Congress will extend it or even improve it when it starts to lapse.\n\nOther Democrats have been more adept about adding phrases such as \u201cin the long run\u201d or \u201cby the end of the decade\u201d when citing the 2027 data. But Cicilline did not do that in this interview.\n\n\u201cUnder that law, tax cuts for the middle class are temporary,\u201d Luchette said. \u201cDavid supports a permanent middle-class tax cut and repealing the tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations so we can invest in infrastructure. But the stat he cited referred to the law as Republicans and President Trump wrote and enacted it.\u201d\n\nWe have tended to give politicians on both sides of the aisle Two Pinocchios for telling only half of the story of the tax bill. Given past performance by Congress, we would be shocked if lawmakers simply let the tax bill run its course and allowed it to raise taxes on tens of millions of Americans. Moreover, it is important for Cicilline to signal to viewers that he is not talking about this tax year, when many can expect to pay less in federal income taxes. So he earns two Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
