Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Sonia became the world\u2019s fourth richest lady under the Congress rule whereas India became the world\u2019s 4th superpower under the Modi rule Fact: Sonia with the declared assets of approximately Rs. 12 crores (in 2019) is not even Top 25 Richest Women in the World, released by Forbes. Also, there is no Super Power list released by any credible organization. India became the 4th superpower, only in the category of space, after successfully conducting Mission Shakti. Business Insider released a list of Powerful nations in which India stands at 15th position. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe declared assets of Sonia Gandhi can be found through her 2019 election affidavit. In 2014, she had declared assets worth of approximately 9 crores (which is around 1.5 million dollars). In 2019, she declared assets worth around Rs. 12 crores. Sonia Gandhi did not even find a place in the 2014\u2019s Top 25 Richest Women in the World. The 25th Richest Woman on that list has a net worth around 5.2 billion dollars, which is much higher compared to Sonia Gandhi\u2019s assets. So, the claim about Sonia Gandhi being the 4th richest in the world is FALSE.\n\nSome organizations like Business Insider and Huffing Post has placed Sonia Gandhi in top positions on their lists (4th position on the Business Insider list) but they have been contradicted. AltNews, in an article, has analyzed the Business Insider list and concluded that the data on Sonia\u2019s assets have been taken from dubious sources whereas Huffing Post has removed Sonia Gandhi from its list after the backlash and clarified that they could not verify the amount.\n\nComing to the Superpower list, FACTLY did not find any superpower list, but India was termed as the fourth space superpower, after the successful destruction of the satellite under Mission Shakti. When searched for a superpower ranking list, only a list of powerful nations published by Business Insider was found. Also, in that article, India was placed at the 15th position, not at the 4th position.\n\nFinally, Sonia Gandhi is not the world\u2019s 4th richest lady and India was termed as the 4th superpower only in the category of space.", "lang": "en"}
