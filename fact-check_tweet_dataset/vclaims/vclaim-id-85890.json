Nope.", "subtitle": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's office quickly reversed course after being contacted by The Fact Checker.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-01T19:52:02Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85890", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/01/13/300-new-rules-in-one-just-week-by-president-obama-nope/", "vclaim": "The reader did not think that the claim of \u201c300 rules\u201d was possible. The blog post linked to a Daily Caller article, which in turn linked to a government Web site called regulations.gov. Upon close examination, it turned out that the 300 \u201crules\u201d included 277 \u201cnotices\u201d of things such as a meeting scheduled by the National Institutes of Health. There were 31 proposed rules, most of which were minor in nature.\n\nBut a rule is only a \u201crule\u201d when it is issued in final form. The Federal Register, which is a more authoritative source, indicates that between January 1 and January 8, 2015, federal agencies issued a total of 53 final rules and 69 proposed rules. (Here\u2019s a summary from one day, Jan. 5.) Most of these are administrative in nature; only 13 of the 53 final rules were considered \u201csignificant\u201d under Executive Order 12866, issued by President Bill Clinton in 1993.\n\nAmong the standards set by Clinton, as well as the Congressional Review Act of 1996, the federal government is required to identify regulations that could have an economic impact of more than $100 million, but people frequently misunderstand what that means. It does not necessarily mean $100 million in costs; in fact, it can also mean more than $100 million in benefits.\n\nMoreover, other factors can result in a rule being deemed as major, such as: it transfers funds from one party to another (grants are one example); it results in consumer spending; or it sets up fees for federal functions (such as issuing passports). In the Obama administration, 83 major rules were issued in 2009, 100 in 2010, 80 in 2011, 68 in 2012 and 78 in 2013, according to a recent Congressional Research Service report.\n\nSo you can see why our reader was puzzled by the assertion of \u201c300 rules\u201d in just seven days.\n\nWe reached out to Matt Sparks, McCarthy\u2019s press secretary, and asked about the blog posting. Very quickly, he informed us that the blog post had been replaced with a new headline and item, along with a prominent correction:\n\nCorrection: This post has been updated (original title: \u201cOne Week, Three Veto Threats, 300 New Regulations\u201d) to correct for an inaccurate count of regulatory activity in the first week of the new year. The original post stated that the Obama Administration issued 300 regulations in the first seven days of 2015. This count incorrectly included items that have little to no impact on the regulatory burden facing Americans, such as notices and some proposed rules.\n\nCertainly McCarthy\u2019s office should have double-checked before running with \u201cfacts\u201d from an inaccurate article. But this kind of quick and forthright response warms The Fact Checker\u2019s heart. As such, we will not be issuing any Pinocchios.\n\nUpdated: As this column was just going up on the Web, Rep. Lynn Jenkins (R-Kan.) repeated the line about \u201c300 rules\u201d at a news conference. Spokesman Tom Brandt said she had gotten the number from McCarthy\u2019s blog post, but her office also quickly corrected her statement on her Web site.", "lang": "en"}
