The quote is dated from 1987. Reuters could not find any evidence that the former President said this.\n\nExamples can be seen here and here .\n\nThe quote reads: \u201cKeep voting Democrat \u2026 One day they will restrict your freedoms, restrict your history and restrict your safety. All in the name of professional victims that don\u2019t understand the consequences of their ignorance. Ronald Reagan, 1987\u201d\n\nThe claim does not give any source, date, location or the event where Reagan is alleged to have said this. It gives no information besides the year. A Google search of the quote brings up meme pages and social media posts.\n\nThe quote does not exist in any of Reagan\u2019s speeches between 1981 and 1989 (his presidential term) on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library & Museum online archive ( here ). It also does not show up in the quotes and speeches available on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute or the National Archives ( here , www.archives.gov/ )\n\nThe earliest iterations of this claim that Reuters could find was July 2020 ( here , here ). This suggests the fabricated quote stems from a national debate in the U.S. around confederate monuments (\u201crestrict your history\u201d) and pandemic safety precautions like wearing a mask (\u201crestrict your freedom\u201d).\n\nOther fact checkers have also asserted this Reagan quote is unsubstantiated ( here , here .\n\nFalse. There is no evidence to show Ronald Reagan said Democrats would restrict freedoms in 1987.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
