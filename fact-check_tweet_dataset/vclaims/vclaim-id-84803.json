Scott Walker (R) was still a presidential contender. Sykes said that Trump\u2019s claims were false, in particular that under Walker the state had gone from a $1 billion surplus to a $2.2 billion deficit, and he wanted to know if Trump would apologize.\n\nBut Trump blamed Time magazine for the error. He claimed he simply got the figure out of the magazine, and he would only apologize for reading it.\n\nWith the help of a researcher at Time magazine, we came up with an article that might have been the source of Trump\u2019s comment: a March 19, 2015, profile of Walker, which included this line buried in the middle of it: \u201cDue largely to tax cuts under Walker, the state could face a $2 billion shortfall in its projected budget, according to the left-leaning Wisconsin Budget Project.\u201d\n\nNow, first of all, this was not strictly Time\u2019s information; it was attributed to a policy group. Moreover, the figure was not $2.2 billion, which is how Trump frequently expressed it. And it concerns a budget shortfall, not a deficit.\n\nThe only time that the $2.2 billion figure has appeared even on Time\u2019s website is after the magazine published a transcript of the second Republican debate, on Sept 16 \u2014 and quoted Trump as jabbing at Walker: \u201cIn Wisconsin, you\u2019re losing $2.2 billion right now.\u201d He added: \u201cYou were supposed to make a billion dollars in the state and you lost $2.2 billion. You have right now a huge budget deficit. That\u2019s not a Democratic talking point, that\u2019s a fact.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the rub: weeks before Trump uttered the claim at the September debate, fact checkers had already called him out for using it. On July 28, PolitiFact Wisconsin gave Trump a \u201cmostly false\u201d for making this claim in a campaign event. And on July 29, FactCheck.org published an article titled \u201cWisconsin\u2019s Trumped Up Deficit.\u201d\n\nBoth fact checks made similar points: Wisconsin, under state law, is required to have a balanced budget. There had once been a projected budget shortfall of $2.2 billion over two years, back in November 2014, after an earlier projection of a $1 billion surplus. But the shortfall was never a deficit \u2014 because the law requires a balanced budget.\n\nIn other words, Trump\u2019s claim in the debate was incorrectly stated, was based on old information and had already been thoroughly fact checked\n\nMaybe Trump doesn\u2019t understand the difference between a projected budget shortfall and a budget deficit. Maybe he failed to see the fact checks of his statement before he uttered them yet again in the debate.\n\nBut he has no business pinning the blame on Time magazine. (In fact, based at the facts on hand, we doubt Trump got this information from Time.) Time correctly reported the possible shortfall at the time \u2014 but the budget issue had already been resolved two weeks before Trump started spouting this factoid. He had even less reason to repeat it again in the debate weeks later.", "lang": "en"}
