The panda character alternates between holding a burlap sack full of money and a hand-drawn sign that reads, \"I love Obama.\" The ad also features clips of real pandas and high pitched voices making claims about Kander \"pandering\" for money in Washington. To date, the video has less than 12,000 views on YouTube after nearly a month online.\n\nKander, a Democrat, is hoping to unseat Sen. Roy Blunt, a Republican who has held the office since 2011.\n\nAmong the charges in the NRSC ad is the claim that Kander is \"attending fancy dinners all over the country.\"\n\nWe decided sink our claws into this claim.\n\nThe NRSC provided us with a list of five fundraisers they say Kander attended between March 1 and May 31, 2015.\n\nGreg Vonnahme, an associate professor of political science at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, said that most congressional candidates raise most of their money from out of district and even candidates for state office will seek out-of-state sources for funding. He also notes the NRSC itself hosts fundraisers for candidates. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, raised more than half of his campaign funding from out of state in the 2014 election.\n\n\"Given the large sums of money now required to run for the U.S. Senate, it is common for candidates, particularly from smaller, less wealthy states, to attend out-of-state fundraisers,\" Squire said. \"It is also common for the opposing party to attempt to make an issue of it. Challengers running against Senate incumbents face an uphill battle and need all the campaign money they can raise. Kander will raise as much as he can, and Blunt will likely respond by raising even larger sums.\"", "lang": "en"}
