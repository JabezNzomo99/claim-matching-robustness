Let Duterte do his work peacefully,\" said the claim that supposedly quotes Guterres.\n\nThe facts: There is no such quote from UN chief Guterres. The claim was also rehashed, first surfacing at least as early as 2017.\n\nGoogle searches using the text in the claim do not point to official statements or news stories that contain this supposed response of the United Nations or Guterres on investigations into the country's war on drugs.\n\nIn fact, in July 2019, at least two years after the claim surfaced, the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution \u2013 drafted by Iceland \u2013 that lays out a set of actions against the killings in the Philippines, including those in Duterte's war on drugs.\n\nOne of the actions in the resolution requested UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michele Bachelet to \"prepare a comprehensive written report on the situation of human rights in the Philippines.\"\n\nAround the time this claim originally surfaced, the European Parliament had adopted a resolution calling for the release of detained opposition Senator Leila de Lima and for a stop into \"proceedings to reinstate the death penalty.\"", "lang": "en"}
