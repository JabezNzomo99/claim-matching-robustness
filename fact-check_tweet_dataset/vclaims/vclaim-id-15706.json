In the two-minute long video, the man hurling instructions and violating the Code of Conduct, has been falsely identified as Madhya Pradesh BJP MLA Anil Upadhyay on social media.\n\nThe viral video, where the audio has been slowed, is doing the rounds on social media, with the caption, \u201cBJP \u0935\u093f\u0927\u093e\u092f\u0915 \u0905\u0928\u093f\u0932 \u0909\u092a\u093e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092f \u0915\u0940 \u0907\u0938 \u0939\u0930\u0915\u0924 \u092a\u0930 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0915\u0939\u0947\u0917\u0947 MODI \u091c\u0940, \u0907\u0938 video \u0915\u094b \u0907\u0924\u0928\u093e \u0935\u093e\u092f\u0930\u0932 \u0915\u0930\u094b \u0915\u0940 \u092f\u0947 \u092a\u0942\u0930\u093e \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928 \u0926\u0947\u0916 \u0938\u0915\u0947..\u201d\n\n\n\nTranslation: \u201cWhat would be the reaction of Modi Ji regarding BJP MLA\u2019s Anil Upadhyay\u2019s misdoings? Spread the video so much that the entire nation can watch it.\u201d\n\nThe video has been posted by multiple Facebook users.\n\nThe same video has made its way on Twitter as well, where he has been identified as an MLA of the Congress party.\n\nBOOM broke the video into key frames and performed a reverse image search. It led us to a report by Republic TV. The report claimed that the video is of a TMC worker who had entered a pooling booth in Islampur, West Bengal, on April 18, the second phase of the general elections.\n\nWe then looked up for news reports with keywords Islampur and TMC workers and found a longer version of the same video in a news report, where a man wearing a white kurta can be seen instructing voters as they vote. \n\n\n\nWe also observed the video and found that another man, in black pants and a white shirt, was \u2018instructing\u2019 voters in a similar way before the former joined in. Voters, mostly women, could be heard chatting in Bengali. \n\n\n\nWe sent the video to Mohammed Selim, CPI(M) Member of Parliament from Raiganj, who confirmed that the incident took place in his constituency. \u201cThis is originally from the Islampur Assembly segment of my Raiganj Lok Sabha constituency. The white kurta clad man is a TMC Panchayat member.\u201d\n\n\n\nBOOM conducted its own independent checks and found that the man was later identified as Hamizuddin, TMC member of Ramganj panchayat, Islampur. In an interaction with the press, Hamizuddin claimed that he had accompanied his mother and daughters inside the polling booth. He was quoted as saying, \u201cSince the presiding officer was unwell, he took the charge of helping his family out.\u201d \n\n\n\nSelim also added that a complaint has been lodged against Hamizuddin for violating the Election Code Of Conduct.", "lang": "en"}
