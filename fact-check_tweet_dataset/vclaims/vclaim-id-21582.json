The proportion of pupils in \u2018good\u2019 schools has mostly risen, and the proportion of pupils in \u2018requires improvement\u2019 schools has fallen every year.\n\nThere have been much smaller changes in the proportion of pupils in \u2018outstanding\u2019 or \u2018inadequate\u2019 schools, which have risen and fallen a little each year.\n\nSchools are improving, but there are also variations\n\nImprovements in primary schools have been concentrated in deprived areas and those with poor schools. However, the proportion of children in good or outstanding primary schools ranges from 100% in some areas to 69% in the Isle of Wight.\n\nIn secondary schools the gap between the North and Midlands and London and the South East has widened. There\u2019s also much wider variation between areas at secondary than at primary, from 100% in \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018outstanding\u2019 schools in some parts of London to below 50% in other parts of the country.\n\nThe results are affected by Ofsted\u2019s inspection practices\n\nIn 2012 it changed from rating schools \u2018satisfactory\u2019 to \u2018requires improvement\u2019. The majority of secondary schools that were rated satisfactory are now good or outstanding. A fifth have since closed, with more poorly rated schools planning to close. Where they become new academies they\u2019re not counted until the new school is inspected.\n\nOfsted also focuses inspections on poorly performing schools. This means areas with low rating have more opportunity to show improvement and the best ones aren\u2019t routinely inspected. There\u2019s a growing number of outstanding schools where that inspection took place more than nine years ago.\n\nSince we factchecked this, new figures for March 2017 have been released. These show that there are still around 1.8 million more pupils in good or outstanding schools since 2010.", "lang": "en"}
