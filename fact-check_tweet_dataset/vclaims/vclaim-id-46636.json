A native of Salem, Massachusetts, he is best known for books like \u201cThe Scarlet Letter \u201d and \u201cThe House of the Seven Gables.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation searched for the quote in Hawthorne\u2019s collected works, but found no evidence that he ever wrote it. Brenda Wineapple, author of \u201cHawthorne: A Life,\u201d confirmed that the quote was suspect.\n\nThe website Quote Investigator traced the expression back to an 1848 newspaper article that used figurative language to define a series of terms such as love, wealth and happiness.\n\n\u201cHAPPINESS. \u2013 A butterfly, which when pursued, seems always just beyond your grasp; but if you sit down quietly, may alight upon you,\u201d reads the article. The entry was only signed with the letter \u201cL.\u201d\n\nThe quote has also been widely attributed to the New England poet and philosopher Henry David Thoreau over the years, so much so that the Walden Woods Project includes it in its list of misquotations.\n\n\u201cThis quotation, erroneously attributed to both Thoreau and Nathaniel Hawthorne, was written by the social worker, author and speaker, J. Richard Lessor,\u201d reads the project\u2019s website. \u201cAlthough it doesn\u2019t appear in any of Lessor\u2019s books, it was published on motivational posters in the 1970s produced by Argus Communications.\u201d\n\nWhile there is no evidence that Hawthorne ever coined the saying, it is thematically similar to a passage found in one of his notebooks that compares the pursuit of happiness to a \u201cwild-goose chase.\u201d\n\n\u201cHappiness in this world, when it comes, comes incidentally,\u201d reads the passage. \u201cMake it the object of pursuit, and it leads us a wild-goose chase, and is never attained. Follow some other object, and very possibly we may find that we have caught happiness, without dreaming of it; but likely enough it is gone the moment we say to ourselves, \u2018Here it is!\u2019 like the chest of gold that treasure-seekers find.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
