A spokeswoman for the publication told the Daily Caller the image has been doctored. FiveThirtyEight\u2018s average of Nevada primary polls has Sanders in second place with 20.7 percent support.\n\nThe Facebook post, which has been shared more than 1,900 times, attempts to paint The New York Times in a negative light, suggesting that the publication put out an article with a misleading headline about Democratic Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2018 performance in Nevada primary polls.\n\n\u201cSanders Loses Third Place Spot in Nevada to Buttigieg,\u201d reads the alleged headline. (RELATED: Do Only 25% Of Americans Support Impeachment, As Trump Claims?)\n\nA subheadline below that says, \u201cAs the senator rises to first in the polls, Buttigieg claims a strong lead behind Elizabeth Warren.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that The New York Times ever published the article shown in the Facebook post. A search of The New York Times archive turned up no matching or similar headlines.\n\n\u201cIt is a doctored screenshot,\u201d said Danielle Rhoades Ha, the vice president of communications at The New York Times, in an email to the Caller. \u201cThe New York Times did not write or publish the story.\u201d\n\nFiveThirtyEight shows former Vice President Joe Biden leading with 26.9 percent support in an average of Nevada Democratic primary polls, followed by Sanders at 20.7 percent and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 14.7 percent. The same average of polls puts South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg in fourth place with 8.2 percent support.\n\nThe Nevada Democratic presidential caucuses will take place on Feb. 22, 2020, according to the Nevada Secretary of State website.", "lang": "en"}
