We\u2019ve asked Vote Leave for more details of the updated figures, but haven\u2019t heard back. Newer data for 2014/15 sent to us by HMRC suggests the figure is still about 5%. This data isn\u2019t public.\n\nBusiness for Britain\u2019s figures are calculated from sales lists that VAT-registered companies have to submit to HM Revenue and Customs for goods or services supplied to VAT-registered businesses in the EU.\n\nThis data won\u2019t count all businesses exporting to the EU, but Business for Britain argues this data would account for the majority of exporters, as large companies\u2014which will be VAT registered\u2014are the most likely to export.\n\nWe asked HMRC, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and the Office for National Statistics if any of them knew how many non-VAT registered businesses export, and so whether this data does account for the majority of exporting businesses. None of them had any figures on this.\n\nSo it isn\u2019t possible to say for certain whether this data accounts for the majority of exporters to other EU countries.\n\nThe 2014/15 data shows that 110,400 VAT-registered businesses exported to other VAT-registered businesses in the EU in that year. That\u2019s 5% of all VAT or PAYE registered businesses in 2015.\n\nStronger in refers to estimates for the total number of businesses trading with the EU\u2014including companies both importing and exporting. We\u2019ve got more on this here.", "lang": "en"}
