This is false; Clinton\u2019s spokesman, her lawyer and court records say the case heard that week was about a public records request, and that she is not on trial.\n\n\u201cDid anyone realize Hillary Clinton is on trial for Bengazi this week or does the media have you blinded by riots?!?!?!\u201d reads a June 3, 2020 Facebook post, referring to protests that spread nationwide after the death of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer, some of which devolved into looting and vandalism.\n\nSimilar posts are available on Facebook here and here and on Twitter here and here.\n\n\u201cShe is not on trial,\u201d Clinton\u2019s spokesman, Nick Merrill, told AFP in an email.\n\nIn September 2014, Judicial Watch, a conservative foundation, sued the State Department to compel compliance with a Freedom of Information Act request seeking \u201cany and all records concerning, regarding, or related to notes, updates, or reports created in response to the September 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.\u201d\n\nThe information sought has expanded since the lawsuit was filed, and on March 2, 2020, US District Judge Royce Lamberth granted Judicial Watch\u2019s request to depose Clinton \u201con matters concerning her reasons for using a private server and her understanding of State\u2019s records management obligations.\u201d\n\nThe arguments heard Tuesday, June 2 at the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit were a petition to remove that order, according to Clinton\u2019s attorney, David Kendall, and Merrill.\n\nKendall said in an email: \u201cShe was not even a party to the... case until last fall, when she intervened to be heard on the issue (of) whether her deposition should be taken. It\u2019s just a Freedom of Information Act case.\u201d\n\nThe only issue at hand is whether Judicial Watch received all the documents it is entitled to from the US Department of State -- not Clinton herself -- Kendall said.\n\nThe full audio recording of the June 2 arguments is available here.\n\nThe US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit in August granted Clinton\u2019s petition to prevent the deposition.\n\nA September 6 Facebook post claimed Clinton was scheduled to go to court again on September 9.\n\n\u201cHILLARY CLINTON GOING TO COURT ON 9/9/2020 (AGAIN),\u201d the post reads in part.\n\nThis is false; Kendall told AFP in an email that he had \u201cno idea what this claim is referring to.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were no legal proceedings of any kind involving former Secretary Clinton on September 9, 2020.\u201d\n\nFour Americans died in the 2012 Benghazi attack.\n\nThe US House of Representatives Benghazi Select Committee and Department of State inspector general\u2019s office completed publicly available investigations into the State Department\u2019s handling of the attack.", "lang": "en"}
