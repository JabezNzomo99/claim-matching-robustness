Using the current ingredient list (which differs slightly from the one used in the viral tweet), two of the 18 Beyond Meat burger ingredients also appear among the 28 in the vegan grain-free dog food:\n\nIn the case of the Beyond Meat burger comparison, both use peas as their source for protein. Indistinguishability is perhaps in the eye of the beholder, but significant differences do exist between the burger-ingredient lists and the dog-food lists.\n\nA broader question, though, is what scientific point does such a comparison serve? One could make a similar argument that the ingredients in high-quality, organic beef dog food are \u201cnearly indistinguishable\u201d from canned beef chili served in the supermarket, but such a comparison wouldn\u2019t be all that illustrative. Indeed, like the Beyond Meat burger and the vegan dog food, the chili and the beef dog food both use the same protein source.\n\nWe asked Mitloehner, who studies chemical emissions from animal agricultural practices and who has served as an expert witness defending the agricultural industry in the U.S. Congress, what scientific point he was illustrating with his tweet. Via email, he told us his concerns were with how the plant-based burgers were marketed:\n\nThese plant-based alternatives are often marketed as burgers made from plants. In reality, they fully qualify for the NOVA definition of \u201cultra-processed foods,\u201d of which many (or most) nutrition scientists, dietitians and clinicians warn us constantly. The claim of them being more healthy and/or wholesome than real meat is not supported by facts. These patties are as ultra-processed and consist of almost identical ingredients as dog kibbles. If you compare the three, you might have had a hard time identifying the dog food yourself, right?\n\nAsked about his interest in the topic, Mitloehner told us it stemmed from \u201cthe many media requests I receive about plant-based products including several [media appearences] alongside [Impossible Foods founder] Pat Brown and [Beyond Meat founder] Ethan Brown and the many factually incorrect claims they make about animal agriculture, which often otherwise go unchallenged in the media.\u201d\n\nThe original conceit behind these plant-based burgers was one of sustainability: being able to produce something that tastes like meat using a process that could scale up and still be sustainable. As an example, this is why the Impossible Burger uses GMO yeast to produce a protein \u2014 heme \u2014 that could theoretically be produced by widespread soy cultivation. The amount of soy required to produce heme would not be sustainable in the long-run. (Beyond Meat does not use GMO products and does not include the protein heme, which is touted as the key to Impossible Burger\u2019s taste.)\n\nThese burgers are indeed often marketed as a healthy alternative to meat, and that assertion is a bit muddier. Pound for pound, meatless burgers have comparable amounts of protein, and Impossible Burgers have the same (or more) vitamins, and minerals added, according to Harvard Medical School\u2019s Health Blog:\n\nOn the negative side, these plant-based burgers also contain comparable, if not elevated, amounts of saturated fat, which can contribute to heart disease. Additionally, Mitloehner\u2019s point about the level of processing in plant-based burgers is a valid one \u2014 many of the ingredients are heavily processed and appear to meet international standards for ultra-processed food \u2014 generally considered to come with a host of nutritional deficiencies.\n\nIn sum, there are shared chemicals in vegan dog food and plant-based burgers. In our view, two shared ingredients out of a combined 46 (in the case of Beyond Meat) or 10 shared ingredients out of a combined 48 (in the case of the Impossible Burger) do not meet the threshold for being \u201cindistinguishable,\u201d and as such we rank the claim mostly false.", "lang": "en"}
