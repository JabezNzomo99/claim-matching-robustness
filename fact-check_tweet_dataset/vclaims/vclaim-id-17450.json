Why the Russian government agency targeted the UN humanitarian official\u2019s statement remains unclear since Cutts did not mention Russia or the Syrian regime in his politically neutral remarks.\n\nIn his statement made on July 5 in Gaziantep, Turkey, Mark Cutts said, he was \u201chorrified by the ongoing attacks on civilian areas and civilian infrastructure\u201d in northwest Syria.\n\nThe United Nations has recorded 29 incidents involving attacks on 25 health facilities, transport and personnel, as well as 45 attacks on schools since the end of April, the statement said.\n\n\u201cShelling and air strikes, including the use of barrel bombs, in Idleb, western Aleppo and northern Hama have now become a way of life for over two months. Over 300 civilians have been killed. Thousands more have been injured,\u201d Cutts said.\n\nThe RIA-FAN article then turned to recent news coverage by the U.S. networks CBS and Fox News, claiming the American journalists of these two television networks \u201cafter arriving in Syria without obtaining accreditation from the Syrian authorities cooperated with the terrorists\u201d from the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) alliance, who \u201cprovided the journalists with guided tours and covered their illegal activities.\u201d\n\nThe Idlib province in northwestern Syria is not governed by the Bashar Assad\u2019s regime and it is false to claim that reporting from these territories without the regime\u2019s accreditation is illegal. The latest reports by CBS and Fox News do not mention interaction with the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, however reportedly, Idlib is controlled by the rebel groups including the HTS.\n\nHayat Tahrir al-Sham, also referred as the Levant Liberation Committee, is a merger of several Salafist jihadi groups including the al-Nusra Front among others.\n\nIn March 2017, the United States designated HTS a terrorist organization affiliated with al Qaeda in Syria (AQS). Thus, RIA-FAN\u2019s claim that the West is willing to provide the terrorists with freedom to act is misleading.\n\n\"Idlib is essentially the largest collection of al-Qaida affiliates in the world right now,\" Michael Mulroy, deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, said in May speaking at the Center for a New American Security in Washington.\n\nOn June 30, U.S. military forces struck an al Qaeda training camp in Idlib, resulting in the deaths of several AQS leaders, who U.S. Central Command said were \u201cplotting external attacks threatening U.S. citizens, our partners and innocent civilians.\u201d\n\nThe RIA-FAN then quoted the head of the Plekhanov Academy\u2019s political science and sociology department Andrei Koshkin, accusing U.S. President Donald Trump of defending the terrorists in Idlib in his current public message. That claim is also false -- the U.S. president urged to stop killing civilians.\n\nHere is what Trump posted on Twitter: \u201cHearing word that Russia, Syria and, to a lesser extent, Iran, are bombing the hell out of Idlib Province in Syria, and indiscriminately killing many innocent civilians. The World is watching this butchery. What is the purpose, what will it get you? STOP!\u201d\n\nOn July 6, Reuters reported, at least 544 civilians, including 130 children have been killed, another 2,117 people injured \u201cin the hundreds of attacks carried out by Russian jets and the Syrian army since a Russian-led assault on the last rebel bastion in northwestern Syria began two months ago.\u201d\n\nOn July 7, the UN Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) said that at least seven children were killed in \u201cyet another airstrike\u201d on Saturday against displaced civilians in the village of Mhambel, in the outskirts of Idlib, in northwest Syria.\n\nOn June 27, the heads of 11 global humanitarian organizations warned that the embattled rebel-held province of Idlib in Syria, \u201cstands on the brink of disaster, with three million civilian lives at risk, including one million children.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to bring public attention to the disaster they launched a social media campaign \u201cIDLIB, SYRIA #TheWorldIsWatching.\u201d\n\nOn June 3, Human Rights Watch (HRW) released a report detailing the use of internationally prohibited weapons by Russia and Syria in Idlib province.\n\n\u201cThe Syrian-Russian military alliance is using a cocktail of internationally banned and indiscriminate weapons on a trapped civilian population,\u201d said Lama Fakih, acting Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. HRW specifically cites the use of \u201cbanned cluster munitions and incendiary weapons\u201d and \u201cbarrel bombs.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussia has abused its position at the UN Security Council to protect itself and its ally in Damascus, and to continue these abuses against civilians,\u201d Fakih warned.\n\nThe abundance of verifiable data on the civilian death toll in Idlib provided by different and independent from each other groups, organizations and governments proves Koshkin\u2019s claims to be false.", "lang": "en"}
