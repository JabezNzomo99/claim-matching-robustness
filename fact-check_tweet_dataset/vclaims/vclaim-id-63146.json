Andrew Cuomo formally signing a state-wide \"stay-at-home\" order on March 20 that banned all non-essential businesses from conducting in-office work and stopped all \"non-essential gatherings of individuals of any size for any reason.\"\n\nYet a photo shared on Facebook April 2 showed an overcrowded NYC subway car along with a caption that seemed almost unbelievable during a time of extreme social distancing:\n\n\"This is NYC#2 train this afternoon!!!! And their mayor and governor wants to blame trump!!!! Damn what a disgrace!!!! Spread this far and wide!!!!\"\n\nThe image was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nIn this case, the post isn\u2019t far off \u2013 the image is real and was taken just three days earlier, during rush hour on a Bronx-bound train on March 30.\n\nThe photo was posted that evening on Twitter by user Hiam Abbas, who wrote:\n\n\"4:30 PM today, #2 BX bound train. Trains are infrequent. All cars were this crowded. Social distancing? Containment? Essential workers are at risk.\"\n\nAbbas\u2019 post includes another photo of an overcrowded train, this one heading into Manhattan during the morning commute.\n\nWith ridership plummeting and fewer crew members working, New York\u2019s Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced implementation of its \"essential service plan,\" which aims to to help move healthcare workers, first responders and essential personnel while scaling back train and bus service overall; some lines are running on modified schedules and others aren\u2019t running at all.\n\nBut public transit is a commuting lifeline for many essential workers, and the reduction in service can make it difficult to maintain the social distancing that health officials recommend.\n\nThe MTA responded to Abbas\u2019 photo on Twitter, saying it would be \"escalated to supervision for investigation.\"\n\nIn an interview with the news channel New York 1 that same day, Mayor Bill de Blasio said fewer people are riding the subway, so this kind of problem isn\u2019t typical. He said subway cars can get overcrowded sometimes due to a train breaking down or a service delay, but he also concluded that crowding on trains was \"not acceptable.\"\n\n\"I understand people are trying to get somewhere, but no one should be getting on a crowded train,\" de Blasio said. \"Spread out throughout the train. Wait for the next train.\"\n\nAccording to a report by the New York Times, although overall subway ridership is down 87%, the steepest declines have occurred in richer neighborhoods.\n\nManhattan, which has a median income around $80,000, saw a 75% decrease in ridership, the Times reports, while the Bronx, where the median household income is about $38,000, saw only a 55% decrease.\n\nThe post is off on the date of the photo, but only by a few days; it was taken well into New York\u2019s stay-at-home order.
