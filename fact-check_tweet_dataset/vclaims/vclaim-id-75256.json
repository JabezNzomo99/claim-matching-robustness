These handles mostly retweet official verified BJP accounts and tweets from senior BJP leaders, however some of these fake accounts take aim at opposition parties. The below tweet has now been deleted but we took a screenshot while it was visible.\n\nThe fake accounts also tweet life advice and quotes that are meant to be inspirational.\n\nThe accounts impersonating Ram Nath Kovind are not verified with followers in the range of about 1000 to 6500. One of the fake accounts @iRamnathKovind has a pinned tweet that urges his/her followers to retweet if they want to see him become the next president of India. The account was created on June 14, 2017.\n\nWhen BOOM questioned the authenticity of the account, it suddenly disappeared.\n\nBut the handle soon reappeared as @KatrinaKaifPost. BOOM had earlier followed @iRamnathKovind to keep track of its tweets and when @KatrinaKaifPost surfaced, it already showed us as following the account.\n\nLike @iRamnathKovind, @KatrinaKaifPost was also created on June 14, 2017 leading us to conclude that it is run by the same person.\n\nAnother fake account @ramnathkovind's Twitter description says 'NDA Presidential Candidate'. This account was created on January 26, 2016 in New Delhi.\n\nOther handles like @ramnkovind seem to be crafting an image of Kovind's public persona. The account @ramnkovind was created on June 19, 2017.\n\nThe person operating the handle seems to have forgotten that there is still an election pending.\n\nFake account @RamnathKovind_, whose Twitter description reads as 'Official Account Of RamnathKovind Governor of bihar . Presidential candidate of NDA ' was created on June 19, 2017 in New Delhi.\n\nBJP president Amit Shah announced the name of Bihar Governor Ram Nath Kovind as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA's) presidential candidate on June 19th. Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is extremely Twitter savvy has not tagged a single Ram Nath Kovind account, in his tweets about BJP's nominee.\n\nFake handles on Twitter are a menace and are skewing the political debate apart from spreading fake news in India. Earlier this week, BOOM wrote a story on how several fake Twitter accounts were defending Rajathan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje's tweet on the lynching of Zafar Khan. Some of these accounts have since been deactivated.", "lang": "en"}
