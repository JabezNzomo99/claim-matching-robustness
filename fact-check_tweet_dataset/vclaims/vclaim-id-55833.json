Trebek, who has been diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, is alive \u2014 and there is no evidence he is \u201ca fervent Trump supporter.\u201d\n\nTelevision game show host Alex Trebek has faced health problems since being diagnosed in March 2019 with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, which has a five-year survival rate of 1%. However, he has responded well to chemotherapy, and on March 4, 2020, he shared an update on the one-year anniversary of his diagnosis. He revealed on April 14 that he has written a memoir set for publication in July.\n\nHowever, a bogus article announcing his death has been shared around 4,700 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle data.\n\nThe story falsely claims that Trebek has died at the age of 80 \u201cas a result of complications\u201d \u2014 though it doesn\u2019t specify any \u201ccomplications.\u201d And it claims Trebek has left his estate to President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nThe story also calls Trebek \u201ca lifelong Republican and a fervent Trump supporter\u201d who stated that leaving his estate \u201cestimated to be valued at 100 million dollars\u201d to Trump\u2019s reelection campaign was \u201c\u2018the best thing I can do for the future of my grandchildren.'\u201d\n\nThe article was created by America\u2019s Last Line of Defense \u2014 a network of satirical news websites, including conservativetears.com, where the Trebek story was originally posted. The Trebek story is clearly labeled as a \u201cdeath hoax\u201d on the original website, and there are several signs in the story itself that it\u2019s not true. For example, \u201cSenator Joe Barron\u201d \u2014 who doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 is quoted as saying that \u201cfacts don\u2019t matter and none of this is real to me,\u201d and a link to support Trump\u2019s campaign leads to a gif of a grimacing Trebek.\n\nHowever, the article has been republished and shared on Facebook without a satire label.\n\nThe phony story doesn\u2019t even get Trebek\u2019s age right. He is 79, and will turn 80 in July.\n\nMoreover, we could find no evidence that Trebek is \u201ca lifelong Republican and a fervent Trump supporter.\u201d In a 2018 interview with Vulture, Trebek described himself as an independent. He recounted a conversation he had with Fox News host Sean Hannity where he stated, \u201cI\u2019m a social liberal and a fiscal conservative.\u201d\n\nTrebek has not said much about Trump. In 2016, Trebek commented that the primary race was \u201cvery disappointing on both sides\u201d and again labeled himself as an independent.\n\nIn the Vulture interview, he said that Trump \u201cpicks on people,\u201d and that if the president were to appear on Jeopardy, \u201c[h]e might not agree that any of the correct responses are correct.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
