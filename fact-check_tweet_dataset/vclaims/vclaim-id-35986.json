The message posted along with the video claims that a child-kidnapping gang is active in Jodhpur and an alleged chid-lifter was nabbed by the police. Facebook page \u2018Blue City Jodhpur\u2019 shared the same video with the claim mentioned above. In the video, a woman can be heard alleging that the man had attempted to kidnap her child.\n\nOne Pawan Sankhla shared the video with a similar narrative.\n\nThe same video has also been published on YouTube.\n\nUpon closely looking at the video, Alt News found that it was shot at Jodhpur railway station.\n\nWith a keyword search on Google, we found a report published by ETV Bharat, according to which, the said incident took place on August 30, 2019. As per passers-by, a child\u2019s mother had raised an alarm after seeing her child being air-lifted by the man, and subsequently, the crowd nearby beat him up, believing him to be a child-lifter, and later handed him to the police. In their investigation, however, GRP police didn\u2019t find any such incident taking place.\n\nSpeaking to the media outlet, GRP police officer Ravindra Bothra said that the person used to beg for alms for a living at the railway station. No incident of child-kidnapping on Jodhpur railway station has come to light, he added.\n\nA News18 report gives the same details as ETV Bharat while adding that the police investigation found that the man was inebriated and had fallen victim to child-kidnapping rumours.\n\nAlt News contacted Government Railway Police (GRP) Jodhpur. Duty Officer Ramdin also confirmed that the man wasn\u2019t a child-kidnapper. \u201c[In the video] home guards appointed by the Railway Protection Force were escorting the man. He was dressed as a woman and was drunk. So they had brought him to the police. He is not a child kidnapper, we spoke to his family. He is a resident of Nagaur district. We were told by the family that this man has a habit of dressing up as a woman since childhood.\u201d We were also told that man was produced before the court for disturbing the peace in a drunken state. He has been sent to jail, stated the ETV Bharat report.\n\nIn conclusion, a video of a man dressed as a woman, detained by the police, is being shared on social media with false child-kidnapping rumours.", "lang": "en"}
