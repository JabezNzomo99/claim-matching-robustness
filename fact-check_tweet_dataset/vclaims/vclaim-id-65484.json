However, Dr Vikas Maurya, director and head, department of Pulmonology & Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh told The Quint that while the technology used in oximeter can be put in any device, if the phone does not have the required technology, an app alone cannot measure the oxygen levels. Further, the app in question has now been taken down from Google Play Store. The message goes on to describe the process of measuring the oxygen levels via the said app. This includes placing the finger on the rear camera, then \u201ctouch, measure, hold the finger until measurement is complete, reading will display on the screen.\u201d The message also mentions the link of the app. Several users have shared the message on Facebook and Twitter. You can view the archived version here. You can view the archived version here. The Quint received a query on the claim made in the message on its WhatsApp helpline.\n\nTo begin with, the app in question has been taken down from Google Play Store. We also got in touch with health experts and cyber experts to know if it was possible to measure the oxygen level using an app. APP ALONE CANNOT HELP IN MEASURING OXYGEN LEVEL: PULMONOLOGIST Dr Vikas Maurya, director and head, department of Pulmonology & Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh told The Quint, \u201cThe oximeter has two wavelengths, that is, infrared and red. The chips used in oximeters are really small and if the developers/manufacturers are able to put the exact technology in the phone, then it is possible. But if you don\u2019t have the technology, an application cannot do this alone. It\u2019s not sufficient to just have the app.\u201d Bharat Biotech Vaccine Available From 15 August? Not So Fast! Further, Dr Sumit Ray, a critical care specialist in Delhi NCR said that the the likelihood of detecting oxygen level through app is very less because it wouldn\u2019t be able to pass infrared light to measure your oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin. \u201cThe pulse oximeter uses infrared light to differentiate between oxygenated haemoglobin and deoxygenated haemoglobin and that\u2019s how it calculates the oxygen saturation. That\u2019s probably not possible through the app,\u201d he added.\n\nWHAT IS A PULSE OXIMETER AND HOW DOES IT WORK? Now, let\u2019s understand what is the purpose of a pulse oximeter and how it functions. A tutorial on the website of World Health Organisation (WHO) mentioned that a pulse oximeter is composed of a sensor (probe) and monitor with the display. While speaking to The Quint, Dr Vikas Maurya said that there is blood flow in the nail band of the fingers and the haemoglobin present there which basically carries the oxygen, sends out a wavelength which is seen on the monitor. \u201cAll pulse oximeter probes (finger or ear) have light emitting diodes (LEDs) which shine two types of red light through the tissue. The sensor on the other side of the tissue picks up the light that is transferred through the tissues,\u201d the WHO website mentions. How will a technology like that work in a mobile application? NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT SMARTPHONES RELIABLE FOR MEASUREMENT: STUDY Meanwhile, a study conducted by Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine on whether smartphone apps should be used as oximeters for clinical purposes, found that there is no evidence that the said technology can yield accurate results. \u201cThere is no evidence that any smartphone technology is accurate for the measurement of blood oxygen saturation for clinical use. Furthermore, the scientific basis of such technologies is questionable. Oxygen saturation levels obtained from such technologies should not be trusted in the clinical assessment of patients,\u201d the study noted. Trisha Greenhalgh, Professor of Primary Care, University of Oxford and one of the authors of the study also tweeted the same. NEW rapid review by me (small clinical/ editing role) and Lionel Tarassenko, Professor of Electrical Engineering (major bioengineer role):\n\n\n\nQ: Can smartphone apps be used to measure oxygen saturation?\n\nA: No.https://t.co/iIQqi66tUM \u2014 Trisha Greenhalgh \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00b7 #BlackLivesMatter (@trishgreenhalgh) April 2, 2020\n\nThe study noted that a pulse oximeter requires the measurement of light transmission from the finger at two different \u2013 red and infrared. Regarding a specific set of Samsung galaxy series, the study mentioned that the phones had a red light emitting diode (LED) in the phone in addition to the flash light and camera, \u201cbut it appears from publicity material on YouTube that it worked via a single-wavelength measurement (albeit with a monochromatic light source, the LED) and therefore that oxygen saturation could not be accurately derived from it.\u201d Telangana Police, too, issued a statement of its official social media handles cautioning the public that this could be another COVID related cyber crime and can steal your personal data. \u201cNote that, your index finger (fingerprint) is used for various personal data authentication. Especially, for eWallet transactions and as an alternative to password for screen lock and apps. It is risky, as these apps ask us to keep our finger on camera to compute the oxygen levels, where it can be misused by the hackers to steal our fingerprints,\u201d it added. No, Kapil Sibal Never Said \u2018He Will Die if Ram Mandir is Built\u2019\n\nHowever, the explanation, regarding stealing data by placing a finger on the camera, provided by the police doesn\u2019t really add up. Sai Krishna Kothapalli, an alumni of IIT Guwahati who founded Hackrew, a cyber security startup based out of Hyderabad, told The Quint, \u201cIf you are clicking a picture of your finger, then it will have enough clarity that you can get your fingerprint stolen like somebody can get the fingerprint data. But if you are directly placing it on the camera, then camera wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything at all.\u201d Evidently, a viral message falsely claimed that an app can yield reliable results in measuring oxygen levels amid COVID-19 pandemic.", "lang": "en"}
