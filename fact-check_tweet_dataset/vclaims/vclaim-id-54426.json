It has the customer address as \u2018XXXX(Customer name) 12-24/Z, Pasha bhai ki dukhan kan aake puchlo, Salim Lala kidhar rehte, seedha ghar tak lake chodte. Charminar- 500002 Hyderabad\u2019. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Photo of a Flipkart delivery package with a funny customer address as \u2018Charminar Hyderabad\u2019. Fact: The photo is not original. It is an edited one. In the original photo, the delivery package has the customer address as- \u2018XXXX(Customer name) 448 Chaoth mata mandir, mandir ke samne aate hi phone laaga lena mein aa jaunga, Shivpura.. Kota-324010 Rajasthan\u2019. So, the package has the address of \u2018Kota, Rajasthan\u2019 not \u2018Charminar, Hyderabad\u2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen we searched on Google with keywords, an article of \u2018India Today\u2019 was obtained in the search results. The article had a tweet by a Twitter user with a similar photo of the Flipkart package. When we observed both the photos, all the details on the package (like product code, return address, amount of package, date) are the same except for the \u2018customer address\u2019. In the photo posted in the tweet, the address is hilarious too and is as follows \u2013 \u2018XXXX(Customer name) 448 Chaoth mata mandir, mandir ke samne aate hi phone laaga lena mein aa jaunga, Shivpura. Kota-324010 Rajasthan\u2019. The photo with the same address as \u2018Kota, Rajasthan\u2019 can also be seen in other news articles which can be read here, here and here. So, the package has the customer address as \u2018Kota, Rajasthan\u2019 not \u2018Charminar, Hyderabad\u2019. Hence the posted photo is an edited one.\n\nThe same photo with the customer address as \u2018Kota, Rajasthan\u2019 was also posted by \u2018Flipkart\u2019 on Twitter.\n\nTo sum it up, the image of a package with a funny customer address as \u2018Charminar, Hyderabad\u2019 is photoshopped.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
