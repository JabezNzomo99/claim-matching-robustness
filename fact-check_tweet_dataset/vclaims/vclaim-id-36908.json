The original sign makes no reference to political party and instead says \u201cLancaster County.\u201d\n\nThis post attempts to criticize the Democratic Party by associating it with the hate group, and while the party historically had ties to the Klan, particularly in the Deep South, the sign being held has been digitally altered.\n\nIn the original photo, found on Getty Images, the sign says \u201cLancaster County.\u201d However, it reads \u201cWomen of the Democrat Party\u201d in the image on Facebook, even though the official party name is the Democratic Party. All the other aspects of the image, including the shadow featured on the lower left and the individuals in the upper right background, are the same as the original.\n\nThe photo shows female members of the KKK from Pennsylvania who came to Washington, D.C., likely for a march. The photo was taken in the 1920s, at a time when many women had organized women\u2019s chapters of the KKK, known as the WKKK.\n\nAccording to sociologist Kathleen Blee, \u201cFrom 1923 to 1930, women poured into the Klan movement to oppose immigration, racial equality, Jewish-owned businesses, parochial schools, and \u2018moral decay.'\u201d (RELATED: When Did Black People Get The Right To Vote?)", "lang": "en"}
