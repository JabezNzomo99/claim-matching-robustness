Obviously, Hanks couldn\u2019t have been in custody in Australia at that time. The bottom two photographs appear to show nothing more than the hem or cuff from his pant leg.\n\nOther photographs from the same time and place don\u2019t provide any convincing evidence of Hanks\u2019 having an ankle bracelet on one of his legs, either. It also makes no sense that Australian authorities have would arrested Hanks on a serious charge, placed him in custody, and deemed him a \u201cflight risk,\u201d then turned him loose to return to the U.S. a few weeks later with no precaution other than a monitoring bracelet.\n\nPhotographs of Hanks taken more recently, in June and July 2020, captured the actor wearing shorts and sandals, and clearly showed he was not sporting an ankle bracelet.", "lang": "en"}
