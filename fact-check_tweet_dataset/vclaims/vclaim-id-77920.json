It was originally shared with the caption \u201cOctie Churro taking a stroll on the beach in his new, revamped body and dynamics model\u201d as well as several hashtags indicating that this was a digital animation, such as #cgcreature, #creatureanimation, #cgrender, and #animation.\n\nA few days prior to posting the above-displayed video, ghost3dee shared another video that showed an in-progress version of \u201cOctie Churro.\u201d\n\nWhile the above-displayed video does not show a genuine octopus moving quickly across a sandy beach, this animation isn\u2019t entirely far-fetched. The Abdopus aculeatus, for example, a small octopus found off the northern coast of Australia, can temporarily leave the water in order to travel small distances across land.\n\nThe following video from the BBC appears to show A. aculeatus moving from pool to pool across the beach at low tide, hunting for crabs:\n\nThe animal kingdom is full of such \u201coddities.\u201d We\u2019ve previously written about spiders that can swim, fish that can \u201cwalk,\u201d and groundhogs that can fly. OK, we made that last one up.", "lang": "en"}
