Abubakar has\n\n(about US$ 7 million) libel suit against Onochie for the tweet.\n\nThe claim is also made in what looks like a\n\nof the 4 May 2019 edition of\n\n, with the headline \u201cAtiku on UAE watchlist\u201d. The image has been shared\n\nBut a number of clues suggest the front page image is fake.\n\nThe headline typeface and design is significantly different from those of\n\nof Gulf News.
