Kamala Harris is the aunt of former \u201cEmpire\u201d actor Jussie Smollett. Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker were in contact with Smollett shortly before his alleged attack, it also claims.\n\nThe Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any familial connection between Smollett and Harris. There is no evidence Smollett was in contact with either senator before the alleged incident.\n\nSmollett, who is black and gay, was indicted for a second time in February on charges of filing a false police report that he was attacked by two men who beat him up and shouted racist, homophobic slurs. He previously faced similar charges but saw them dropped by Chicago prosecutors in early 2019.\n\nThe Facebook post offers a conspiracy theory that Harris, who originally called the alleged attack an \u201cattempted modern day lynching\u201d but later said she was \u201csad, frustrated, and disappointed\u201d by developments in the case, is Smollett\u2019s aunt. It also creates a dubious link between the actor and Booker, who initially offered support to Smollett, claiming Booker and Harris were in contact with him just before the alleged attack.\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that Harris and Smollett are related in any way. (RELATED: Is Chelsea Clinton Married To The Nephew Of George Soros?)\n\nThe surname of Smollett\u2019s mother was Harris before marriage, according to California birth records, but her first name, Janet, doesn\u2019t match that of Harris\u2019 only sibling. Maya is the name of Harris\u2019 sister, according to their mother\u2019s obituary. No connection between Smollett and Harris\u2019 husband, Douglas Emhoff, could be found.\n\n\u201cWe have no information on Mr. Smollett being related to Senator Harris,\u201d Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told FactCheck.org.\n\nThe post\u2019s claim that Smollett was in contact with Harris and Booker shortly before the alleged attack on the actor doesn\u2019t hold up either. If they had been in Smollett\u2019s phone records, major media outlets would have picked it up, yet no news organizations have reported about it.", "lang": "en"}
