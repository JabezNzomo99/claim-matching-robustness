There is no evidence to suggest the tags are used to track those who wear such products.\n\nIn recent weeks, social media platforms have been replete with misinformation regarding RFID tags found on some Victoria\u2019s Secret clothing items, with one Facebook post saying, \u201cSo the person who created and runs victoria secret buys people\u2019s souls and he has something to do with the sex trafficking going on. Did you know that if you cut your tag in half, there is a chip/tracker on the inside.\u201d\n\nVictoria\u2019s Secret, like many other retailers such as Nike and Macy\u2019s, does use RFID technology to track inventory in some stores, according to several media reports. However, there is no indication that these tags are used to track the movements of people who wear the products.\n\n\u201cLike many other retailers, this technology helps us deliver a great store experience by ensuring we have the right products available for our customers,\u201d a Victoria\u2019s Secret spokesperson said in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation. \u201cWe only use this technology in our back room and sales floors to help us manage inventory so that our associates can efficiently support our customers\u2019 needs.\u201d\n\nThe small barcode-like RFID tags only work if they are within an approximately 15-foot range of an in-store RFID reader, according to The Associated Press.
