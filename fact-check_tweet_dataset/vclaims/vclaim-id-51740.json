So this must be fake news\u201d the CBN official explained.\n\nAlthough the Interswitch group did not respond to numerous communication from The FactCheckHub, a tweet made by its support handle @iswsupport on August 4, noted that the organisation is still operating.\n\n\u201cInterswitch\u2019s operations continue to function in spite of the pandemic. You can make transfers, withdrawals, pay on the Quickteller and use your verve card,\u201d the payment system tweeted. \u201c\n\nIt added that all our services are working and issues will be resolved promptly.\n\nEarlier in April, the Twitter handle of Quickteller, a payment product of Interswitch had debunked a similar variation of the claim in question. The tweet which was accompanied by several screenshots of the claim termed it as \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\nFrom the information presented above both claims are FALSE.", "lang": "en"}
