Physical confrontations between anti-racism demonstrators and counter-protesters broke out during one such protest on June 13 near Waterloo Station in London, according to CNBC.\n\nThe image being shared shows a bloodied man lying on the ground while another man, dressed in what appears to be a sweatsuit, stands close by. The caption claims the image depicts the aftermath of the bloodied man being attacked with \u201cmetal spikes.\u201d\n\nBut, contrary to the post\u2019s claim, the two black lines circled in the image aren\u2019t \u201cmetal spikes,\u201d but rather part of the alleged attacker\u2019s clothing.

Other pictures taken from different angles by Leal-Olivias make it clear that the supposed \u201cmetal spikes\u201d are the drawstrings on the man\u2019s pants, not a weapon. The man wearing the sweatpants does not appear to be holding anything in his fist.\n\nThe captions of AFP photos depicting the incident do not mention \u201cmetal spikes\u201d at any point. We rate this claim false.", "lang": "en"}
