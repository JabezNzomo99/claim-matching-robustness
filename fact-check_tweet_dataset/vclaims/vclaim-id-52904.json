Message provides a list of medicines", "author": "www.thequint.com", "date": "2020-06-16T18:17:19+05:30", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-52904", "url": "https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/doctors-advice-for-covid-19-patients-at-home-fact-check", "vclaim": "Dr Sumit Ray, a critical care specialist in Delhi NCR also agreed with this and told The Quint that there is no evidence that the suggestions like turmeric etc can help in the treatment of COVID-19.\n\nDr Ray stressed that no person should self-medicate as was suggested in the message and said that if one had persistent cough, they should see a doctor and could need hospitalisation. Further, he said that suggestions like getting an X-ray or an ECG and self-medicating on the basis of those was also dangerous.\n\nWith regard to the drugs mentioned in the message such as azythromycin (Tab Azee) and hydroxychloroquine (Tab HCQS), Dr Chatterjee said that these are to be prescribed depending on the need and clinical condition of the patient. No patient should himself decide the line of treatment and it has to be done under the guidance of a COVID-treating doctor, he further stressed.\n\n\u201cIt is not that there is a list of medications and that a person takes depending on what has been written,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further added that nowadays, according to the ICMR suggestions, azythromycin is not combined with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a home modality of treatment, since both have cardiac side-effects. Only HCQ is being given, according to the most recent recommendations of ICMR, and only under the supervision and monitoring of a doctor.", "lang": "en"}
