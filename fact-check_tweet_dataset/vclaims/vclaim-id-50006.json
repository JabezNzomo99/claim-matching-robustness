The claim is misleading; a police spokesperson said that \u201cno such dye has been used\u201d; a criminal justice expert also told AFP the practice was phased out in 2015.\n\nThe post was published here on Facebook on June 13, 2020. It has been shared more than 7,000 times.\n\nThe claim reads: \u201cSouth Korean police shoot the crowd with purple dye, then spend the next week arresting the protestors. Who\u2019s all in favor? And that\u2019s how you do it.\u201d\n\nThe post was also shared on Facebook here, here, here, here, here, and here.\n\nA Korean National Police Agency spokesperson denied the claim, telling AFP by phone on July 6, 2020: \u201cNo such dye has been used in protest control\u201d.\n\nIn the past, however, South Korean police have used dyes in water cannons to target protesters.\n\nThis Associated Press video of a 1998 pro-unification rally and this Getty Images photo of a 2008 rally against a state visit of former US President George W. Bush's show police firing water cannons laced with yellow dye.\n\nBlue dye has also been used by police. The Hankyoreh, a South Korean newspaper, reported on blue dye being used in this 2008 report about anti-US beef protests and South Korean news agency Yonhap reported on the same practice being used in this 2011 report on an anti-police brutality protest.\n\nKeyword searches for purple dye on the South Korean search engine Naver, however, yielded no results.\n\nKyung-Seok Choo, a US-based associate professor of Criminal Justice & Economic Crime at Utica College and president of the Korean Society of Criminology in America, told AFP that South Korean police have stopped using such dyes.\n\n\u201cKorean police occasionally used yellow or blue dye against protests and unlawful assembly from 2008 to 2011,\" Choo said in an email on July 10, 2020.\n\n\u201cSince 2011, police stopped using dyes not because of social issues related to the dyes but because of its effectiveness to control the protests. No dye supplies have [been] distributed since 2015 at all.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
