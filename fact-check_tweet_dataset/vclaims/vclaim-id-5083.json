Immigration Minister James Brokenshire told Parliament that the UK has granted asylum to \"more than 4,000 Syrians\" since the start of the crisis.\n\nThe immigration statistics bear this out. From the beginning of the Syrian crisis in early 2011 to the first quarter of 2015, almost 4,200 Syrian refugees were granted asylum in the UK in the initial decision made on their application.\n\nA further 100 people were allowed to stay in the UK through humanitarian protection or discretionary leave.", "lang": "en"}
