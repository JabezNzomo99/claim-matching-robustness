Trump told reporters at the White House:\n\nBeyond the event\u2019s potential threat to attendees\u2019 health, critics including high-profile Democrats and historians saw the announcement as a call to white supremacists during a national reckoning over racism following the death of George Floyd for two reasons: Tulsa is home to one of the worst acts of racial violence in American history \u2014 the 1921 Tulsa race massacre \u2014 and the event\u2019s originally scheduled date of June 19, or Juneteenth, is a day in many communities that traditionally celebrates the end of U.S. slavery in 1865. So two days after the initial announcement from the Trump campaign, the president yielded to that backlash and said he would delay the event and instead hold it on June 20. He tweeted:\n\nBut as critics pointed out, the massive gathering still held the potential to expose large numbers of people to COVID-19. As if to confirm the danger, reports appeared saying the Trump campaign was asking attendees to agree in advance not to hold the campaign liable for coronavirus exposure:\n\nTo investigate the claim that attendees were asked to agree to a liability waiver, we went through the steps of reserving a spot at the Tulsa rally in the days before the event. To receive a digital ticket for the event, attendees had to complete the following form:\n\nAt the bottom of the registration page, the following text appeared:\n\nIn other words, to reserve an entry ticket for the Tulsa rally, people had to agree that they would \u201cassume all risks related to exposure to COVID-19\u201d and agree not to sue Trump or any organizers of the event if they got sick. That agreement essentially clears the campaign of any responsibility should attendees catch the virus.\n\nAt first, campaign leaders declined to elaborate on their plans to protect attendees\u2019 health once they were at the event. Then, on June 14, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters that attendees should wear masks. And campaign manager Brad Parscale said the following day that event organizers will hand out hand sanitizer and face masks (though they\u2019re not necessarily required) and check attendees\u2019 temperatures for fevers. He tweeted:\n\nStill unclear is if, or to what extent, the event will promote social distancing. It\u2019s possible people will stand or sit less than six feet apart from each other, despite recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to avoid that close of contact with people to prevent the virus\u2019 spread. Additionally, as of June 16, the CDC urged everyone to wear cloth face coverings when they leave their homes, stating on its website:\n\u2022 Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus\u2026\n\u2022 Continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others. The cloth face cover is not a substitute for social distancing.\n\nConsidering the ongoing health risks due to COVID-19 and an upward trend in cases statewide, Tulsa Health Department Director Bruce Dart said he would rather the president hold the event at a later date. He told Tulsa World:\n\nAs of June 15, Oklahoma had tallied 359 deaths and 3,417 non-fatal cases due to the virus.\n\nThe Trump campaign had last held a big rally on March 2 in Charlotte, North Carolina, before much of the country shut down to curb the pandemic.\n\nIn sum, given the substantiating evidence that, in order to receive a ticket for the Tulsa event, people must click a box agreeing they would not hold the Trump campaign or event organizers liable should they catch COVID-19 at the June 20, 2020, rally, we rate this claim \u201cTrue\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
