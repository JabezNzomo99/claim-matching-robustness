Ted Cruz, a Koch puppet. He was just bribed by the Kochs to introduce a bill that would gift or sell them and their allies America\u2019s national forests, parks, and other public lands and open them for mining, drilling, fracking and logging.\"\n\nDemocratic Party forces, , Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, often assail the billionaire Koch brothers, Charles and David, pro-Republican Kansas industrialists who have plowed millions of dollars into influencing elections and government.\n\nPolitiFact in April 2014 a statement by Reid that the Koch brothers together are the richest people in the world. The same month, PunditFact a claim the brothers spent three times what the top 10 labor unions expended in the 2012 elections. An apples-to-apples comparison was undoable, but an independent analysis of trackable federal data found organizations tied to the Kochs spent three and a half times what unions did that year. Earlier in April, a claim by , CEO of the privately held Koch Industries, Inc., that it was only in the past decade he realized the need to \"engage in the political process.\" Records showed him giving tens of thousands to candidates and political committees prior to 2004 while collectively, his brother and their company\u2019s PAC had donated $7 million to candidates and political committees.\n\nIn Cruz\u2019s Senate office, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier confirmed Cruz this summer offered a proposal, which wasn\u2019t acted on, for the federal government to shed excess lands, but she said in an email the Occupy Democrats statement \"looks like nothing more than politically charged rhetoric with no facts to back it up.\"\n\nOccupy Democrats didn\u2019t offer evidence of Cruz getting money or another benefit to introduce his proposal.\n\nBut Omar Rivero, the group\u2019s founder and a for the Florida House, said by email the Texan elected in 2012 had fielded campaign contributions from groups fueled by the Kochs, including the , which describes itself as the nation\u2019s \"leading free-enterprise advocacy group.\" The group has been Cruz\u2019s top donor, giving more than $705,000 of his $18.1 million in contributions, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Government , which says Koch employees and the company\u2019s PAC to Cruz, placing Koch 26th among the senator\u2019s most-generous givers.\n\nRivero told us Occupy Democrats analyzed Cruz\u2019s amendment via a July 10, 2014, on the pro-Democratic ThinkProgress.org website stating Cruz sought to force the government to hand prized lands in the West to home states that would be forced to burden state taxpayers with the costs of managing the lands or, more likely, sell or give away the lands for mining, drilling and logging.\n\n\"We consider it bribery,\" Rivero said, \"when a shadowy, wide-reaching corporate interest political machine like the Kochs\u2019 bankrolls a U.S. senator\u2019s political operation and then that same senator turns around and supports a major piece of legislation desired by those corporate interests.\"\n\nWe looked over the amendment, contacted a Koch spokesman and asked advocates familiar with Cruz\u2019s proposal about this claim.\n\nIn July 2014, Cruz as a change to authored by Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., the Bipartisan Sportsmen\u2019s Act of 2014; neither survived.\n\nCruz\u2019s proposal said land under the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal Interior and Agriculture departments in any state shouldn\u2019t exceed half the state\u2019s land area. In states where those agencies do control more than half the land, Cruz proposed, the government should sell the \"excess\" land at auction or transfer it to the state. His amendment called for auctions or transfers to take place by 2020.\n\nFrazier of Cruz\u2019s office said he offered the amendment, as he had once before, because \"he believes in principles of small government and like many conservatives, feels that federal ownership of land in the states should be limited so that the federal government does not own more than half of the land in any state.\" Asked the precise origin of the idea, Frazier said: \"It came from him. He thinks the federal government should get out of the landlord business.\"\n\nLike many companies, Koch Industries lobbies in Washington, according of federal records by the CRP, and it spent $5.4 million lobbying there from January through June 2014, just before Cruz offered his proposal.\n\nKoch lobbyists reported interests in nearly 50 topics including appropriations to the Interior and Agriculture departments, the center, though the company any lobbying related to Hagan\u2019s proposal.\n\nTo our inquiry, Rob Tappan, a Washington, D.C.-based spokesman for Koch Public Sector, part of Koch Industries, said by email the Kochs had no position on Cruz\u2019s amendment nor, he said, did it lobby the issue or contact Cruz\u2019s office to discuss it.\n\nExperts familiar with Cruz\u2019s idea said they were unaware of information confirming the Occupy Democrats\u2019 claim. Each also said it's not a novel idea to reduce the amount of federally owned land.\n\nBroadly, Jessica Goad of the Colorado-based , which says it \"promotes responsible policies and practices, and ensures accountability at all levels to protect land, water, and communities in the American West,\" told us it\u2019s not novel for legislators or members of Congress to advocate the sale or transfer of federal lands. Cruz\u2019s amendment, she said by phone, \"is in line with the anti-government, anti-establishment tone of that side of the (Republican) party.\"\n\nCuriously, Goad said, Cruz\u2019s proposal would limit the transfer or sale of \"excess\" lands to the states of Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Nevada and Utah, the only states where more than half the land is federally controlled. She emailed us a Nov. 14, 2008, Heritage Foundation map of the U.S., drawing on federal data, showing the share of federally owned acreage by state. (Uncle Sam owns 2 percent of the land in Texas, the map indicates.) And how did the federal government end up with so much land in some of the states? Goad showing that as a condition of joining the U.S., western states agreed to give up any stake in otherwise unclaimed lands in their respective boundaries.\n\nGoad said the concept of transferring or selling off federal lands has been promoted by right-leaning groups. By email, she pointed out a for state legislatures from the American Legislative Exchange Council, urging Congress to convey title of federal public lands to the states. An ALEC summary says: \"Currently, huge swaths (over 50 percent) of the land in our nation\u2019s western states are controlled by the federal government making it impossible for states to tax this land to fund education, grow state economies and generate high-paying jobs. Further, federal control prevents the states from accessing the abundant natural resources contained on these lands.\"\n\nBy phone, Alan Rowsome of the Wilderness Society, which as the \"leading American conservation organization working to protect our nation\u2019s shared wildlands,\" said he had no information on the Kochs touching off Cruz\u2019s proposal, which Rowsome described as a \"blunt instrument\" to shift lands to states or auctions instead of leaving decisions to designated federal agencies. He said, too, there\u2019s no certainty under Cruz\u2019s amendment that the trims of federal lands would lead to drilling for oil and gas or to forests being cleared. \"It is not a mandate of the legislation,\" he said.\n\nBrian Mullis, a Cato Institute spokesman, put us in touch with Shawn Regan of the Montana-based , a think tank which says its scholars have \"documented how government regulation and bureaucracy often led to environmental degradation.\"\n\nBy email, Regan said Cruz\u2019s proposal reflected \"a sentiment in many western states that local control of public lands is more desirable than management by distant federal bureaucracies.\"\n\nOf note, Regan said, three states affected by Cruz\u2019s proposal -- Idaho, Nevada and Oregon -- are not oil-and-gas rich. He noted too that under the proposal, the secretaries of Agriculture and Interior would be responsible for identifying acreage to be auctioned off or transferred. Regan speculated: \"These almost certainly would not be national parks, wilderness areas, or other \u2018pristine\u2019 federal lands, but would likely be lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management or Forest Service\u2014many of which are already managed for logging, grazing, and energy development.\"\n\nOccupy Democrats said Cruz \"was just bribed by the Kochs to introduce a bill that would give them and their allies America\u2019s national forests, parks, and other public lands and open them for mining, drilling, fracking and logging.\"\n\nIf excess federal lands were put up for auction, as possible under Cruz\u2019s amendment, anyone including the Kochs could perhaps purchase the lands and then, as the owners, possibly chop down trees, drill for oil and the like.\n\nAll this said, this group failed to provide (nor did we find) evidence of a bribe or any Koch-linked inducement causing Cruz to present his proposal nor did we find confirmation his proposal came about so pristine federal lands could be exploited.\n\nCampaign contributions aren\u2019t bribes and suspicions aren\u2019t facts. We rate this unsupported and ridiculous claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
