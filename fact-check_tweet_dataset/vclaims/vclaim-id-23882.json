Republican leaders who control the state Legislature have said the bill is going nowhere.\n\nBut that proposal prompted a Twitter exchange that caught our eye.\n\nFormer state Rep. Adam Jarchow, R-Balsam Lake, retweeted coverage of the proposal July 16, 2019, calling it \"non-sense\" and insisting elected officials should draw maps. When another user asked if he felt gerrymandering is an issue, the two-term lawmaker responded:\n\n\"My answer is the same as it\u2019s been for 250 years in this country. Elected officials draw maps. That\u2019s it. If people don\u2019t like how they drew them, kick them out of office.\"\n\nHmm. Are elected officials really the only people who draw district maps in the U.S.? Or are there other ways to do it?\n\nGiven the attention on this issue will only grow in the coming year, we decided to check it out.\n\nWisconsin is currently a classic example of gerrymandering, or manipulating legislative boundaries for partisan gain.\n\nAmid one legal challenge to the maps, a federal court said the Wisconsin maps drawn in 2011 were among the most heavily skewed to one party of any plan in the country going back more than 40 years. We rated Mostly True a 2017 claim that Wisconsin was the most or second-most gerrymandered state in the country.\n\nAfter the 2010 Census, Republicans \u2014 who controlled all of state government \u2014 drew lines that created an out-sized number of GOP districts in a state that is otherwise pretty evenly divided between Democrat and Republican voters. The November 2018 election laid the disproportionate boundaries bare.\n\nAcross the 99 elections for the state Assembly, Democrats garnered 53% of the votes, compared to 45% for Republicans, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission. But that overall advantage yielded only 36 Democratic seats in the Assembly, compared to 63 for Republicans.\n\nThat\u2019s because the GOP-imposed boundaries clustered Democratic voters together while Republicans wound up with smaller but hard-to-overcome majorities in other districts. The Democratic winners averaged 90% of the vote in Fall 2018, while Republican winners averaged 63%.\n\nMeanwhile, a Marquette University Law School poll earlier this year found 72% of Wisconsinites support having a nonpartisan commission draw the maps \u2014 including a majority of both parties.\n\nMost states have legislators draw boundaries, but not all\n\nWisconsin\u2019s approach redistricting is the most common nationally, but it is far from the only option.\n\nAs of December 2018, state legislatures were responsible for drawing state district maps in 30 states, often subject to a veto by the governor. (Wisconsin is among those granting the governor veto power, which means the state Legislature may need a more cooperative approach than the all-GOP process that yielded the current maps.) Four of those states have a backup commission, however, that draws the maps if the Legislature deadlocks or the governor issues a veto.\n\nBut that number is shrinking.\n\nRedistricting reforms have put maps in the hands of a commission of some kind in Colorado, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Ohio and Utah since 2010, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy institute at the New York University School of Law.\n\nNew Hampshire passed a bill to move to an independent commission, but it was vetoed Aug. 9, 2019, by the Republican governor.\n\nAll told, 20 states now use some type of commission or nonpartisan agency to draft of state legislative maps. The commissions are often nominated by leaders of both parties. Some states give them final say, others make the commission\u2019s maps subject to approval by the Legislature or governor.\n\nEleven states currently give the Legislature no direct role in drawing or approving the state legislative boundaries, according to the Brennan Center. That number will grow to 13 in 2021 when new laws in Ohio and Michigan take effect.\n\nThe breakdown is similar for how congressional districts are drawn, aside from the seven states that have only one district.\n\nJarchow did not reply to requests for evidence of his claim. An attorney in Polk County in northwestern Wisconsin, Jarchow left the state legislature in January 2019 after losing a special election for a state Senate seat and serving two terms in the Assembly.\n\n\u2018Kick them out of office\u2019\n\nJarchow concluded his claim with an oft-heard response to political criticism, that voters who don\u2019t like it can elect for new lawmakers.\n\n\"Even in wave election years you don\u2019t see that much change,\" said Michael Li, senior redistricting counsel at Brennan. \"The whole point of gerrymandering is to make sure seats don\u2019t flip, and we have proof from around the country that this works if you draw districts right.\"\n\nIn 2018, only 28% of the congressional districts that flipped to another party nationwide were from states where maps were drawn by legislatures \u2014 even though the majority of states use that system.\n\nJarchow, a Republican, said amid a redistricting discussion that \"elected officials draw maps. That\u2019s it.\"\n\nState legislatures still draw the majority of maps around the country. But a growing number of states have turned to an independent or bipartisan commission of some kind to establish legislative boundaries.\n\nEleven states currently give the Legislature no direct involvement in drawing or approving maps.", "lang": "en"}
