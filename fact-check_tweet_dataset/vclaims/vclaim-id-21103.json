The government\u2019s calculation is including benefits these people receive that aren\u2019t directly related to their health condition, like housing benefit and income support.\n\nThis is a claim about total spending, it doesn\u2019t tell us very much about how individuals in receipt of these benefits are affected or will be in the future, or how eligibility for benefit payments has changed in recent years.\n\nIt is possible to find out how many people receive each type of benefit and how much of it they receive, but as people can receive more than one benefit this won\u2019t reflect the actual experiences of many.\n\n\u00a351 billion is forecast to be spent this year\n\nThe government is forecast to spend \u00a351bn on this in in 2017/18. That\u2019s forecast to go up overall in real terms until 2021/22.\n\nThis includes benefits which are paid wholly to disabled people and people with health conditions such as industrial injuries benefits, personal independence payment (PIP) and employment and support allowance (ESA). Others are paid wholly to carers such as carers allowance.\n\nSome of the money included in the government\u2019s calculation comes from the portion of spending on certain benefits which goes to disabled people and people with health conditions or their carers (although the benefits are not exclusively for them). This includes a portion of housing benefit and income support.\n\nGovernment spending on benefits for people with disabilities, health conditions and their carers makes up about 2.5% of GDP and 6.4% of total government spending and is forecast to be around that until 2021/22.\n\n\n\nSo what about spending on specific benefits for disabled people?\n\nIt\u2019s also possible to calculate how much the government spends just on the benefits which go wholly to disabled people and people with health conditions.\n\nThe government spent \u00a339 billion on disability, incapacity and industrial injury benefits in 2017/18. That\u2019s 76% of the total \u00a351 billion spent. This is also forecast to continue rising until 2021/22.\n\n\n\nSpending on the main disability benefits (DLA, PIP, and attendance allowance) is also forecast to increase in real terms from \u00a323 billion in 2015/16 to \u00a325 billion in 2021/22.\n\nThe claim originally dates back to 2012. Then it referred not just to benefit spending but other support, such as adult social care, free travel and home adaptations, as well.", "lang": "en"}
