Dianne Feinstein said, \u201cOne day the American people will know their place, and they will stop thinking they deserve the same privileges as us.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any record of Feinstein saying the quote.\n\nFeinstein has been a vocal proponent of gun control. For instance, she was the architect behind the now-expired Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 that prohibited the manufacture of certain semi-automatic firearms and limited magazines to 10 rounds. She and other Democrats also introduced an updated version of the bill in 2019.\n\nThe California senator did once possess a permit to carry a concealed weapon but, per a spokesman from her office in 2012, she dropped the permit, according to The Hill. (RELATED: Did Democrats Introduce A Bill To \u2018Euthanize Seniors\u2019 To Save Social Security?)\n\nThe viral Facebook post alleges Feinstein made the comment while talking about her concealed carry permit. There is, however, no record of her saying, \u201cOne day the American people will know their place, and they will stop thinking they deserve the same privileges as us.\u201d\n\nSearching resources like her congressional website and the congressional record turned up no matching or similar statements. It appears on neither her social media nor ProPublica\u2019s archive of her deleted tweets. Media outlets have also not attributed the quote to her.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a fake quote has been attributed to Feinstein. In May 2019, a meme falsely quoted her as saying, \u201cWhen the gunman realizes that nobody else is armed, he will lay down his weapons and turn himself in \u2026 that\u2019s just human nature.\u201d\n\nFeinstein\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment.", "lang": "en"}
