The claim that this will reduce fishermen\u2019s incomes by 40% is based on a quote from an unknown source on a Cornish local news website.\n\nThere\u2019s no credible source for the 40% figure\n\nWe asked the Brexit Party where the 40% figure came from and it directed us to an article about a visit MEPs Ann Widdecombe and Christina Jordan made in June to Newlyn, a fishing town in Cornwall.\n\nThe article said: \u201cA pressing concern from the quayside is a new directive from the EU to do with net mesh sizes, intended to protect the cod stock but will in fact stop our fishermen catching squid too and some claimed it could lose up to 40% of their income from just this one ruling.\u201d\n\nNo further background is given about the claim and we can\u2019t find evidence of it anywhere else. The news outlet confirmed to us that a fisherman told them the figure during Ann Widdecombe\u2019s visit, but they were unable to provide any further details.\n\nThe mesh is the space between four pieces of crossing twine in a fisherman\u2019s net. The mesh size is the \u201cmaximum possible opening between two opposite knots\u201d when the mesh is stretched out. The minimum mesh size is regulated\u2014the larger the mesh the easier it is for small fish to escape nets undamaged. Of course, this size depends on what species fishermen are trying to catch.\n\nA 2014 briefing from the European Parliament\u2019s own research service called the rules on mesh sizes and fishing equipment \u201ca complex set of EU regulations\u201d.\n\nA minimum mesh size was introduced in some areas from 1 July\n\nEU regulation has recently changed in this area, and the legislation was adopted by the European Commission at the end of 2018.\n\nThe regulation was changed using something called a \u2018delegated act\u2019. This is where the Commission can adopt new laws without the vote of the European Parliament or Council.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s power to adopt delegated acts are subject to limits. The European Parliament and Council have to authorise the Commission to adopt delegated acts in the first place, and delegated acts cannot change essential elements of the law.\n\nThe European Parliament and Council had two months to object to the delegated act on fishing regulations, but this didn\u2019t happen so it is now law. It\u2019s also now in UK law.\n\nThe UK was one of the EU member states that developed and submitted recommendations on the new act to the Commission.\n\nThe Marine Management Organisation (MMO) which is the England and Wales marine activities regulator, told us that the changes to mesh sizes came into force for the Celtic Sea on 1 July 2019. It added that the changes for the Celtic Sea in particular were \u201cdesigned to reduce unwanted catches of cod and haddock primarily\u201d.\n\nThe MMO added that it was \u201caware of the implications of these new measures for small scale fisheries such as those targeting squid seasonally and are working with the fishing industry and [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] to find solutions, whilst still ensuring the measures achieve their objectives\u201d.\n\nThe MMO also wrote about the new rules on its website. It said part of the change is that \u201clarger regional baseline mesh sizes will be introduced\u201d but that \u201csmaller mesh sizes for certain fisheries are allowed\u201d. These are minimum sizes so fishermen could use larger mesh if they want to.\n\nThe MMO says that most minimum sizes of fish and areas where fishing is restricted remain the same.", "lang": "en"}
