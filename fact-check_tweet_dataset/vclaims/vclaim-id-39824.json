Subsequently, several media outlets reported the representational video as \u201creal\u201d footage or \u201cevidence\u201d of the IAF\u2019s airstrike in Pakistan.\n\nRepublic TV played the footage as \u201cIAF\u2019s Balakot proof\u201d. Its consulting editor Major Gaurav Arya welcomed the IAF\u2019s move and said, \u201cit is high time we start speaking about what we have done\u2026in today\u2019s world where social media and mainstream media are so active, it was also a weapon of war\u2026I have not seen the video but I am aware of its content\u2026They should make more such videos and spread awareness among the people and also amongst the enemies because they have been fed a certain diet of propaganda\u2026\u201d\n\nIronically, while neither the anchor nor Arya mentioned that the video is representational in nature, the channel flashed \u201cpromotional video\u201d a few times on the screen while also terming it \u201cproof\u201d of Balakot airstrike.\n\nABP Newscalled the video \u201cexclusive footage\u201d and asserted, \u201cPakistan used to say that only trees were fallen but you can see the extent of damage caused by the IAF in terrorist camps\u2026this video is proof. (translated from Hindi)\u201d However, a disclaimer flashed by the channel for a fraction of a second, inadvertently or not, specified that the video is promotional.\n\nZee Newsalso carried the misinformation. Its tweet and article headline called the video the \u201cfirst footage which gives proof\u201d of Balakot airstrike. Zee News has now updated their story with the article correctly reflecting \u201cpromotional\u201d however, a clarification for the same was not provided.\n\nZee MP-Chhattisgarh and Zee Uttar Pradesh Uttarakhand called the footage \u201cexclusive video\u201d. Oneindia Hindi called it \u201cevidence\u201d of IAF\u2019s attack.\n\nPunjab Kesariwrote a headline in Hindi \u2013 \u201cAirstrike video released. See how we entered Pakistan and killed terrorists.\u201d The word \u201cpromotional\u201d found a subtle mention inside the article.\n\nA PTI copy published by media outlets like Firstpost and Business Standard claimed, \u201cAhead of the press conference, the IAF also showed video clips of the Balakot strikes.\u201d The word \u201cpromotional\u201d appeared nowhere in the article.\n\nGujarati media outlets Gujarat Samachar and TV9 Gujarati also carried reports with no mention of \u201cpromotional\u201d in their titles. While the former claimed in its article that the video was indeed promotional but included \u201creal\u201d footage, TV9 Gujarati asserted throughout its report that the video depicted the actual airstrike. Incidentally, the YouTube and Facebook posts by the channel mentioned the word \u201cpromotional.\u201d\n\nA few Marathi media outlets \u2013 News18 Lokmatand Loksatta \u2013 also gave credence to the misinformation.\n\nA broadcast by India Today, while terming the video \u201cpromotional\u201d, also called it \u201cproof\u201d of Balakot airstrike.\n\nThe Tribune\u2019sAjay Banerjeedescribed the footage as \u2013 \u201cgraphic shot of its [IAF] planes destroying terror camp at Balakot.\u201d\n\n\u201c.@IAF_MCC releases Balakot video. \u2018Doubters\u2019 didn\u2019t believe PM @NarendaModi. Will they also doubt Uniform?,\u201d tweeted Times Now with a poster of its daily prime time show with Rahul Shivshankar.\n\nA defence correspondent with WION, Sidhant Sibal, tweeted that the Air Chief clarified during the press conference that there were \u201cno shots of Balakot strikes in the video.\u201d\n\nBBC journalist Jugal R Purohit also ascribed similar statements to the Air Chief in a tweet.\n\nANI had uploaded the footage released by IAF, specifying that it is a promotional clip showcasing the Balakot aerial strike.\n\nA representational video released by the IAF on the occasion of Air Force Day, due October 8, was broadcast by a plethora of mainstream media outlets and their regional branches as the actual footage of Balakot airstrike. While most of these news organisations failed to mention \u201cpromotional\u201d video, the word found a scanty mention inside some of the reports, with the headlines not specifying the same. Ironically, a few other media outlets broadcast contradictory reports \u2013 terming the footage \u201cproof\u201d of the attack on one hand and also calling it \u201cpromotional\u201d on the other.\n\n[Update: A misleading tweet by Times Now, posted after this fact-check was published, has been added to the story.]", "lang": "en"}
