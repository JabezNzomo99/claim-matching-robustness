The questioner had asked Sanders about his defense of the VA after the 2014 scandal over wait-time data manipulation: \u201cAt the time, you went so far as to call it manufactured scandal by the Koch brothers to promote the privatization of government healthcare. We need someone who would fix the issue, not ascribe blame.\u201d\n\nThe Koch-backed group is Concerned Veterans for America, or CVA, one of the most vocal critics of the VA since wait-time allegations first surfaced (and were later confirmed by the VA Inspector General). In 2015, CVA commissioned a bipartisan task force that proposed drastic changes to the VA.\n\nThe crux of the proposal is to split up the current Veterans Health Administration\u2019s payor and provider responsibilities by creating two new entities, one for health insurance and another for health delivery. The proposal would give veterans the choice to receive subsidized private care and would create a new, nonprofit government corporation to oversee the VA\u2019s medical facilities.\n\nThe proposal to create the independent entity is what politicians often call \u201cprivatization,\u201d which usually refers to a complete outsourcing of government services to a private industry. But the new corporation would be modeled after Amtrak, which is not a private entity. It would receive congressional appropriations, be run by a board appointed by Congress and be subject to congressional oversight.\n\nThere are elements in the plan that open up veteran health care to the private market. But when people \u2014 especially politicians \u2014 talk about \u201cprivatization,\u201d they usually refer to the wholesale outsourcing of government services to the private industry. That does not accurately describe CVA\u2019s proposal.\n\nThe Fact Checker Recidivism Watch tracks politicians who repeat claims that we have previously found to be incorrect or false.
