The claim is false; the Amazon does not have a president; Duterte\u2019s spokesman told AFP they had not received any requests for help from any of the countries affected by the fires in the Amazon rainforest; the doctored CNN screenshot was created by a meme generator.\n\nThe doctored image of a CNN report was published here in a Facebook post on August 27, 2019. It contains a purported screenshot of a CNN broadcast hosted by anchor Wolf Blitzer which combines a supposed photo of Duterte with a Breaking News ticker saying: \u201cPresident of Amazon asked help from Rodrigo Duterte\u201d.\n\nUnderneath the screenshot is text saying: \u201cWhy is this not being reported in Mainstream media?!\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe misleading post\u2019s Tagalog language caption translates to English as: \u201cWow! The president of the Country of Amazon!\n\n\u201cApproached our beloved President Rody Rodrigo Duterte Roa Duter30 to ask for help\n\n\u201cWhy did the Mainstream Media did not report on this? WE KNOW WHY! THEY ARE YELLOWS!!! YELLOW SHIT\n\n\u201cLIKE if you support the Federation Government\u201d.\n\n\u201cPresident Rody Rodrigo Duterte Roa Duter30\u201d refers to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte who was elected in May 2016.\n\nHe is also known as \u201cRody\u201d, and \u201cDuter30\u201d is used as a hashtag by his supporters on social media, for example here.\n\n\u201cYellows\u201d is a pejorative term used to describe the supporters and members of the Liberal party, the main political opposition.\n\nThe Federation government refers to the Philippines\u2019 shift to federalism, which Duterte has pushed for.\n\nThe post has also been shared on Facebook here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim the Amazon asked Duterte for help is false. There is no country called \u201cAmazon\u201d. \n\n\n\nThe Amazon is an area spanning Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana, which contains \u201chalf of the planet\u2019s remaining tropical forests,\u201d according to the World Wildlife Foundation here.\n\nParts of the Amazon rainforest have been burning over the summer, prompting many countries to offer help. Here is an AFP report about the fires.\n\nA reverse image search on Google for the image in the misleading post found this site which creates memes. The template shows an identical image of Wolf Blitzer seen in the misleading posts, with a different doctored CNN banner.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the website:\n\nPresidential spokesman Salvador Panelo told AFP Duterte had not received any requests for help from the heads of any of the countries affected by the Amazon fire.\n\n\u201cNone,\u201d he said in a phone call on September 11, 2019 when asked this question: \u201cHas President Rodrigo Duterte received any request for help from any of the countries affected by the fire in the Amazon?\u201d", "lang": "en"}
