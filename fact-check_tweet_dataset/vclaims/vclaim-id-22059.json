From Gujarati JAIN family joined U S.Army. during last leg of his selection at field exam. During one of the toughest drill training final test. Salute to his drill \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc47\u201d, claimed one Chandrakala Kadam while posting the video on Facebook. As per the post, the man seen in the video is from a Gujarati-Jain family and his name is Nirav Shah.\n\nMany other users on Facebook and Twitter have shared the video with the identical narrative. A few more individuals have shared the same video with the claim that the man\u2019s name is Syed Hameed ul Hassan with an Indian ancestry and his family is from Uttar Pradesh. A post by one Syed Saleem has been shared more than 1,000 times on Facebook so far.\n\nSeveral other people had posted the video with a similar claim.\n\nAfter carefully watching the video, Alt News found a banner in the video \u2013 \u201cNational High School Drill Team Championship\u201d \u2013which suggested that this video had something to do with a drill championship that annually takes place in Daytona Beach, Florida (USA).\n\nThen, we looked at the stitched badge on the uniform of the drill participant. From the screenshot posted below, it was unclear and hard to read the badge. However, with little legibility, it was assumed that the first letter of the full name was \u201ca\u201d and it ended with \u201cno\u201d.\n\nWe then Google searched for the website of the World Drill Championship and found a list of individuals from the year 2007 to 2016. On sifting through the available list for full names ending with \u201cno\u201d and starting with \u201ca\u201d, we came across a name that read, \u201cAlejandro Paulino\u201d. He stood 10th in 2015 World Drill Championship.\n\nHowever, in the 2015 video of the solo category performance by Alejandro Paulino, there was no name tag on the uniform.\n\nLooking for Paulino on Facebook, we found his Facebook Id which said that he is a student at the Universal Technical Institute.\n\nOn May 5, Paulino had posted the same video with a message, \u201c1st place at the 2019 World Drill Championships\u201d, suggesting that he stood first at the 2019 World Drill Championship.\n\nIn a Facebook conversation with Alt News, Paulino confirmed he does not have Indian ancestry and further added, \u201cThis is me in the video. This is a competition of rifle exhibition drill. I am not in the military. This is a military-style competition where we perform rifle spins. This is all for fun.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, a video from the World Drill Championship was falsely shared as an Indian-origin man enrolling in the US army.", "lang": "en"}
