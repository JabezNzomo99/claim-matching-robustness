John McCain, and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\n\nPredictably enough, U.S. President Donald Trump got his turn in the spotlight with this picture of him shaking hands with bin Laden, which was shared via social media in May 2020 accompanied by the putative Trump quote, \u201cI knew Osama bin Laden. People loved him. He was a great man that died for a worthy cause\u201d:\n\nEven among this class of digital manipulations, this item is one of the more improbable entries, as bin Laden was not known for taking time off from training volunteers to fight against the Soviet-backed regime in eastern Afghanistan in order to pop over to New York to attend black tie affairs.\n\nThis image is in fact an altered version of a photograph of Donald Trump and publisher S.I. Newhouse, Jr. attending a Trump book party at Trump Tower in New York City in December 1987:\n\nThe quote superimposed over the manipulated image is likewise fake, not a reproduction of anything Trump actually said.", "lang": "en"}
