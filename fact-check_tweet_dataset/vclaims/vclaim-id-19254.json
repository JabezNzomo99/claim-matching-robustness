They made a stop at Ladwa for snacks and opened the dickey of the car to feed their children. This raised suspicion among locals who confronted them.\u201d\n\nKumar further added, \u201cPolice reached the spot and verified the registration of the car and the Aadhaar details of the family. On interrogation we came to know that since there was no space in the Swift Dzire they were traveling in, the family decided to accommodate the children in the dickey. They were tied for safety reasons.\u201d\n\nBOOM also tried to reach Surendra Kumar, who was not immediately reachable. It was not clear if the trunk was left open or why the individuals thought it was safe to let the children sit there.\n\nWe were not able to trace the image of a man wearing black. However, the pictures are unrelated to the above incident.", "lang": "en"}
