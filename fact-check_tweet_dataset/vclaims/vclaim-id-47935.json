(a Visayan expression for teasing) 95 out of 105 countries in UN review believe there are no EJKs in the Philippines.\u201d\n\nThe facts: This claim has been debunked. The claim originated from a state-run Philippine News Agency (PNA) 2017 news report that misquoted Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Undersecretary Epimaco Densing III, who was then-assistant secretary.\n\nIn the report, Densing supposedly said 95 countries were convinced that EJKs were not happening in the country during the 27th Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland in May 2017. The UPR is a periodic review of human rights records among 193 members of the UN.\n\nRappler reported on May 20, 2017, that contrary to the PNA article, Densing said that the Philippine delegations to UPR were \"very confident\" that 109 countries were convinced by former senator Alan Peter Cayetano's presentation of the human rights situation in the country.\n\nThe former assistant secretary also said 95 countries \"made interventions\" or gave comments and recommendations on the EJKs that happened in the past 9 months at the time. (READ: Countries call for end to killings in PH drug war)\n\nAside from the UN mishap, the PNA also claimed that Densing described the information the other countries heard about the drug war as \"spoiled and rotten information.\" This was supposedly released by local media and human rights groups.\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
