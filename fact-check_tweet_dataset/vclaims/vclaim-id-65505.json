The claim is false; a similar image of the same group of people was published in an online report in February 2020; the report stated the photo shows a gathering of United Airlines staff after its flights were suspended to parts of China due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe photo was published here on Facebook on July 24, 2020, in a Taiwan-based group that has more than 15,000 members.\n\nThe photo shows a group of people holding banners in front of a boarding gate at an airport. The English banners read \u201cUnited Airlines\u201d and \u201cWe Will Be Back\u201d, and the simplified Chinese banners read \u201cChengdu add oil!\u201d, \u201cChina add oil!\u201d and \u201cWe will see each other soon\u201d.\n\n\u201cAdd oil\u201d is a Chinese phrase often used to express encouragement or support.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption, written in simplified Chinese characters, translates to English as: \u201cRecently, the United States issued a 72-hour ultimatum to the Chinese Communist Party, asking them to close and evacuate from the Chinese Embassy in Houston (a spy centre). The Chinese Communist Party was filmed burning a large number of confidential documents in the middle of the night. As a result, the Chinese Communist Party went furious and ordered a direct closure of the US embassy in Chengdu today.\n\n\u201cBefore leaving, the staff of the US embassy in Chengdu did not burn any documents. Instead, they raised banners to cheer for Chengdu! Cheer for China! Chinese people have forgotten the sense of propriety, justice, honesty and honour, and should really learn from these American people!\u201d\n\nUS-China relations spiralled in late July after the US consulate in the Chinese city of Chengdu was ordered to close, in retaliation for the forced closure of Beijing's consulate in Houston, Texas. Both sides alleged the other had endangered national security, as AFP reported in this article.\n\nThe photo was also shared here on Facebook, here and here on Twitter, and here on Weibo alongside a similar claim -- all after the closure of the US consulate in Chengdu on July 24.\n\nThe claim, however, is false.\n\nA keyword search of the text on the banners in the photo found this February 5, 2020 article published on the WeChat account of CAAC Inflight Magazine, a state-controlled publication in China.\n\nThe article\u2019s simplified Chinese-language headline translates to English as: \u201cOn the last flight before temporarily leaving China, pilots held up banners in the cockpit\u201d.\n\nIt features a photo similar to that in the misleading posts. The same group of people can be seen standing together. They can be seen wearing United Airlines uniforms and holding identical banners.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading posts (L) and the photo contained in the CAAC Inflight Magazine article (R):\n\nThe report reads, in part: \u201cAffected by [China\u2019s] epidemic situation, during the time from February 5 to March 28 (eastbound), United Airlines will suspend flights between US and the city of Beijing, Chengdu, and Shanghai.\n\n\u201cOn February 3, on Flight UA8 from Chengdu to San Francisco, tourists captured images like these. / On the cockpit windows, two pilots raised banners \u2018We will be back United Airlines\u2019 and \u2018Chengdu add oil\u2019\u201d.\n\nThe same photo and misleading claim was also debunked by Hong Kong fact-check page Kauyim Media here.", "lang": "en"}
