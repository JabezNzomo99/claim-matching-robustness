Lee, commander of the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War, was not a slave owner, while Ulysses S. Grant, who led the Union Army, was? No, that's not true: General Lee owned dozens of slaves and controlled many more as the trustee of his father-in-law's estate, which he freed during the war. General Grant did own at least one slave, which he freed before the war began.\n\nThe claim appeared in a meme, including this Facebook post (archived here) shared on June 10, 2020, with the title \"Check your history.\" It features side-by-side images of both men, beneath different flags (Grant with the American flag; Lee with the Confederate flag):\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nLee, in fact, owned several hundred enslaved workers. But it's also true that Ulysses S. Grant, who served as the commanding general of the United States Army and then became the nation's 18th president, owned at least one slave, whom he freed before the Civil War.\n\nThe truth about these opposing military leaders, including who owned slaves and who didn't, has been chronicled by historians and experts. In companion pieces under the headline \"Myths & Misunderstandings,\" The American Civil War Museum took these claims about slave ownership head on.\n\nHere's how the piece about Lee began:\n\nThe museum article goes on to describe how Lee inherited three or four families of slaves from his mother upon her death in 1829. And then, after his father-in-law died in 1859, \"Lee assumed command of 189 enslaved people.\" His father-in-law put in his will that these enslaved individuals should be set free \"within five years,\" the article says, but Lee \"petitioned state courts to extend his control of enslaved people\" -- a request that was denied, prompting Lee to free them \"three days before the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect.\" The article also references testimony from Wesley Norris, who was born into slavery on the plantation of Lee's father-in-law and ran away with several others while under Lee's ownership, only to be brutally beaten under Lee's command upon his capture and return.\n\nNorris described what happened him and the others who were captured:\n\n[Lee] told us he would teach us a lesson we never would forget; he then ordered us to the barn, where, in his presence, we were tied firmly to posts by a Mr. Gwin, our overseer, who was ordered by Gen. Lee to strip us to the waist and give us fifty lashes each, excepting my sister, who received but twenty; we were accordingly stripped to the skin by the overseer, who, however, had sufficient humanity to decline whipping us; accordingly Dick Williams, a county constable, was called in, who gave us the number of lashes ordered; Gen. Lee, in the meantime, stood by, and frequently enjoined Williams to lay it on well, an injunction which he did not fail to heed; not satisfied with simply lacerating our naked flesh, Gen. Lee then ordered the overseer to thoroughly wash our backs with brine, which was done.\n\nThe article ends with this summary:\n\nThe story about Grant is addressed separately by The American Civil War Museum and begins this way:\n\nGrant's views on slavery were complicated, according to the museum's write-up. His father, Jesse Grant, was an abolitionist in Ohio, but the younger Grant was \"more ambivalent.\" He married into a St. Louis, Missouri, slaveholding family in 1848. In 1854, after resigning from the military, Grant first tried his hand at farming, during which time he \"worked alongside\" the enslaved laborers owned by his father-in-law, Frederick Dent. After the death of his mother-in-law, he managed the farm owned by his in-laws. The museum article provides a glimpse into what it was like for Grant to be on that farm:\n\nEven if he wasn't a \"slavery man,\" he did briefly own a man named William Jones, whom he set free in March 1959. The manumission document, as shared by the museum, read:\n\nAfter the Union troops were attacked at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, starting the Civil War on April 12, 1861, Grant rejoined the military. He wrote to his father, as reported by the museum:\n\nWith the Emancipation Proclamation, which took effect January 1, 1863 and which \"allowed for the raising of black troops,\" Grant showed a further evolution in his thinking, the museum article shows. He wrote in a letter to President Abraham Lincoln, \"by arming the negro we have added a powerful ally. They will make good soldiers and taking them from the enemy weaken him in the same proportion they strengthen us.\"\n\nThe article goes on to explain how Grant's views further developed:\n\nMisinformation about Grant, the myth that he owned slaves during the Civil War, is perpetuated -- much like the false claim that Lee did not own slaves -- \"to obscure the historical record that the overwhelming reason given by southerners for seceding from the Union was to protect the institution of slavery, an institution that had expanded beyond southern borders,\" The American Civil War Museum concluded. \"That the United States initial war aim was to preserve the Union and only later became a war of liberation for enslaved people does not contradict that fact.\"", "lang": "en"}
