We\u2019ll put them into a mental trap and make them blame white people. The black community is the easiest to manipulate.\u201d\n\nThe meme, which shows a photo of Soros, was shared on a number of\n\nrecently debunked fake quotes associated with other famous personalities such as South Africa\u2019s former public protector\n\nand first president of the US,\n\nLike these, the George Soros attribution is also false.\n\nNo evidence of Soros saying this\n\nAccording to US fact-checking site\n\nstatement from Soros \u201cdoes not appear in the [Bild] newspaper\u2019s\n\nfor September 2014 (or any other month)\u201d.\n\nIn addition, no other credible news site ever reported on Soros\u2019s alleged hateful message. If Soros had made the remarks they would have been circulated by reputable news organisations.\n\nIt is unusual for such remarks to go unreported.\n\nThis was not the first time a fake quote (not) made by Soros has been shared online.\n\nas equally false. Soros was said to have told\n\n\"I've made my life's mission to destroy the United States. I hate this country and I hate all of the people in it.\"\n\nThere is no evidence of this statement either.", "lang": "en"}
