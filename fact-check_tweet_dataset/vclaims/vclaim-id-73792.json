But the chart misleads by using cherry-picked and, in some cases, faulty numbers.\n\nFacebook and Instagram users are sharing a chart that falsely claims that human trafficking arrests under President Donald Trump have increased 200% in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2016, when President Barack Obama was in office. Using accurate, comparable data, we found that all of the numbers under Trump are erroneous and greatly exaggerated.\n\nThe bar graph is being shared by supporters of President Donald Trump, conservative accounts, and by social media pages advancing the widespread QAnon conspiracy theory, which hinges in part on the belief that Trump is working to dismantle an elite child sex trafficking ring.\n\nOn one QAnon-themed Instagram account that shared the chart in July, commenters used the hashtag \u201c#savethechildren.\u201d A Facebook post included the caption, \u201cProtect our future save our kids.\u201d\n\nBut the chart, titled \u201cHuman Trafficking Arrests Since 2010,\u201d actually refers to arrests that relate to both labor and sex trafficking of both adults and children.\n\nMoreover, while the chart focuses exclusively on arrests, experts told us there are better metrics to assess the issue in terms of federal law enforcement, such as prosecutions. Those numbers tell a different story.\n\nEarlier versions of the viral chart appeared online in 2018 after the supposed statistics were reportedly sourced on QAnon message boards.\n\nThe chart in its most recent iteration claims that human trafficking arrests under Obama reached a high of 1,952 in fiscal year 2016 \u2014 whereas Trump oversaw 6,154 such arrests in fiscal year 2019. That would be an increase of more than 200%.\n\nThere are a few things wrong with it, as we\u2019ll explain:\n\u2022 For the Obama years, the chart only includes human trafficking-related arrests reported by the Department of Homeland Security, under Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations. At the federal level, the FBI is the other main agency responsible for human trafficking-related arrests, so the numbers are incomplete.\n\u2022 Using that same comparison \u2014 arrests reported by only ICE-HSI \u2014 the numbers under Trump are inflated for every year, according to federal reports.\n\nEven if the viral chart\u2019s numbers were right, arrest figures aren\u2019t the best measure to assess the federal government\u2019s action on human trafficking, experts told us.\n\nJean Bruggeman, executive director of the nonprofit Freedom Network USA, said in a phone interview that human trafficking arrests data could include other arrests made in the course of \u201csuspected\u201d trafficking cases. For example, ICE-HSI reported 1,588 arrests stemming from human trafficking investigations in fiscal year 2018, according to the U.S. Attorney General\u2019s annual report to Congress on human trafficking. But a breakdown of the arrests by human trafficking statutes accounts for only 256 of the arrests.\n\nFor the sake of fact-checking the chart, we looked at the annual reports on human trafficking submitted by the attorney general to Congress for the corresponding years. We found that the chart correctly refers to only ICE-HSI arrests under Obama. There were 300 trafficking-related arrests by ICE-HSI in fiscal year 2010 (the first year listed in the chart and the first complete fiscal year under the Obama administration) and 1,952 in fiscal year 2016, Obama\u2019s last complete fiscal year.\n\nUsing that same data for a direct comparison, however, the numbers during the Trump administration are wrong.\n\nICE-HSI reported 1,602 arrests (not 3,213) in fiscal year 2017 (which began in October 2016) and 1,588 arrests in fiscal year 2018 (the chart claims the number is 5,987).\n\nIn fiscal year 2019, which ended Sept. 30, 2019, such ICE-HSI arrests did reach a high of 2,197. But that figure is higher than the 2016 level by 12.5%, not 200%, as the social media graphic suggests.\n\nThat said, there are also human trafficking-related arrests reported by the FBI outlined in the annual reports.\n\nFor example, looking at both arrests made by ICE-HSI and the FBI, the combined number of reported human trafficking-related arrests in fiscal year 2018 was 2,067. Under Obama, the ICE-HSI and the FBI\u2019s Civil Rights Unit together reported 2,295 arrests in fiscal year 2014.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Innocence Lost National Initiative, which focuses on domestic sex trafficking of minors, reported larger numbers of arrests \u2014 such as a reported 2,402 arrests in fiscal year 2016 \u2014 but it appears some of those arrests were made at the state and local level, too. We asked the FBI for clarification and weren\u2019t given a clear answer.\n\nAccurate numbers of human trafficking-related arrests made by the FBI also aren\u2019t fully clear for 2017 or 2019.\n\nThe annual report to Congress for 2017 noted that the FBI \u201carrested 2,693 subjects\u201d related to its human trafficking investigations, but a bureau spokeswoman, Tina Jagerson, told us in an email that the \u201cFY2017 number included all individuals arrested during the course of an FBI human trafficking investigation (regardless of the violation).\u201d For a frame of reference, FBI arrest totals for human trafficking were reported as 302 the year before, and 479 in fiscal year 2018.\n\nWe asked the FBI for the 2017 arrests specifically for human trafficking violations, in order to directly compare it to the other annual reports, and Jagerson said the FBI was \u201cnot able\u201d to provide it. And the FBI declined to provide us with the number of arrests for fiscal year 2019.\n\n\n\nExperts said none of the data is perfect. But the number of prosecutions by the Department of Justice is a better way to assess the impact of federal law enforcement efforts on human trafficking.\n\nProsecutions are filed publicly and \u201cwhat people are being charged with \u2026 is verifiable,\u201d Bruggeman said. \u201cThat, I think, is a lot more reliable in terms of what is being done\u201d on human trafficking.\n\nMartina Vandenberg, founder and president of the Human Trafficking Legal Center, likewise said in an email that \u201c[w]hile prosecution data suffers from multiple flaws, that count is a much more realistic measure than arrest records.\u201d\n\nWe reviewed the prosecution data in the annual attorney general reports and annual State Department Trafficking in Persons reports for all of the years in the viral chart. That data tell a different and more nuanced story.\n\nTrafficking prosecutions. The number of trafficking prosecutions initiated per year by the Justice Department rose from 103 in fiscal year 2010 to 241 in fiscal year 2016 under Obama. Trafficking prosecutions went up to 282 in fiscal year 2017, which includes Trump\u2019s first eight months in office. But declined in fiscal years 2018 (230) and 2019 (220). (According to a report by the Human Trafficking Institute, just more than half of the victims in active federal trafficking cases in the calendar year 2019 were children.)\n\n\n\nThe majority of the trafficking prosecutions \u2014 nearly 90% \u2014 over the years were for sex trafficking, not labor trafficking, though some cases are reported to be \u201cpredominantly\u201d sex or labor trafficking and could involve both.\n\nDefendants charged. The number of defendants charged annually went up from 181 in fiscal year 2010 to 531 in fiscal year 2016 under Obama. That number again went up in fiscal year 2017 to 553, before dropping the following two years \u2014 to 386 and 343 in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, respectively.\n\nTrafficking convictions. Convictions \u2014 which often result from prosecutions initiated in previous years \u2014 are up in recent years, relative to years past. In fiscal year 2016, there were 439 convictions, up from 297 the year before. There were 499, 526 and 475 convictions in fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.\n\nThe general rise in prosecutions over the last decade tracks with a large uptick in the calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline \u2014 and of potential cases referred to law enforcement agencies by the hotline. In fiscal year 2010, the hotline referred 499 calls to law enforcement agencies (which could include state and local agencies). In fiscal year 2019, there were 3,599 cases referred to law enforcement, the Polaris Project, the nonprofit group that runs the hotline, told us.\n\nVanessa Bouch\u00e9 \u2014 an associate professor at Texas Christian University who created the online database humantraffickingdata.org \u2014 said in an interview that awareness about the issue of human trafficking has resulted in increased calls and tips to the national hotline, which in turn leads to more potential cases referred to law enforcement.\n\nAnd, she said, the upward trajectory of trafficking prosecutions followed the 2008 reauthorization of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, particularly driven by child sex trafficking prosecutions.\n\nIn July 2019, a report from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University found that federal prosecutions of child sex trafficking specifically went down in fiscal year 2018 and was on track to go down again in fiscal year 2019, which is consistent with the overall human trafficking prosecutions outlined in the annual reports.\n\nAmy Farrell, director of the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University, noted that the federal statistics should not be considered representative of the scope of human trafficking offenses.\n\nNone of the numbers \u201care accurate reflections of the problem of human trafficking or in many cases the identification of human trafficking,\u201d she said, due to issues such as underreporting (including at the state and local levels).\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
