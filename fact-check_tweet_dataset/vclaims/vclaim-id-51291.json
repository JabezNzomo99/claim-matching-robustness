Several prominent figures, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will be part of the event. Amid this, some news websites have claimed that Samajwadi Party MP Azam Khan has said he will take \u2018jal samadhi\u2019 in the Saryu river, or in other words, sacrifice his life, if not invited to the ceremony.\n\nHindi news website \u201cNews Track\u201d published an article, according to which Azam Khan has said he is a devotee of Lord Ram and he had played a significant role in the Ram temple movement. This article was tweeted by BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra, among others. \u201cSwarajya\u201d had also published an article with the same information. All of them later corrected the mistake.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the articles to be misleading. The above statement was not given by SP\u2019s Azam Khan but a namesake, who is the president of \u2018Sri Ram Mandir Nirman Muslim Kar Sewak Manch\u2019 and claims to be a Ram devotee.\n\nThe fake news has been circulated widely on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nWhen pointed out by netizens, \u201cSwarajya\u201d and \u201cNews Track\u201d corrected their articles with the right information. Sambit Patra too clarified that the \u201cNews Track\u201d article he had shared was faulty.\n\nWe found multiple news reports regarding the statement given by Azam Khan of Muslim Kar Sewak Manch on July 25 in Ayodhya.\n\nClaiming to be a \u2018Ram bhakt\u2019, Azam Khan had said Lord Ram cannot be restricted to any religion or caste and the \u2018bhoomi pujan\u2019 of the Ram temple will not be complete without him. He had said he will sacrifice his life in Saryu river if not invited to the \u2018bhoomi pujan\u2019 ceremony.\n\nA \u201cHindustan Times\u201d report said the Ram temple trust has invited all prominent figures associated with the movement and all chief ministers for the ceremony.\n\nOn the other hand, SP\u2019s Azam Khan, along with his son and wife, has been in jail for the last five months in relation to various cases such as land grabbing, encroachment and others lodged against them by the Yogi Adityanath government.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court verdict on Ram temple last year, the Rampur MP had said that the apex court\u2019s decision should be respected by all.\n\nHence, the claim saying that SP leader Azam Khan had threatened to sacrifice his life if not invited to the \u2018bhoomi pujan\u2019 ceremony of the Ram temple in Ayodhya is false. The statement was given by a different Azam Khan.", "lang": "en"}
