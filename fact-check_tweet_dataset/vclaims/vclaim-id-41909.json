No, that's not true: The settlement agreement in Judicial Watch's latest California voter registration case did not confirm one million illegal votes were cast and Judicial Watch never claimed it did. California's Secretary of State Alex Padilla slapped down similar allegations dating back to the 2016 election, calling them \"corrosive lies.\" A Judicial Watch spokeswoman distanced the conservative group from the meme that made the debunked claim.\n\nThe claim was made in a Facebook post (archived here) that was published by Kathie Walters, who describes herself as a pastor, author and speaker, on April 8, 2020. It read:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nWalters' post got more than 28,000 shares and plenty of followers weighed in with praise. \"Yay! Praise The Lord,\" wrote one person. \"It seems like we are in a snowball effect. I think so much will start coming out, it will make our head spin,\" said another. \"Well, if nothing else, this lock-down has the attention to getting things cleaned up,\" wrote a third.\n\nBut there were also some who raised questions and challenged the claim. \"Kathie Walters can you post the article about the 1 million illegal votes?\" asked one person. [Walters' response: \"look on google.\"] \"Where is this verified? I can't find it online anywhere,\" said another. \"You know this is a lie, right? Of course you do. And here I thought Christians were supposed to be beacons of righteousness. Instead, they seem to enjoy spreading lies,\" added a third.\n\nA close look at the Judicial Watch website doesn't offer any material boasting of a recent win that proved there were 1 million illegal votes in 2018. On a page dedicated to \"illegal voting,\" the last news release to touch on the topic was from January 27, 2017. It was titled, \"Judicial Watch: Fitton Weighs in on Illegal Alien Voting,\" and referenced a Breitbart article in which Fitton \"weighs in on the burgeoning debate over whether illegal aliens voted in the 2016 presidential election.\"\n\nIncluded in the release and article were these comments from Fitton:\n\nNot included in the article or news release was any proof; Fitton's statements were speculation.\n\nSo, Lead Stories reached out to the group directly, giving the spokeswoman, Jill Farrell, repeated opportunities to either confirm or deny the claim circulating on social media. She passed along a couple of links (only one related to California) that did not answer the inquiry.\n\nThe only statement she offered by email was this:\n\nFor transparency, below are our attempts to get answers to the question through the spokeswoman.\n\n\"It seems like a fair request to simply ask if what she's saying is true or not,\" we wrote in one message.\n\nAfter that got no response, we tried once more:\n\nThat note, too, was ignored.\n\nThe one link Farrell provided in the beginning of the email exchange was a news release from June 19, 2019, titled, \"California Begins Massive Voter Roll Clean-Up -- Notifies Up to 1.5 Million 'Inactive' Voters as Part of Judicial Watch Lawsuit Settlement.\" The release started this way:\n\nNowhere in this release about cleaning up inactive voter registrations is there mention that 1 million illegal votes had, in fact, been cast.\n\nRealClearPolitics published a story the day after the press release went out from Judicial Watch. The story, \"Calif. Begins Removing 5 Million Inactive Voters on Its Rolls,\" began this way:\n\nThe June 20, 2019, article makes mention of a Los Angeles Times investigation uncovering glitches in a new system allowing people to automtacially register to vote while at the Calfornia Department of Motor Vehicles. The RealClearPolitics article summarized the findings this way, saying the system was:\n\nWhether the more than 1,500 noncitizens who were allowed to register to vote actually voted is unknown. But even if they did, 1,500 is a far cry from the 1 million claimed in the Facebook post.\n\nLead Stories reached out the California secretary of state's office to see if it could offer clarification on this matter. We did not hear back before publication, but we will update the story when we do.\n\nWe did find a news release from Secretary of State Alex Padilla that was dated January 24, 2017, days after Trump stepped into office. It was issued in response to ongoing claims by Trump that California had purposefully engaged in voter fraud.\n\nHere are Trump's tweets about the issue on consecutive days in November 2016:\n\nHere's what Padilla said a couple months later, in response to Trump's repeated claims:\n\nOther fact-checking outlets have debunked Trump's revisited allegations about massive voter fraud, including FactCheck.org and PolitiFact.\n\nIn fact, in a court filing, Trump's own attorneys seemed to rebut the idea that there was any voter fraud in 2016. The Washington Post reported on January 25, 2017, that:", "lang": "en"}
