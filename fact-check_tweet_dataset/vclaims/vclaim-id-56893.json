In fact, physicians say that the drug has serious side effects for patients, especially if they have pre-existing conditions such as heart problems.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper she was concerned for other reasons. In the interview, Cooper asked Pelosi what she thought of Trump saying he is taking the drug.\n\n\"I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group,\" Pelosi said. \"He\u2019s morbidly obese, they say.\"\n\nPelosi\u2019s comment probably was meant to get under Trump\u2019s skin. Trump has ridiculed other people\u2019s heights and weights in the past, while others have questioned whether he\u2019s been accurate in describing his own height and weight.\n\nBut morbid obesity, or severe obesity, is a term of science, and weight is a risk factor for COVID-19.\n\nWe decided to see what we could find out. Pelosi\u2019s office did not offer a comment.\n\nThe White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Trump responded to Pelosi\u2019s comments at a May 19 news conference, calling Pelosi \"a sick woman\" with \"a lot of mental problems.\"\n\nOfficially, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not define the threshhold needed for someone to be considered \"morbidly obese.\" Instead, the CDC says that \"Class 3\" obesity, sometimes categorized as \"extreme\" or \"severe\" obesity, is defined as having a body-mass index, or BMI, of 40 or higher. Other medical sources list a definition of \"morbidly obese\" as equivalent to a BMI of 40 or higher.\n\nSome available data about Trump comes from his most recent periodic physical exam. In a 2019 memo, Trump\u2019s physician Dr. Sean Conley said Trump was 6 feet, 3 inches tall and 243 pounds.\n\nTrump, who was 72 at the time, had gained 4 pounds since his 2018 exam, when his previous doctor, Ronny Jackson, said Trump\u2019s \"overall health is excellent\" but \"he would benefit from a diet that is lower in fat and carbohydrates and from a routine exercise regiment.\"\n\nOfficially, Trump\u2019s height and weight would correlate to a BMI of 30.1, just a bit over the 30.0 level to be considered obese \u2014 the lowest of three levels. That is not high enough to count as Class 3 obesity.\n\nBased on the 2019 physical exam, Trump \"would not be considered morbidly obese at this time,\" said Lucas Carr, a professor in the department of health and human physiology at the University of Iowa.\n\nParesh Dandona, the head of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at the State University of New York, agreed with this observation.\n\nSome critics, such as MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough, say they think Trump is neither 6-foot-3 (a New York driver\u2019s license listed him as 6 feet, 2 inches), nor does he weigh around 240 pounds.\n\n\"By the way he's picked up, magically picked up, he's 2 inches taller now than he was a couple years ago, right?\" Scarborough said on his MSNBC show in 2019.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I'm a guy that weighs about 240, 241,\" he said. \"This guy, this guy is, he's pushing 300, there's no doubt about it,\" Scarborough said. \"Maybe he's 270, maybe he's 280.\"\n\nThe Washington Post went so far in 2016 as to have experts guess Trump\u2019s weight. Their answers: 250-260 pounds; 228-242 pounds; 252-255 pounds; at least 240 \"maybe more\".\n\nTo have a BMI above 40, with the highest of those weights (260 pounds), Trump would need to be shorter than 5 feet, 8 inches. He\u2019s not.\n\nPelosi does have a point that an individual\u2019s age and weight are risk factors for worse outcomes after a coronavirus infection. Many studies connect obesity with COVID-19 complications, and data has shown higher death rates for older patients than younger ones. The CDC warns on their \"Defining Adult Obesity\" page that \"severe obesity (a BMI of 40 or higher) may raise risk\" of a severe reaction to COVID-19.\n\nThe CDC also warns that \"older adults, 65 years and older, are at higher risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19.\" Trump is 73.\n\nBased off of his declared height and weight, Trump has a body mass index of 30.1. This places him into the lowest of three levels under the CDC\u2019s definition of obesity. Even if the public numbers are a bit shy of reality, Trump would have to be substantially heavier to meet a level of severe, or morbid, obesity.\n\nPolitiFact senior correspondent Louis Jacobson and executive director Aaron Sharockman contributed to this report.", "lang": "en"}
