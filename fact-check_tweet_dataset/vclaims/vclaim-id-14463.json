But like the film, the claim those boats are from America is fiction.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "December 02, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-14463", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-g20-ukraine-ships-hunter-killer/29633460.html", "vclaim": "Speaking to reporters after the G20 (Group of Twenty) Summit in Buenos Aires on Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin was asked his opinion of the Hollywood film \u201cHunter Killer\u201d by \"Kommersant\" Kremlin pool reporter Andrei Kolesnikov.\n\nIn that movie, which Russian censors have reportedly left in limbo, an American submarine is sent to observe a Russian naval base, only to discover a putsch, in which the Russian president is kidnapped with the ultimate goal of starting World War III.\n\nThe Ministry of Culture prevented release of the film just before its scheduled run in Russian theaters on November 1 \u2013 claiming the distributor had not followed proper procedures , which the distributor disputed. The film was eventually approved for release in Russia with significant delay in its schedule.\n\nAfter bantering with Andrey Kolesnikov about the plot of the film, Putin calls it \u201cunlikely\u201d and \u201cfantastic.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo little cutters that the United States gifted Ukraine didn\u2019t pass through the Kerch Straight, and you want a nuclear submarine visiting our base? A bad film,\u201d Putin said dismissively before ending the press conference.\n\nPutin refers to the incident occurred on November 25, when Russian Coast Guard boats attempted to stop a Ukrainian tugboat as it was on its way to transit the Kerch Strait from the Black Sea into the Azov Sea, between Russia and Russian-occupied Crimea. The incident ended with Russian vessels firing on two Ukrainian naval patrol boats that came to the aid of the tug, and Russian forces capturing all three Ukrainian vessels along with their crews.\n\nBut Putin\u2019s claim that the two ships were \u201cgifted\u201d by the U.S. is false.\n\nThe two patrol boats, \u201cBerdyansk\u201d and \u201cNikopol\u201d, have already been identified as Gyurza-M-class artillery boats, which are manufactured by the Kyiv-based Kuznya na Rybalskomu ship building and armament firm.\n\nWhen claiming the two seized boats were a gift to Ukraine from the U.S. the Russian president might have confused them with two different ships Ukraine agreed in September to accept from the U.S. \u2013 Island-class patrol boats as free military aid.\n\n\u201cThis aid is especially crucial at a time when Russia is undermining the freedom of navigation in the Sea of Azov, cowardly hunting and intimidating commercial ships,\u201d Ukrainian President Petro Porohsenko said at the time.\n\n\u201cOur task is to convince the Kremlin that we are committed to defending Ukraine\u2019s shores.\u201d\n\nThose outdated vessels, manufactured for the U.S. Coast Guard from 1985-92, are intended to help Ukraine create a so-called \"Mosquito fleet\" \u2013 with a focus on quick deployment covering a large area.\n\nThe aim is to counter what Valeriy Chaly, Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., called Russia\u2019s attempt to \u201cmilitarize the Azov\u201d during an interview with Defense One.\n\nBut the ships seized by Russia on November 25 were Ukrainian, and not American-made and so we judge Putin\u2019s claim to be false.", "lang": "en"}
