One in four in this limited sample said they had been diagnosed with depression by a professional.\n\u2022 None Experts pointed out a number of problems with the study, primarily that it cannot be generalised to the South African workforce as a whole. \n\n\n\nWhenever work anxiety, burn-out and stress in South African workplaces are reported on, a well-worn statistic is likely to be mentioned.\n\n\u201cAt least one in four employees are diagnosed with depression,\u201d said an\n\nhave also repeated this statistic in recent years.\n\nIs there truth to it?\n\nas its source. The group\u2019s operations director Cassey Chambers told Africa Check that the information was from a research study done by Hexor, a health and economic research organisation now known as\n\n\u201cWe were involved in disseminating the information and creating awareness around it, [but] SADAG didn\u2019t actually host this research ourselves,\u201d Chambers said.\n\n, which was published in 2016, was based on an online survey. One of the study\u2019s authors and TCD Global\u2019s pharmacoeconomic and data analytics manager,\n\narticipants were recruited through a South African online market research panel in June 2014.\n\n\u201cWe used a sample of 1,061 employees who worked in advertising or market research and were employed full or part-time or at some time during the 12 months prior to the survey,\u201d she said.\n\nOf the people surveyed, 278 answered yes to the question \u201cHave you ever personally been diagnosed as having depression by a doctor/medical professional?\u201d\n\nDe Necker added: \u201cThis indicates 26.2%, which can be interpreted as one in four participants in the study.\u201d\n\nBut the authors highlighted several limitations, including that it was a self-reported survey.\n\n\u201cThe results from this study all rely on subjective responses to an online questionnaire. Anonymity supports the reliability of the data, however, the design of this study does not allow for diagnosis of depression to be verified.\u201d\n\n\u2018Basically no way study can be generalised\u2019\n\n(UCT) where he teaches a course titled \u201cAnalysis of Survey Data\u201d. He believes the study\u2019s methodology was of low quality.\n\n\u201cThe survey was done online, so [it] excludes anyone without internet access, which is a large fraction of employees. These types of employees could be more or less likely to be depressed, we don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAnother selection problem, Kerr said, is that all of the participants worked in the advertising or market research sector. The study also did not report non-response rates, or the fraction of people who were asked to respond to the survey but did not.\n\n\u201cAgain, those with depression may be more or less likely to respond, we don\u2019t know,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cThese could all affect the estimated proportion of employees with depression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is basically no way their study can be generalised to any population, either all employees or even all advertising or market research employees [in South Africa],\u201d he said.\n\nOnly one representative study on mental disorders\n\nThe head of UCT\u2019s psychiatry and mental health department, Prof Dan Stein, told Africa Check there has only been one nationally representative study on mental disorders, the\n\nIt surveyed a representative sample of 4,351 adults between 2003 and 2004 and found that close to 10% of the respondents had suffered from major depressive disorder at some point in their life. Almost 5% had suffered from the disease in the course of the previous 12 months.\n\nStein, who co-authored the study, said that\n\n\u201cthe data were analysed as a whole though, [and] we didn\u2019t focus on just people who were employed\u201d.\n\n, also said the SASH survey was the only nationally representative study on mental disorders she was aware of.\n\nRoos added that when talking about mental disorders, the term prevalence rate (the proportion of people affected by a disease) must be used with caution, because of the lack of nationally representative data.\n\n\u201c[We must do] good epidemiological and representative research with a sound research methodology, otherwise there is the danger of false and inflated prevalence rates.\u201d\n\nConclusion: No study backs up claim that 1 in 4 South African employees have depression\n\nSince 2015, many journalists have cited a statistic that one in four South African employees are diagnosed with depression. Though the South African Depression and Anxiety Group is usually quoted as the source, the organisation told Africa Check they only helped to spread another organisation\u2019s findings.\n\nThe statistic is based on a 2014 online survey of\n\n1,061 employees who worked in advertising or market research. Just over a quarter (\n\n) of the respondents claimed that they had been diagnosed with depression by a medical professional in the 12 months before the poll.\n\nExperts told Africa Check that various flaws in the study\u2019s methodology mean that the findings cannot be generalised to all South African employees.\n\nWe therefore rate the claim as unproven.", "lang": "en"}
