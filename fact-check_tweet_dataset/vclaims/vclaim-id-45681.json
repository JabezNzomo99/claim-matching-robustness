He also supposedly chided medical frontliners and told them to do their jobs.\n\nThe quotecard was posted as early as May 27, according to Facebook's Claim Check dashboard that flagged these posts. One such post by the Pinoy Ako Facebook page on Wednesday, June 3, has been shared over 1,200 times and has received 700 reactions and 525 comments as of writing.\n\nSearching parts of the quote or the entire quote on Google does not turn up any result supporting the claim.\n\nNeither the quotecard nor the posts that shared it did not cite the source of the quote.\n\nIn addition, Roxas has yet to issue a statement related to COVID-19 developments in the country on his official social media pages. He last posted on his Facebook and Twitter accounts in October 2019, and on his Instagram account in December 2019.\n\nThe photo used in the quotecard was from an old Rappler interview of Roxas in November 2015, months before the 2016 presidential elections. \u2013 Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
