But one popular Facebook post fabricates a tweet from the president that he never wrote.\n\nThe post, published Sept. 1, claims to show a screenshot of a tweet from Trump. In it, Trump credits Dorian\u2019s northward path away from the Florida coast on the state\u2019s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, saying that, if Democrat Andrew Gillum had won the midterm election, \"millions would have died.\"\n\nBut the tweet is a fake. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nOn first glance, the account in the screenshot appears to belong to the president. It bears the same photo as his real account, @realDonaldTrump, and even the handle looks similar.\n\nBut it\u2019s not. The suspect tweet bears the handle @realdonalbtrump \u2014 with a \"b\" where the \"d\" should be. It also has a misplaced period at the end of Trump\u2019s name and does not have a blue verification badge, which means the account doesn\u2019t actually belong to the president.\n\nFurther, in its Twitter bio, @realdonalbtrump says it\u2019s a parody account.\n\n\"NOT the real Donald Trump, just PARODY,\" the bio reads. \"If you thought it was really him for a second what does that say about him?\"\n\nYet hundreds of Facebook users are sharing the screenshot as if it were true. Just to make sure, we checked Trump\u2019s real Twitter page to see if he has tweeted about Gillum in connection to Dorian. He hasn\u2019t.\n\nThe Facebook post is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. We rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
