How accurate were Sarah Huckabee-Sanders\u2019 comments re: Mr. Obama\u2019s use of non-lethal methods?\n\nOn Nov. 25, hundreds of Central American migrants traveling as part of a so-called caravan attempted to unlawfully cross from Mexico into the United States at the port of entry between Tijuana and San Diego. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said some of them tried to enter through vehicle lanes or fencing along the border.\n\n\n\nCBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan told reporters on Nov. 26 that members of the group \u201cbecame assaultive,\u201d throwing \u201crocks and other projectiles\u201d at federal agents policing the border. In turn, \u201cBorder Patrol agents deployed tear gas to dispel the group because of the risk to agents\u2019 safety,\u201d CBP explained on Twitter.\n\nThat was not the first time that border agents have used tear gas against a group of migrants during an altercation at the Southwest border.\n\nStatistics CBP emailed to FactCheck.org show that, from fiscal years 2012 to 2018, border agents used the chemical compound 2-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS), which is commonly known as tear gas, in 126 incidents. Of those, 79 occurred during the five full fiscal years under President Barack Obama. That\u2019s a little over one incident per month from fiscal 2012 to 2016. CBP sent us annual, not monthly figures.\n\n\n\nNews reports also indicate that tear gas was used in incidents during at least the administrations of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.\n\nBut White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders specifically mentioned Obama during a Nov. 27 press briefing, in which she answered a question about a photo showing a Honduran woman and two children running from a tear gas canister that landed near them on Nov. 25.\n\n\u201cCertainly the White House would never want children to be in harm\u2019s way in any capacity whatsoever,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHowever, that is why we are continuing to encourage people to follow the law and go to ports of entry.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cAnd let\u2019s also not forget that this isn\u2019t the first time that non-lethal force like this has been used. In fact, tear gas was used on average once a month during the Obama administration for very similar circumstances. In fact, they were actually for far less circumstances, because they didn\u2019t have the same numbers in the mass rush that we\u2019re seeing in this caravan take place.\u201d\n\nReaders, like the one who poses the question above, have continued to ask us about her comments.\n\nWe know that tear gas was used by CBP under Obama, as Sanders said. What we don\u2019t know are the circumstances of every case. A CBP spokesperson provided us with the numbers without going into any detail about the incidents.\n\nIn one 2013 occurrence, United Press International reported: \u201cBorder guards used tear gas on a crowd of people at the U.S.-Mexico border in Tijuana and some in the crowd threw rocks and bottles, video of the melee shows.\u201d According to the Nov. 26, 2013, article, \u201cThe video, broadcast on Milenio Television, shows a crowd of well over 100 people walking along the border fence before coming face to face with border guards in a confrontation that occurred Sunday as the crowd attempted to cross the Tijuana River into the United States.\u201d\n\nThe CBP spokesperson told us the agency actually has been using tear gas since 2010, but did not provide data for years before fiscal 2012.\n\nWhen we searched the Nexis news database, however, we found reports of tear gas being used during administrations prior to Obama\u2019s and Trump\u2019s. For example:\n\u2022 None In April 1980, under President Carter, the Associated Press reported that additional border agents were needed in San Ysidro, California, \u201cafter agents wearing riot gear used tear gas to disperse an estimated 500 illegal aliens over the weekend, authorities said.\u201d The migrants \u201creportedly pelted waiting agents with rocks,\u201d causing the agents to use \u201cseven canisters of tear gas to drive the aliens back to the south levee.\u201d\n\u2022 None In September 1986, under President Reagan, the Los Angeles Times reported that Border Patrol Supervisor Armand Olvera said that a border agent was \u201chit in the head with a rock\u201d when \u201c150 to 200 aliens \u2018charged\u2019 the levee\u201d in San Ysidro. \u201cDespite the blood that was flowing from his head, Agent Ruiz managed to fire one tear gas round and threw one canister and the crowd dispersed,\u201d Olvera was quoted as telling the Times. The story also noted, \u201cBetween Jan. 12 and Sept. 4, agents had to use tear gas on 35 occasions to disperse hostile groups of aliens, Olvera said.\u201d\n\u2022 None \n\n And in December 2007, under President Bush, the AP reported that \u201cBorder Patrol agents are firing tear gas and powerful pepper-spray weapons across the border into Mexico to repel what the agency says are an increasing number of attacks by assailants hurling stones, bottles and bricks.\u201d Agents were attacked 987 times in fiscal year 2007, the story said.\n\nIn addition to tear gas, the CBP spokesperson told us the agency still \u201cregularly uses Pava Capsaicin,\u201d or pepper spray. Border agents used it in 540 incidents from fiscal years 2012 to 2018, and 434 (or 80 percent) of those were during the five full fiscal years under Obama.\n\nSo, the use of tear gas or pepper spray is not exclusive to either Obama or Trump.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection.
