The message urges people to take action against people who wishfully spread infection in light of the global coronavirus outbreak.\n\nMany users on Facebook and Twitter posted the video with the same message in Hindi.\n\nAlt News had also received a request on its official WhatsApp number to fact-check if the clip is from India.\n\nA Google search revealed that the video is from Belgium. The man was reportedly inebriated and was travelling in the Brussels subway. Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company, the capital\u2019s public transport provider, informed that he was arrested by the police and their security services. The subway train was later taken off service to be disinfected.\n\nThe incident had come to light after at least two fellow commuters captured the act on video and posted online, warning other commuters to be careful. Posted below is a video of the same incident from a different angle. It was also reported by Belgian\u2019s daily newspaper The Brussels Times on March 10.\n\nA video of a passenger carelessly rubbing his saliva-ridden hand on a handrail in a subway in Belgium is circulating on the Indian social ecosystem with an appeal to take action against people who recklessly put others in danger.\n\nNote: The number of positive cases of the novel coronavirus in India has exceeded 500. This has caused the government to impose a complete restriction on movement apart from essential services. Globally, more than 4 lakh confirmed cases and close to 19,000 deaths have been reported. There is a growing sense of panic among citizens, causing them to fall for a variety of online misinformation \u2013 misleading images and videos rousing fear or medical misinformation promoting pseudoscience and invalid treatments.
