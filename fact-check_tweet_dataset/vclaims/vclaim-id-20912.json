Dj Khaled said\u201cSOMETIMES YOU JUST GOTTA THROW THE WHOLE HORSE AWAY.\u201d\n\nThe headline claimed \u201cResort kills horse after Dj Khaled broke its back during video shoot.\u201d\n\nThe Vybz Media article did not offer any evidence to support its three claims: that the horse\u2019s back was broken during filming; that the resort had put down the animal, and that Khaled was paying for its funeral.\n\nFurthermore, the article contains two quotes: one appearing to come from staff at the resort, but not attributed to anyone in particular; and another from Khaled himself, with no source given for his purported comments.\n\nVybz Media did embed a video showing DJ Khaled mounting and riding the horse, which was taken from his Instagram account and uploaded to YouTube. Since publication, the producer \u2013 whose album Grateful debuted at Number One in the Billboard Top 200 on 15 July 2017 \u2013 has received criticism and condemnation on social media from people believing the Vybz Media story to be true.\n\nApart from the fact that DJ Khaled got on the horse, every detail in the article is inaccurate, and the story is a fabrication.\n\nWe spoke by phone to Christina Turner, who runs Horseplay, a horseback riding business in Nassau, Bahamas that Khaled visited with his family. We have verified her identity.\n\nTurner owns the horse in question, Eclipse, a 19-year-old male part-Arabian breed horse who weighs roughly 1,100 lb and measures 15 hands (five feet tall). She told us Khaled\u2019s horse ride took place on 10 July 2017 and lasted \u201cprobably less than 10 minutes.\u201d\n\nI got a call from [the One and Only] Ocean Club, where DJ Khaled was staying, saying that he wanted to do a family ride with his wife and child\u2026His wife rode the horse in the water, his son rode the horse and then he rode the horse and he did a little quick clip for his Instagram. They were a very friendly, great family.\n\n\u201cThat was the extent of the story,\u201d she added, \u201cuntil the crazy rumors.\u201d\n\nTurner confirmed that, contrary to the claim made by Vybz Media, the horse in question is not owned by the resort.\n\nTurner also sent us a photograph of herself and a healthy Eclipse standing next to a copy of the Nassau Guardian newspaper from 18 July 2017, eight days after DJ Khaled\u2019s visit.\n\nShe also pointed to six photographs taken and posted to the Horseplay Facebook page on 12 July 2017, two days after Khaled\u2019s visit, which show Eclipse giving rides along a beach to several other clients. He is scheduled to give rides at a wedding on the weekend of 21 July 2017.\n\nShe added that she had contacted Vybz Media to point out the factual errors in the article, including misidentifying the horse\u2019s owner, and had asked them to take down the article and issue a retraction. We have reviewed and confirmed these emails. As of 18 July 2017, the article remains online, unedited.\n\nThe article is almost an exact copy of one published by the Viral Mugshot web site in November 2016, which claimed that rapper Rick Ross had broken a horse\u2019s back during a video shoot in Miami, Florida, forcing its owners to have it put down.\n\nThat story contained the same unattributed quote: \u201cHe said he weighed 200 pounds, but our horse\u2019s back determined that was a lie,\u201d and the same quote attributed to DJ Khaled by Vybz Media was originally attributed to Ross: \u201cSometimes you just gotta throw the whole horse away.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
