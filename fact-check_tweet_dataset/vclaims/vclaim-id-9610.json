It is widely believed that President Vladimir Putin will seek reelection, although he has not yet officially announced his candidacy, and few analysts believe Sobchak would pose a real challenge to the incumbent.\n\nIn fact, some believe Sobchak\u2019s candidacy will help the Kremlin portray the presidential election as more competitive than it actually is, given the fact that opposition leader Aleksei Navalny was banned from running for president because he was found guilty of embezzlement in February.\n\nOn the issue of Crimea, Sobchak stated that Russia violated a diplomatic memorandum pledging to respect Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty: \u201cI will be straightforward in my answer and tell you what I really think of this issue \u2013 I won\u2019t dodge or evade a question. From the standpoint of international law, Crimea belongs to Ukraine. Period. \u2026 We did not keep our promise. We breached the Budapest Memorandum of 1994.\u201d\n\nUkraine, Russia, the United States and the United Kingdom signed the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances in 1994, during a summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).\n\nUkraine, which at the time had the third-largest arsenal of nuclear weapons after the United States and Russia, pledged to give up its nuclear weapons and join the Nuclear Non-Nonproliferation Treaty.\n\nIn return, the parties to the memorandum reaffirmed their commitment to respect Ukraine\u2019s existing borders, independence, and territorial integrity; refrain from the threat or use of force; refrain from economic coercion; and not use their weapons against Ukraine, among other assurances.\n\nTwenty year later, in late February 2014, Russian forces invaded Crimea following popular anti-government protests in Kyiv and the ouster of then Ukrainian president Victor Yanukovych, who was backed by Moscow.\n\nAuthorities in Crimea held a referendum on the Black Sea peninsula\u2019s status on March 16, 2014, just a few days after they declared its independence from Ukraine. According to the Russian state news agency TASS, 96% of those who voted in the referendum supported Crimea\u2019s accession to Russia. Turnout for the referendum was 80%.\n\nEthnic Russians make up roughly 58% of the Crimean population, Ukrainians -- 24%, and Crimean Tatars -- 12%.\n\nFollowing the referendum, the UN General Assembly passed a non-binding resolution invalidating the change in Crimea\u2019s status, with 100 member states voting in favor, 11 against, and 58 abstaining.\n\nRussia denounced the resolution and voted against the measure.\n\nA short time later, during the April 2014 \u201cDirect Line with Vladimir Putin,\u201d an annual televised program during which the Russian president answers questions from citizens across the country, Putin denounced Yanukovych\u2019s removal as an \u201cunconstitutional coup, an armed seizure of power\u201d that had threatened the Russian-speaking population of Crimea and the rest of Ukraine.\n\nResidents of Crimea had asked Russia \u201cfor help,\u201d he said, and the goal of the Russian troops in Ukraine was \u201cto ensure proper conditions for the people of Crimea to be able to freely express their will.\u201d He added: \u201cAnd so we had to take the necessary measures in order to prevent the situation in Crimea unfolding the way it is now unfolding in southeastern Ukraine.\u201d\n\nJohn B. Bellinger III, a former legal adviser for the U.S. State Department, challenged this version of events.\n\n\u201cThe Ukrainian constitution requires that any changes to the territory of Ukraine be approved by a referendum of all of the Ukrainian people,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe requirement is consistent with general principles of international law, which respects the territorial integrity of states and does not recognize a right of secession by a group or region in a country unless the group or region has been denied a right to \u2018internal self-determination\u2019 (i.e., its right to pursue its own political, economic, social, and cultural development) by the central government or has been subject to grave human rights violations.\u201d\n\nThe factors legitimizing the \u201cright of remedial secession\u201d were not present in Crimea, Bellinger wrote, adding that even if Yanukovich\u2019s ouster was questionable, \u201cthis would not trigger any right under international law for Russia to intervene in the Ukraine or for Crimea to secede.\u201d\n\nAccording to Barry Kellman, a professor of law and director of the International Weapons Control Center at DePaul University's College of Law, while the Budapest Memorandum (as well as the CSCE treaty and the UN Charter) underpins Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, its lacks any means of enforcement.\n\nIn a report on nuclear proliferation for the Woodrow Wilson Center, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, Mariana Budjeryn, a PhD candidate at the Doctoral School of Political Science, Public Policy and International Relations at the Central European University in Hungary, wrote that the Budapest Memorandum \u201cfailed to deter Russian aggression because it imposed no immediate cost for its violation.\u201d\n\nBudjeryn concluded: \u201cThe political assurances it provided rested on the goodwill and self-restraint of the guarantors, an arrangement that can work between allies but not potential adversaries.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
