Is that the case?\n\nFirst, let\u2019s set the record straight on \u201cinner cities.\u201d Trump constantly \u2014 and incorrectly \u2014 uses the term as a synonym for black Americans, and as areas ravaged by crime and poverty. \u201cInner cities\u201d generally is used to describe low-income urban neighborhoods. But there was a big shift among black residents in recent decades, out of urban cities and into the suburbs. And it ignores the large black population in the rural South.\n\n\u201cUsing \u2018inner city\u2019 as a stand-in for \u2018black\u2019 is even less accurate than using \u2018suburban\u2019 as a stand-in for \u2018white,\u2019\u201d The Washington Post reported during the campaign. \u201cWhen Trump addresses black America by talking about urban centers, he overlooks the diversity of America\u2019s black population and the unique issues that affect the millions who live in the rural South and the suburbs.\u201d\n\nThe White House and the Office of Management and Budget did not respond to our request for an explanation of how Trump has prioritized black Americans or increased federal spending on programs that benefit low-income Americans, a disproportionately large number of whom are African American. So we looked at some major programs that benefit such populations.\n\nTrump\u2019s budget would increase defense spending by $54 billion and offset that with money taken from 18 other agencies. To put this figure in context, there is a backlog of about $225 billion in various projects that would help rebuild the country\u2019s inner cities. This includes projects to repair public housing, fix aging infrastructure, invest in schools and job training, and more, PolitiFact found.\n\nTrump\u2019s proposed budget plan included stark reductions for programs that help minorities, the poor, seniors and those with disabilities. Congress has not finished appropriations for fiscal 2018, which begins Oct. 1, although House and Senate appropriations committees have approved certain agency budgets. Some agency budgets were approved at higher levels than Trump\u2019s proposals, but still lower than fiscal 2017 levels.\n\nAlthough Trump promised to make funding for historically black colleges and universities a \u201cpriority,\u201d his budget called for less discretionary spending than the schools now receive, and there was no mention of any new federal investments that the school leaders requested.\n\nThe list goes on. For the Labor Department, Trump proposed shrinking Job Corps, a job-training program for disadvantaged youths. Trump would eliminate federal funding for after-school programs, which mostly help children of poor families. And he would eliminate the Minority Business Development Agency, which boosts businesses owned by minorities and are in minority communities.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has started using unemployment figures that give the impression that employment among black youths has substantially improved under his presidency. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly used a striking and misleading measure of black youth unemployment to make a case to black voters: \u201cFifty-eight percent of your youth is unemployed, what the hell do you have to lose?\u201d\n\nTrump was asked whether he has concerns about race relations \u2014 particularly between black and white communities, in the context of Charlottesville. His answer was that he was spending more money to fix and prioritize \u201cinner cities.\u201d This is incorrect on many levels.\n\n\u201cInner cities\u201d is not synonymous with black communities, so he gets a basic fact wrong about where black Americans are concentrated in this country. Moreover, Trump proposed steep reductions to a variety of programs that disproportionately affect minority communities and lower-income Americans, from education to housing. There is a $225 billion backlog to fix America\u2019s inner cities, yet Trump\u2019s budget does not reflect a genuine prioritization of projects to reduce this backlog.", "lang": "en"}
