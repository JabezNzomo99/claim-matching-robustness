The posts show photos of the front cover of \u201cThe Eyes of Darkness\u201d by Dean Koontz, and two photos of pages referencing illnesses that, when put together, sound similar to the new Wuhan coronavirus (now known as Covid-19).\n\nBut these photos show pages from two different books: one is from a 1981 novel describing a fictional \u201cbiological weapon\u201d, and the other is a prediction from a 2008 book written by a self-proclaimed psychic.\n\n\u201cThe Eyes of Darkness\u201d is a science fiction novel published in 1981. It references a fictional \u201cbiological weapon\u201d called \u201cWuhan-400\u201d that was designed to kill people but inadvertently gives one child psychic abilities.\n\nThe fictional \u201cWuhan-400\u201d and Covid-19 have little in common, bar that they both have some association with the Chinese city of Wuhan. The book says of \u201cWuhan-400\u201d that \u201cOnce infected, no one lives more than twenty-four hours\u201d and that its \u201ckill-rate is one hundred percent\u201d, something that is not true of Covid-19, which probably has a fatality rate of around 2%.\n\nThe other book that appears in the posts is called \u201cEnd of Days: Predictions and prophecies about the end of the world\u201d co-written by \u201cpsychic and spiritual teacher\u201d Sylvia Browne, and published in 2008. It claims that \u201cIn around 2020 a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and the bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve written more about the books and what they both describe here.", "lang": "en"}
