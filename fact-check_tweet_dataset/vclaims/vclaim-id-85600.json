In fact, the 16th time he said it was during remarks before traveling to Indiana for the speech: \u201cWe\u2019re going right now to Indiana. We\u2019re going to introduce a tax plan that\u2019s the largest tax cut, essentially, in the history of our country.\u201d\n\nThis tendency of Trump is all too familiar to The Fact Checker. He is quick to make claims full of superlatives \u2014 the greatest this and the most beautiful that \u2014 with little to no empirical evidence to support them. Trump proposed deep tax cuts, but so far, he has released only a nine-page framework that would start negotiations with lawmakers. Yet since five months ago, he flatly proclaimed his plan \u201cis actually bigger than Reagan tax cuts.\u201d\n\nThe Fact Checker has completed two-thirds of our year-long project analyzing, categorizing and tracking every false or misleading claim by Trump, as well as his flip-flops. As of our latest update Oct. 10, 2017, or his 264th day in office, the president has made 1,318 claims over 263 days. He has averaged five claims a day, even picking up pace since the six-month mark. (Our full interactive graphic can be found here.)\n\nWhen you track Trump\u2019s claims so closely, it can often feel like deja vu. Trump has a tendency to repeat himself, and that includes his false or misleading claims. (For an overview of his most frequently repeated claims, see our update from August when Trump surpassed the 1,000-claim mark.)\n\nMany of Trump\u2019s most frequent claims in the past month were about taxes. He repeatedly claimed that the United States pays the highest corporate taxes or that it is the highest-taxed nation. The latter is false; the former is misleading, as the effective U.S. corporate tax rate (what companies end up paying after deductions and benefits) end up being lower than the statutory tax rate.\n\nTrump now claims that between $3 trillion and $5 trillion, perhaps even more, of profits are held overseas by U.S. companies. There is no official statistic, as Trump notes, but his high-end figure appears to be an exaggeration. The Internal Revenue Service in 2012 said the figure was $2.3 trillion, and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that it had risen to $2.6 trillion in 2015. There are other estimates as well, but none top $2.8 trillion.\n\nTrump repeatedly got basic facts wrong about Hurricane Irma in Florida and Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. He claimed they made landfall as Category 5 storms \u2014 the most destructive kind \u2014 but they touched down as Category 4 and eventually reached Category 5 strength. How strong a hurricane is when it makes landfall, and then how much strength it gains or loses, is an important distinction for weather disasters.\n\nBut this lacks context. The TV audience size for NFL games is down this year, but it\u2019s unclear exactly why. \u201cAverage attendance at regular season NFL games last year was the highest since 2007, when the NFL set an record in attendance. The NFL says ticket sales are \u2018on par\u2019 with last year,\u201d according to the Associated Press. And professional football games remain among the most-watched televised events, the AP reported.\n\nTrump also repeatedly said the NFL protest \u201chas nothing to do with race.\u201d But players and coaches who defended the protests said it was over racial injustice. Trump blamed the NFL for not enforcing a rule \u201cthat\u2019s been in existence for a long time\u201d requiring players to stand for the anthem. But it turns out, it wasn\u2019t a rule; the NFL said players are \u201cencouraged but not required to stand for the national anthem\u201d and that teams can use discretion.\n\nTurns out, this was an instance where Trump glossed over key details to the point of inaccuracy \u2014 another Trump tendency with which The Fact Checker is quite familiar. During an Oct. 7, 2017, interview with former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee (R), Trump acknowledged that there are three different Kims, but they have the \u201csame attitude.\u201d Trump added, about Kim Jong-Un: \u201cI think this one\u2019s the worst of the group.\u201d\n\nSo, mystery solved on the Kim front. Still, we are eager to get to the bottom of another head-scratcher: Whether Trump\u2019s tax plan is the \u201cbiggest tax cut in U.S. history.\u201d When the details are finally revealed, Trump\u2019s track record so far suggests his claim will once again fall short.", "lang": "en"}
