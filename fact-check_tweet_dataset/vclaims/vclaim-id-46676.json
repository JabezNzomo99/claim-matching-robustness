Fact: No information was found about any international organisation with the name \u2018The Institute of World Demographics Research\u2019. Also, as per a report of \u2018Pew Research Centre\u2019, by 2050, out of India\u2019s total population, Muslims would account for 18.4%. So, the claim made in the post is \u2018FALSE\u2019.\n\nWhen searched on Google for \u2018The Institute of World Demographics Research\u2019, it was found that there is no such international institute with that name.
