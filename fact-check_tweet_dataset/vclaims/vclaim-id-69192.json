The victim\u2019s family has told me they\u2019ve received threats when trying to take to MSM about the payout. #draintheswamp #Shushfund.\" (We assume that \"take\" is a typo and was supposed to say \"talk.\")\n\nWe searched news accounts and found nothing about Pelosi authorizing such a payout. The tweet appears to be the only source of the information.\n\nAccording to RBC, a Russian media company with a history of independence, @TEN_GOP was a Russian troll account. It had posted 10,000 tweets by the time it was shut down in August 2017, two years after it launched. The fake account had nearly 150,000 followers -- far more than the real state party\u2019s twitter account of about 13,000.\n\nThe real Tennessee Republican Party contacted Twitter multiple times to report that @TEN_GOP was impersonating the party\u2019s actual account.\n\n\"It was very misleading, pretending to be our office,\" Tennessee Republican Party communications director Candice Dawkins told PolitiFact\n\nTwitter\u2019s press office didn\u2019t respond to an email from PolitiFact.\n\nBefore the election, @TEN_GOP tweeted a series of misinformation, according to the New York Times, such as ''Obama wants our children to be converted to Islam! Hillary will continue his mission.''\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the list of prominent people who tweeted out links from the account included political figures such as Michael Flynn and Roger Stone, celebrities such as Nicki Minaj and James Woods, and media personalities such as Ann Coulter and Chris Hayes.\n\nTwitter has said it had discovered that 2,752 accounts controlled by Russians.\n\nThe headline on Puppet String News states, \"Tennessee GOP twitter taken down after tweet exposing Pelosi involved in pedophilia.\"\n\nActually, Twitter took down the fake Russian news account in August, and we found no evidence that Pelosi was involved in a payout related to pedophilia.\n\nThe Puppet String News\u2019 website states that it was created by a U.S. Navy veteran who \"decided to get into alternative news to tell the truth to best of ability.\" We attempted to contact the website via a Facebook message and did not get a reply.\n\nWe rate this headline Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
