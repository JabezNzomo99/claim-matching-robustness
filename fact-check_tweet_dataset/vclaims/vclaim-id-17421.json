Its hotel in Las Vegas opened in 2008.\n\nAlthough Las Vegas is home to quite a few hotels that double as casinos, the Trump International Hotel is not one of them. Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization, told The Wall Street Journal in 2016 that he was discussing plans to build a casino next to the hotel, but he said the plans were preliminary and that the Trump Organization was focused on developments elsewhere.\n\nHe addressed the issue of a gaming license specifically in a 2013 interview with Las Vegas Inc. \u201cWe have no problem getting a gaming license, but we wanted to do something different here,\u201d Trump said of the hotel. \u201cWe wanted a true luxury resort experience. It\u2019s hard to have a high quality product when you walk into a \u2018ding, ding, ding\u2019 and there are people walking around in Hawaiian shirts with big plastic drink mugs.\u201d\n\nContrary to the claims of the Facebook post, The Daily Caller found no evidence that Trump was ever found not \u201ctrustworthy\u201d enough for a gaming license in Las Vegas. \u201cPresident Trump has, in fact, been found suitable to be involved in gaming in Nevada,\u201d Nevada Gaming Commission Chairman Tony Alamo told the Caller via email. \u201cHe was never denied a license.\u201d\n\nThe real estate mogul was granted a Nevada gaming license years before the Las Vegas hotel\u2019s opening, as part of a separate business venture.\n\n\u201cIn 2004, President Trump filed an application and submitted to an investigation into his background in relation to his ownership interest in the Riviera Hotel & Casino,\u201d Alamo explained. \u201cBoth the Nevada Gaming Control Board and the Nevada Gaming Commission voted unanimously to approve Trump\u2019s application for suitability as a shareholder (individually and by and through his companies), with just over 10% ownership interest, in the Riviera Holdings Corporation. Later that same year he sold his interest in the Riviera.\u201d\n\nSnopes identified an article from 1987 that may have spurred the claim. \u201cMr. Trump recently applied for a Nevada casino license, but Paul Bible, chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission at the time, said that Nevada regulators would look askance at any \u2018greenmailer\u2019 who hurts casino companies in Nevada by acquiring large quantities of stock in order to sell the stake back to the company at a premium,\u201d reads the article, published by The New York Times.\n\nThe passage refers to accusations that Trump bought a stake in a rival casino operator to then sell it back at a profit, an accusation lawyers for Trump denied.\n\nThe most recent addition to the Trump Hotels brand, the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Vancouver, British Columbia, opened in February 2017.", "lang": "en"}
