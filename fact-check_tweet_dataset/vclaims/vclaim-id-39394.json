The Kremlin loves destabilization,\u201d said Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and former Swedish diplomat who served as an economic advisor to Russia and Ukraine in the 1990s\n\nSteven Pifer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine said \u201cRussian actions just during the past five years have created major tensions in East-West relations.\u201d\n\nHe listed Russian actions that have heightened international tensions:\n\u2022 Seizure and illegal annexation of Crimea; support -- including with units of the Russian army -- for the continuing conflict in Donbas;\n\u2022 Violation of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty by developing and deploying a prohibited land-based cruise missile of intermediate range;\n\u2022 Large military exercises (some with no notice);\n\u2022 Interference in U.S. and other Western elections.\n\nPifer added that the West also bears responsibility, but the main blame falls on Russia\u2019s own actions.\n\n\u201cThis is not to say that the West is blameless for the deterioration in West-Russia relations, but Moscow's actions bear significant responsibility,\u201d he said.\n\nStephen Blank, a senior fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council said in response to Putin\u2019s claim: \u201cUkraine, Georgia, Syria, UK, the U.S. election interference and the hacking of the World Anti-Doping agency WADA \u2013 all show that he is, as usual lying.\u201d\n\nEdward Lucas, a British journalist and author, said Russia has been \u201ccausing problems for its neighbors since 1991.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
