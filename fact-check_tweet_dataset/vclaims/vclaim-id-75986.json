The issue will appear on the November ballot.\n\nOne question many voters want answered: How much will the new tax cost me?\n\nIn a brochure outlining how rapid transit can boost the economy and ease traffic congestion, Hillsborough Area Regional Transit says the tax will cost the average family $12 a month.\n\nThat figure comes from the Hillsborough County Metropolitan Planning Organization\u2019s long-range transportation plan. It puts the cost of a 1 cent sales tax for the average family at $142 a year, and the average for a single person at $85 a year.\n\nThe MPO came up with those numbers by plugging the county\u2019s household incomes into the IRS sales tax deduction calculator, available on the agency\u2019s Web site. The IRS developed the calculator because tax rules allow people to deduct either sales taxes paid annually or state income tax from their federal returns, and the calculator enables them to arrive at a reasonable estimate without having to save a basket of receipts.\n\nMPO planner Beth Alden said she used average household income rather than median income. \u201cThe number we\u2019ve been using is the higher one, just to be more conservative,\u201d she said.\n\nThe county\u2019s average family of three has a household income of $77,852, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. A single household\u2019s average income is $44,832.\n\nWe plugged those figures into the IRS calculator and it showed the average family would pay $141.83 a year in local sales tax, which currently is 1 percent. A single person would pay $91.50. \n\nThat\u2019s virtually the same as the MPO estimates.\n\nThe figure does not include sales taxes on major purchases, such as cars, mobile homes or construction materials for a house. Those are listed separately on tax returns. The county sales tax on items worth more than $5,000 is capped, meaning the maximum amount paid on any single item would be $50.\n\nBut how accurate is the IRS calculator?\n\nSkeptical observers say it spits out a low figure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the IRS\u2019 interest to have that on the lower end, obviously, to decrease the deductions,\u201d said Rusty Spoor, a tax accountant at Foley & Lardner. He guessed the calculator could be as much as 30 percent off.\n\nLike other tax experts, he noted it\u2019s impossible to determine exactly how much people pay a year in sales taxes without saving receipts, so the IRS calculator is a useful tool.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the best of the poorest options,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that number\u2019s great, but it\u2019s the best starting point.\u201d\n\nThe calculator is based on spending patterns captured in the Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted annually by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, IRS spokesperson Florida Mike Dobzinski said.\n\nThat\u2019s the best method for calculating how much people pay in sales tax, according to Frank Williams, chief economist for the Florida Department of Revenue\u2019s Office of Tax Research.\n\n\u201cIt should be fairly close,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may understate it by 2 to 5 percent, but that\u2019s just a gut feel.\u201d \n\nOpponents of the sales tax say it will cost residents much more than the MPO estimates.\n\nJim Hosler, a demographer running for Hillsborough County commissioner, initially figured it would cost households nearly $400 a year.\n\nHe came up with that number by dividing the estimated revenue from the tax \u2014 about $174 million, according to the Florida Legislative Committee on Intergovernmental Relations \u2014 by 454,000, the approximate number of households in Hillsborough County.\n\nThat comes about $383.\n\nTrouble is, residents aren\u2019t the only ones who pay sales taxes. Tourists, commuters and businesses also pay them. Experts say there\u2019s no way to know exactly who pays what, but most estimate that non-residents bear about 20 percent of the tax burden. Under that calculation, the cost is $307 per household.\n\nBut that spreads out sales taxes equally among all households, regardless of income. And a household that earns $200,000 a year will pay much more in sales taxes than a $20,000 household, simply by virtue of having more disposable income.\n\nHosler concedes his number may be high. \u201cBut their number is definitely a low number,\u201d he said. \u201cThe real number is probably somewhere in between.\u201d\n\nClearly there are a number of ways to calculate the figure, and the result for all of them is a somewhat imprecise.\n\nStill, our research shows that the number in the brochure is very close to the one provided by the MPO, and HART used a recognized, legitimate source in coming up with the figure. The IRS calculation, while perhaps on the low side, is a recognized standard. So we rate the statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
