Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown by NATO-backed forces in 2011.\n\nSecurity experts say the turmoil has allowed ISIS to in the North African country, allowing the jihadists a haven from which to train and plan attacks abroad.\n\nAnd while ISIS is blamed for in recent months, experts strongly disagree with a claim GOP frontrunner Donald Trump repeated on April 27 during his foreign policy speech in Washington.\n\n\"And now ISIS is making millions of dollars a week selling Libyan oil,\" in the speech.\n\nExperts and news articles say ISIS has attacked Libya\u2019s oil fields to disrupt oil markets and prevent rival groups from making a profit. But, they say, the group does not have the ability to operate the country\u2019s few and complex oil refineries.\n\n, an expert on Libya and terrorism with the nonpartisan Middle East Institute, called Trump\u2019s claim \"absolutely untrue.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t know where he got this gem of misinformation,\" he told PolitiFact.\n\nClaudia Gazzini, a Tripoli-based senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, also rejected Trump\u2019s statement.\n\nGazzini said in an email to PolitiFact: \"While it is true that ISIS has attacked oil fields in the Sirte basin area and destroyed key equipment there, they have not sought to keep control of the oil fields.\n\n\"At the moment they appear to have adopted a hit-and-run strategy. There is no evidence that they are pumping out the crude oil and certainly no evidence that they are trading it. At the moment they just appear interested in starving the Libyan state of oil revenues.\"\n\nGazzini made the same comments to the Washington Post Fact Checker when it Trump made on NBC\u2019s Today show on April 21. The Post gave Trump four Pinocchios, which it reserves for only the biggest falsehoods.\n\nThe West Point-based also examined the ISIS/Libyan oil question. In a March 17 report it stated: \"It is simply hard for the Islamic State to do much in (Libya\u2019s oil fields) beyond episodic attacks.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request to explain his comment.\n\nTrump said, \"ISIS is making millions of dollars a week selling Libyan oil.\"\n\nExperts and news reports say ISIS has attacked Libya\u2019s oil fields in recent months, amid the country\u2019s instability. But they roundly reject Trump\u2019s claim that ISIS jihadists based in that country have been able to seize, refine and sell the oil for \"millions of dollars a week.\" Instead, they say, the terrorist group is focused on disrupting oil markets and preventing rivals from getting the oil in Libya.", "lang": "en"}
