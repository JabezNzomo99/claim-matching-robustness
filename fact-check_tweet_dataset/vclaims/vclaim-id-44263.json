Fact checkers Truth or Fiction debunked the post in March 2015, followed by the Hoax-Slayer site in February 2017 and Vice in August 2017.\n\nDespite the instant-noodles-and-wax claim being debunked multiple times over two decades, it has persisted and continues to circulate on social media.\n\nAAP FactCheck contacted Gary Kennedy, a National Food Safety Auditor and food safety consultant with Correct Food Systems, a compliance advisory company, for an expert opinion.\n\nMr Kennedy told AAP FactCheck in an email that the post is untrue and listed three reasons why instant noodles do not stick together. Mr Kennedy wrote:\n\n\u201c1. Instant noodles are fried. They all have a slippery coating on the outside from the frying oil - the same oil we use in our homes. This helps to prevent them sticking together.\n\n\u201c2. They generally have smooth surfaces and so there are few rough surfaces to \u2018catch\u2019 and cause them to stick together. Pasta such as spaghetti has similar properties. This is analogous to human hair, which does have a rough surface. If you don\u2019t comb your hair, it sticks together and forms dreadlocks.\n\n\u201c3. You eat them soon after you cook them. If you do let pasta or noodles sit around after cooking in the pot or bowl to cool, they will set into one big lump. This is an effect of the starch released in cooking acting as a glue. This is why you often wash pasta and rice after cooking, so that the released starch does not cause the noodles, pasta or rice to stick to one another.\u201d\n\nRegarding the claims about wax, Mr Kennedy said noodle cups don\u2019t have a wax coating nor is there a wax coating on instant noodles.\n\n\u201cThe polystyrene cup has a flat surface from the manufacturing process that does not need a release mechanism such as a wax being applied,\" he said.\n\n\u201cThe article talks about wax being dangerous. Beeswax is a common wax used in the food industry and it\u2019s natural and 100 per cent edible.\u201d\n\nMr Kennedy said all waxes used in the food industry have to be medically proven to be safe.\n\n\u201cFood in contact with wax is common - think Edam cheese such as the Babybel brand,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWax seals on jars and bottles is a traditional method of sealing containers. Many shiny foods have a wax coating applied.\u201d\n\nMr Kennedy said waxes used in the food industry are not broken down in the body.\n\n\u201cThey pass out of your body unabsorbed. They do not accumulate,\u201d he told AAP FactCheck.", "lang": "en"}
