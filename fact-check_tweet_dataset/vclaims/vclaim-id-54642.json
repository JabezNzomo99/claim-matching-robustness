A Trump campaign spokesperson refuted the claim.\n\nThe Rolling Stones, working with performing rights organization BMI, asked the Trump campaign to no longer play their music at campaign events and threatened to sue if they did not stop, according to Deadline. The band\u2019s 1968 hit song \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want\u201d has been played as Trump\u2019s walk-off song at the end of his rallies and events, per CNN.\n\nThe viral image claims Trump called the Rolling Stones un-American for not allowing their music to be played at rallies, even though the band is originally from London.\n\nBut there\u2019s no evidence of Trump calling the band un-American. Had he done so, it would have been picked up by major media outlets, yet none have reported on it. A search of Factbase, an online database that collects Trump\u2019s public statements, turned up no instances of Trump making such a remark.\n\nThere is also no record of Trump ever tweeting the statement. Searching Trump\u2019s verified Twitter accounts \u2013 @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS \u2013 and ProPublica\u2019s archive of his deleted tweets turned up no matches. The Daily Caller found just one tweet from Trump mentioning the British band in 2012, when he congratulated them on their 50th anniversary.\n\nA Trump campaign spokesperson confirmed in an email to the Caller that neither Trump nor the campaign called the Stones un-American.
