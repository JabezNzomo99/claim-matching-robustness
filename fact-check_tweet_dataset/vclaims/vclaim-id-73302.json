This is false; the people who appear in the photo with the Democratic vice presidential candidate are not her parents, but rather two attendees at a fundraising gala.\n\n\u201cHELLO, EVERYONE. I\u2019M KAMALA HARRIS AND THESE ARE MY PARENTS,\u201d says an August 11, 2020 Facebook post, which adds: \u201cBUT WHY DO I PRETEND TO BE BLACK AMERICAN????\u201d\n\nThe same photo has also been used to make the claim on Instagram here.\n\nJoe Biden announced on August 11 that Harris -- who embraces both her black and South Asian ancestry -- would be his running mate to challenge President Donald Trump in November's election.\n\nHarris\u2019s father, Donald Harris, was born in Jamaica, and her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was originally from southern India. They divorced when Harris was a child.\n\nNeither of them is pictured in the photo of Harris that is circulating on social media, the original version of which was posted on the Facebook page of education NGO Pratham USA on August 27, 2016, years after her mother\u2019s death in 2009.\n\n\u201cThe photo is\u2026 not of her parents,\u201d a spokesperson for Pratham USA told AFP by telephone, saying it was taken at a fundraising gala for the organization in California at which Harris spoke. She was the attorney general of the state at the time.\n\nThe man and the woman pictured with Harris \u201care two supporters of Pratham,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nAFP Fact Check has previously debunked social media posts claiming that Harris was ineligible for the vice presidency because her parents were born outside the United States.", "lang": "en"}
