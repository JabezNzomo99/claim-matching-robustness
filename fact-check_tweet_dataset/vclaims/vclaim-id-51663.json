It\u2019s doing better than the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Sweden and Chile, but worse than France, Canada and Germany, to pick a few examples.\n\nFactoring in population size, the United States has one of the highest rates globally of people who have tested positive \u2014 16,430 per million residents, which is lower than Chile, but higher than any other large country. Put another way, the virus is known to have infected a higher fraction of the population in the U.S. than in many other places.\n\nTrump often says that the United States finds more cases because it tests more than other nations. We\u2019ve rated that claim False and Pants on Fire, depending on how he says it. Testing is a way to measure progress against the coronavirus, but the key indicator of progress is whether the percentage of tests that come back positive declines as more tests are done.\n\nWith a positivity rate of about 7%, the United States ranks in the middle of the pack, doing better than countries such as Mexico and Argentina, but worse than just about every country in Europe, as well as Canada and Australia.\n\nTrump said that the United States\u2019 COVID-19 \"numbers are better than almost all countries.\" The White House pointed to one number to back that up \u2014 the number of deaths relative to the number of known cases. But the source it cited said that wasn\u2019t a good measure of the threat of the disease.\n\nBy other yardsticks, the United States is doing worse than many countries, including many major developed economies.\n\nIt has a higher death rate in relation to its population, the virus is known to have reached a larger share of the population, and the percentage of tests that come back positive is higher than in many other nations.", "lang": "en"}
