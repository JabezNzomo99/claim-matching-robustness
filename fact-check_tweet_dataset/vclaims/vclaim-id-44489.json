Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the posts.\n\nFact: While it is true that there was a standoff between Indian & Chinese troops near the border, the videos posted are old. They are not related to the recent incidents along the LAC. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the same video went viral in 2019 as then recent video, FACTLY has debunked the video and found the video to be related to a conflict that took place on 15 August 2017 between Indian and Chinese soldiers near Pangong lake in Ladakh.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, the same video was found in the search results. A user has uploaded the same video on 13 January 2020 with the title \u2013 \u2018Chinese army arguing with Indo Tibetan Border Police (I.T.B.P.) in Border of Arunachal Pradesh\u2019. So, the video is not related to the recent incidents in May 2020.\n\nThe same video is being circulated on the internet at least from 2017. The \u2018Deccan Herald\u2019 has posted the same video on YouTube in July 2017 with the title \u2013 \u2018Watch: Jawans stop Chinese soldiers from entering Indian territory Part 1\u2019.\n\nTo sum it up, several old videos revived in the context of recent India-China border standoff.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
