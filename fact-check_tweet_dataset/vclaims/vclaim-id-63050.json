It is being claimed that the video shows an employee of 'Zee News' attacking a doctor for trying to administer a COVID-19 test. The viral clip is being circulated amid the news of atleast 28 Zee News employees testing positive for COVID-19.\n\nSimple Keyword search led to the same video being shared extensively on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\n\nThe same video shared by Twitter user Neha (@ShantiseAshanTi) has more than 300,000 Views.\n\n\n\nA Zee News employee attacked a doctor in a hospital. The doctor was trying to administer a COVID-19 test.\n\nOn InVID, a video verification tool, the keyframes of the video were extracted. A reverse image search of keyframes led to the same video that was uploaded by China Global Television Network (CGTN) on October 15, 2018.\n\n\n\nAccording to the CGTN report, the incident occurred on September 22, 2018, when a pregnant woman's husband and daughter attacked a gynaecologist at Peking University's 'First Hospital' for refusing to perform a Cesarean delivery.\n\n\n\nOn searching Google for 'Gynaecologist attacked in China', we found multiple reports confirming the video was sourced from CCTV cameras installed at the Peking University Hospital.\n\nTherefore, given the evidence, it can be confirmed that an old video from China is being shared with false claims of a Zee News employee attacking a doctor for trying to administer a COVID-19 test.\n\nThe claim is false. An Old video from China's Peking University showing a disgruntled relative of a patient attacking a doctor is being shared with false claims.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343", "lang": "en"}
