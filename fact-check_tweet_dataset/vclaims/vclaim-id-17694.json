This can be useful for cough and cold, but not slip disc. Sometimes people use certain herbs that can help in reducing pain to some extent but if we say that this decoction can actually cure slip disc, so this isn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nDr. Sanjeev Kumar, C.S.C, D.C.H, M.B.B.S, General Physician (34 years of experience): \u201cThis claim is an absolutely foolish gimmick.\u201d\n\nThe image was shared from the page \u2018\u0918\u0930\u0947\u0932\u0941 \u0928\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0915\u0947\u2019. We observed the name of a website at the top of the image and its social media pages.\n\nWhen we visited the website, there was a disclaimer that says, \u201cThis site is not intended to provide diagnosis, treatment or medical advice.

Please consult with the physician or other healthcare professional regarding any medical or health related diagnosis or treatment options. The results from the product may vary from person to person.\u201d\n\nWe also found the same post on the Facebook and Instagram page mentioned on the post.\n\nVishvas News tried to contact the doctor on the number given on the website of AllAyurvedic, but the doctor was not available to comment on the query.\n\nThe website itself is stating on its disclaimer that it is not intended to provide any diagnosis or treatment. Which means one cannot rely on or follow the treatment provided by the website.\n\nWe used StalkScan to check the previously shared posts from the page \u2018\u0918\u0930\u0947\u0932\u0941 \u0928\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0915\u0947\u2019. There were many health-related posts shared by the page but their authenticity wasn\u2019t determined.\n\nWe also searched the website of the page \u2018\u0918\u0930\u0947\u0932\u0941 \u0928\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0915\u0947\u2019, the name of which was mentioned on the About page, which landed us to:\n\nAlso, there is no research that authenticates the claim.\n\nThe viral photo claiming that a decoction made of ginger powder, 4 cloves, and black pepper if consumed twice a day can cure the problem of slip disc, is fake.I\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
