The case was investigated and subsequently closed by the CBI. Ever since his disappearance, social media has been thick with rumours that Najeeb had joined the ISIS.\n\nThe above message has been circulated on WhatsApp along with a photograph showing young men posing in front of the ISIS banner. \u201cOur Najeeb, Najeeb of JNU, Najeeb of Azadi gang. Beloved of leftists, he has been placed in ISIS directly from JNU. He has sent his wishes to Rahul ji and Kejri sir ji from Syria (translation)\u201d, says the message. The photograph claims to show Najeeb, who is supposedly in the centre of the photo.\n\nAlt News has already debunked this claim twice earlier. This time, the rumour started circulating after a tweet by Najeeb\u2019s mother addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, inquiring about her missing son.\n\nThat Najeeb Ahmed has joined the ISIS is a rumour which has been circulating since early 2018. In August 2017, a student of the Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Vellore had gone missing and was suspected to have joined the ISIS, investigators had concluded on the basis of text messages the 23-year old had sent to his family before he went missing.\n\nSo as it turned out, news of a Najeeb from VIT, Vellore who was suspected to have joined the ISIS was conflated, deliberately or otherwise, with the disappearance of JNU\u2019s Najeeb Ahmed, and shared widely on social media platforms and WhatsApp. In the past, BJP leaders such as Ram Madhav and Swapan Dasgupta have fallen prey to this misinformation.\n\nIn March 2017, Times of India published an unverified story, according to which \u2018sources\u2019 had told the newspaper that JNU\u2019s Najeeb Ahmed was an ISIS sympathiser, revealed by his browsing history. The report claimed that according to police sources, Najeeb used to watch videos of ISIS on YouTube.\n\nThe \u2018report\u2019 was picked up and relayed by multiple news organisations, before Delhi Police confirmed that the news was bogus\u2013 there was no truth to the report that Najeeb had viewed pro-ISIS videos.\n\nWhat is the origin of the viral photo?\n\nAlt News reverse searched the image and discovered that the photograph of ISIS fighters used along with the message claiming Najeeb has joined ISIS, was clicked in the year 2015 by Reuters. It is part of a photo album titled \u2018Battle For Iraq\u2018, and was uploaded in March 2015.\n\nDisinformation about Najeeb Ahmed joining ISIS circulates on social media every few months, despite being debunked.", "lang": "en"}
