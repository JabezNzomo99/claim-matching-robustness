During his speech a baby starts to cry, and Trump says: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that baby, I love babies. \u2026 I hear that baby crying. I like it. What a baby. What a beautiful baby. Don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. The mom\u2019s running around like \u2014 don\u2019t worry about it, you know. It\u2019s young and beautiful and healthy, and that\u2019s what we want.\u201d\n\nSo, just from watching the video, Trump sounds rather cruel. But what\u2019s missing is what the mother was doing. As it happens, Daniel Dale, a reporter from the Toronto Star, was sitting right behind her and wrote that the entire incident was mischaracterized.\n\nThe baby was one row in front of me, three or four rows from the stage, at Trump\u2019s event at a high school in Ashburn, Va. When it began to cry, Trump said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that baby, I love babies. I love babies. I hear that baby crying, I like it. I like it. What a baby, what a beautiful baby. Don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. The mom\u2019s running around \u2014 don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d People applauded. One minute later, though, the baby began to cry again. This time, the mother quickly decided to take the baby out of the room. Trump, looking in our direction, appeared to notice that she was on her way to the exit. And then he said, \u201cActually, I was only kidding. You can get the baby out of here. That\u2019s all right. Don\u2019t worry. I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I\u2019m speaking?\u201d He cupped his hand over his eyes to watch her leave. \u201cThat\u2019s okay, people don\u2019t understand. That\u2019s okay.\u201d A joke? Possibly. An insensitive, heartless, ordinary-person-embarrassing remark? Possibly. Trump\u2019s tone is eternally hard to read. But, to my eyes, it certainly was not an ejection \u2014 it was an unusually barbed endorsement of the mother\u2019s own decision to depart. One other salient fact is missing from all the pieces on babygate. Mom and baby, very much not kicked out, came back to their seat a bit later.\n\nDale had this perspective because he was not sitting in the news media corral. \u201cI almost never request press credentials from the Trump campaign anymore \u2014 partly because I like being in the crowd rather than the pen,\u201d he told The Fact Checker. \u201cI was lucky, this time, that the usher people seated me very close to the stage, and one row behind the baby. There was one empty seat up there.\u201d\n\nVirtually no one in the media noticed Dale\u2019s version of events. He said he did not seek to interview the mother himself, as he did not realize until later how much attention had been paid to this incident. (Dale, incidentally, is one of the reporters who exposed the misdeeds of former Toronto mayor Rob Ford.)\n\n\u201cThe media did in fact blow this entire situation out of proportion,\u201d she wrote in an email to The Fact Checker. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to make it into anything bigger. All I\u2019m hoping is that Trump personally is aware that I am in agreement with him and stand by the fact that I was never kicked out of the rally.\u201d\n\nShe said that she decided to leave the auditorium on her own because \u201cit\u2019s the considerate thing to do for others around, trying to listen or for those presenting,\u201d adding that \u201cit was blatantly obvious he was joking.\u201d She said she stood with the police officers outside the auditorium, who were very kind to her, and then returned to her seat once her child had calmed down.", "lang": "en"}
