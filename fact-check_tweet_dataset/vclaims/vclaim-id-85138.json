(In fact, NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue repeated that statistic during her speech at the Democratic National Convention.) So we checked the facts.\n\nThe claim is a reference to the findings of a 2011 study by Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research organization, using data from the 2008 Abortion Patient Survey of nearly 9,500 women. Researchers used survey data to find the first abortion rate for age subgroups, multiplied the rate by the number of years in each age group, and added up the number of first-time abortions that had taken place by the time women were 45 years old. This was called the \u201ccumulative first abortion rate,\u201d through which they came up with the \u201clifetime incidence\u201d of abortion, or the \u201cone in three\u201d figure.\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute usually adds the caveat that the figure is based on the 2008 abortion rate, and we have urged advocates and politicians to do the same. But the claim in the letter did not contain any caveat. Instead, it said one in three women (no age specification) has already had an abortion.\n\nThe latest national abortion data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are from 2012, when there were 699,202 legal induced abortions reported from 49 reporting areas. The abortion rate was 13.2 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44 years. Census data show there were 62.3 million women aged 15 to 45 in 2012. One-third of that is 20.6 million women. These numbers show the claim in this letter is not correct.\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute is now analyzing the 2014 Abortion Patient Survey. (These surveys are conducted every six to eight years.) Findings from the 2014 survey will be the first update since 2008. Without the breakdown of first-time abortions of women ages 15 to 44 in 2014, we can\u2019t definitively say whether this statistic would increase or decrease, or by how much \u2014 though previous trends indicate it could decrease.\n\nThe decline in abortion rates from 1992 to 2008 was accompanied by a parallel decline in the proportion of women expected to have an abortion by 45. We do not know yet if the 2014 data will show the same trend.\n\n\u201cWhen Guttmacher says these women [one in three by age 45] will have an abortion, they suggest an inference of data \u2014 that these rates stay constant \u2014 instead of a projection,\u201d NARAL spokeswoman Kaylie Hanson Long said. \u201cWithout new data, we have to presume rates have stayed constant. We wish this specific kind of data could be released more frequently, but until that\u2019s the case, we will use this data.\u201d\n\nGuttmacher Institute spokeswoman Rebecca Wind noted the findings were, indeed, a projection: \u201cAt the time those data were published, it was an accurate statement to say that one in three women would have an abortion by age 45 (not has had an abortion, it\u2019s a projection by the end of their reproductive years).\u201d\n\nWind said no data support the claim in the letter: \u201cWe anticipate an update to that figure using more current data sometime in the next year, but at the moment, there is no current data to support that statement.\u201d\n\nThe broader point made in the letter, Hanson Long said, is that \u201cabortion is a common medical procedure under attack by anti-choice politicians. It\u2019s a procedure that must be respected and available, given there\u2019s a clear need for it for so many women in this country. . . . The issue of abortion access should not be pushed to the sidelines \u2014 it should be a central part of any discussion of how to help women become full partners in society.\u201d\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute\u2019s 2011 report found that one in three women will have an abortion by age 45, if 2008 abortion rates prevailed. Until the study of the 2014 data is complete, we will not know whether this rate has remained constant. The Guttmacher Institute usually adds the caveat that the figure is based on the 2008 abortion rate, and we have urged advocates and politicians do the same. In this case, the statistic was simplified way too much \u2014 that one in three women (with no age specification) have had (not \u201cwill have by age 45\u201d) an abortion. This statistic is unsupported by facts and earns Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
