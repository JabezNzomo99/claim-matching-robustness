The claim is false; police said it appeared to be misinformation, an AFP journalist said her phone still worked, and Twitter suspended hundreds of accounts that used the hashtag for violating its manipulation policy.\n\n\u201cThis is what the capital looked like shortly before this radio silence,\u201d said one tweet shared 11,800 times since June 1, 2020. A screenshot of it was later shared on Instagram.\n\nA second tweet used the same image to claim: \u201c#DCBlackout This picture is the last we saw before all media was cut at 1am. An entire city was on fire and suddenly went silent.\u201d It was also shared on Facebook.\n\n\u201cThe US government cut all communications in D.C. from 1AM to 6AM,\u201d a similar Instagram post claimed.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that communications were cut in Washington.\n\n\u201cThis appears to be misinformation. We have no confirmation of a cell phone blackout,\u201d Alaina Gertz, spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police Department, said by email.\n\nAFP video journalist Agnes Bun said she was \u201cnear the White House until roughly 1:30 am, and I had no issue at all with my phone connection.\u201d\n\nNetblocks, a civil society group that monitors internet shutdowns, tweeted similarly to say they found \u201cno indication of a mass-scale internet disruption from Washington, DC.\u201d\n\nTwitter said it is \u201cactively investigating the hashtag\u201d and has \u201csuspended hundreds of spammy accounts\u201d under its platform manipulation policy, which guards against actions intended to artificially amplify information.\n\nA spokesman for the company said by email: \"We're taking action proactively on any coordinated attempts to disrupt the public conversation around this issue.\"\n\nAlex Engler, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes in artificial intelligence and policy, said by phone that he calculated upwards of 30,000 retweets of false or misleading content shared under the hashtag.\n\nHe pointed to one tweet from @sarahxo85267698, an account that was subsequently suspended, which claimed phones in DC were \u201cjammed.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone clearly wrote that and then you saw that account screenshotted and then that account was deleted. That\u2019s a fairly classic way to disseminate this.\u201d\n\nAmid nationwide protests over Floyd's death in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Engler said people wanting to spread misinformation know how to make emotionally charged content that aligns well with pre-existing outrage so it is ripe for sharing.\n\nHe said he observed inauthentic accounts retweeting content with the hashtag #DCBlackout, but they had low follower counts.\n\n\u201cThe bots are not actually there to spread the disinformation,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey're used to make the material seem true and seem trustworthy. Then you have actual people with actual networks disseminating this.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
