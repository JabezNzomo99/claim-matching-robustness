She adds that this new version can be found in vegetables and that the \"Tiranga virus\" has taken over Maharashtra.\n\n\n\nAn unknown virus infecting tomatoes is linked to the coronavirus and can be transmitted to humans upon consumption. According to a report by Indian Express, farmers cultivating tomato in Maharashtra have complained of an unidentified disease that is causing early ripening and loss of yield of their crops. Reportedly, the samples of affected tomato plants were sent to Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Horticulture Research on May 14, to identify an \"unknown\" virus wreaking havoc in the crop. \"The damage to the crop has been extensive. The plant leaves are drying up and the ripened tomatoes are developing irregular shapes and losing their sap. The crop ready for harvesting has been lost to the viral outbreak,\" Hindu Businessline quoted Dr Navale as saying. None of the reports mentioned any link to the contagious Coronavirus. A keyword search led to a video uploaded by Zee 24Taas, a Marathi news channel where Dr Navale rubbishes all connections between the virus affecting tomatoes and the novel Coronavirus.\n\nA website called Agri News Network published a report that said that Dr BNS Murthy, Horticulture Commissioner, Department of Agriculture Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) has written a letter to the channel TV9 Bharatvarsh, asking them to retract the 'the baseless and scary capsule.' \"...the second part of the story that eating such fruits would cause much more complications than that of Corona virus is absurd. As of date no plant virus affecting plants has affected human beings as they lack the receptors for such an infection,\" the letter reads. It is noteworthy to mention that TV9 Bharatvarsh in a report on May 15 said that people had connected a report by them to coronavirus and were spreading rumours. According to the channel they had said no such thing in their report and the earlier report only spoke about the damage to the tomato crop faced by tomato farmers.", "lang": "en"}
