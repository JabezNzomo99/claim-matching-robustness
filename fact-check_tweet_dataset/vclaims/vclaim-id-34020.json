The story, which deceptively features a photo from a London concert, originated on a website that calls its work satire.\n\nPresident Donald Trump was scheduled to hold a rally in Chicago during his 2016 presidential campaign, but the campaign cancelled the event amid protests.\n\nSince then, Trump has visited the city \u2014 including as president in October 2019, when he spoke at a police chiefs conference and attended a private campaign fundraiser.\n\nBut it\u2019s not true that he recently held a rally there with \u201cupwards of 150,000\u2033 supporters. That erroneous claim has been spread by thousands on social media under the headline, \u201cTrump Rally Crowd Size In Chicago Shows Dems Are Turning To Trump.\u201d\n\nThe false report is illustrated with a photo that does not show a Trump rally, but was instead taken at the storied 1985 Live Aid concert in London. The same photo previously has been doctored and shared on social media to advance the erroneous claim that it depicted a Trump rally \u201cin downtown Philly.\u201d\n\nBoth bogus claims leave the impression that reliably Democratic strongholds are drifting toward Trump. In the 2016 election, more than 83 percent of voters in Chicago voted for Trump\u2019s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. And in Philadelphia, where more than three-quarters of voters are registered Democrats, more than 82 percent of voters cast ballots for Clinton.\n\nThe latest made-up report originated in December 2019 on dailyworldupdate.us, part of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Last Line of Defense,\u201d a self-described satirical publication whose headlines often dupe social media users despite disclaimers on its websites.\n\nThe story was republished on the website ajuanews.com, where the only disclaimer is a small watermark on the image. That version was shared by nearly 25,000 Facebook users, according to CrowdTangle data. Another version also appeared on the website \u201cscaryhalloweencostumes2019.com.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
