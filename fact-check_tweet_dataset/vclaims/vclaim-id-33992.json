Actor and filmmaker Aparna Sen was among those who shared it.\n\nThe image has been morphed. One can spot the areas where the original image has been edited. In the viral image, the pixelation is clearly visible and highlighted below.\n\nAlt News did a reverse image search on Google and found a November 5, 2019 article by The Hindu which carried the same photograph. The report is on police protest outside the Delhi Police headquarters. This was a protest in response to the November 4 incident where few lawyers thrashed a policeman at Saket Court, New Delhi.\n\nThe image shared by Aparna Sen is also of the same incident. Alt News found the original photograph in a November 5, 2019 report by Dainik Jagran. In the original photograph, the placard has the words \u201cwe want justice\u201d.\n\nMorphed images of Delhi police personnel protesting after a scuffle with lawyers in November 2019 are now being shared with the false claim that the police joined the protest against CAB and NRC.\n\n[Update: Aparna Sen\u2019s tweet was added to the fact-check on January 13, 2020.]", "lang": "en"}
