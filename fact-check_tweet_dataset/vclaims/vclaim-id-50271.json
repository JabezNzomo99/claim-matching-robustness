{"title": "FALSE: Briones says that once classes start 'patay kung patay,' 'matira matibay'", "subtitle": "Education Secretary Leonor Briones did not say this. These graphics were altered from a quote card produced by ABS-CBN News.", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Jul 20, 2020 11:02 AM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-50271", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/briones-says-once-classes-start-patay-kung-patay-matira-matibay", "vclaim": "Facebook users Garence Lagrimas and Aldrin Garcia, respectively, circulated two graphics attributing quotes to Briones, saying, \"August 24 magbubukas na ng klase, patay kung patay (Classes will open on August 24, if we die, we die),\" and \"August 24 magbubukas na ng klase kaya matira matibay (Classes will open on August 24 so those who are strong will survive).\"\n\nThese graphics bore the logo of ABS-CBN News and were dated July 15. The first one was watermarked \"@garenceeeee\" and the second was watermarked \"TriggeringNormiesxPSMP.\"\n\nOverall, the two posts acquired 593 reactions, 31 comments, and 816 shares as of writing. These posts were flagged by Facebook Claim Check, a tool that detects potentially false information on the platform.\n\nMany users who shared the posts seemed to believe these claims were true, placing captions such as \"Bakbakan with covid 19 is real (Battle with COVID-19 is real)!\" and \"Mauna ka na po (Please be the first).\"\n\nThe original quote card posted by ABS-CBN News on July 15 attributed this quote to Briones: \"August 24 magbubukas na ng klase (Classes will open on August 24) whatever form it is.\"\n\nThis quote was taken from a meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte on July 15. Briones did not say \"patay kung patay\" or \"matira matibay.\" (READ: No backing down: Briones says classes will open on August 24 'whatever form it is')\n\nOn July 11, Rappler also debunked a similar false post that claimed Commission on Higher Education Chairman Prospero de Vera III said \"we are ready to die\" in the context of opening classes in August. The post manipulated a Rappler graphic. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
