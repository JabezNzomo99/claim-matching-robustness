Which organisation is this? You guessed it, it\u2019s the HOUSE OF COMMONS\u201d\n\nThe post claims that large numbers of UK MPs are accused or have been arrested for some kind of misconduct, and altogether cost the taxpayer almost \u00a393 million this year alone in expenses.\n\nNone of this is correct.\n\nIn fact it\u2019s a viral post about politicians that has been circulating for years, being repurposed for a new country every so often. When Snopes factchecked it back in 2000 it referred to members of Congress, but contained almost exactly the same numbers and accusations as the post we saw shared on Facebook in March 2019.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the UK that the viral post has been repurposed for. Just one other example is a post from 2012, which applies the same figures to the Australian parliament.\n\nSnopes found that the original viral posts could be traced back to an article by the online publication \u201cCapitol Hill Blue\u201d. But Snopes pointed out that no sources were cited in the article, many of the assertions were unverifiable and things that should have been a matter of public record, for example information about businesses that were supposed to have gone bankrupt, did not seem to exist.\n\nSnopes concluded that the website\u2019s founder \u201ceventually bowed to the obvious and removed the dubious Congressional statistics from the Capitol Hill Blue series\u201d.\n\nAlthough many of the claims are unverifiable, there are a few clues in the post which we can easily check to show it doesn\u2019t refer to the UK or the House of Commons.\n\nTo start with there are 650 MPs elected to parliament, of whom 643 take up their seats (the other seven are from Sinn F\u00e9in in Northern Ireland and traditionally do not take their seats). The last time 635 MPs were elected at a general election was in 1979.\n\nMPs aren\u2019t the only employees in the House of Commons either, but they seem to be the group the post is referring to.\n\nThe line about expenses doesn\u2019t seem to appear in the original so has been added at some point since. This version sent to the Guardian in 2006 didn\u2019t include the figure, while this version sent to the Courier and Advertiser (a paper based in Scotland) in 2011 did include it.\n\nMPs expenses were in the region of around \u00a393 million back in 2007/08 before the system was changed in the wake of the expenses scandal. This was the cost of all MPs\u2019 expenses (including travel) and the salaries of the staff working for them, it didn\u2019t include MPs\u2019 own salaries. We\u2019ve written more about expenses here.\n\nWe can\u2019t find a specific year where the cost totalled exactly \u00a392,993,748 and most online searches for the number bring up results to versions of this viral post.\n\nIn the latest year we have figures for, 2017/18, MPs\u2019 expenses totalled around \u00a335 million\u2014around a third of the figure claimed in the post. This was spent on expenses for accommodation, office spending and things like travel or parking. These expenses, as well as the salaries of MPs\u2019 and their staff came to around \u00a3182 million that year.", "lang": "en"}
