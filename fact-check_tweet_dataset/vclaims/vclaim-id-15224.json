(What now that Congress is openly chanting Allah-o Akhbar!)\u201d\n\nThe clip is viral on Facebook.\n\nIt has also been circulated on Twitter.\n\nThe 16-second video viral on social media has been lifted from a 33:35-minute long speech that Sidhu gave in Kishanganj during a Congress rally. At around 31:24, the Congress MP can be heard saying, \u201cRaise both your hands and chant. We\u2019ll first raise the slogans of Sikhs, then our Muslim brothers and then Hindus. We\u2019ll raise all slogans.\u201d Sidhu goes on to say \u201cBole So Nihaal\u201d, followed by three chants of \u201cAllah-o Akhbar\u201d. He subsequently says that we are one and asks the crowd to raise their hands and say \u201cBharat Mata ki Jai\u201d. This video was earlier fact-checked by Boomlive.\n\nTherefore, while Navjot Singh Sidhu raised the chants of \u201cAllah-O Akhbar\u201d, he also raised other slogans like \u201cBole Sonihal\u201d and \u201cBharat Mata ki Jai\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
