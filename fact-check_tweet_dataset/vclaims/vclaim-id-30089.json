Spokespeople from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Fox News debunked the claim in emails to the Daily Caller.\n\nA viral post making the rounds on Facebook falsely alleges Fox News changed its accreditation from \u201cnews\u201d to \u201centertainment,\u201d suggesting the cable news network took such action so that its reporting doesn\u2019t have to contain facts.\n\n\u201cThey have changed their accreditation to \u2018entertainment.\u2019 They legally don\u2019t have to provide any facts in their reporting,\u201d reads the post. \u201cFox News is in the same category as \u2018Saturday Night Live,\u2019 \u2018Laugh-In,\u2019 and \u2018Swamp People.\u2019 You don\u2019t have to believe me, look it up yourself.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no regulatory agency that assigns accreditations to media organizations. The FCC does regulate licensing and over-the-air broadcasts, according to its website, but it doesn\u2019t require media organizations to categorize themselves in such a manner.\n\n\u201cThis claim is false,\u201d an FCC spokesperson said in an email to the Caller. \u201cThe FCC does not have any rules or licensing requirements in which a cable channel might categorize itself as news vs. entertainment.\u201d\n\nCarly Shanahan, a Fox News spokeswoman, also told the Caller in an email that the post\u2019s claim was false. (RELATED: No, Fox News Didn\u2019t Stage A Photo Of Trump Visiting Troops In Afghanistan)\n\nSnopes reported that Free Wood Post, a parody news website, published a satirical article about Fox News changing its accreditation from \u201cnews\u201d to \u201csatire\u201d in 2013. It\u2019s possible the image, posted Jan. 12, may have stemmed from that article, though it clearly disclaimed its satirical nature.", "lang": "en"}
