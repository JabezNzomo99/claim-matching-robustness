Other methods show less impressive growth in jobs -- even declines.\n\n \n\n First of all, Clinton was using private-sector job figures, not total job figures. Right off the bat, that paints Obama\u2019s numbers favorably, since government jobs have declined during much of Obama\u2019s term. If you count from the start of Obama\u2019s term, private-sector jobs have increased by 332,000, but total jobs have decreased by 316,000 due to losses of government jobs.\n\n \n\n Since this time frame includes the start of Obama\u2019s term -- when the economy was in free fall and before Obama\u2019s policies had time to take effect -- we don\u2019t think this is the best way to measure it.\n\n \n\n The way Clinton did it is another way to count it. Clinton started counting from the low point of jobs in February 2010. Using this method, private-sector jobs increased by about 4.5 million.\n\n \n\n However, starting the count at the low point is a bit of cherry-picking.\n\n \n\n If you instead start at the official end of the recession in June 2009, private-sector jobs increased by 3.4 million. That\u2019s well below Clinton\u2019s 4.5 million figure.\n\n \n\n We realize that speakers at political conventions are going to put the best gloss on the numbers they have available, so it\u2019s not surprising that Clinton would use the 4.5 million figure. But getting to 4.5 million requires starting the count at the most favorable point possible for Obama.\n\n \n\n In addition, as we\u2019ve written previously, presidents are not the only factor in job creation. The national, and world, economies are too big for any one person to control. So crediting Obama\u2019s policies is at best partially correct because there are so many other factors -- such as policies of the Federal Reserve, the willingness of banks to lend money, and global business trends -- that play a role.\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n While it\u2019s true that by most measures, the number of jobs in the United States has increased on Obama\u2019s watch, Clinton has done some cherry-picking in coming up with the 4.5 million number. But he chose his words carefully in describing the jobs picture. He said, \"In the last 29 months, our economy has produced about 4.5 million private-sector jobs.\" On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
