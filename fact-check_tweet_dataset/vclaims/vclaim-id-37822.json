The investigators suspect 39-year old Loretta Jones, who suffers from premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) as well [as] Chronic Hormone Disorder, of killing 189 people between 1993 and 2017, in both the United States and Mexico.\n\nThis item was not a factual recounting of real-life events. The article originated with a website that describes its output as being humorous or satirical in nature, as follows:\n\n\u201cWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website \u2013 even those based on real people \u2013 are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\u201d\n\nAs further evidence of the article\u2019s lack of a real-life factual basis, the photograph it presented as a mugshot of the fictional \u201cLoretta Jones\u201d actually showed a woman arrested in March 2013 on suspicion of stealing jewelry from a Palm Beach County, Florida, store where she worked.\n\nFor background, here is why we sometimes write about satire/humor.", "lang": "en"}
