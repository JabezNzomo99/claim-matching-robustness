Before passage of the Indiana law, 19 states passed such laws while 11 more interpreted that their state constitutions already provide such protections. We checked the news clips on passage of the Illinois law and there was little controversy about it, though the governor objected to these rights being extended to prisoners; his partial veto was overridden.\n\nSince then, numerous plaintiffs have used the laws (generally known as RFRAs) to challenge government actions or activities that threaten their beliefs. Mollie Hemingway, a senior editor at the Federalist who says the media has misrepresented the Indiana law, has compiled an interesting list of various plaintiffs who relied on RFRAs, including an Apache feather dancer permitted to keep eagle feathers and 40 churches in Chicago who unsuccessfully fought a zoning law that required a special permit for a church in business and commercial areas.\n\nThe U.S. Courts of Appeals for the 2nd, 8th, 9th and D.C. Circuits have supported that right, but others have not. So Indiana, which is in the 7th Circuit, is making the right explicit, resolving that disputed issue expressly in favor of religious claimants. (The Illinois law only makes reference to being able to able to recover attorney\u2019s fees and costs if a claim is upheld against a government, suggesting the possibility that law applied to suits between private parties.)\n\n\u201cThis language is unusual and could mean that someone could file a lawsuit even if their religious exercise isn\u2019t currently burdened or burdened in a significant manner,\u201d said Eunice Rho of the American Civil Liberties Union, who said the language was \u201ccurious.\u201d She said the Texas law, by contrast, was drafted so that \u201cit cannot be used in a way that could jeopardize existing civil rights laws.\u201d\n\nThis brings us to final distinction \u2013 the context in which the laws were crafted. We noted that the Illinois law was not especially controversial \u2014 but the Indiana law has been attacked as being anti-gay. One reason is that some advocates of the law have expressly said that it would allow businesses to refuse to support same-sex marriages. When Pence signed the law, the right-leaning group Advance America gave \u201cthree examples\u201d of how the law would change Indiana:\n\nDouglas Laycock is a University of Virginia Law School professor who supports a federal right to same-sex marriage and yet believes the controversy over the Indiana law has been overblown. He said Indiana should enact a gay rights law; he notes that the absence of one means it is currently not illegal in Indiana to refuse to serve gays. At the same time, he said, \u201ca state RFRA cannot exempt anyone from a Supreme Court decision requiring same-sex marriage as a matter of constitutional law.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the actual impact and meaning of the Indiana law will be determined by the courts. It is important to remember that RFRAs do not change existing laws; they only give plaintiffs a potential legal tool with which to make their case. But there are no guarantees they will be successful. Pence made this point in a Wall Street Journal opinion article that appeared Monday evening: \u201cRFRA only provides a mechanism to address claims, not a license for private parties to deny services.\u201d\n\nIf a governor is going to appear on national television, he needs to come prepared with an answer to an expected question. Advocates of the law have said the law will give new rights to Christian businesses that oppose same-sex marriage, and Pence should be able to explain whether he believes they are right or wrong. (In the Wall Street Journal, Pence still skirted the issue but personally was more forceful, saying, \u201cI abhor discrimination. \u2026 If I saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple, I wouldn\u2019t eat there anymore.\u201d)", "lang": "en"}
