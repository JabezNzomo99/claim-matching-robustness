It was reported by the\n\nhis new ministers on 29 May 2019. But is the cabinet really one of 11 in the world that are gender equal?\n\nThe simplest way to measure its gender equality is to count the men and women appointed and compare the numbers to the total cabinet size.\n\nSouth Africa now has 28 government ministries. Fourteen of the ministers are women. So there is gender equality in ministerial positions.\n\nBut Kevin Foster, an independent policy consultant and political analyst, told Africa Check that this could not be said for the whole cabinet. The country\u2019s\n\nsays \u201cthe cabinet consists of the President, as head of the cabinet, a deputy president and ministers\u201d.\n\nFoster said the president and deputy president \u201care clearly members of the cabinet\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is not the case in all countries with parliamentary systems of government, where the president is often the head of state in a ceremonial role outside of cabinet, rather than in a head-of-government role.\u201d\n\nRamaphosa and deputy president David Mabuza bring the size of the cabinet to 30, and the number of men in the cabinet to 16.\n\nWith 14 women, the new cabinet is currently just short of a 50/50 gender split. It is 47% female.\n\nIt\u2019s more difficult to verify global comparisons of gender equal cabinets.\n\nmonitor cabinet gender equality around the world. It is a joint project of the\n\nIts latest data is for 1 January 2019, when it reported that just\n\nhad gender equal cabinets. But rankings such as this have limitations.\n\nFirst, it is a snapshot in time. The ranking will not reflect changes \u2013 ministers resigning or being fired \u2013 since 1 January. South Africa\u2019s former president Jacob Zuma was\n\nSecond, the composition of a cabinet varies by country. iKNOW Politics says deputy presidents are not included in its assessment. But South Africa\u2019s constitution includes the deputy president in the cabinet.\n\nThe women in South Africa\u2019s new cabinet are in charge of half of the ministries, but that does not necessarily mean there\u2019s gender equality in who makes government decisions. The president and the vice president are both men.\n\nargues that while some countries have appointed more gender equal cabinets, women have historically been \u201cmainly allocated portfolios with \u2018feminine\u2019 characteristics and lower levels of prestige\u201d.\n\nIn Britain, for example, the four most important cabinet posts (prime minister, chancellor of the exchequer, foreign secretary and home secretary) are known as the \u201cGreat Offices of State\u201d. It was only in July 2016 that half of these posts were\n\n. The chancellor of the exchequer has never been a woman.\n\nThe four posts do not always have direct equivalents in other countries, as different states divide ministerial responsibilities in different ways. In South Africa the first three have close matches in the cabinet, but the equivalent responsibilities of the British home secretary are split between three ministries.\n\nThe only women in the six South African positions are Naledi Pandor, the equivalent of a foreign secretary, and state security\u2019s Ayanda Dlodlo, who is responsible for a third of a home secretary\u2019s broad portfolio. By this measure, the new South African cabinet is still a way off gender equality in the Great Offices.\n\n: \u201cIn the new cabinet women are leading some strategic ministries, most notably the ministry of state security and the ministry of defence and military veterans.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s new cabinet is not mathematically balanced between men and women, but it does appear to divide quite equally the more meaningful balance of prestige and responsibility.\n\n, told Africa Check that the new cabinet could be viewed as achieving gender equality beyond a simple numeric division between men and women.\n\n\u201cThe most high-profile posts in cabinet have been fairly evenly spread between male and female ministers. It is certainly not the case that the \u2018top\u2019 posts have been retained for men,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe departments of international relations, state security, defence and military veterans, basic education, and the vital portfolio of agriculture, rural development and land reform are all led by women.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
