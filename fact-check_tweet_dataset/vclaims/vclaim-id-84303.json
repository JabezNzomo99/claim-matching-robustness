A spokeswoman for the South African Police Service told AFP they did not issue the message.\n\nIn the audio clip, which has been also transcribed in Facebook posts, a voice begins: \u201cGood afternoon everyone, this is Warrant Officer Du Plessis from the SAPS. Please take note of this following message\u201d.\n\nThe almost 90-second clip claims that criminals are impersonating Vodacom employees running a mobile phone promotion in shopping centres.\n\nIt claims that they remove the SIM card, note the IMEI numbers and send money from the bank accounts through mobile banking.\n\nWe have archived Facebook posts sharing the scam here and here.\n\nSAPS spokeswoman Brenda Muridili told AFP that the warning was a hoax and confirmed it was not recorded by a SAPS officer.\n\nThe official SAPS Twitter account also retweeted a tweet by the South African Banking Risk Information Centre (SABRIC) calling the scam a hoax.\n\n\u201cCriminals aren't able to access your cell phone banking using the IMEI \u2013 they would need your PIN and/or password, which you should NEVER share with anyone,\u201d the centre advised.\n\nSABRIC issued tips for users on how to protect themselves in their latest report on Digital Banking Crime Statistics, particularly: \u201cDo not click on links or icons in unsolicited emails\u201d.\n\nWhile this warning was a hoax, a SABRIC report from 2018 shows mobile network banking scams are a growing trend in South Africa. In 2017, it noted 13,438 incidents across banking apps, online banking and mobile banking. From January to August 2018, it found a 64 percent increase in incidents.", "lang": "en"}
