Justin Amash, R-Mich., has been called a \"total lightweight\" and \"loser\" by the president and will now have a Republican primary challenger.\n\nWhen House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was asked about Amash\u2019s principal conclusions on the Mueller report on Fox News, he attempted to distance himself and the Republican Party from the Michigan representative. And McCarthy made a statement about Amash that caught our attention:\n\n\"He votes more with Nancy Pelosi than he ever does with me.\"\n\nIn an age of polarization \u2014 when rank and file members rarely deviate from their party leaders \u2014 we wondered if a Republican representative who breaks from the party still votes consistently with it.\n\nWe used ProPublica\u2019s Represent app to find out. (We also reached out to McCarthy's office but didn't receive a response.)\n\nProPublica tracks every House and Senate member\u2019s voting record and has a feature that enables users to compare representatives head to head. The database extends from the 112th to the current Congress, so we were able to compare Amash and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Amash and McCarthy, for nearly the past decade.\n\nAmash has voted against his party more than all House members this session \u2014 32.6% of the time. But he has agreed with McCarthy for 65% of the roll call votes.\n\n\"Out of 220 votes in the 116th Congress, they have disagreed on 76 votes, including 3 major votes,\" the ProPublica article reads.\n\nHowever, the same comparison can\u2019t be made between Amash and Pelosi for this session, because Pelosi is speaker of the House, said Derek Willis, news applications developer at ProPublica. In fact, ProPublica doesn\u2019t even have a page to compare Pelosi to any other House representative in the 116th Congress because she has missed nearly nine in 10 votes.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Pelosi has been AWOL. Rather, there\u2019s a tradition that speakers of the House do not typically vote. (Pelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, referred us to this precedent when we asked about it.) Richard E. Cohen, chief author of The Almanac of American Politics, said that there have been \"occasional exceptions\" to this informal rule, but that most speakers don\u2019t regularly vote.\n\n\"On the other hand, Pelosi \u2014 like most speakers \u2014 almost always supports the legislative agenda of her party, at least rhetorically,\" Cohen said. \"So, it\u2019s possible to match up many of Amash\u2019s votes with Pelosi\u2019s informal views. Even from that perspective, Amash often \u2014 but certainly not always \u2014 sides with the views of McCarthy and most Republicans.\"\n\nStill, we were able to compare Amash to McCarthy and Pelosi using past voting records, when Pelosi wasn\u2019t House speaker. We found that Amash has voted with McCarthy more than Pelosi for every term he has been in office.\n\nFor example, in the last Congress, Amash voted with McCarthy 65% of the time and with Pelosi 29% of the time.\n\nMcCarthy said that Amash votes more frequently with Pelosi rather than himself. But Amash has voted more frequently with McCarthy than Pelosi for every session Amash has been in Congress. We rate this statement False.", "lang": "en"}
