It hosted Kenya President Uhuru Kenyatta in April 2018 and Kirinyaga county governor Anne Waiguru three months later.\n\nRuto made a number of claims at the event on 8 February 2019. Here we put nine under the microscope.\n\nAfrica Check contacted David Mugonyi, Ruto\u2019s spokesperson, for the source the deputy president\u2019s information.

Nearly half was from North America.\n\nThe deputy president said the amount was \u201cupwards\u201d of KSh290 billion, so we rate his claim as exaggerated.\n\nRuto apologised to Kenyans living in London that he was unable to meet them, saying he had to rush back to Nairobi as President Uhuru Kenyatta was due\n\nIn Kenyan law the two leaders could not be out of the country at the same time,\n\n. \u201cIt is a constitutional requirement which you passed that when the president is away, the deputy president must be in the country.\u201d\n\n: \u201cWhen the President is absent or is temporarily incapacitated, and during any other period that the President decides, the Deputy President shall act as the President.\u201d\n\nin Nairobi, confirmed this interpretation of the law. \u201cIt is clear to me that the intention of the drafters was that the president and the deputy president should not be away (from the country) at the same time,\u201d\n\nTo improve its economy, Kenya is building a rail line that can carry both higher-speed trains and heavier cargo.\n\nThe first phase of the standard-gauge railway (SGR) from the coastal city of Mombasa to the capital Nairobi has already been built. But several sources have recently put the length at 472 kilometres.\n\n\u2013 the Chinese firm that built it \u2013 and the\n\nthe \u201croute length\u201d at 472 km and the \u201ctrack length\u201d at 609 km - closer to the deputy president\u2019s figure.\n\nThe main line is 472 km and the total track built 607.4 km, the SGR office told Africa Check. The difference is because there are areas on the main line with multiple tracks. These include two main stations and seven intermediate stations.\n\nIn total 33 stations account for the difference in rail length, the office said. The second phase of the railway, from Nairobi to the town of\n\n, will measure 120.5 km for the main line and 132 km in total track length, it added.\n\nThe SGR line is expected to strengthen trade in east Africa. According to 2014 parliamentary records, discussions on the railway began in 2003.\n\nIn 2008 Mwai Kibaki, then Kenya\u2019s president, and his Uganda counterpart Yoweri Museveni\n\nKenya\u2019s transport ministry says the railway\u2019s journey started in 2007 while a 2009\n\nfor the East Africa Community says the project was developed in 2007.\n\nWe have not found any publicly available record that the railway was in the works 30 years ago \u2013 in the 1980s or 1990s.\n\nSome 6.76 million customers were connected to the electricity grid by 30 June 2018, according to the\n\nIn June 2013, a month after the current administration came into office, there were\n\ncustomers.
