The dossier included allegations that Russia had compromising sexual material on Trump from a visit to Moscow. Many major news organizations at the time had copies or were aware of the allegations but had held off writing about it without confirmation.\n\nQ: Did you discuss the dossier or any other intelligence related to Russia hacking of the 2016 election with journalists?\n\n CLAPPER: No.\n\n Q: Did you confirm or corroborate the contents of the dossier with CNN journalist Jake Tapper?\n\n CLAPPER: Well, by the time of that, they already knew about it. By the time it was \u2014 it was after \u2014 I don\u2019t know exactly the sequence there, but it was pretty close to when we briefed it and when it was out all over the place. The media had it by the way. We were kind of behind the power curve, because the media, many media outlets that I understood had that, had the dossier for some time, as did people on the Hill.\n\n Q: Do you have any idea how they had it, how they got it?\n\n CLAPPER: The media?\n\n Q: Yes.\n\n CLAPPER: I do not. ***\n\n Q: Was it your testimony earlier that you did, in fact, discuss the so-called dossier with CNN journalist Jake Tapper?\n\n CLAPPER: Well, after it was out, yeah.\n\n Q: And by out, what do you mean by that?\n\n CLAPPER: Well, once it was public. It wasn\u2019t \u2014 you know, it wasn\u2019t like this is an Intelligence Community document or anything. This was out in the media.\n\n\u201cI did not leak the dossier\u201d when he was in government, he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t talk out about it with the media.\u201d By the time he left government, when Trump took the oath of office, the dossier was public. But in any case, he did not speak to Tapper about it until May \u2014 the first time they ever spoke.\n\nIn reporting this fact check, we had noted that line and asked a spokesman for the Democrats about it. \u201cHaving now read that section again, I can see how you think the Minority in its Views is referring to his time as DNI; but that would be an incorrect reading,\u201d he said, explaining that the Democrats were only referencing the conclusion of the majority report. We agree the line has led to confusion \u2014 and now The Federalist is citing it, though apparently the publication did not bother to ask the Democratic staff about it \u2014 so it certainly should be made clearer.]", "lang": "en"}
