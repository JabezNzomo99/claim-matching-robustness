No, that's not true: Makkai did share some fashion advice on Twitter about red hats, suggesting that \"normal\" people might want to avoid wearing them because they risk being confused at a distance with President Trump supporters. The author of \"The Great Believers\" never called for a ban on red baseball caps. She even suggested that those who \"enjoy\" wearing \"Make America Great Again\" hats should continue to do so.\n\nThe claim originated from an article (archived here) where it was published by AWM.com on January 16, 2020, under the title \"This Author Believes All Red Hats Should Be Banned Because They Make Her 'Uncomfortable'\". It opened:\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nMakkai did say she was \"made really uncomfortable\" when she spotted a red hat, even if she realized with a closer look that it was not a MAGA hat. Her full comments never call for a ban on red hats. It is just a discussion about her personal reaction:\n\nIs anyone else made really uncomfortable these days by anyone wearing any kind of red baseball cap? Like, I see one and my heart does weird shit and then I finally realize it only says Titleist or whatever. Maybe don't wear red caps anymore, normal people? Also, for the love of God: The clever folks wearing \"Make America Read Again\" or whatever caps -- NO. You're making everyone scared. Don't do it. If you're here to be contrary: an equivalent here would be western Hindus choosing not to use the swastika symbol in public despite it being sacred to their faith because it would offend/frighten people. The red hat has become a symbol of hate bc of how its wearers act. Also I love all the people who are like \"YOU CAN'T POLICE ME, LIBTARD!\" Please note that I was specifically addressing \"normal people.\" The ones who don't want to freak people out at a distance. The ones who enjoy it should absolutely continue letting us know who thy are.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes america.awm.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard, the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
