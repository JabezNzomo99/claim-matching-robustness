In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova accused Bulgaria of rewriting history and acting against the law. Zakharova did not specify whether she was referring to international, Russian or Bulgarian law.\n\n\u201cBy declaring that the Red Army brought so-called repressions, Bulgaria is engaged in rewriting history,\u201d Zakharova told the Russian state news agency TASS. \u201cThis is a dangerous trend, because it is illegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is certainly no prohibition in international law to challenge Moscow\u2019s official version of the events surrounding World War Two,\u201d Evelina Kelbecheva, professor of history at the American University of Bulgaria, told Polygraph.info. For example, historians and politicians have refuted Russia\u2019s persistent denial that it started WWII together with Nazi Germany to carve up Central and Eastern Europe \u2013 a deal sealed in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939.\n\n\u201cAs far as Bulgarian law is concerned, the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry statement fully complies with the Law on Declaring the Criminal Nature of the Communist Regime in Bulgaria, adopted in April 2000,\u201d Kelbecheva said.\n\nThe law states that the Soviet Union helped the Bulgarian Communist Party to come to power on September 9, 1944, bringing a criminal regime that led the country to a national catastrophe:\n\nArticle 1 (1): \u201cThe Bulgarian Communist Party (then called the Bulgarian Workers' Party / Communists) came to power on September 9, 1944 with the help of a foreign power that declared war on Bulgaria, and in violation of the Tarnovo Constitution.\u201d\n\n(2) The Bulgarian Communist Party was responsible for the rule of the state from September 9, 1944 to November 10, 1989, which led the country to a national catastrophe.\n\nThe law further establishes that the Communist regime subordinated Bulgaria\u2019s interests to a foreign country, which undermined national dignity and led to the effective loss of state sovereignty.\n\nRussian law, on the other hand, criminalizes disputing the official narrative about World War Two. The 2014 law is aimed at counteracting \u201cattacks on historical memory in relation to the events of the Second World War.\u201d The law is controversial and disputed by Russian historians.\n\nIn the Spirit of the Law\n\nThe Bulgarian Foreign Ministry\u2019s statement accurately reflects the Bulgarian law criminalizing the country\u2019s former communist regime. The ministry said that, from the point of view of international law, the facts are clear: the September 9 coup was a direct consequence of the USSR\u2019s declaration of war on Bulgaria on September 5, 1944 and the subsequent entry of Soviet troops into Bulgaria, which had a neutral position toward to the Soviet Union.\n\nIn fact, the Red Army did not fight a single battle in Bulgaria; there were no fallen Soviet soldiers on Bulgarian territory. Except for a few accidents, including the incident in the city of Burgas, where nearly 100 Russian soldiers died from drinking methanol alcohol, there were no Soviet casualties in Bulgaria. \u201cThe Soviet soldiers first shot and killed the Bulgarian worker who warned them not to drink from the tank of methanol alcohol,\u201d Kelbecheva said.\n\nAlthough Bulgaria was a German ally for most of WWII, the country never sent soldiers to the Eastern Front and maintained diplomatic relations with Moscow throughout the war.\n\nHistorians say Bulgaria was never a fascist state, had a functioning multi-party parliament during the war, and that, despite the government\u2019s policies, Bulgaria\u2019s Jewish population was saved from deportations to the German death camps.\n\nThe Bulgarian Foreign Ministry further said that the USSR had declared war on Bulgaria when a new democratic government had just come to power, had announced the end of ties with Nazi Germany and reaffirmed the Kingdom of Bulgaria\u2019s position of neutrality toward Russia.\n\nThus, the Red Army did not have to save Bulgaria from Nazism. Rather, it helped the local Communist party stage a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat to overturn the democratic government led by the pro-Allies leader of the legal opposition within parliament Konstantin Muraviev.\n\nThe Soviet-backed Fatherland Front tried and sentenced almost the entire pre-WWII political elite of Bulgaria in a \u201cPeople\u2019s Court.\u201d The court, operating outside the Constitution, issued 2,730 death sentences, leading to 1,400 executions. The rest of those sentenced to death had already died in extra-judiciary killings. Among those summarily shot on February 1, 1945 were two former prime ministers, various cabinet ministers and members of parliament, and the regents to the then-underage heir to the throne.\n\nOn the Russian side, Maria Zakharova was not alone in reacting strongly to Sofia\u2019s rejection of the notion that the Soviet Army \u201cliberated\u201d Bulgaria from Nazism.\n\nNatalya Poklonskaya, a member of Russia\u2019s State Duma fraudulently elected in Crimea, a region of Ukraine annexed by Russia, started a social media discussion with her comment:\n\n\"The stupid statement of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry, which called for rejecting the \u2018dubious historical thesis\u2019 and not considering the USSR\u2019s struggle against Nazism the liberation of Europe, is extremely provocative and absolutely does not express the opinion of the Bulgarian people. Only an ignoramus and a provocateur can doubt the decisive role of the Red Army in ridding humanity of the fascist plague.\u201d\n\nPoklonskaya is wrong. Bulgaria\u2019s Foreign Ministry did not deny the Soviet Union\u2019s contribution to the defeat of Nazism in Europe, but it recalled the price paid by the Soviet-occupied countries in Eastern Europe after WWII. \u201cThe long-term consequences for Bulgaria are the same as for other countries in Eastern Europe that fell within the Soviet zone of influence - 45 years of rule by a totalitarian regime based on the Bolshevik-Leninist version of communist ideology,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nThis is reminiscent of the words of Donald Tusk, then Polish prime minister, who said ten years ago while honoring the Russian troops who died in Poland: \"They gave their lives for liberation, but they didn't bring us freedom.\u201d\n\nThe public debate over the legacy of Bulgaria\u2019s communist regime is ongoing in Bulgaria. As former Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov said in an interview, the main consequence of the events that took place on September 9th 1944 is the deep division of the Bulgarian nation.\n\nHowever, starting this September, all history textbooks in the country will include the facts about the Soviet occupation of Bulgaria in 1944 and the criminal nature of the Soviet-backed Bulgarian communist regime.\n\nKelbecheva, who worked for years to have the historic facts included in Bulgaria\u2019s school textbooks, believes that this development is the real reason behind the strong Russian reaction to the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry statement.\n\n\"Blood Bath\" to commemorate September 9, 1944 -- the Soviet occupation of Bulgaria.
