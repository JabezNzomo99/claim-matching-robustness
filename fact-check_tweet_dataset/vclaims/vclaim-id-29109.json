He just hosted an acting workshop at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas, on March 10.\n\nBut a hoax story claiming that Winkler died in January has been shared more than 150,000 times on Facebook. The story also politicized his alleged death by saying he had been a \u201chuge Trump supporter\u201d and a \u201clifelong member of the NRA.\u201d\n\nNeither of those things is true, either.\n\nWhen he was asked about the political beliefs of his former co-star Scott Baio, who has been a vocal supporter of President Trump, Winkler said unequivocally, \u201cI completely disagree with his politics.\u201d\n\nIn another interview, MSNBC\u2019s Hugh Hewitt asked Winkler, \u201cDo you have anything good to say about Donald Trump?\u201d After a pause, Winkler said, \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you on that.\u201d\n\nWinkler filmed a video endorsing then-Sen. Barack Obama for president in 2008, and he has given thousands of dollars to other Democratic candidates, according to federal campaign records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. He also derided the Republican Party in 2010 for saying \u201cno about everything\u201d on Obama\u2019s political agenda.\n\nAs for the claim that Winkler is a \u201clifelong member of the NRA,\u201d he actually was listed by the organization\u2019s lobbying arm as an \u201canti-gun\u201d celebrity in 2012.\n\nThe story making these false claims was originally published on a self-described satire website. Its \u201cAbout\u201d page, says, \u201ceverything on this website is fiction.\u201d\n\nBut, as often happens, the story was copied and posted by at least one other site that didn\u2019t have a disclaimer, and the picture claiming that Winkler died in 2019 started circulating as a meme on social media.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nRosenfeld, Laura. \u201cHenry Winkler\u2019s Thoughts on Scott Baio\u2019s Political Beliefs Is Sure to Make You Feel Things.\u201d BravoTV.com. 27 Oct 2017.\n\nHewitt, Hugh. \u201cOne on one with Henry Winkler.\u201d MSNBC.com. 2 Sep 2017.", "lang": "en"}
