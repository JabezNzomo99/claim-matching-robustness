That the discovery was made during an election year makes it even more important and deserving of our attention.\n\nBansal showed how misinformation thrives on PM Modi\u2019s personal mobile application, NaMo App, which provides a built-in Twitter-esque network to its millions of users. However, unlike scrutiny of misinformation on other social media platforms, the content on Namo App stays off the radar.\n\nMisuse of social media for political one-upmanship isn\u2019t a new phenomenon in this country. But the issue becomes even more problematic when the prime minister\u2019s personal app promotes accounts infamous for sharing misinformation.\n\nThe \u2018My Network\u2019 section of NaMo App houses 15 promoted and verified accounts, found Bansal. Among these is The India Eye. But here\u2019s where the story gets interesting \u2013 users don\u2019t enjoy the discretion to not see the content posted by this account (or by any other promoted account). Even if one chooses to unfollow The India Eye, its posts still appear on their \u2018My Network\u2019 feed.\n\nIn the aftermath of the opposition\u2019s Mahagathbandhan rally, this account attempted to portray Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal as more concerned about Pakistan than about India. \u201cPakistan will suffer if Modi comes into power\u201d \u2013 this quote wasascribed to CM Kejriwal while The India Eye termed him \u201canti-national\u201d. The post appeared in Hindi and its text read \u2013 \u201c\u0907\u0938 \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0926\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0939\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0938\u0947 \u0905\u0927\u093f\u0915 \u092a\u093e\u0915\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u0940 \u091a\u093f\u0902\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0917\u0920\u092c\u0902\u0927\u0928 \u0915\u0940 \u0930\u0948\u0932\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0915\u0939\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0926\u094b\u092c\u093e\u0930\u093e \u0906 \u0917\u092f\u093e \u0924\u094b \u092a\u093e\u0915\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928 \u092c\u0930\u094d\u092c\u093e\u0926 \u0939\u094b \u091c\u093e\u092f\u0947\u0917\u093e|\u201d\n\nThe India Eye\u2019s claims were based on a doctored video that has been debunked by Alt News in the past. During his speech, the chief minister actually said, \u201cIt sends shivers down my spine to think that if these two come back to power in 2019, if Modi and Amit Shah are re-elected in 2019, then friends this country won\u2019t survive. They will ruin this country.\u201d The part where CM Kejriwal says \u201cthis country\u201d, was changed to \u201cPakistan\u201c.\n\nThe above example is one among a plethora of misleading posts circulated by The India Eye.\n\nThe India Eye and its Gujarat connection\n\nThe India Eye isn\u2019t merely a propaganda account on NaMo App. Its activities are widespread in the online world, including a Twitter account, a Facebook page, and websites. In September last year, Alt News had chronicled its trysts with misinformation on social media.\n\nDuring the course of our investigation, we found connections between a Gujarat-based company Silver Touch Technologies and The India Eye.\n\nAlt News followed the social media activities of a Twitter handle @HemanNamo, which promoted The India Eye during its initial days, and discovered that the individual managing the handle was associated with The India Eye website.\n\n@HemanNamo or Himanshu Jain is the director of Silver Touch Technologies, and theindiaeye.in was registered under his name and phone number.\n\nFurthermore, we also found that his company\u2019s servers were used to host theindiaeye.com. However, right after our conversation with Himanshu Jain, questioning him about the apparent connection, the IP addresses of theindiaeye.com were changed.\n\nWhen we reached out to the managing director of Silver Touch, Vipul Thakkar, he said that his company isn\u2019t associated with The India Eye.\n\nSilver Touch Technologies is an IT firm that was established in Ahmedabad in 1992 and one of its work is providing IT solutions for e-governance. As part of this business wing, the company has developed various projects for the BJP government. MD Vipul Thakkar had tweeted about some of these projects.\n\nBut the focus of this article is one specific project \u2013 the NaMo App \u2013 which was also developed by Silver Touch.\n\n\u201cThe mobile app developed by Silver Touch, offers the latest news and updates about the PM. It gives access to PM\u2019s \u2018Mann Ki Baat\u2019 state addresses, his biography and blogs. The app will also update people of PM\u2019s Governance initiatives, achievements and development related Infographics. The Android app will allow users to contribute and earn badges through to-do tasks,\u201d the company described the app in a blog post.\n\nThe connection is apparent. In fact, the association of Himanshu Jain and his company Silver Touch with The India Eye was also disclosed by NDTVin 2017. The news channel had also found that 53% of the company\u2019s work came from government contracts worth approximately Rs 62.5 crores. Furthermore, Himanshu Jain, from his Twitter account @HemanNamo, was a part of trending pro-BJP hashtags. He is also followed by prime minister Narendra Modi on Twitter.\n\nDigging out similar information now would be a futile attempt. Most of the details laid out by Alt News have been taken down by both Himanshu Jain and Silver Touch. In fact, Jain has also changed his Twitter handle from @HemanNamo to @NamoNews2019.\n\nBut our earlier investigation includes all the necessary links of association that can be accessed here.\n\nFake news peddled by The India Eye on NaMo App\n\nOn January 21, the account posted images of mahagatbandhan rally in Kolkata, claiming that everyone present at the rally took an oath to save the country but nobody said, \u201cBharat mata ki jay\u201d. BJP president Amit Shah also made a similar claim while addressing a rally in Malda, West Bengal.\n\nAlt News found that the claim was untrue. Patidar agitation leader Hardik Patel while ending his speech at the rally had raised slogans of \u2018Jai Hind\u2019 and \u2018Bharat mata ki jai\u2019.\n\n\u201cRahul Gandhi said that non-violence was inspired by Islam\u201d\n\nA cartoon posted by The India Eye attributed a statement to Rahul Gandhi which said, \u201c\u092e\u0941\u0938\u0932\u092e\u093e\u0928\u094b \u0915\u094b \u0905\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0938\u093e \u0915\u093e \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u0932\u092e\u093e\u0928\u094b \u0938\u0947 \u092e\u093f\u0932\u093e (Muslims got the philosophy of non-violence from Muslims/Islam-translated)\u201d.\n\nThe statement ascribed to the Congress president was based on clipped video. Rahul Gandhi, in his speech at Dubai said, that non-violence was inspired by every great religion of the world, including ancient Indian religions, Christianity and Judaism. He did not single out Islam as suggested in the cartoon.\n\nAnother post by The India Eye said, \u201cCongress bans the release of The Accidental Prime Minister in Madhya Pradesh\u201d.\n\nThe claim was based on reports by several media outlets which later turned out to be false. The official Twitter handle of the department of public relations of the Madhya Pradesh government clarified that there was no decision to ban the film.\n\n\u201c\u0926\u0941\u092c\u0908 \u0938\u094d\u091f\u0947\u0921\u093f\u092f\u092e \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0930\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0932 \u0917\u093e\u0901\u0927\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u0938\u0941\u0928\u0928\u0947 \u0969 \u0932\u093e\u0916 \u0932\u094b\u0917 \u0906\u092f\u0947 (Three lakh people came to listen to Rahul Gandhi at the Dubai stadium-translated)\u201d, read a quote attributed to Congress spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi. The post claimed that Chaturvedi\u2019s statement is false. Gaurav Pradhan also made an identical claim.\n\nHowever, we found that Chaturvedi never made such a statement. She quoted-tweeted Pradhan\u2019s tweet and rubbished the claim.\n\nThe evidence at hand shows that prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s personal mobile application NaMo App was created by a company that has connections to Facebook page The India Eye. Despite the page\u2019s established track record of promoting misinformation, the content from the same outlet is included among the 15 promoted accounts in NaMo App. Moreover, every user sees its posts by default even after unfollowing the outlet. That the NaMo App has such scant regard for the veracity of the information shared on its \u2018My Network\u2019 section to millions of users shows how the country\u2019s ruling party has a massive fake news problem.", "lang": "en"}
