This is false: the man seen in the picture is a Mauritanian Islamic scholar, who has made no public comments about Nigeria\u2019s immigration policy.\n\nWe\u2019ve archived one of the Facebook posts, shared nearly 6,000 times on Facebook, here. In it, the \u201cEgyptian Muslim cleric\u201d asserts that the new immigration policy will hurt Nigerian Christians, especially members of the Igbo ethnic group.\n\n\u201cBreaking News. I am an Egyptian Muslim cleric but seriously weeping for Nigerian Christians. You people don't know the real motive behind the order by buhari for all Africans to come to Nigeria without visa especially those from Muslim part. I am weeping for Christians in Nigeria especially the IGBO people!\u201d it reads.\n\nThe cleric is said to have added that Nigerian Christians \u201cshould pray seriously because 2020 will be bloody!\u201d\n\nThe same post has been circulating among Nigerian WhatsApp groups, as well as on this blog.\n\nBuhari has pledged to make travel easier for Africans\n\nWhile at the Aswan Forum in Egypt earlier this month, Buhari announced that from January 2020, Nigeria \u201cwill commence issuance of visas at the point of entry into Nigeria, to all persons holding passports of African countries\u201d.\n\n\u201cNigeria is committed to supporting the free movement of Africans within Africa,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nThe policy announcement has received both praise and criticism; while some Africans have hailed it as a move that will make travel and trade easier, some Nigerians worry that it could pose a security threat.\n\nControversial Nigerian pastor Johnson Suleman tweeted on Wednesday that he\u2019s \u201cbeen thinking about the govt's decision to give Visa on arrival to all holders of africa passport\u201d. \u201cWon't that make Nigeria flooded with our already limited Infrastructure and increase crime rate?\u201d he asked.\n\nDetails of how the new policy will be implemented, including how long Africans will be able to stay in Nigeria, remain thin. There is as yet no evidence that it will lead to an influx to Nigeria from Muslim countries in particular, as suggested by the post.\n\nTravel for Africans seeking to visit neighbouring countries has long been notoriously difficult -- in 2017, the continent\u2019s richest man Aliko Dangote complained that he needed 38 visas to travel within Africa on his Nigerian passport.\n\nHowever, Nigeria is not the only country that has been loosening its visa policies of late. Kenya announced a similar policy of visas on arrival for Africans in 2017, while Ethiopia announced the same move last year.\n\nThis cleric is not Egyptian, and the photo was online long before Nigeria\u2019s policy change\n\nThe man in the picture is not an Egyptian cleric -- and the photo itself existed on the internet long before Nigeria\u2019s change in visa policy was announced.\n\nA quick Google reverse image search showed that the man in the picture is Mohamed Al-Hassan Ould Al-Dido, a Mauritanian Islamic scholar and thinker.\n\nOther image searches also show that the picture had been on the internet as early as 2016, years before Buhari made the announcement.\n\nWe have found no public comments by Al-Dido on the new Nigerian immigration policy, despite online searches in both English and Arabic.\n\nThe cleric has often been filmed crying while speaking about religion -- for example in this video, where he talks about loving God.", "lang": "en"}
