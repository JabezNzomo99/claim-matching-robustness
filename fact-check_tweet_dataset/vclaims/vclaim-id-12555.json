His claim is false either way.\n\nIf he was referring to the first scenario, government data belie his claim.\n\nThe city saw a total of 56 murder and 15 homicide incidents from Jan. 1 to Oct. 31, 2018 alone, based on the Philippine National Police\u2019s (PNP) Bantay Krimen online interactive .\n\nThe site counts and plots major crime incidents in the country down to the street level based on data from the PNP\u2019s Directorate for Investigation and Detective Management (DIDM) unit, which handles all crime statistics. However, some of the site\u2019s features, including the map, are currently unavailable while the data is being revalidated, according to the PNP\u2019s IT division.\n\nRevalidation is done to incorporate late reported crimes and other adjustments by the regional offices, a DIDM staff said.\n\nIn 2017, the city recorded 122 murders and 20 homicides, based on from the Davao regional police office published on their official website.\n\nPNP quarterly crime as of February 2017 show there were 162 murders and 20 homicides in the city in 2016. During Duterte\u2019s last term as mayor, the tally stood at 219 for murder and 31 for homicide in 2015; 169 and 25 in 2014; and 157 and 55 in 2013.\n\nDavao City ranked in the number of murder cases at 1,032, and third in homicide at 245 in the PNP\u2019s list of 15 cities with the highest index crimes from 2010 to 2015. Sara Duterte, the president\u2019s daughter was city mayor from 2010 to 2013; the older Duterte from 2013 to 2016.\n\nThe defines homicide and murder as the killing of another person who is not an immediate family member, while murder is done deliberately, inhumanely or with evident premeditation, among other qualifications.\n\nBut even if Duterte meant not one had been killed in clashes between government troops and the NPA, he would still be wrong.\n\nMultiple news reports show at least nine people, soldiers and rebels alike, were killed in the past two years alone.\n\nThe latest incident, a firefight which killed an alleged rebel leader at Toril District, Davao City, took place on Sept. 16, merely a month before Duterte uttered the claim.\n\nThrough Google Advanced Search using the keywords \u201cNPA,\u201d \u201cDavao City\u201d and \u201cKilled,\u201d VERA Files was able to triangulate four military-NPA encounters that yielded casualties.\n\nDuterte had previously misstated the peace and order situation in the city (See ?).\n\nPCOO, President Rodrigo Duterte, Speech during the inauguration of the Gaisano Grand Citygate Mall , Oct. 9, 2018\n\nManila Bulletin, Two NPAs killed in an attempt to recover a cleared barangay in Davao city , June 28, 2018\n\nPhilippine News Agency, 2 die, 2 hurt as NPA tries to retake lair in Davao , June 28, 2018\n\nInquirer.net, 2 soldiers killed in firefight with NPA rebels in Davao , June 11, 2017\n\n(Guided by the code of principles of the International Fact-Checking Network at Poynter, VERA Files tracks the false claims, flip-flops, misleading statements of public officials and figures, and debunks them with factual evidence.
