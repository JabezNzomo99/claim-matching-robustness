However, The Quint found that there is no truth to this claim and that there is no military lockdown in place in either of these cities. An archived version of this post can be seen here. The message claims that in view of this \u201cmilitary lockdown\u201d in these cities, people should stock up on everything, with special emphasis on groceries and vegetables. It also goes on to say that \u201ccities can be handed over to military\u201d and that \u201conly milk and medicines will be allowed.\u201d It adds that central government meetings are going on and a total shut down is expected to be announced anytime. We found many people sharing the message on Facebook.\n\nAn archived version of this page can be seen here. The Quint also received queries about the veracity of the message from its readers on our WhatsApp helpline number. First off, the MHA guidelines issued on Saturday, 30 May, for the stage after Lockdown 4.0, named \u2018Unlock 1\u2019, actually lifts many of the remaining restrictions on cities across India. Restrictions were only to continue in containment zones as demarcated by district authorities. From 01.06.2020\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u008fWithin Containment Zones, #Lockdown restrictions to continue till 30.06.2020\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u008f#Unlock1 All activities to be relaxed in phased manner outside containment zones, as per @MoHFW_INDIA guidelines\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u008fStates may impose restrictions/prohibit activities as per assessment pic.twitter.com/LDbmvf6Gfa \u2014 Spokesperson, Ministry of Home Affairs (@PIBHomeAffairs) May 30, 2020 The order nowhere mentions that any of the cities \u2013 Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Ahmedabad or Indore, were to go under a military lockdown from 31 May, as the viral message claims. In fact, the guidelines allow for a phased reopening from 1 June, with more restrictions lifted from 8 June. None of the guidelines issued by the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, West Bengal or Madhya Pradesh also mention any such thing. Further, the Mumbai Police took to Twitter to call out a variation of the message which only mentioned Mumbai and Pune, as fake. The attached message is fake but being widely circulated. If it reaches you, break the chain & do not forward. All essential supplies will be available & movement permitted only as per lockdown guidelines. #FakeMessageAlert pic.twitter.com/K5BLN7UN6h \u2014 Mumbai Police (@MumbaiPolice) May 26, 2020 Previously, The Quint has debunked a similar message which claimed that Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray was calling in the army. The Quint further reached out to the Ahmedabad Police PRO, which said that there was no such military lockdown in place and that normal public life was underway, calling it a wrong message.

We tried reaching out to Kolkata Police but haven\u2019t received any response. This story will be updated if and when we receive a response.", "lang": "en"}
