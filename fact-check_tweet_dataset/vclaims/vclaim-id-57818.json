He spent a week in the hospital, including three nights in intensive care, before being discharged on April 12, according to The Guardian.\n\nThe post falsely alleges that the video shows Johnson offering journalists tea after recovering from the disease, with the caption saying, \u201cSome reporters visited the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson who had recovered from his illness \u2026 The living room was too small so he had to hold the tea tray and entertain the reporters outdoors.\u201d\n\nThe video, taken by The Daily Telegraph, actually comes from August 2018, long before the new coronavirus first emerged in China late last year. It shows Johnson, wearing a blue sweater and holding a tray, as he offers tea to reporters waiting outside his home and refuses to answer questions about an op-ed he wrote that month, according to the caption.\n\nJohnson argued in that August 2018 column that burqas should not be banned but said it was \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d Muslim women chose to \u201cgo around looking like letter boxes\u201d and \u201cbank robbers.\u201d He was widely criticized for the remarks.
