The Senate must pass the (Paycheck Fairness Act) now. Latinas deserve better \u2014 we all do.\"\n\nThere are many different methods for analyzing the pay gap. Some researchers look at full-time workers, others focus on wages for people who work part time. Some analyses adjust for education or focus on calculating the gap within specific occupations.\n\n\"This suggests that for Hispanic men, much of the earnings gap seems to be explained by a host of factors ... however, controlling for these same factors does not narrow the hourly wage gap between Hispanic women and white men nearly as much,\" reads a summary of the report. \"This suggests that for Hispanic women, ethnic and gender discrimination, and other forms of discrimination, appear to be at play.\"\n\n\"The numbers are meant to be an indicator to help point to where some of the problems are,\" she said. \"There are so many numbers, but what we\u2019re really talking about is whether the economy in Texas or nationally is really working for all of the people who are living here and working here. When we see these wage gaps, what we\u2019re really seeing is that it appears to be harder for some groups to achieve economic security than others.\"", "lang": "en"}
