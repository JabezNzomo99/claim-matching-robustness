Your \u00a330 fine will automatically be added to your bill.\u201d\n\nAnother says: \u201cYou have left your home more than once today and was at considerable distance from your home. As this isn\u2019t a location such as work, shopping, medical assistance, this is your final warning to comply to government guideline. Fail to do may result in fines.\u201d\n\nPeople across the country have received texts from \u201cUK_Gov\u201d or a similarly named sender telling them to stay at home. These real messages were included in many of the misleading posts.\n\nHowever, the texts shown in the posts that followed this first message with warnings of fines. These are not real.\n\nThese texts have been confirmed as scams by at least one police force, though there are other clues which indicate these messages are not from the government. \n\n\n\nThe messages feature a number of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors which would not be present in official government communications.\n\nIn examples of the texts where the receiver is asked to call a number or visit a website, we have verified that neither are active.\n\nWe can\u2019t definitely say whether the UK government is tracking phone data more broadly right now. There have been some reports of the government working with networks to get anonymised data on whether people are following social distancing guidelines.", "lang": "en"}
