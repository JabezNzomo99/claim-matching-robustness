In addition, the thing that displeased me is that, after more than 100 samples none came out positive. I have a career to protect and I am Congolese by blood. Getting rich by lying is a sin before God, I quit.\"\n\nThe quote is fake. Mukwege said he resigned because of problems that included inadequate preventive measures and inefficient testing.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nMukwege served as vice chairman of the Multi-sectoral Coronavirus Response Committee and president of the Health Commission, which were established in Congo\u2019s South Kivu province to handle its COVID-19 pandemic response.\n\nMukwege released a statement about his decision to resign from the committee on June 10 on the website for the Panzi Foundation, a charitable organization he founded.\n\nHe said the decision was due to slow testing, problems implementing a response strategy and inadequate preventative measures.\n\n\"We are therefore at the start of an exponential epidemiological curve and we can no longer apply a strategy that would only be preventive,\" Mukwege wrote.\n\n\"I therefore decided to resign from my duties as Vice-President of the Multi-sectoral Coronavirus Response Committee in our province and President of the Health Commission, in order to devote myself entirely to my medical responsibilities and to treat this influx of patients at Panzi Hospital.\"\n\nA Panzi Foundation spokesperson also confirmed to PolitiFact that the quote is fabricated.\n\nOn Twitter, Mukwege said any statements posted in his name were not genuine unless they appeared on his official social networks or websites.\n\nMukwege did resign from the coronavirus response team in Congo, but he never made the statement attributed to him in the post.", "lang": "en"}
