I would also bet that they are not aware that Confederate veterans were conferred with many of the same benefits of other United States military veterans by Acts of Congress back in 1929 and 1957. Sad, that on a day in which we should honor all of our veterans, including those who fought in the Civil War, there are some who, instead, wish to sow discord and discontent.\"\n\n\"In his post, Commissioner Miller did not state that Confederate veterans had been conferred U.S. veteran status,\" Smith said. \"Instead, he said that \u2018Confederate veterans were conferred with many of the same benefits of other United States military veterans by Acts of Congress\u2026\u2019 So, these two laws appear to provide benefits to CSA veterans EXACTLY AS IF they had been a U.S. military service member.\"\n\nThe law stated that the Veterans Administration \"shall pay to each person who served in the military or naval forces of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War a monthly pension in the same amounts and subject to the same conditions as would have been applicable to such person ... if his service in such forces had been service in the military or naval service of the United States.\"\n\nMiller is right that Congress eventually afforded Confederate veterans many of the benefits awarded to other U.S. military veterans, but no qualifying veteran ever actually received aid from the federal government (outside the placement of headstones).
