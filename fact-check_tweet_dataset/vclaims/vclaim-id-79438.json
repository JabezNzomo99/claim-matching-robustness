The messages have been attributed to \"Dr Kelkar\" who has been claimed to be an \"Onco Surgeon & CEO of the Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital\".\n\n\n\n2) The claim that 600 doctors treating COVID-19 are practising 5-7 min exercise and none of them have contracted the COVID-19 infection. A Reverse image on Yandex search of a screenshot from the viral video showed that the man in the video is actually S. Prakash, CEO of See Change, a company which provides Coaching and Training Services as a Knowledge Management Partner(KMP).\n\nThe Logical Indian reached out to M. K. Anand, the co-founder of the company who identified the person in the viral video as his partner S. Prakash. \"The video is being circulated on WhatsApp attributing it to doctors of different names. Prakash is not a doctor,\" he replied on being asked if he has seen the viral video.\n\nThe Logical Indian then spoke to S. Prakash, who confirmed that it was him in the viral video. \"The video was originally made by me. It is a simple exercise that I have learnt long ago which I found to be beneficial and hence shared through YT platform,\" he said. \"It has since gone viral through WA and through several YT channels. But the names being ascribed to are Dr. Bajaj (Cardio Surgeon) and Dr. Kelkar (Oncologist)!\" he added. Below is a comparison of S. Prakash from the company's website (right) and the viral video (left):\n\nThe exercise according to the video is called Jal Neti. It is an old technique used to clean the respiratory system and remove toxins from the nasal passage.\n\n In a separate video, which was uploaded on July 7, Dr Kelkar was asked about the Jal Neti practice introduced in his hospital. The video was uploaded by the youtube channel of the Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital And Research Center.\n\nThe doctor clarified that only 600 people of the total 4000 staff had come forward back in March 2020, to practise Jal Neti. According to him, these 600 people consisted of \"about 100 doctors, about 150 to 200 nurses, the remaining were ward boys, Ayas, Cleaning staff and security Personnel.\"\n\n \"These 600 healthcare workers had been practising Jal Neti for the last 3 months and none of them contracted COVID,\" he said. He added 25 staff members of the hospital who were not a part of the Jal Neti practise had contracted a mild form of the infection. The video description, however, mentions a disclaimer which clearly states that \"the video is for public education in pandemic times. It is made based on available medical literature and our short experience.\" It adds that the content of the video is \"not a substitute for proper medical advice, should you need one.\" Below is a comparison of S.
