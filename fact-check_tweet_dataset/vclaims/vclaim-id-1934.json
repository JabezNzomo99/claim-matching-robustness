Trump has not released his tax returns, and his one-page tax plan lacks the details needed to analyze its impact.\n\u2022 Trump said that \u201cthe last time a new Supreme Court justice was confirmed in the first 100 days was 136 years ago in 1881.\u201d That\u2019s correct, but lacks context. Trump is the only president since 1900 who took office with a vacancy on the high court.\n\nThe president also repeated several false claims on job creation, the Affordable Care Act, Russia and China. For example, Trump claimed that China stopped manipulating its currency because of him, when in fact economists \u2014 including those at his own Treasury Department \u2014 have said China stopped doing so three years ago.\n\nTrump marked his 100th day in office on April 29. A day earlier, Trump gave an interview to Fox News as part of a media blitz to mark the occasion. On April 29, he gave an interview to CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d and spoke at a campaign-style rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He also gave an interview May 1 to the Washington Examiner, among others.\n\nIn his interview with Fox News, Trump discussed his desire to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. But in doing so he falsely claimed that the U.S. has a \u201c$17 billion trade deficit with Canada.\u201d In fact, the U.S. had a surplus in 2016.\n\nTrump is close to accurate on Mexico. In 2016, the U.S. had a trade deficit in goods and services of nearly $62 billion, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. But Trump is way off on his Canada trade figure.\n\nFor the second year in a row, the U.S. had a trade surplus with Canada. In 2016, the U.S. had an $8.1 billion trade surplus in goods and services with Canada, up nearly 33 percent from the $6.1 billion surplus in 2015. The last time the U.S. had a deficit with Canada was 2014.\n\nTypically, when referring to trade deficits, Trump counts only goods and not services. But, even if that were the case here, he would be overstating the U.S. trade deficit for goods with Canada.\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit for goods was $11.2 billion with Canada in 2016, so Trump would have overstated the trade deficit for goods by $5.8 billion, or more than half. Not only that, but the trade deficit for goods has dropped significantly over the last few decades. It was $78.3 billion in 2008. The $11.2 billion trade deficit in goods is the lowest it has been since 1993, when it was $10.8 billion.\n\nIn the interview with the Washington Examiner, Trump flummoxed historians when he claimed that President Andrew Jackson was \u201creally angry\u201d at \u201cwhat was happening with regard to the Civil War,\u201d and then went on to proclaim that \u201cpeople don\u2019t ask the question, but why was there the Civil War?\u201d\n\nDaniel Feller, director of The Papers of Andrew Jackson at the University of Tennessee, told us that Trump\u2019s comments about Jackson are \u201cempty of content.\u201d\n\nFirst of all, Jackson died in June 1845 \u2014 16 years before the Civil War started in 1861. So Jackson did not see \u201cwhat was happening with regard to the Civil War,\u201d as Trump said.\n\nIt is true that concerns about preserving the union date to at least the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state. Jackson, who served as president from 1829 to 1837, was alive at that time and was among those who \u201cdid decry disunionism in any form,\u201d Feller wrote to us in an email.\n\n\u201cHis belief in a permanent indivisible national Union ran deeper than anything else in his character or circumstances,\u201d Feller said.\n\nBut, he added, Jackson \u201cdid not, as far as we know, speculate about or anticipate a civil war over slavery in particular.\u201d\n\n\u201cJackson was almost unique among politicians of his day in avoiding making any kind of public or even private statement about slavery as a general moral question. He was of course a slaveholder himself, though many such, including Thomas Jefferson and Henry Clay, held slaves while at least regretting the system in principle. Jackson did not,\u201d Feller said. \u201cHe responded to slavery solely as a political issue, condemning both proslavery and antislavery agitators for threatening disruption of the Union and his own Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nIn a phone interview, Feller also questioned what Trump meant when he said Jackson \u201chad a big heart,\u201d and expressed puzzlement by the president\u2019s statements that \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t have had the Civil War\u201d if Jackson was president and that \u201c[p]eople don\u2019t ask that question, but why was there the Civil War?\u201d\n\n\u201cI literally don\u2019t know what that means,\u201d Feller said about Trump\u2019s description of Jackson as having \u201ca big heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cMagnanimous? Forgiving? Compassionate? That is not particularly true,\u201d Feller said. \u201cWho among our presidents has been known for that? The guy who coined the term \u2018with malice toward none, with charity for all,\u2019 and that would be Abraham Lincoln.\u201d\n\nLincoln coined those words in his second inaugural address.\n\nTrump \u201cfurther says, \u2018people don\u2019t ask the question, but why was there the Civil War?'\u201d Feller wrote in his email to us. \u201cThat is THE MOST ASKED question among American historians, and has been since the war itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn short, and not to mince words, it\u2019s impossible to understand what someone is talking about when they have no idea themselves,\u201d Feller said.\n\nTrump on the Media\u2019s First 100 Days\n\nIn a bit of table-turning, Trump purported to rate the performance of the media in his first 100 days at his rally in Harrisburg. But he cited a partisan study on negative news coverage of his administration and then misleadingly tied those findings to a study about journalists \u2014 none of whom cover national politics \u2014 contributing disproportionately to Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThe report from the Media Research Center did conclude that ABC, CBS and NBC evening news coverage between Jan. 20 and April 9 was 89 percent negative. Media Research Center is a conservative group whose mission is to \u201cexpose and neutralize the propaganda arm of the Left: the national news media,\u201d according to its website.\n\nAn analysis by Media Tenor, an independent media research firm, looked at a shorter time period \u2014 Jan. 20 to Feb. 17 \u2014 and also tallied news it considered to be neutral. That study found that on NBC\u2019s \u201cNightly News\u201d and CBS\u2019 \u201cEvening News,\u201d the majority of the news reports were neutral, but that a much higher percentage (43 percent) were negative than positive (3 percent). On Fox News\u2019 \u201cSpecial Report,\u201d the analysis found, \u201c25 percent of the reports about Trump were negative, compared with 12 percent positive and the remainder neutral. In other words, even the conservative-leaning Fox News featured twice as much bad press as good press.\u201d\n\nTrump said the Media Research Center\u2019s findings about overwhelmingly negative coverage of his administration were \u201cperhaps \u2026 because, according to the Center for Public Integrity, 96 percent of journalists who made donations in the last election gave them to our opponent.\u201d\n\nThe analysis from the nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity found that about 430 people \u201cwho work in journalism\u201d contributed about $382,000 to the Clinton campaign through August, compared with about 50 journalists who contributed $14,000 to Trump. Notably, however, the study did not find that any journalists responsible for covering the White House, Congress or national politics made political contributions of any kind.\n\nIndeed, Dave Levinthal, co-author of the report from the Center for Public Integrity, told us that \u201cthe vast majority of journalists did not contribute to any presidential candidate, period.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump has called out the New York Times, Washington Post, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and MSNBC as purveyors of fake news to discredit him, none of the journalists covering him from those news organizations made any political contributions. In fact, among that media group, only one journalist from the New York Times, a Hong Kong-based videographer, was confirmed to have made a contribution \u2014 to Democrat Bernie Sanders \u2014 which was later returned.\n\nWhile there were some journalists on the contributors list who covered local or state government \u2014 mostly for small newspapers \u2014 there was none on the list whose primary responsibility was covering Congress or the White House or national politics, Levinthal said. Most of the contributing journalists were doing other things. For example, one Clinton contributor was a restaurant critic for the Orange County Register and another was a television critic for the New Yorker.\n\nThere were very few journalists at all from the top 50 news organizations, Levinthal said, noting that most of those news organizations have strict policies prohibiting participation in political campaigns, including making contributions to candidates.\n\n\u201cAs a statement of fact,\u201d Levinthal said, \u201ceffectively no one covering the White House or the presidential campaign was making contributions to Hillary Clinton or any other candidate in 2016.\u201d\n\nThe president flatly stated in his Fox News interview that under his tax proposal he will \u201cend up paying more than I pay right now in taxes.\u201d But he provides no evidence to support that.\n\nWe would need two things in order to analyze the impact of Trump\u2019s tax plan on the president\u2019s personal taxes: Trump\u2019s tax returns filed this year and details of how his tax plan would work. We have neither.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t tell how the plan would affect Trump\u2019s taxes,\u201d said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, which analyzes the impact of tax policy changes. \u201cIf we knew more about his taxes, we might be able to say something, even without knowing precise details for the plan, but knowing so little about Trump, we\u2019d be hard pressed to say much even with the plan\u2019s details.\u201d\n\nThe president went through the entire 2016 campaign without releasing his tax returns \u2014 the first major party presidential candidate to not release his tax returns since Richard Nixon. In an April 29 interview for \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Trump repeated that he will not release his tax returns because \u201cI\u2019m under audit.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Trump administration has provided only a one-page summary of his tax plan that was bereft of details. For example, the plan calls for reducing the number of tax brackets from seven to three, but it does not provide the income thresholds for each bracket. \u201cBecause the Administration summary was, um, short, it is impossible to know what the president really wants to do, and what it would mean for taxpayers,\u201d Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, wrote.\n\nWe do know that Trump\u2019s plan calls for abolishing the alternative minimum tax, which is designed to ensure that the most wealthy taxpayers pay a minimum tax. We also know that Trump paid $38 million in federal taxes in 2005. A New York Times analysis of how Trump\u2019s tax plan would have affected his 2005 tax return showed that the president would have saved $31 million alone from the repeal of the AMT. The paper also said that Trump would lose millions of dollars worth of tax deductions, as the president told Fox News, but Trump on net could have saved \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d in taxes.\n\nHowever, Williams at the Tax Policy Center told us the New York Times analysis \u201cassumes no other changes to the tax law.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the AMT were repealed AND we got rid of tax loopholes that benefited Trump, he might have paid enough more regular tax to make up much of (or even more than) the AMT tax he would have saved,\u201d Williams said in an email. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know without more details.\u201d\n\nWhat is pretty clear, he said, is that Trump\u2019s plan \u201cwould save high-income people in general a lot of money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe combination of lower rates, no AMT, no estate tax, and a 15% tax rate on corporate and pass-through income would disproportionately benefit the rich,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that getting rid of most tax loopholes would reverse the effects of those provisions.\u201d\n\nIn his Harrisburg speech, Trump made the accurate, but meaningless, claim that \u201cthe last time a new Supreme Court justice was confirmed in the first 100 days was 136 years ago in 1881.\u201d\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump nominated on Jan. 31, was confirmed as the late Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s replacement on April 7. That was Trump\u2019s 78th day as president.\n\nPrior to that, Chester Arthur, in 1881, was the last president to have a Supreme Court nominee confirmed in his first 100 days.\n\nBut the fact is no president since 1900 other than Trump took office with a vacancy on the high court.\n\nAccording to a 2010 report from the Congressional Research Service, only three presidents since 1900 have had a vacancy on the Supreme Court to fill during their first 100 days. Those presidents were Warren Harding, Harry Truman and Bill Clinton. But unlike Trump, none of them had the full 100 days to get a nominee confirmed.\n\nHarding had a vacancy 77 days into his presidency when Justice Edward White died, and Truman and Clinton both received resignation letters from justices 80 days and 59 days into their respective presidencies. All three presidents had their replacement nominees confirmed after their 100th day in office.\n\nRichard Nixon was the only other modern-era president who could have potentially accomplished the feat that Trump touted.\n\nIn June 1968, Chief Justice Earl Warren submitted a resignation letter to President Lyndon Johnson, who was unable to get Justice Abe Fortas confirmed as his replacement. Warren agreed to remain on the court until Nixon, who took office in January 1969, could have a replacement nominee confirmed. However, Nixon decided to wait until May \u2014 when the 1968 court term was almost over \u2014 to nominate a replacement for Warren.\n\nJob creation: In his speech in Harrisburg, Trump again inflated the job growth that has occurred under his tenure by including jobs that were added in January before he was inaugurated, and then generously rounding up.\n\nA total of 317,000 jobs have been added during Trump\u2019s presidency, in February and March, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That\u2019s a far cry from \u201cover 600,000,\u201d a figure that\u2019s 89 percent higher than the one Trump should be using.\n\nTrump is counting the jobs that were created in January, which occurred during the last days of the Obama administration. The BLS payroll survey measures jobs as of the pay period containing the 12th day of the month, and Trump took office on Jan. 20.\n\nEven if we add in jobs created in January, the total would be 533,000 \u2014 not \u201cover 600,000.\u201d\n\nHis figures for construction, manufacturing and mining jobs also wrongly include January. The actual figures for Trump\u2019s tenure are: construction jobs, 65,000; manufacturing jobs, 37,000; mining jobs, 21,300.\n\nThe nation has now experienced positive job growth for 78 straight months, with 76 of those under Trump\u2019s predecessor.\n\nObamacare: Trump once again declared the Affordable Care Act \u201cdead.\u201d He said, \u201cPlaces like Tennessee have already lost half of their state with the insurance companies.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s wrong about Tennessee and exaggerates the condition of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs we have written, all eight of Tennessee\u2019s insurance rating areas have at least one carrier offering Affordable Care Act policies in 2017, and three of them have two. Furthermore, insurers offer multiple ACA plans \u2014 such as bronze, silver and gold \u2014 which offer different coverage plans at different prices, and some companies offer more than one of each level. For example, Cigna sells three bronze plans, four silver plans and one gold plan in greater Nashville, according to the state\u2019s rating plan.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Humana has announced it will not sell insurance on the ACA marketplace next year. \u201c[I]f another insurance company does not enter the market, there will be no Obamacare exchange\u201d in one of the eight ratings area, the greater Knoxville area, as reported by the Tennessean.\n\nAs for Obamacare being \u201cdead,\u201d the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in its analysis of a House bill to replace the ACA that the individual health insurance market \u201cwould probably be stable in most areas under either current law or the [GOP replacement] legislation.\u201d We wrote about that here.\n\nChina Currency: Trump again took undue credit for ending China\u2019s currency manipulation. \u201cNumber one, they \u2014 as soon as I got elected, they stopped,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not \u2014 it\u2019s not going down anymore, their currency.\u201d\n\nAs we have written, economists \u2014 including in Trump\u2019s own Treasury Department \u2014 say China has not been holding down the value of its currency since 2014 or 2015.\n\nRussia/Uranium: Revisiting a talking point from the 2016 campaign, Trump said, \u201cHillary [Clinton] did a uranium deal with Russia. Nobody ever talks about that.\u201d\n\nTrump badly distorts the facts of a transaction between Rosatom, the Russian nuclear energy agency, and Uranium One, a Toronto-based company with mining operations in the United States.\n\nAs a member of the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, which is required to review all U.S. transactions that involve a company owned or controlled by a foreign government, Clinton was one of nine voting members to approve Rosatom\u2019s purchase of Uranium One. As we have written, Clinton alone couldn\u2019t have stopped the deal. The committee can approve a sale, but it cannot stop a sale. \u201cOnly the President has the authority to suspend or prohibit a covered transaction,\u201d according to Treasury Department guidelines governing the committee.\n\nRussia/Hacking: Trump once again challenged the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia was behind the computer hacks of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer networks. He said that \u201cif you don\u2019t catch a hacker, okay, in the act, it\u2019s very hard to say who did the hacking. With that being said, I\u2019ll go along with Russia. Could\u2019ve been China, could\u2019ve been a lot of different groups.\u201d\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Jan. 6 released a declassified intelligence report that said it had \u201chigh confidence\u201d that Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election.\u201d Russian intelligence services gained access to Democratic National Committee computers from July 2015 to June 2016, and released hacked material to WikiLeaks and other media outlets \u201cto help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances,\u201d the report said.\n\nCorrection, Oct. 27: There were 76 straight months of job growth under Obama \u2014 not 75 as we originally wrote \u2014 and 78 straight months of growth through March.\n\nFox News. \u201cPresident Trump reflects on his first 100 days.\u201d Transcript. 28 Apr 2017.\n\nFeldscher, Kyle. \u201cTrump: \u2018Why was there the Civil War?\u2018 \u201d Washington Examiner. 1 May 2017.\n\nU.S. Census Bureau. \u201cExhibit 20.
