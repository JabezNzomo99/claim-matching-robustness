Trudeau said the two countries had a surplus, while Trump said, no, it\u2019s a deficit. Trump claimed one of his aides went to check and reported: \u201cWell sir, you\u2019re actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn\u2019t include energy and timber. But when you do we lose 17 billion dollars a year.\u201d\n\nSo, there was a $17 billion trade deficit in merchandise goods in 2017 between the United States and Canada, primarily because the United States imported about $77 billion worth of mineral products (primarily oil) from Canada \u2014 more than one-quarter of all Canadian exports \u2014 while exporting about $21 billion of mineral products back. There\u2019s also a big gap in timber, since Canada possibly has more trees than people.\n\nApparently, in Trumpland, trade in services simply does not count, even though it\u2019s a big part of U.S. trade. In fact, the World Trade Organization says that trade in services is the \u201cmost dynamic segment in world trade, growing more quickly than trade in goods.\u201d The United States is the dominant player, a fact highlighted by the 2018 annual report of the Council of Economic Advisers, released in February and signed by the president: \u201cFocusing only on the trade in goods alone ignores the United States\u2019 comparative advantage in services.\u201d\n\nTrade in services includes, among other things, telecommunications, accounting and legal services, and tourism. It\u2019s not perhaps as solid and shiny as steel, but it\u2019s a real export. In 2016, the U.S. services surplus was almost $25 billion, resulting in an overall trade surplus with Canada of $12.5 billion, according to the U.S. Trade Representative. (The Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis says the surplus was $7.7 billion in 2016 and nearly $2.8 billion in 2017.)\n\nMore to the point, these deficit and surplus numbers are almost meaningless, compared with the big picture: Canada is the No. 1 goods export market for the United States. U.S. goods and services trade with Canada totaled an estimated $627.8 billion in 2016, according to USTR.\n\nThe president frequently suggests the United States is losing money with these deficits, but countries do not \u201close\u201d money on trade deficits. A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first.\n\nAmericans want to buy these products from overseas, either because of quality or price. If Trump sparked a trade war and tariffs were increased on Canadian goods, then it would raise the cost of those products to Americans. Perhaps that would reduce American purchases of those goods, and thus reduce the trade deficit, but that would not mean the United States would \u201cgain\u201d money that had been lost. Meanwhile, trade deficits are also affected by macroeconomic factors, such as the relative strength of currencies, economic growth rates, and savings and investment rates.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request to comment on why Trump consistently says the United States runs a trade deficit with Canada when official government figures show a surplus. According to our database of Trump\u2019s false and misleading claims, he has made this false claim about Canada at least 10 times.\n\nSomeone needs to brief the president on trade in services. He admitted he simply assumed the United States ran a trade deficit with Canada, even if he did not know the answer. Bad assumption. If he had bothered to listen to Trudeau\u2019s explanation, he might have learned something.", "lang": "en"}
