Raising slogans and carrying placards, the agitators demanded the resignation of PM Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh, alleging that the controversial bill will endanger the very existence of the Mizos,\u201d per NDTV.\n\nSince the dilution of Article 370, several old, unrelated videos have been floating on social media to depict people\u2019s opposition to the government\u2019s move.
