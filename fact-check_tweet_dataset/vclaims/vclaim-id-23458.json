The person pictured is a British-born man suspected of terrorism.\n\n\u201cThis is the guy who added his infected blood to Cadbury products,\u201d the image states beneath an image of a man being led away by Interpol. \u201cFor the next few week do no eat [sic] any products from Cadbury, as a worker from the company has added his blood contaminated with HIV (AIDS).\u201d\n\nThe image also claims that this story was shown on BBC News and implores readers to \u201cplease forward this message to people who you care.\u201d\n\nNo such news story appeared on BBC News, and The Daily Caller found no reporting about it from any credible outlets.\n\nA representative for Mondelez International, the parent company of Cadbury, told the Caller in an email, \u201cWe would like to make this very clear that this is fake news. We maintain the highest quality and safety standards for all our products and have been enjoying consumer love and trust for over 175 years.\u201d\n\nThe image documents Aminu Sadiq Ogwuche, a British-born man suspected of helping orchestrate terror attacks for Boko Haram, being extradited from Sudan to Nigeria.\n\n\n\n The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that \u201cyou can\u2019t get HIV from consuming food handled by someone with HIV. Even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
