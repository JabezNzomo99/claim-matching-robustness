It was already viewed 16,100 times on Facebook as of writing, according to the tool.\n\nThe facts: The photo of the Pope looking at a braless woman's chest was manipulated using separate photos of Pope Francis taken in Bolivia, and of Argentine model Victoria Xipolitakis in Paraguay.\n\nBoth photos were taken in 2015 during the Pope's homecoming tour in July that year, when he visited Ecuador, Bolivia, and Paraguay.\n\nThe unedited photo of Pope Francis first appeared in a HuffPost article dated July 9, 2015. The article, titled \"Pope Perplexed By Gift Of Hammer And Sickle Carved With Crucifix,\" was accompanied by a photo of the Pope with a serious look on his face as he looked closely at Bolivia's gift.\n\nMeanwhile, the original photo of Xipolitakis also came out in July 2015, as pointed out in a similar fact-check piece by Rappler in 2018. The real photo of the model only showed her waving to a crowd.
