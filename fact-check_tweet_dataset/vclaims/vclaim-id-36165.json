The claim is false; four bills that propose renewing the licence are currently pending in Congress.\n\nThe online report, published here on August 13, 2019, claims that a Philippine House of Representatives committee has rejected a bill renewing the franchise of Alto Broadcasting System-Chronicle Broadcasting Network (ABS-CBN), the biggest media network in the country.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the online report:\n\nThe headline, when translated to English, says: \u201cCONFIRMED: CONGRESS ALREADY GAVE ITS VERDICT! ABS-CBN WILL CLOSE DOWN ON MARCH 30,2020! WATCH\u201d\n\nTranslated to English, the article says: \u201cTHE LOWER HOUSE WHICH HAS THE MANDATE TO PASS THE BILL RELATED TO THE REQUEST OF ABS-CBN TO HAVE ITS FRANCHISE RENEWED HAS ALREADY REACHED A DECISION AND THE COMMITTEE HAS JUNKED THE REQUEST OF ABS-CBN TO HAVE ITS FRANCHISE RENEWED.\u201d\n\n\u201cIT CAN BE RECALLED THAT RODRIGO DUTERTE HAS FIRMLY SAID THAT HE WILL NEVER ALLOW ABS-CBN TO DECEIVE HIM AGAIN LIKE THE WAY IT DID IN THE PAST ELECTIONS AND THAT HE WANTED ABS-CBN TO BE CLOSED DOWN.\u201d\n\n\u201cTHE KAPAMILYA NETWORK ABS-CBN HAS SPOKEN ABOUT THE NEWS ON THE CONGRESS' FAILURE TO APPROVE THE REQUEST OF ABS-CBN TO HAVE THEIR FRANCHISE RENEWED FOR ANOTHER 25 YEARS.\u201d\n\nA video accompanying the report repeats the claim that the broadcaster will shut down.\n\nThe report was shared on Facebook here, here and here.\n\nAs part of licensing requirements, a broadcasting network in the Philippines must obtain a congressional franchise as well as a certificate of public convenience from the National Telecommunications Commission, the regulatory body for the telecommunications sector. The congressional franchise comes in the form of a law.\n\nIn the Philippines, a bill is passed by both houses of Congress, the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is then submitted to the president, who can either sign it into law or veto it. A bill passes into law if the president has not acted on it after 30 days.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte has threatened to object to the renewal of ABS-CBN\u2019s franchise following the network\u2019s alleged refusal to air his campaign ad during the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nThe House of Representatives did not act on a November 2018 bill which sought the renewal of ABS-CBN\u2019s franchise.\n\nHowever, a search of the legislative documents in the official website of the House of Representatives showed that four bills for the renewal of ABS-CBN\u2019s franchise were filed during the current congressional session, which runs until 2022.\n\nThese include House bills no. 676, 3064, 3521 and 3713.\n\nAll four bills are still pending.", "lang": "en"}
