Many users claimed that stone pelters in Kashmir got a lesson of their lives\u2019 when they hit the army dogs.\n\nA Twitter user named Theju@Theju\u2019 has shared the video with the caption, A stone pelting Kashmiri Muslim hit two army dogs. Since the dogs didn\u2019t wait for orders from the government, they did what they thought was right! Till the time of filing this story, about 64,000 people had already watched the video.\n\nIndia Today\u2019s Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral video was uploaded six years back. The incident took place in Morocco and not Kashmir as claimed.\n\nIn the viral video, one can see the top shot of a street where a man in a yellow jacket is seen walking across a road with his two dogs. All of a sudden, another man in bright red pants and a t-shirt, along with two other men, start hitting the dogs repeatedly with a stone-like object. The dogs then maul the attacker until he is rescued by their owner.\n\nApart from Twitter, the video has been shared by many Facebook pages.\n\nThe video was earlier debunked by SMHoaxSlayer in April 2017.\n\nWe also found that in the past, the same video had been uploaded on various platforms such as Daily Motion claiming that the incident took place four years ago in Morocco\u2019s Casablanca on April 22, 2013.\n\nYouTube channel Boukili Lofts and Reddi t also posted the same video five years ago. Another blog on the same incident was posted on Wall Street Insanity the same year.\n\nThough we could not find the original source of the incident, but with all the references given above, it can be clearly said that the incident did not take place in Kashmir.\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: The truth behind a Tokyo restaurant serving human meat\n\nALSO WATCH| Fact Check: Was this Muslim man harassed in India?", "lang": "en"}
