The majority of the text first appeared in a 2017 post on the website The Daily Jot.\n\nA Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist, Krauthammer wrote for a variety of publications and appeared nightly as a commentator on the Fox News show \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier.\u201d He passed away in 2018, according to his official website.\n\nSocial media users recently shared a long statement that they attribute to the late columnist. It talks about Organizing for Action, a nonprofit organization created in 2013 to advocate for Obama\u2019s national policy goals, according to Politico.\n\n\u201cOFA is behind the strategic and tactical implementation of the resistance to the Trump Administration that we are seeing across America, and politically active courts are providing the leverage for this revolution,\u201d the post credits Krauthammer with writing. \u201cOFA is dedicated to organizing communities for \u2018progressive\u2019 change. Its issues are gun control, socialist healthcare, abortion, sexual equality, climate change, and of course, immigration reform.\u201d\n\nBut, contrary to the post\u2019s claim, Krauthammer didn\u2019t actually write the long statement, and Organizing for Action no longer exists. Krauthammer\u2019s son, Daniel, confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that Krauthammer \u201cdid not write that article.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can confirm for you that my father did not write that article,\u201d his son told the Caller. \u201cHe had nothing to do with its authorship or publication.\u201d (RELATED: Does This Video Show Barack Obama Crying During A Press Conference About Racism?)\n\nMost of the long statement appears to lift from a February 2017 article published by the website The Daily Jot. Bill Wilson, the author of The Daily Jot article, confirmed to USA Today that the Krauthammer attribution is a \u201cfabrication.\u201d The Daily Jot describes itself as \u201cnews analysis from a prophetic Christian worldview.\u201d\n\nIn early 2019, Organizing for Action merged with the National Redistricting Action Fund to form the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, according to The Hill. The merged organization, chaired by former Attorney General Eric Holder, leads the All On The Line campaign to \u201cfight against gerrymandering and push for fair maps in the next round of redistricting.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
