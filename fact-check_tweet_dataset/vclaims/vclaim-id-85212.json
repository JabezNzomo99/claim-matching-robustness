The unemployment rate and poverty rate in his district were higher in 2015 than the state and national averages. But the percent of people with high school degrees and bachelor\u2019s degrees were higher than the state and national averages.\n\nPerhaps a minor point, but Woodward took issue with the unsubstantiated report being presented at an intelligence briefing, not with it being presented at all. Here\u2019s what Woodward said on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d on Jan. 15, with the part Trump is citing in bold:\n\nWoodward: \u201cI think what\u2019s underreported here is Trump\u2019s point of view on it. And you laid it out when those former CIA people said these things about Trump, that he was a recruited, you know, agent of the Russians.\u201d Woodward: \u201cYes, and a useful fool. I mean they started this. And in Trump\u2019s mind, he knows the old adage, once a CIA man, always a CIA man. And no one came out and said those people shouldn\u2019t be saying things. So then act two is the briefing when this dossier is put out. I I\u2019ve lived in this world for 45 years where you get things and people make allegations. That is a garbage document. It never should have been presented in \u2014 as part of an intelligence briefing. As you suggested, other channels have the White House Counsel give it to Trump\u2019s incoming White House counsel. So Trump\u2019s right to be upset about that. And I think if you look at the real chronology and the nature of the battle here, those intelligence chiefs who were the best we\u2019ve had, who were terrific and have done great work made a mistake here. And when people make mistakes, they should apologize.\u201d\n\nTrump misstates a critical issue. Deployed nuclear weapons in Russia has climbed a bit because the Russians are modernizing their force. But they have to meet 2018 deployment caps set by the Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (also called New START), which does reduce and limit Russian strategic weapons. The treaty limits the number of deployed strategic warheads to no more than 1,550 on both sides.\n\nRegular readers know The Fact Checker frowns on claims that suggest a president is responsible for every good or bad thing that happens to an economy on his watch \u2014 or even before he takes office. The U.S. economy is huge; so many factors affect the economy that are out of the president\u2019s control, and decisions made long ago continue to reverberate in the future.\n\n\u201cBut the reality is that presidents have far less control over the economy than you might imagine. Presidential economic records are highly dependent on the dumb luck of where the nation is in the economic cycle. And the White House has no control over the demographic and technological forces that influence the economy. Even in areas where the president really does have power to shape the economy \u2014 appointing Federal Reserve governors, steering fiscal and regulatory policy, responding to crises and external shocks \u2014 the relationship between presidential action and economic outcome is often uncertain and hard to prove.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what Ford\u2019s chief executive Mark Fields said about the company\u2019s decision to abandon plans to open a factory in Mexico: \u201cThe reason that we are not building the new plant, the primary reason, is just demand has gone down for small cars.\u201d\n\nSo, for the third week in a row: Ford\u2019s decision has more to do with the company\u2019s long-term goal \u2014 particularly its plans to invest in electric vehicles \u2014 than with the administration. However, Ford\u2019s top officials also have said they are encouraged by economic policies and business opportunities under Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nLewis, who is boycotting Trump\u2019s inauguration, had said it would be the first inauguration he\u2019ll miss. But in fact, Lewis boycotted the inauguration of George W. Bush, and instead spent the day in his district. \u201cHe thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush\u2019s swearing-in because he doesn\u2019t believe Bush is the true elected president,\u201d The Washington Post reported on Jan. 21, 2007.", "lang": "en"}
