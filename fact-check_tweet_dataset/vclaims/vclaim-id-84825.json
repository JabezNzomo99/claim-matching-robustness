Although student loan rates may reach 10 percent in some circumstances, there are much lower interest rates that are almost equal to the average 30-year mortgage rate. The comparison doesn\u2019t work, since the two loans are so different. One major difference: You pay a lower interest rate on your home partly because you have a property at stake, unlike with a student loan.\n\nWe spotted a similar claim made in a post on Sanders\u2019s Twitter account, comparing student loan interest rates to auto loans. His claim has been widely retweeted, but it\u2019s equally mistaken.\n\nAgain, we\u2019d like to remind the senator that auto loans are collateralized. This lack of collateral makes the student loan more risky than a loan for a home or a car. The current average auto loan rate is 2.59 percent for a used car for a 60-month term, 3.4 percent for 48-month term used car, and 3.3 percent for a new car with a 60-month term, according to Bankrate.com.\n\nStudent loans disbursed between 2006 and 2015 had interest rates from 3.4 percent to 8.5 percent. The highest federal student loan interest rates have been since 1988-89 was 12 percent, according to calculations by Mark Kantrowitz, who runs Cappex.com, a website that connects students with colleges and scholarships.\n\nUnder Sanders\u2019s proposal, borrowers will be able to refinance or consolidate their federal student loans into interest rates of 2.3 to 3.1 percent, depending on the loan.\n\nSince 2013, there has been a cap on federal student loan interest rates under the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act. Undergraduate loans are capped at 8.25 percent, graduate loans at 9.25 percent and loans taken out by parents at 10.5 percent. While some Democrats heralded this law, others voted against it as it ties the student loan interest rates to 10-year Treasury bonds. Sanders joined Democrats opposing the law, saying rising interest rates would result in higher student loan rates.\n\nThe Fact Checker Recidivism Watch tracks politicians who repeat claims that we have previously found to be incorrect or false.
