It featured a story on Duterte\u2019s speech before military and police personnel.\n\nThe post\u2019s claim is false on two levels.\n\nFirst, the headline by Tokhang TV runs counter to the content of the video. Reporter Alvin Baltazar did not say anything about Duterte removing the eligibility requirement in \u201cregularizing\u201d employees.\n\n\n\nWhat he said was the president would prioritize competence and trustworthiness over eligibility among those who wish to work in government:\n\nSecond, the Tokhang TV post takes the president\u2019s speech out of context.\n\nDuterte talked about his criteria in selecting some of his appointees in the context of corruption. He explained why he chose Lt. Gen. Macairog Alberto, commanding general of the Philippine army, and Lt. Gen. Reynaldo Mapagu, defense undersecretary for civil, veterans and retiree affairs among other appointees.\n\nHe then said:\n\nIn a report by ABS-CBN News, Civil Service Commission spokesperson Ariel Ronquillo said Duterte was only referring to his \u201cown confidential appointees\u201d who are not required to pass any civil service eligibility to be employed in government.\n\nThe pirated video has garnered over 27,100 views on Youtube, and could have reached at least 274,350 people more on social media. Its largest Facebook traffic generators include pages DUTERTE MARCOS SUPPORTERS; HARRY ROQUE, BONG GO AT RONALD \u201cBATO\u201d DELA ROSA - DDS PARA SA SENADO; and Federal for Better Philippines.\n\nTokhang TV, which has a history of posting false and misleading reports, was created in November 2016.\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
