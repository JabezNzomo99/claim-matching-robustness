{"title": "FACT CHECK: Did Andrew Jackson Say, \u2018One Man With Courage Makes A Majority\u2019?", "subtitle": "", "author": "checkyourfact.com", "date": "2019-09-25T15:58:08.000Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-31376", "url": "http://checkyourfact.com/2019/09/25/andrew-jackson-one-man-courage-majority/", "vclaim": "A Facebook post alleges that former President Andrew Jackson once said, \u201cOne man with courage makes a majority.\u201d\n\nWhile the saying is widely attributed to him, there is no evidence that it originated with Jackson.\n\nWidely considered the founder of the Democratic Party, Jackson served as the seventh U.S. president. Before being elected to the Oval Office, he had a successful military career.\n\nWhile the internet is replete with quotes attributed to Jackson, this particular expression appears to be apocryphal. There is no record of it in his writings.\n\nDaniel Feller, the director of The Papers of Andrew Jackson at the University of Tennessee, debunked the quote in a 2007 article published in The Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cHere at The Papers of Andrew Jackson at the University of Tennessee, we collect and publish copies of every authenticated Jackson writing and utterance,\u201d wrote Feller. \u201cWe have nothing to corroborate his authorship of this line.\u201d\n\nThe misattribution likely stems from usage of a slight variation of the quote in James Parton\u2019s 1860 three-volume biography titled \u201cLife of Andrew Jackson,\u201d according to Feller. The saying \u2013 \u201cdesperate courage makes one a majority\u201d \u2013 appears on the title page of each volume in quotation marks.\n\nHowever, there is no indication that Parton intended the expression to be interpreted as Jackson\u2019s words. It was actually meant as a criticism of the seventh president because Parton, according to Feller, thought Jackson was a \u201cheadstrong ignoramus whose desperate courage overrode other men\u2019s good sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cParton did not mean it as a compliment, and Jackson, were he alive to see it, certainly would not have taken it as such,\u201d Feller said in the 2007 article.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation reached out to two other experts, neither of whom thought the saying came from Jackson. H.W. Brands, a history professor at the University of Texas at Austin, also noted in an email to the DCNF that it did not sound like Jackson.\n\nThe origin of the saying is unknown but similar expressions have been found in the works of transcendentalist writer Henry David Thoreau and abolitionist Wendell Phillips.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
