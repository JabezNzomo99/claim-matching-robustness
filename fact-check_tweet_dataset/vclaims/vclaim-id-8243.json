But even the most basic element of the claim, about the imposition of mandatory gun ownership in that town, wasn\u2019t quite true.\n\n(a) In order to provide for the emergency management of the city, and further in order to provide for and protect the safety, security and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants, every head of household residing in the city limits is required to maintain a firearm, together with ammunition therefore. (b) Exempt from the effect of this section are those heads of households who suffer a physical or mental disability which would prohibit them from using such a firearm. Further exempt from the effect of this section are those heads of households who are paupers or who conscientiously oppose maintaining firearms as a result of beliefs or religious doctrine, or persons convicted of a felony.\n\nIn other words, Kennesaw residents were required to own guns \u2026 save for those Kennesaw residents who couldn\u2019t afford guns, couldn\u2019t use guns, couldn\u2019t legally own guns, or simply didn\u2019t want to have guns. Essentially, Kennesaw residents were never actually required to own guns, making most assertions about mandatory gun ownership and crime rates in that town highly problematic.\n\nThat law was a direct response to a (since repealed) ban on the possession of handguns that was implemented in Morton Grove, Illinois, in 1981. An important point of distinction between the two examples was that Morton Grove\u2019s was enforceable while Kennesaw\u2019s was largely symbolic and was never intended to be enforced. The latter, therefore is clearly not an exceptionally good indicator of the effect of such a mandate on crime statistics.\n\nAs Kennesaw Police Department\u2019s Lt. Craig Graydon explained, gun ownership wasn\u2019t truly compulsory in Kennesaw (nor was it ever intended to be):\n\nKennesaw\u2019s 1982 gun mandate was a direct response to a gun ban enacted a year earlier in Morton Grove, Illinois. That was later deemed unconstitutional, but Kennesaw\u2019s law is still on the books. Added Lt. Graydon, \u201cIt was not meant to be an enforceable law. The police department has never searched homes to make sure you had a gun. It was meant more or less as a political statement to support citizens\u2019 second amendment rights to own firearms.\u201d Homeowners in Kennesaw who don\u2019t buy a gun are not punished. In fact, there are several exemptions, including religious objections, if someone is a convicted felon, has a mental illness or simply can\u2019t afford a weapon.\n\nLt. Graydon\u2019s sentiment was also expressed in an April 1987 New York Times article:\n\nMayor Stephenson says that in the five years since the gun ordinance was adopted the city has never prosecuted anyone for refusing to keep a gun. Officials concede that the ordinance is, for all intents, unenforceable. \u201cWe\u2019re not interested in searching people\u2019s houses,\u201d said the Mayor. \u201cMostly, what we wanted to do was make a statement, to make people sit up and take notice. And they did, and we\u2019re proud of that.\u201d\n\nMuch of the claim hinged on the passage of time for plausibility. Hard statistics for the crime rate in a small Georgia city before 1982 were difficult to come by in 2015 (more than three decades later), but the author of a 18 March 1982 New York Times editorial titled \u201cThe Guns of Kennesaw\u201d squeezed those numbers from the initially \u201creticent\u201d Mayor Darvin Purdy and Chief of Police Robert Ruble:\n\nSoon afterwards, the narrative claiming a reduction in crime had begun to develop (even as Mayor Stephenson conceded he had no idea how many residents newly became gun owners because of the law): \u201cIn 1981, the year before the ordinance was adopted, Kennesaw recorded 55 house burglaries. The next year there were 26, and in 1985 only 11.\u201d\n\nAs the news excerpt referenced above indicated, a drop in homicides owing to a mandatory gun ownership law would be difficult to measure, as the number of murders that took place in Kennesaw the year prior to the law\u2019s implementation was zero and therefore could drop no lower. And the increased number of armed robberies from 1980 (one) to 1981 (four) represented a sample so low that a subsequent reduction in such crime didn\u2019t provide any meaningful data from which a conclusion about \u201cmandatory\u201d gun ownership and crime rates could be drawn.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is whether Kennesaw\u2019s crime rates were observed elsewhere in the state. In the decade bracketing the law\u2019s passage (1976 through 1986) there was a significant drop in murders, burglaries, property crimes, the property crime rate, and the burglary rate in Georgia as whole (despite Kennesaw\u2019s outlier status with the gun law in question). Statewide, the murder rate similarly dropped in a fairly dramatic fashion after 1982 without a statewide law requiring gun ownership.", "lang": "en"}
