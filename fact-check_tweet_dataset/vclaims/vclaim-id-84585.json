Along with online celebrations of her murder, came these veiled social media attacks on Lankesh. \u201cYet we should condole her death?\u201d asked Postcard News in an attempt to justify the celebratory posts. Others like Paresh Rawal may not have asked the question directly but circulated her old posts that they found objectionable. What is this post on \u201cfree sex\u201d that has offended the so-called nationalists? Let us take a look at what Gauri Lankesh had said, its context and how it is being interpreted in a twisted manner after her death.\n\nThe Context: Never unfree, never forced\n\nTo understand the context of the \u201cfree-sex\u201d post of Gauri Lankesh, one has to go back a long time.\n\nThe term \u201cfree sex\u201d was used as a slur by BJP MP Subramanian Swamy against Kavita Krishnan of CPI(ML) on national television way back in 2013.\n\nSince then, Swamy has used it several times and each time it has proven to be a cue for the online troll army to attack Krishnan. In 2016, reacting to a news item about barring a woman in a short dress from an Indigo flight, Kavita Krishnan had tweeted, \u201cStop this kind of sexist idiocy @IndiGo6E Length of our skirts none of your business!\u201d\n\nThis was a time that several voices were being raised about moral policing and misogynistic comments by fringe elements associated with the right-wing. There was nothing unusual about Krishnan\u2019s post but it elicited an unusual unprovoked reaction from Swamy. For him it was an attack on middle class values and he referred to Krishnan as a \u201cfree sex Naxalite\u201d.\n\nThe label \u201cfree sex\u201d led to a lot of debate about what is free and what is un-free i.e. paid or forced. In response, Kavita Krishnan had maintained, \u201cOne can only pity\u2026. who fear \u2018free sex\u2019 \u2013 un-free sex is after all nothing but rape\u201d and was extensively trolled for saying so.\n\nIt was Kavita Krishnan\u2019s mother who silenced the trolls with her gutsy reply. It was about consent. It was about free choice. \u201cNever un-free never forced\u201d\n\nGauri Lankesh\u2019s Facebook post was in support of Kavita Krishnan and her mother. At no point has she called anyone\u2019s mother a \u201csex slave\u201d as claimed by Postcard News. This brings us to the question, what is the outrage about? What did BJP MP Paresh Rawal find so objectionable? Is it because a woman spoke about the right of every woman to consent and free choice? If free sex is consensual sex, what is the opposite of free sex? Maybe those maligning Gauri Lankesh can explain it better to us.", "lang": "en"}
