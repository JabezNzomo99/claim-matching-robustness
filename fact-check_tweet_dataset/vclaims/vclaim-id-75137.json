{"title": "The false tale of the bullfighter\u2019s epiphany", "subtitle": "A photo of a matador facing a bull has recently resurfaced and is presented as the exact moment that led Alvaro Munera to end his bullfighting career, upon realizing the cruelty of his sport. However, the real Munera ended his career after a severe injury, and the matador in the photo is intentionally striking a dangerous pose to challenge the bull.", "author": "factcheck.afp.com", "date": "2018-12-12T13:55:42+01:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-75137", "url": "https://factcheck.afp.com//false-tale-bullfighters-epiphany", "vclaim": "\u201cThis incredible photo marks the end of Matador Torero Alvaro Munera\u2019s career,\u201d reads the caption of a photo shared tens of thousands of times in several languages.\n\nThe image depicts a man sitting down, head lowered, one hand on his temple, as though he were realizing something. Facing him a couple feet away is a bull looking at the torero, a few banderillas, or bullfighting spikes, sticking out of its back.\n\nThe caption also attributes a quote to Munera, in reference to scene captured in the photo. \u201cAnd suddenly I looked at the bull. He had this innocence that all animals have in their eyes, and he looked at me with this pleading.\u201d\n\nThe post was shared tens of thousands of times in English, French, Spanish, Italian, and more over the past decade.\n\nMunera, also known as El Pilarico, was a famous Colombian matador who was injured by a bull in the arena in 1984, after which he began to promote anti-bullfighting campaigns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me and that\u2019s not what happened to me,\u201d Munera told AFP in Spanish.\n\n\u201cI left the world of bullfighting due to an accident that left me in a wheelchair.\u201d\n\nPart of the quotation presented in the posts also exists, but it is out of context. The part of it that describes the bull\u2019s eyes was published in Spanish newspaper El Pais, on July 30, 1995, well after Munera retired.\n\nIt appeared in an excerpt named \u201cThe inhuman race,\u201d from the book La Casa Sosegada by Spanish writer Antonio Gala, available on page 23 of this document. This translation reads \u201cAll of a sudden, the bull, his eyes innocent and imploring, stared at me.\u201d\n\nWhat is happening in the photo?\n\nThe photo is real, but the reality is far from what the caption suggests. The bullfighter in the photo is performing a desplante, a common move in bullfighting in which the matador asserts his dominance over the bull by deliberately placing himself in a dangerous position. The emotion of the scene is defiance, not contrition.", "lang": "en"}
