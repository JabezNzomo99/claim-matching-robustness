As with all other members of the EU the UK is a shareholder in the European Investment Bank (EIB). It is the bank of the EU and works closely with the other EU governing bodies, investing in projects across Europe and around the world.\n\nAlong with Germany, France and Italy, the UK is one of the largest shareholders in the EIB with shares of 16%.\n\nEarlier this year a committee of Lords said that \u201cit is likely that the UK would claim its called up capital in the event that it ceased to be a shareholder of the EIB\u201d, that was around \u20ac3.5 billion in 2016. But it said that \u201ca more useful measure\u201d would be be the UK\u2019s share of the bank\u2019s equity, reserves and profits for that year (known as the bank\u2019s \u2018own funds\u2019.)\n\nThe EIB had around \u20ac66 billion of its own funds in 2016. The UK\u2019s 16% share of that would be \u20ac11 billion or just under \u00a39 billion.\n\nThe EIB\u2019s rules state that its members must also be member states of the EU. For the UK to remain a member of the EIB after Brexit the rules would have to be changed\u2014something that all the remaining members states would have to agree on.\n\nAs well as the UK having shares in the EIB, the bank also invests in projects in the UK. This investment totalled more than \u20ac29 billion between 2011 and 2015, followed by another \u20ac6.9 billion in 2016. Whether or not the EIB would continue to lend money to projects in the UK is likely to be discussed during Brexit negotiations. It would be possible for this to happen, but it would need the unanimous agreement of finance ministers in all the remaining EU countries.", "lang": "en"}
