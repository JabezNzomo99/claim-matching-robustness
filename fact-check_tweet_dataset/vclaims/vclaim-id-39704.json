He who works with his hands and his head is a craftsman. He who works with his hands and his head and his heart is an artist.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that this saying originated with Francis.\n\nFrancis, who gave up his wealth to live in evangelical poverty during the late 12th and early 13th centuries, founded the Order of Friars Minor, commonly known as the Franciscans. He is also the patron saint of the environment and animals.\n\nWhile he wrote considerably on a variety of topics, the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post appears nowhere in his written works. A search of his complete writings turned up no matches.\n\n\u201cThis quotation is not found in any contemporary sources nor in any of St. Francis\u2019s own authentic writings,\u201d said Augustine Thompson, the theology department chair at the Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology, in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation. \u201cI have never heard of it before \u2013 and it does not even sound like something a thirteenth-century Italian would say. In fact, it sounds to me like something a nineteenth-century Romantic would say.\u201d\n\nEtymologist Barry Popik traced the earliest instance of the expression in print back to 1923, where it appeared unattributed in the Boys\u2019 Workers Round Table magazine. (It uses the word \u201cartisan\u201d instead of \u201ccraftsman\u201d and \u201cbrain\u201d instead of \u201chead\u201d in this instance.)\n\nIt has also been attributed to lawyer Louis Nizer, who employed the quote in his 1948 book \u201cBetween You and Me,\u201d according to Popik.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
