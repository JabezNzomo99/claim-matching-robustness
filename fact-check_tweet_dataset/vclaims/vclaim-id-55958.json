Secretary General Antonio Guterres outlined the results of the investigation to Security Council members, but the report itself has not been released. The Sept. 14, 2019, attacks hit Saudi-Aramco facilities and shut down more than 5% of global oil supplies, causing a spike in oil prices.\n\nIran called the U.N.\u2019s conclusions \u201cbaseless\u201d and said the world body is \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d and \u201cextremely unprofessional.\u201d\n\nRussia also echoed Iran\u2019s critique, stating that the U.N.\u2019s findings were based not on \u201cconvincing evidence\u201d but merely \u201csome images such as media pictures of military exhibitions.\u201d\n\nOn June 13, Iran\u2019s U.N. ambassador, Majid Takht Ravanchi, said on Twitter: \u201c\u2018Iranian origin\u2019 of arms is a fallacy. UN Secretariat lacks capacity, expertise & knowledge to conduct investigations.\u201d https://en.irna.ir/news/83820417/Envoy-terms-Iranian-origin-of-arms-as-fallacy\n\nThe claim about U.N. capabilities is false.\n\nAnalysts told Polygraph.info that there is no doubt about the U.N.\u2019s expertise and capacity to authoritatively investigate such cases.\n\n\u201cThe U.N. Panel of Experts has a high level of forensic weapons intel capability, both internal and through contacts and contractors, to identify and trace partial and complete weapons system,\u201d said Michael Knights, senior Mideast analyst at the Washington Institute.\n\n\u201cThey use U.N.-appointed, long-term subject matter experts who are very picky about chain of custody and evidencing,\u201d Knights said. \u201cThe Iranian comment is not accurate, and Iran never replies to information requests from the U.N. investigators.\u201d\n\nTim Michetti, a private-sector expert on illicit weapon flows in Africa and the Middle East, also lauded the U.N.\u2019s work on arms. Working together with independent weapons technical intelligence organizations, the U.N. \u201chas produced the best open-source information to date on illicit transfers of Iranian materiel,\u201d he said.\n\nThe U.N. has not revealed which of its teams were involved in the Saudi Aramco attack investigation. Asked about the findings, the U.N. media office told Polygraph.info further details may be made public after the Security Council holds a private meeting on June 24.\n\nYemen\u2019s Iran-supported Houthi rebels, known as Ansar Allah, claimed responsibility for the attack, as they have for several dozen other attacks on Saudi Arabia since 2015, when Riyadh entered the war in Yemen to back the government in Sanaa.\n\nThe U.N. investigators previously confirmed the Houthi forces were responsible for most of those earlier attacks, and that the weapons they used were of \u201cIranian origin and shipped from Iran.\u201d\n\nIn the case of the Sept. 14 attack, however, the U.N. team said the Houthi forces were not responsible. That\u2019s because the missiles that struck Saudi targets came from \u201ca north/northwestern and north/northeastern direction, rather than from the south, as one would expect in the case of a launch from Yemeni territory.\u201d\n\nIn January, Reuters reported that the U.N. investigators were not tasked to identify the perpetrators. Still, their preliminary report said the Houthi forces were receiving \u201cassault rifles, rocket propelled grenade launchers, antitank guided missiles, as well as more sophisticated cruise missile systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of those weapons have technical characteristics similar to arms manufactured in Iran,\u201d Reuters said, quoting the U.N. investigators.\n\nWriting at the time, Michetti said that the U.N. investigation \u201cmay have been stymied somewhat by U.S. exploitation teams, who initially combed through and removed some of the weapon debris.\u201d\n\nBut he noted that the U.N. \u201crequires near-certain evidence\u201d before making attributions, and that its standards of transparency and verification require that it \u201csidestep controversial findings.\u201d\n\nSome wreckage from the Saudi Aramco attack is on display at the Iranian Materiel Display (IMD) at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C., along with other Iran-manufactured weaponry that the U.S. has seized over the years.\n\nThe Pentagon launched the IMD three years ago, to \u201cpresent evidence that Iran is arming dangerous groups with advanced weapons, spreading instability and conflict in the region.\u201d The U.S. maintains the exhibit is proof of \u201cIranian proliferation into Yemen, Afghanistan and Bahrain.\u201d\n\nThe U.N. Secretariat has traveled a number of times to Saudi Arabia and to Washington, D.C., to examine the Iranian weapons and the debris, Guterres said last December, and was able to independently verify the Iranian origin of the weapons.\n\nIn its critique of the U.N. report, Iran took a swipe at the prevalence of U.S. arms, citing \u201cthe origin of sophisticated weaponry being poured into our region by the U.S. and its allies killing and maiming innocent people is quite obvious.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has kept the arms pipeline open to Saudi Arabia despite criticism from human rights groups and others.\n\nBoth Iran and Yemen are under a U.N. arms embargo. Iran has been accused of violating the ban by smuggling weapons to state and non-state regimes and groups in the Middle East and in Africa.", "lang": "en"}
