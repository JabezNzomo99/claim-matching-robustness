Beto O\u2019Rourke running for president gain traction, so do some questionable claims about the maybe-candidate\u2019s platform.\n\n\"If I could throw two kinds of people in the garbage it would be the elderly and wounded veterans,\" reads the text under a photo of O\u2019Rourke that was published on Facebook on Feb. 13. \"When a tool breaks you don\u2019t fix it, you throw it in the damn trash.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Is it true?\n\n\"Of course not,\" O\u2019Rourke spokesman Chris Evans told PolitiFact. \"Beto has never said that, and it\u2019s a fabricated quote.\"\n\nHe pointed to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s position as a member of the House Veteran Affairs Committee and his work as \"the congressional representative for the large military community of El Paso,\" where the congressman is from.\n\n\"His leading bipartisan initiative to expand access to mental health care for veterans was passed in the House, passed in the Senate, and signed into law by the president,\" Evans continued. \"He held regular veteran town halls in El Paso to hear directly from those who wore our country\u2019s uniform and ensure they had access to their representative in Congress.\"\n\nTrump vs. O'Rourke on immigration messaging in El Paso\n\nAfter searching online, we couldn\u2019t find any sources to corroborate the claim that O\u2019Rourke said vets and seniors should trashed.\n\nAccording to ProPublica\u2019s list of the legislation O\u2019Rourke sponsored during 2017-2018, he backed six bills related to veterans, including the Get Veterans a Better Doctor Now Act and the Enhanced Veteran Healthcare Act of 2017.\n\nDuring O\u2019Rourke\u2019s failed bid to oust Ted Cruz from the U.S. Senate, the Texas Tribune asked both lawmakers what three legislative accomplishments they were most proud of.\n\n\"The O\u2019Rourke campaign passed along three measures that the El Paso Democrat saw signed into law by Trump,\" the Tribune reported, including two bills related to veterans and service members. \"O\u2019Rourke was the primary sponsor of the Honor our Commitment Act, which expanded mental health care through the VA to veterans with \u2018other-than-honorable\u2019 discharges from the military. The measure was included in an omnibus spending bill in March.\"\n\n\"This figure shows an unacceptable gap in health care coverage for our nation\u2019s most vulnerable veterans,\" O\u2019Rourke said in the blog post on Medium.\n\nWe rate the made-up Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
