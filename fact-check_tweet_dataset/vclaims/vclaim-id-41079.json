No, that's not true: The only sourcing for the claim is a tweet from a self-described vegan that included a meme featuring an anonymous quote along with a photo of a cut of meat with an unidentified green substance in the middle. There is no support for the claim that the quote is from an \"experienced butcher\" or that it is a regular practice for butchers to sell meat after cutting out tumors.\n\nThe claim has circulated on social platforms for several years, including a version that originated from an article (archived here) published by EducateInspireChange.org on February 20, 2018 under the title \"Experienced Butcher Admits: 'When We See Cancer In The Pork, We Just Cut It And Still Sell It To Customers'\".

Carcasses that are condemned are not allowed to enter commerce/food supply and are denatured and disposed of appropriately.\n\n\n\nDenaturing involves covering the carcass or meat with a non-toxic colored dye. The purpose of the dye is to clearly change the appearance of the condemned meat to something that does not resemble edible product. Colored dye typically includes colors such as green, black or blue, does not wash off of the meat, and may be incorporated throughout the meat.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes educateinspirechange.org as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
