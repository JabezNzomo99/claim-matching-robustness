Two \u201ctweets\u201d from the US President\u2019s Twitter account were fabricated\n\nTwo images shared in multiple posts on Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp in Nigeria claim to show tweets from US President Donald Trump warning he will attack the West African country for supporting Iran in the wake of rising tensions between the two sparring nations. However, both images have been digitally altered to look like they were sent from Trump\u2019s personal account and are false.\n\nOne of the images (screenshot below) has been viewed more than 16,000 times since it was shared here on Facebook on January 8, 2020 by an account displaying the logo of Nigeria\u2019s main opposition People's Democratic Party.\n\nIt claims to show a tweet from Trump posted at 12:11 am on January 8, 2020.\n\nThe caption, replete with uppercase words and spelling errors typical of Trump\u2019s style, reads: \u201cWe have reports of NIGERIA supporting Iran ACTIVELY and PASSIVELY\u2026.just got of the phone with secretary Pompeo\u2026.the USA MUST and WILL respond to terrorist nations IMMEDIATELY!\u201d\n\nA similar version has been shared here, here, and here on Facebook, and on Twitter here, here, here, and here.\n\nAnother image purporting to be a Trump tweet also appeared here on Twitter, although the wording is different, but implies the same threat.\n\nThey follow recent international developments which saw Iran launch missiles at two air bases hosting American and other foreign troops in Iraq early on January 8, 2020, a move seen as revenge for the killing of its top military commander Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike near Baghdad Airport on January 3, 2020. Read AFP's report here.\n\nAlthough some members of the pro-Iran Islamic Movement in Nigeria, known as Shi'ites, protested against the killing of Soleimani on January 6 in the capital Abuja, the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs called for calm.\n\nThe two fabricated images appear designed to achieve the opposite by trading on Trump's robust exchanges on Twitter.\n\nAFP searched Trump\u2019s Twitter account on Wayback Machine, a digital archive of internet content that takes regular snapshots of web pages, and found the earliest documented tweet by the US President on January 8 was at 3:15 am (0215 GMT) -- about one hour after one of the purported tweets was supposedly sent.\n\nThe so-called tweets do not appear in Trump\u2019s archived timeline. See here and here.\n\nThere are also several visual clues that are telling.\n\nFor starters, it is customary for tweets appearing in someone\u2019s feed to have three symbols in the footer -- comments, retweets, and likes.\n\nHowever, when a tweet is opened, those symbols are replaced by \u201cRetweets\u201d and \u201cLikes\u201d and their accompanying numbers (see examples below).\n\nBut the image below has an unusual configuration. On one line it shows 244,391 retweets and 319,284 likes, while below that the same metrics are reproduced using the comment, retweet and like symbols, which doesn't happen with Twitter.\n\nThe date in the image above is also inconsistent with Twitter's style, which employs the month first, and then the day and year: January 8, 2020.\n\nIn the second so-called \u201ctweet\u201d, the number of characters exceeds the limit imposed by Twitter.\n\nAFP did a count -- the image contains 320 characters, 40 more than the limit of 280 set by Twitter, meaning if it was a genuine tweet, it could not have been published.\n\nFor good measure, the US Embassy in Nigeria dismissed the images.\n\nPress and information officer, Glenn Guimond, when asked by AFP in an email about the veracity of the purported tweets, said: \u201cThis is false.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
