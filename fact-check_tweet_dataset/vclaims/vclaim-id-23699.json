It is your income.\u201d\n\nLabor announced a $2.3 billion Medicare Cancer Plan to fund six million free scans and tests and three million free specialist appointments over four years to reduce out-of-pocket treatment costs for cancer sufferers. [1]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined the claim by Labor leader Bill Shorten that the most reliable predictor of cancer survival is not a patient\u2019s general health or family history but income.\n\nAAP FactCheck asked Mr Shorten\u2019s office for the source of his claim but received no reply.\n\nIn 2017 cancer accounted for 28.1 per cent of deaths in Australia, or around 45,200 people, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). In 2017-18 around one in 50 (1.8 per cent or 432,400) Australians had cancer. [2]\n\nA 2019 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) cancer report found between 2010 and 2014 the age-standardised mortality rate for all cancers was highest among patients in the lowest socioeconomic group and lowest among those from the highest socioeconomic group.\n\nThe five-year cancer survival rate was 67 per cent for those living in the most socioeconomic advantaged areas, while the lowest socioeconomic areas recorded a rate of 55 per cent, the (AIHW) report found.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2016, the mortality rate for all cancers combined was 187 deaths per 100,000 people in the lowest socioeconomic areas and 136 per 100,000 in the highest socioeconomic areas. [3]\n\nA Cancer Council of Australia\u2019s submission to the National Health and Medical Research Council stated \u201cthe available evidence on cancer and socioeconomic status clearly shows that people in disadvantaged groups have markedly higher cancer mortality rates, largely attributable to reduced access to health promotion information and consequent higher risk behaviours\u201d. [4]\n\nAssociate Professor Brigid Lynch, a senior research fellow at Cancer Council Victoria stated in 2017 it was very clear a person\u2019s socioeconomic position had a strong influence on cancer incidence and mortality in Australia.\n\n\u201cThe better off people are, the less likely they are to develop most cancers - and they are more likely to survive after diagnosis,\u201d Professor Lynch said. \u201cWe know that socioeconomic position influences cancer in a number of ways including via health behaviours.\u201d [6]\n\nThese Australian findings were supported by a 2018 US study led by doctors Jeremy O\u2019Connor and Cary Gross from the Yale University School of Medicine, which found people in low and middle-income US counties were more likely to die of cancer than those in high-income counties.\n\nThe US study found eight factors, including lack of access to high-quality clinical care, food insecurity, smoking and obesity may help explain more than 80 per cent of the relationship between poverty and disparities in cancer death rates. [6] [7]\n\nAAP FactCheck concludes that based on this evidence in Australia and the US, Mr Shorten\u2019s claim is mostly true. Income has a \u201cstrong influence\u201d on a patient\u2019s chances of dying from cancer but it is not necessarily the \u201cmost reliable\u201d predictor as he stated.", "lang": "en"}
