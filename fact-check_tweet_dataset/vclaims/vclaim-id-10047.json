Mr. Gordon spent the last seven years working as a night watch at a lab owned by American Cosmetic Chemicals (ACC), a subcontractor for several companies including Cover Girl, Neutrogena, and Yves Rocher. He was recently caught by a video camera while masturbating in the cream tanks and was confronted by his employer. He admitted that he was depressed since he got divorced three years ago and that had ejaculated in the reservoirs at least 500 times since then to \"avenge himself against women\".\n\nOf course the story is fake. It originated on the satirical website World News Daily Report and the man in the picture is not \"Larry Gordon\" but David E. Brady, a man arrested at a music festival for selling fake drugs. It seems like IdeasFun copied the story but conveniently forgot to mention the source.\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known hoax website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories.
