Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., saying gunmen will lay down their weapons when they see their victims are unarmed is fabricated.\n\nThe page Principle News shared the quote in a post on Sept. 17.\n\nIt quotes Feinstein as saying, \"When the gunman realizes that nobody else is armed, he will lay down his weapons and turn himself in. That's human nature.\"\n\nThis image was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe statement on the meme about gunman is a fabricated quote that first appeared February 2013 on the website Palookaville Post. The story appeared after Feinstein proposed a bill that would \"ban the sale, transfer, manufacturing or importation of 150 specific firearms.\" The material from the Palookaville Post article was quoted on several websites.\n\nThe original website doesn\u2019t operate now, but the full article can be found in the archive of the WayBack Machine. It is bylined by a fake author \"Jimmy Olsentwins.\" The website itself was satirical and mostly active in 2013.\n\nFor the next five years the false post bounced around the internet (especially in memes) to criticize Feinstein.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
