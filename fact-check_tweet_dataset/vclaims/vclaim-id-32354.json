Let\u2019s check the authenticity of the claim.\n\nWhen searched with the text \u2018Sniffer dogs killed in Pulwama attack\u2019, no corroborating information was found in the results. The media, in their news reports about Pulwama attack, have reported only about the death of 40 CRPF jawans; they did not mention about the death of sniffer dogs. Those reports can be seen here, here and here. When the image is cropped to the extent of dogs and subjected to reverse image search technique, it was found in a Facebook post from 2016. So, it has nothing to do with the Pulwama attack that occurred in \u2018February 2019\u2019.\n\nAlso, earlier, when \u2018The Quint\u2019 had contacted \u2018CRPF\u2019 about information regarding the death of sniffer dogs in the Pulwama attack, they were told that sniffer dogs weren\u2019t killed in the attack as the convoy was transporting only jawans.\n\nTo summarize, sniffer dogs weren\u2019t killed in the Pulwama blasts.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
