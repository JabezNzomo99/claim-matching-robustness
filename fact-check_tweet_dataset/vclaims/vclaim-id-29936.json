The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was not identified until early January 2020. Genomic analysis of the virus indicates it has a natural origin and was not man-made.\n\n Misrepresents source: Several coronavirus strains have been patented or referenced in the labeling of animal vaccines and disinfectants, such as Lysol. However, the 2019 outbreak was caused by a new coronavirus strain which emerged more recently. Patents cited to support this claim are not related to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which was newly identified in early January 2020 after genome sequencing. Instead, these patents are for known coronavirus strains such as SARS-CoV-1, which causes SARS. A pandemic simulation exercise called Event 201, which was held just before COVID-19 hit the U.S., did not predict the COVID-19 pandemic as many have claimed, and the hypothetical virus it modeled does not resemble SARS-CoV-2. Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 indicates no signs of genetic modification. The wide scientific consensus is that the virus is of natural origin and that the outbreak began through zoonotic infection, not through a lab accident.\n\n\n\n The claim that SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19, is not actually a new virus has taken many different forms. One of its first incarnations, published in late January 2020, was made by Jordan Sather, who stated that the coronavirus is \u201c\u2018new\u2019 yet it was lab-created and patented in 2015\u201d. Sather asserted that the proof of this claim was the existence of a patent for a coronavirus held by the Pirbright Institute in the United Kingdom. This claim went viral on Facebook within a day and spawned numerous copycat posts on Facebook that received more than 86,000 views. The rapid spread of this claim on social media was attributed to the group QAnon, as well as anti-vaccine groups.\n\nHowever, the patent that Sather cited is not for SARS-CoV-2 at all, but for the avian infectious bronchitis virus, a coronavirus that infects birds. Similar false claims about patents related to SARS-CoV-2 have inaccurately referenced patents to other coronaviruses, such as a one for SARS-CoV-1 which caused the 2003 SARS outbreak of more than 8,000 cases of infection in 26 countries. No patents currently exist for SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the existence of a patent on a virus does not indicate that it was man-made because until 2013, U.S. patent law allowed patenting of natural organisms, as mentioned in this article by FactCheck.org.\n\nThis claim has evolved over time, with later posts citing product labelling on animal vaccines and virus-killing disinfectants, such as Lysol, which list \u201ccoronavirus\u201d as one of the microorganisms it kills as evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not new. However, \u201ccoronavirus\u201d is not a single disease or organism, as many of these posts suggest. It is the name given to an entire family of viruses, some of which cause severe respiratory illnesses (such as SARS and MERS), and others which cause the common cold. These claims misleadingly conflate known coronaviruses with SARS-CoV-2, which is a novel coronavirus that was identified as the causal agent of COVID-19 in early January 2020[1]. It has been found to share 96% genomic sequence identity with a bat coronavirus isolated in the wild, named RaTG13[2].\n\nThe origin of the virus has not yet been confirmed, but one theory is that it jumped from animals to humans at a wet market in Wuhan, China, that trades in a wide range of livestock. However, the first known case of COVID-19 had no known link to the market and neither did about one-third of later patients in the first cohort examined[3].\n\nNo vaccine is yet available against SARS-CoV-2, as some posts have claimed, although scientists around the world are working on one now.\n\nSome posts claim that the 2019 pandemic was a planned, man-made event based on the fact that the outbreak began only a few months after a pandemic response simulation event called Event 201, held in New York on 18 October 2019. The association between the outbreak and Event 201 has been debunked by several fact-checkers, including PolitiFact, Full Fact, and FactCheck.org.\n\nEvent 201 was held jointly by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the World Economic Forum. The goal of the exercise was to \u201cillustrate areas where public/private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences.\u201d Due to the occurrence of the event only a few months before the global COVID-19 outbreak started, many have speculated that the exercise had already predicted the pandemic. The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security has clarified that no predictions were made during the exercise and that the parameters used in modeling their hypothetical virus did not resemble the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2:\n\nRelated to the claim that the pandemic was planned is the claim that the virus is man-made, examples of which can be found in this New York Post article published in February 2020 and more recently, the \u201cPlandemic\u201d vignette featuring anti-vaccination activist Judy Mikovits. This claim has largely been fueled by the fact that there is a laboratory studying bat coronaviruses in Wuhan, although labs in the U.S. and Canada have also been implicated. However, genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 has shown no traces of bioengineering or manipulation[4]. Health Feedback reviewed the New York Post article and the Plandemic video and found that both contained inaccurate and unsupported information.\n\nMultiple pieces of evidence, such as the analysis of its likely evolutionary trajectory and past zoonotic outbreaks, which Health Feedback discussed in this article, indicate that the virus has a natural origin and that the virus most likely jumped from an animal to humans through a zoonotic infection, instead of leaking from a lab.\n\u2022 1 \u2013 Zhu et al.
