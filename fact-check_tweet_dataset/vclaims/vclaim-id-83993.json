In this video, he shows how newly constructed RCC Bollards and RCC Road boundaries are coming apart within a few months of being constructed. In the first part of the video, he shows how RCC road boundaries constructed to prevent vehicles from going off the edge of the road disintegrate just by gripping the edge of the boundary hard enough. In the second part of the video, he shows how RCC Bollards, again used for stopping vehicles from going off the edge of the road, can be literally kicked out of their foundation and again crumble into powder by just gripping at it.\n\nVimal goes on to criticise the blind devotion that Modi supporters (Bhakts) have towards the Prime Minister and how such sub-standard construction reflects poorly on the oft-repeated slogan of \u2018Vikas\u2019. He also states all such construction in that area is in a similar state. He goes on to suggest that along with the Patidar community that he belongs to, all the other communities in Gujarat will defeat BJP in 2017.\n\nThis video reflects the corruption there is in the infrastructure business under Gujarat Government with contractors using the most sub-standard material while over-charing the Government for same.", "lang": "en"}
