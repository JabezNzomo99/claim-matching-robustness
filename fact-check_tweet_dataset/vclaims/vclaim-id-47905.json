His estate at Mount Vernon includes the expression on its list of \u201cspurious quotations.\u201d\n\nGeorge Washington, the first U.S. president and a prominent figure in the Revolutionary War, has been credited with coining a multitude of quotes about firearms, governance and citizens\u2019 rights. (RELATED: Did George Washington Say, \u2018Firearms Stand Next In Importance To The Constitution Itself?)\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence, however, that this particular quote about firearms originated with Washington. The Daily Caller searched his writings and recorded speeches, but neither collection yielded any similar or matching phrases.\n\nWashington\u2019s estate at Mount Vernon also includes the expression on its list of \u201cspurious quotations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe quote seems to originate from an online publication: The American Wisdom Series presents Pamphlet #230, \u2018President George Washington\u2019s Thoughts on Firearms,'\u201d states the Mount Vernon website. \u201cThe author provides no citation for the quotations used.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it appears unattributed in the pamphlet written by one Joe Spenner. The statement may have originated with him, as he includes it in the section of the pamphlet that appears to be his own commentary. The rest of the pamphlet contains sayings about firearms that are attributed to Washington, though some of those are also spurious. The pamphlet has been online since at least 2002, according to etymologist Barry Popik.\n\n\u201cThe anti-gun saying is often accompanied with a photo of Dianne Feinstein, a senator from California who frequently sponsors gun control legislation,\u201d noted Popik.", "lang": "en"}
