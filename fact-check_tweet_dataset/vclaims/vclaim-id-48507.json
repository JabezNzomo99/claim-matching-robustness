The claim is false; the video shows a 2014 performance by Angelina Jordan, winner of Norway's Got Talent, who was 8 years old at the time. Winehouse died in 2011.\n\nIn 2015, a Facebook account twice shared a video of a young girl singing the late American singer Dinah Washington's \"What a Difference a Day Made\" in a live television performance.\n\nThis post from August 11, 2015, was shared more than 81,000 times and viewed nearly four million times. Its caption states: \u201cAmy Wine house, age 10. Sad she is gone.\u201d\n\nA nearly identically-captioned post from August 12, 2015, was shared more than 510,000 times and received 27 million views.\n\nBritish singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse died at age 27 in 2011. An inquest released in 2013 found she died after drinking too much alcohol.\n\nAFP released this video report on July 23, 2011, the day Winehouse was found dead, featuring archival footage of the singer.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the August 12 Facebook post:\n\nInitial comments on the post indicated that people believed the caption:\n\nThe claim is false; the video shows a performance from Norwegian singer Angelina Jordan in 2014, three years after Winehouse's death.\n\nThe original video was posted to YouTube by TV 2, a government-owned television station in Denmark, on July 3, 2014.\n\nThe caption for the video says: \u201cAmazing! 8 year old Angelina Jordan, winner of Norway\u2019s Got Talent 2014, performs Dinah Washington\u2019s 'What a Difference a Day Made' on the opening show of TV 2 singalong summer hit \u2018Allsang p\u00e5 grensen\u2019 on Thursday June 3rd 2014.\u201d\n\nHere is the same video on the official website of Jordan, who won the 2014 edition of Norway's Got Talent.\n\nThis clip from the documentary \u201cAmy\u201d, which is about Winehouse\u2019s life, shows an early example of her singing in at age 14 in 1998.\n\nThe Facebook user who uploaded the video along with a wrong caption also realised her mistake and posted an apology on August 20, 2015, stating the video does not show Winehouse.\n\nDespite this effort, fact-checking site Snopes said the video was still circulating online along with the false claim in 2016.\n\nThe misleading Facebook posts now include comments pointing to the fact that the video in fact shows Jordan, not Winehouse, but people continue to share the video with the incorrect caption in 2019.", "lang": "en"}
