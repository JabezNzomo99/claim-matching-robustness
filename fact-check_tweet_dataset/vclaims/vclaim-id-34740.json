This is false; the US embassy in Abuja has called on Nigerians to disregard the claim, which it described as \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\nThe posts have been shared thousands of times on Facebook. One article, published on the site Double A Media, was shared at least 1,700 times according to data from the social media analysis tool CrowdTangle, including by a popular Nigerian pastor. We've archived that post here.\n\nThe same message has travelled among numerous WhatsApp groups in Nigeria, especially groups focused on scholarships and international education. The number of shares on WhatsApp cannot be traced due to the end-to-end encryption available on the instant messaging app.\n\nThe claim was also posted on some of Nigeria's most popular blogs and message boards -- we've archived some of the posts here, here, and here. The story was also posted on Nairaland, the country's most-visited homegrown social network, but it was taken down after the claim was found to be false. Information Nigeria, an online newspaper, also deleted its initial post reporting the claim.\n\nThe earliest version of the story, which was published on the website The 247ureports and which we've archived here, claims that US authorities had \"effectively halted issuing student visas to students coming from Nigeria until further notice\".\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been shaking up US immigration policies since he came into office in 2017 -- including, in Nigeria, an indefinite suspension of interview waivers for renewals, otherwise known as the \u201cDropbox\u201d process. This change came into force on May 14, 2019.\n\nThe US administration has, however, not placed a ban on student visas as claimed by the misleading posts. Sterling Tilley, acting information officer of the US embassy in Abuja, told AFP via email that \u201cthe reports in question are inaccurate\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe requirements to qualify for a student visa have not changed for Nigerians or for applicants of any other nationality,\u201d he said.\n\nThe US Embassy in Abuja also tweeted on June 17, 2019 to say the posts were \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cmanufactured\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
