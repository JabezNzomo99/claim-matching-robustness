Ted Cruz (R-Tex.): \u201cLook, I understand Marco wants to raise confusion, it is not accurate what he just said that I supported legalization. Indeed, I led the fight against his legalization and amnesty. \u2026 I have never supported legalization, and I do not intend to support legalization. Let me tell you how you do this, what you do is you enforce the law.\u201d\n\u2022 None \u201cI don\u2019t want immigration reform to fail; I want immigration reform to pass. And so I would urge people of good faith on both sides of the aisle, if the objective is to pass common-sense immigration reform that secures the borders, that improves legal immigration and that allows those here illegally to come out of the shadows, then we should look for areas of bipartisan agreement and compromise to come together.\u201d (May 2013 Senate Judiciary hearing)\n\u2022 None \u201cThe amendment I introduced affected only citizenship; it did not affect the underlying legalization in the Gang of Eight bill.\u201d (May 2013 event at Princeton University)\n\u2022 None \u201cGiven that bipartisan agreement outside of Washington, my objective was not to kill immigration reform but to amend the Gang of Eight bill so that it actually solves the problem rather than making the problem worse.\u201d (May 2013 interview with the Washington Examiner)\n\u2022 None \u201cIf the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground, that would fix the problem and also allow for those 11 million people who are here illegally a legal status with citizenship off the table. I believe that is the compromise that can pass.\u201d (June 2013 Senate floor speech)\n\u2022 None \u201cThe 11 million who are here illegally would be granted legal status once the border was secured \u2014 not before \u2014 but after the border was secured, they would be granted legal status,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd indeed, they would be eligible for permanent legal residency. But they would not be eligible for citizenship.\u201d (June 2013 interview with NPR)\n\u2022 None The New York Times and Texas Tribune interviewed Cruz about the amendments in September 2013 and reported he was looking for a compromise between Democrats and Republican hard-liners.\n\nIn reference to the citizenship amendment, then-Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) said during the 2013 hearing: \u201cMy concern with this, I feel it would virtually gut the bill \u2026 and gut what has been a very careful balance by Republicans and Democrats and the sponsors of it.\u201d Sen. Charles E. Schumer, a Gang of Eight Democrat, echoed the concern at the hearing: \u201cIf we do not have a path to citizenship, there is no reform, many of us feel. That is a bottom line here.\u201d The Gang of Eight Republicans on the Judiciary Committee sided with Democrats in rejecting this amendment.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember the political climate at the time. The bipartisan Gang of Eight and its coalition seemed poised to get the landmark reform bill passed through Congress, and the hard-liner rejectionist was out of favor, said Frank Sharry, executive director of the immigration-reform group America\u2019s Voice. Sharry said he believed Cruz was \u201ccreating mischief and attempting to undermine the bill by peeling off Republican votes for the Gang of Eight bill,\u201d but positioning himself to the right of Rubio while supporting immigration reform.\n\nCruz\u2019s public statements in 2013 and in 2015 are inconsistent. But we have no way of knowing whether he really was using a tactic then, or if he is using a tactic now \u2014 or both. If we had a mind-reader, either the 2013 or 2015 version of his explanation would be Pinocchio-worthy. But we can\u2019t read minds, and it\u2019s not The Fact Checker\u2019s job to rate claims using speculation, so we will not issue a rating. But readers can certainly draw their own conclusions.", "lang": "en"}
