This is false; large studies in British Columbia and the US found no evidence that the influenza vaccine increases the risk of contracting a coronavirus, and health officials throughout North America recommend the flu vaccine for children during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cBombshell as flu shots found to cause huge increases in coronavirus infections,\u201d says the headline of an article shared as a screenshot on July 31, 2020 on Facebook.\n\n\u201cChildren who are vaccinated with flu shots have a 440 percent increase in risk of contradicting other respiratory infections such as coronavirus, researchers found in a published paper,\u201d claims the post, which also circulated on Instagram.\n\nSeveral posts claim the evidence came from \u201cThe British Medical Journal,\u201d sharing this link. However, that is not a scientific study, but rather a response to an article about the COVID-19 pandemic from a retired pediatrician.\n\nBMJ executive editor Theodora Bloom explained in an email that \u201cRapid responses\u201d are comments to the editors that appear on the journal\u2019s website but \u201care not indexed in PubMed and they are not journal articles.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough we moderate Rapid Responses to ensure they are not libellous, for example, they are certainly not endorsed by the publication,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother version of the post reveals that the source of the claim is an article on the website NaturalNews, one of a network of internet domains found to host health disinformation which AFP has fact-checked in the past.\n\nNaturalNews was removed from Facebook in May 2020 \u201cfor spammy and abusive behavior, not the content they posted,\u201d according to a Facebook spokeswoman. \u201cThey misled people about the popularity of their posts and relied on content farms in Macedonia and the Philippines.\u201d\n\nBrian Ward, professor in the McGill University Department of Medicine, said in an email that the claim has been \u201ccherry-picked from a very weak study.\u201d\n\nIt is based on a 2012 study titled: \u201cIncreased Risk of Noninfluenza Respiratory Virus Infections Associated With Receipt of Inactivated Influenza Vaccine.\u201d\n\nThe study was conducted from 2008-2009, a decade before the novel coronavirus pandemic, and only included 115 children during one flu season.\n\nIt found that over nine months, the children in the group that received trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine \u201chad an increased risk of virologically-confirmed non-influenza infections.\u201d\n\nWard explained that the study, though published in Clinical Infectious Diseases, has methodological flaws, including having 1.5 times more children in the flu vaccine group, compared to the placebo group.\n\nSarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the University of Oxford\u2019s Nuffield Department of Medicine, also said in an email that it is important not to overstate the findings of a small study.\n\nGilbert further explained: \u201cIt isn\u2019t that the flu shot directly made children more susceptible to other viruses.\u201d\n\nShe said the children in the placebo group who were not vaccinated were more likely to get the flu and there seemed to be short-term protection from other viruses right after recovering from the flu.\n\nBased on this study, \u201cno-one should make decisions to avoid flu vaccinations,\u201d Gilbert said.\n\nDanuta Skowronski, the principal investigator at the British Columbia Center for Disease Control (BCCDC), published a study in May 2020 that included thousands of people over multiple flu seasons in Canada. It found the \u201cinfluenza vaccine did not affect seasonal coronavirus risk.\u201d\n\nSkowronski, who plays a critical role in Canada\u2019s national influenza program, helped develop test negative design, a methodology used worldwide to monitor how well the influenza vaccine protects.\n\nAsked if there was any particular coronavirus risk to children who receive the flu shot, Skowronski said: \u201cWe saw no association in children nor in adults between the receipt of influenza vaccine and coronavirus risk.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a 2013 study conducted in the US state of Wisconsin covering six flu seasons and including more than 3,000 patients found: \u201cInfluenza vaccination was not associated with detection of noninfluenza respiratory viruses.\u201d\n\nClaims that a 2017 study also found the flu shot left people vulnerable to infections were also shown to be misleading by AFP Fact Check here.\n\nThe US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has not yet voted on the flu vaccine recommendations for 2020-2021, but Lisa Black, a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), said in an email that AAP has not changed its guidance because of the pandemic and \u201crecommends that everyone over 6 months is vaccinated for influenza.\u201d\n\nThe same is true of the Canadian Paediatric Society. Spokeswoman Genevieve Brouillette said in an email: \u201cOur general guidance (that everyone over 6 months of age be immunized against the seasonal flu) won\u2019t be changing.\u201d\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that how and where people get a flu vaccine may need to change due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis was echoed by Oxford\u2019s Gilbert: \u201cPeople leaving their homes to receive flu shots should take care to protect themselves against exposure to coronavirus by following all the public health guidelines on social distancing, handwashing and wearing face coverings.\u201d\n\nThe flu shot is a regular target of disinformation. AFP Fact Check has debunked the false claim that the vaccine contains coronaviruses, the false claim that receiving a flu shot will make you test positive for COVID-19, and false ingredient lists for the annual immunization.", "lang": "en"}
