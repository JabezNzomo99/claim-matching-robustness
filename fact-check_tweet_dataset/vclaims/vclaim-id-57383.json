Right next to Lee\u2019s photo, a quote attributed to him read: \u201cRodrigo Duterte was my inspiration for building Singapore from scratch.\u201d\n\nPalalay captioned her post, \u201cHindi natin kalahi pero proud siya. Ikaw? ARE YOU PROUD OF OUR PRECEDENT (sic) DuTER30?\u201d (Not a Filipino but he\u2019s proud. How about you? Are you proud of our President Duterte?)\n\nPalalay posted the graphic on December 16, 2019, but it was flagged by Claim Check on Friday, August 14, for fact checkers to verify. Claim Check is Facebook\u2019s monitoring tool that identifies potentially dubious content shared across the platform. The graphic was reported at least 12 times for containing false information.\n\nLee served as Singapore\u2019s prime minister from 1959 until 1990. Duterte was only 14 years old when Lee took office. There are also no legitimate sources that confirm Lee said the quote attributed to him in the graphic.\n\nDuring the latter part of Lee\u2019s term, Duterte had not yet been elected president but was serving as Davao City\u2019s vice mayor from 1986 to 1987, and then as mayor from 1988 to 1998. Lee died in March 2015, a year and 3 months before Duterte became president of the Philippines.\n\nIn the past, Duterte\u2019s supporters had called him the \u201cLee Kuan Yew of the Philippines.\u201d The Duterte administration also compared the Philippine president to Lee in terms of leadership style.

In October 2019, a blog falsely quoted Lee as saying that \"the Philippines' version of democracy as of late is best called a government by stupid people, of stupid people.\"\n\nAnother false quote surfaced in December 2019, which claimed that Lee said that \u201cthe Philippine media are 'just a master of intrigues'.\u201d \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
