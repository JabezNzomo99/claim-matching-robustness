However, the uniformed men are not Indian Army soldiers; they are Israeli soldiers. The photograph was taken five years ago in Gaza and published by international news agency Reuters.\n\nThe image was posted here on February 11, 2019 by a Facebook page called 'India Lover' and has since received more than a thousand reactions.\n\nThe misleading post's caption in Hindi reads: \"Long live India, victory to India\".\n\nThe image also contains text written in brown on a white background in Hindi, which says: \"I am proud of our soldiers, do you also feel proud?\"\n\nA reverse image search found that the original photograph showing Israeli soldiers at rest was taken by Nir Elias near the Gaza Strip on the Israeli-Palestinian border.\n\nIt was published by Reuters on July 15, 2014, according to information on the news agency\u2019s image website here.\n\nThe photo caption on the Reuters site reads: \u201cIsraeli soldiers sleep on the ground next to an armoured personnel carrier (APC) outside the central Gaza strip July 15, 2014.\n\n\"Israel approved an Egyptian-proposed deal that would halt the week-old Gaza shelling war on Tuesday but the Palestinian territory\u2019s dominant Hamas Islamists responded suspiciously, saying they had not been consulted by Cairo.\u201d\n\nThe image was used in media reports at the time, for example here in Newsweek on July 16, 2014, with the headline: \"Israel sends out evacuation warnings ahead of potential incursion after truce collapses\".\n\nAnother image by the same photographer, published by Reuters here on July 14, 2014, shows soldiers wearing the same uniform and skullcaps with Hebrew writing on them.\n\nThe caption of that Reuters image says: \"Israeli soldiers dance with members of the Breslov Hasidic sect at a military staging area outside central Gaza\"", "lang": "en"}
