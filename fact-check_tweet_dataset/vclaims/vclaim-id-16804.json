It said that \u201cevery extra day missed was associated with a lower attainment outcome\u201d.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean more absence causes worse performance. This research can\u2019t prove that. We don\u2019t know whether other factors, not measured by the research, are affecting pupils\u2019 performance.\n\nEven though there\u2019s a link between overall absence and worse performance, there are exceptions, particularly if you just take a single missed day. When you drill down to look at the type of absence, authorised holidays at Key Stage 2 haven\u2019t shown the same link.\n\nA link is not the same thing as a cause\n\nThe research is careful in only talking about an \u201cassociation\u201d between extra days of absence and lower attainment. But the minister\u2019s claim arguably implies there is a proven causal link.\n\nThe Department says it \u201chas not claimed a causal link, and we have previously explained that in the statement the spokesperson said that absence \u2018can\u2019 (rather than \u2018will\u2019) affect GCSE performance\u201d.\n\nHowever you interpret what the minister has said, this research can\u2019t prove absence causes lower attainment.\n\nPupils\u2019 characteristics need to be factored in\n\nWhen we previously factchecked claims made about the link between absence and attainment, it wasn\u2019t clear if lower grades were down to days missed from school or the characteristics of pupils who tended to be absent.\n\nAbsences are higher among pupils eligible to claim for free school meals, for example. This is the measure generally used to indicate if a pupil is from a low-income family. The overall absence rate of pupils eligible for free school meals was 7%, compared to 4% of their peers.\n\nAbsence rates also vary by ethnicity. Children who are Travellers of Irish Heritage or Gypsy/Roma had the highest absence rates and Chinese and Black African children had the lowest absence rates.\n\nUnlike earlier research, the 2013/14 analysis does take some of this into account.\n\nIt looks at whether the pupil is male or female, whether they are classified as having Special Educational Needs, what ethnic group they are in, whether they\u2019re eligible for free school meals, and how well they were doing at school before the absence.\n\nIt finds that taking these characteristics into account, there is still a link between missing days from school and the likelihood that children do less well.\n\nThere may be important characteristics we don\u2019t know about\n\nEven then\u2014and you\u2019ll be getting used to this phrase by now\u2014it\u2019s still not possible to say that this proves that absence causes lower performance.\n\nAs Professor Stephen Gorard from Durham University has said, \u201cabsent pupils may be different to their peers in many ways not covered by the data available\u201d.\n\nWhen holidays are the reason for absence, the evidence isn\u2019t consistent\n\nLooking at holidays, most pupils still do worse the more days they take off. But not all age groups follow this trend.\n\nAt Key Stage Four\u201415 and 16 year olds\u2014the greater the number of days of absence, the lower the pupils\u2019 performance. That was true regardless of whether the absence was authorised or unauthorised.\n\nAt Key Stage Two\u201410 and 11 year olds\u2014the trend was the same for unauthorised holidays. But for authorised holidays, there is a small link in the opposite direction. That is, pupils who had taken more days off tended to do better than their peers.\n\nEither way, holidays alone don\u2019t show large links between absence and performance.\n\nIn 2013/14 the proportion of unauthorised holidays taken by students at Key Stage Two and Four was greater than authorised holidays.", "lang": "en"}
