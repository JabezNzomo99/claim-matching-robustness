In a Sept. 1 video, for example, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s been proven by the CDC \u2014 [the pandemic] is nothing, it was absolutely nothing. Zero. 9,000 people? That\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\nNumerous readers asked Snopes to investigate the matter. Several inquiries included a link to the hyperpartisan, junk news website The Gateway Pundit, or a link to another conspiratorial web page that phrased the alleged revelation like this:\n\n\u201cThe CDC quietly released new covid numbers showing those who solely died from the virus was only 6% (9,210) of the total deaths (153,504). 94% of those who died, did so because they had existing health conditions.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, The Gateway Pundit page claimed, \u201cthe overwhelming majority\u201d of reported COVID-19 deaths were among \u201cvery old Americans\u201d \u2014 without going into specifics on what age population that meant \u2014 and suggested nefarious intentions on the part of the CDC to try to change its guidance without anyone noticing.\n\nVersions of this notion circulated widely online in summer 2020, in part because of support from American politicians such as Trump. In two retweets \u2014 one by his campaign adviser that linked to the Gateway Pundit page and another by a supporter of the unfounded QAnon conspiracy theory (screenshot below) \u2014 Trump endorsed the claim, essentially denigrating scientific evidence by his own health advisers, Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx. However, as of this writing, Twitter had removed the below-displayed post for violating its terms of service.\n\nFirst, to unpack the claim, let\u2019s be clear about how COVID-19 \u2014 which is the disease caused by the coronavirus dubbed SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 attacks the body and can become deadly. According to an article in the journal Science, a highly credible scientific publication:\n\nIn other words, SARS-CoV-2 attacks lung cells, and that assault on a person\u2019s respiratory system can greatly exacerbate other preexisting conditions. That means COVID-19 patients run the risk of previously manageable health problems turning fatal \u2014 including cardiac arrest, liver failure, or lung scarring \u2014 after they\u2019re infected with SARS-CoV-2. Put another way, Ryan McNamara, a virologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in a series of tweets compared the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS. He wrote:\n\nNext, we investigated how the CDC compiles COVID-19 death toll data. Since the viral posts did not specify what \u201cnumbers\u201d by the CDC to which they were alleging nefariousness, we considered the CDC\u2019s Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) web page, which is a compilation of death certificates updated weekly by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).\n\nAdditionally, we obtained an April 2020 document by the World Health Organization titled, \u201cInternational Guidelines For Certification and Classification (Coding) of COVID-19 As Cause of Death,\u201d which stated that medical examiners must include as much detail as possible based on records and lab testing when they\u2019re filling out death certificates. For example, a death certification for a patient who was infected with SARS-CoV-2 and afterwards developed pneumonia and fatal respiratory distress would list all three conditions as causes of death (see example below).\n\nThe document also said death certificates for people who suffered from chronic conditions, such as coronary artery disease or diabetes, before their exposure to the coronavirus would list those conditions in addition to COVID-19. The coronavirus would still be labeled the underlying cause of death \u2014 or the disease that \u201cinitiated the train of events leading directly to death,\u201d per the WHO\u2019s definition \u2014 since the preexisting health issues were likely exacerbated by the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nNext, we considered the CDC\u2019s process for analyzing those death certificates that list COVID-19. Its website explained:\n\nIn short, the CDC compiles mortality statistics that are based on all possible causes of death for one individual. So if a diabetes patient with high blood pressure was infected with COVID-19 \u2014 which can target blood vessels \u2014 and they die because their blood vessels were already so damaged, the CDC would consider their death related to both the coronavirus and diabetes. (According to the CDC database of death certificate data, that was the case for more than 27,500 people.)\n\nAs of this writing, the CDC last updated its mortality statistics on Sept. 3, 2020. At that point, the agency said 171,787 death certificates included COVID-19 since the beginning of the U.S. outbreak in February 2020. And alongside the coronavirus, the majority of documents also listed comorbidities, or additional health issues that can either worsen or develop after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. For instance, 71,700 included influenza or pneumonia and COVID-19 as potential causes of death.\n\nHowever, fueling the conspiracy theory, the CDC web page stated:\n\n\u201cFor 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause [of death] mentioned. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death.\u201d\n\nThat meant, yes, medical investigators believed only 6% of COVID-19 patients died from the coronavirus alone. Those patients had no reported comorbidities. However, it was dangerously wrong to misinterpret that fact to mean that the remaining fatalities (or 94 percent) died from health issues other than the coronavirus. Rather, most people\u2019s underlying cause of death was COVID-19 and the virus either intensified or caused other illnesses that contributed to patients\u2019 death.\n\nNote: The \u201c6%\u201d claim was not the first attempt by COVID-19 conspiracy theorists to allege without any substantial evidence that the CDC was nefariously compiling data to trick people into thinking the coronavirus was more serious than it actually is. In spring 2020, for instance, they attempted to ring the alarm on the agency supposedly inflating COVID-19 death numbers for political reasons, but in reality the alleged discrepancy was a result of comparing two separate data sources that report different measurements. (See our analysis into that claim here.)\n\nThe death certification statistics, in short, prove that people with preexisting health problems \u2014 such as asthma or hypertension \u2014 face higher risk for serious illness, or dying, if they\u2019re infected with COVID-19, according to Bob Anderson, lead mortality statistician at NCHS. He said in a statement to NBC News: \u201cThese data are consistent with CDC guidance that those with underlying medical conditions are at greater risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Fauci explained the phenomena in a Sept. 1 interview on the ABC program \u201cGood Morning America:\n\nNext, we found data to address another aspect of the fringe theory: that the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of reported COVID-19 deaths were among people of a \u201cvery advanced age.\u201d For the purpose of this report, we considered that group to be people aged 85 or older. And according to the CDC death certificate data, 53,000 documents for that population listed COVID-19 as a potential cause of death, accounting for about one-third of the total, or less than the majority.\n\nWe should note here: Epidemiologists and health officials have been up front with the fact that COVID-19 patients who are older \u2014 as well as those who have underlying health problems \u2014 are at greater risk for serious problems.\n\n\u201cAs you get older, your risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19 increases. Everyone, especially older adults and others at increased risk of severe illness, should take steps to protect themselves from getting COVID-19,\u201d according to the CDC. Eight out of 10 people who have died as a result of COVID-19 in the U.S. were over the age of 65, per the agency\u2019s data.\n\nLastly, we looked for any evidence to confirm or deny that the CDC attempted to \u201cquietly\u201d adjust its mortality statistics under the public\u2019s radar. Bob Anderson, lead mortality statistician at NCHS, told NBC News in a statement the death certificate data does \u201cnot represent new information as NCHS has been publishing this same information since the outset when we began posting data on COVID-19 deaths on our web site.\u201d\n\nIn sum, considering the way in which the coronavirus impacts the human body, the way the CDC compiles data from death certificates \u2014 listing comorbidities that were either developed or exacerbated by COVID-19 \u2014 as well as the fact that one-third of COVID-19 fatalities were people aged 85 or older, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
