The group focused on promoting mining operations, light industries, agribusiness and other areas, but by most accounts, the $800 million effort did not get very far before it was essentially disbanded a few years later. SIGAR has been investigating allegations of profligate spending and mismanagement by TFBSO.\n\nThe comparison to Pakistan is actually apples and oranges. Pakistan is the number one country in the world for using CNG, with at least 70 percent of its vehicles running on it. There are already more than 3,000 stations, meaning the incremental costs of adding a station are relatively small, experts said. By contrast, the TFBSO project was the first such station in Afghanistan.\n\nThe SIGAR report mentions there was a contract \u201cawarded to Central Asian Engineering to construct the station was for just under $3 million.\u201d But then it relies on a single line on a page in a consultant\u2019s 2014 report, which assessed the impact of the TFBSO projects on the gross domestic product of Afghanistan: \u201cThe Task Force spent $42,718,739 between 2011 and 2014 to fund the construction and to supervise the initial operation of the CNG station (approximately $12.3 [million] in direct costs and $30.0 [million] in overhead costs),\u201d said Vestige Consulting. Here\u2019s a copy of the page in question:\n\nSchraven\u2019s letter noted that the numbers included in the economic impact analysis were based on \u201cTFBSO guidance.\u201d In other words, that\u2019s what the Pentagon suggested when Vestige was doing its report. But as we noted, the original Vestige report was not designed to do financial accounting of TFBSO, but to evaluate if the projects had an real impact. (Vestige calculated the projects would add nearly $55 billion to Afghanistan\u2019s gross domestic product by 2025.)\n\nBut he said the Pentagon has been stonewalling for months on the issue, all but ignoring a May letter that asked about the $43 million figure and offering no substantive comment before publication of the October report. (The Pentagon asserted that since the task force has been abandoned, there was no one available who could explain the math.) \u201cWe don\u2019t withhold reports just because DOD doesn\u2019t answer questions,\u201d he said.\n\nWhether the investment was worth it is unclear. A just-published report by Rand on TFBSO, citing documents not available to the public, said the \u201cSheberghan pilot facility opened in May 2012 and, as of September 2013, had converted 120 cars to CNG and taken in a total revenue of 7,375,313 afghanis, or approximately $132,000.\u201d In a statement to the Senate, Pentagon official Brian McKeon said that as of Nov. 15, \u201cthe operator indicated that the station was working normally, that 230 cars had been converted, and that every day approximately 160 cars obtain fuel from the station.\u201d That indicates the revenue so far totals at least $250,000.\n\nHere again, we have an example of \u201coverhead\u201d apparently randomly assigned to a project, without much rhyme or reason. While SIGAR did point out, on Page 5 of the report, that a substantial part of this figure was overhead, its report overall treated the $43 million figure as an established fact, mentioning it seven times, including in the title. The report then further emphasized that figure by making the unwarranted comparison that this was 140 times more than an equivalent station in Pakistan.", "lang": "en"}
