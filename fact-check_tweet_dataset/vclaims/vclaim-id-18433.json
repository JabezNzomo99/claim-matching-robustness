The disturbing aspect of the whole thing is that when you challenge them to show proof they run away.\u201d\n\nA check on Debt Management Office\u2019s (DMO) website, the official institution coordinating the management of Nigeria\u2019s debt, revealed that as at December 2018, Imo State domestic debt was N97.85bn while its external debt was $59.51m (N18.266bn).\n\n[The naira value of Imo state external debt was arrived at after multiplying the foreign debt by N307, the official exchange rate of a dollar to naira as at December 31, 2018].\n\nIf the domestic debt of N97.85bn is added to the naira value of the external debt, N18.266bn, then, Imo State\u2019s debt as at the time Okorocha left office would be N106.11bn.\n\nThis means the claim by Ihedioha that the state debt is over N100bn is true.\n\nWe contacted the Special Adviser to Okorocha to provide the state\u2019s debt profile when his principal left office, especially since he disagreed with Ihediora\u2019s claim, and statistics on DMO\u2019s website showed that the state\u2019s debt profile as at the time Okorocha left office was over N100bn.\n\nAccording to him, their interpretation of Ihedioha\u2019s statement was that Okorocha incurred over N100bn debt while in office. So we checked that too!\n\nA further check on DMO\u2019s website revealed that as at December 2011, Imo state had an external debt of $50,277m and N25.41bn domestic debt. This implied that the external debt grew by $9.23 (N2.833m) while domestic debt grew by N72.43bn during Okorocha\u2019s tenure. This means the state\u2019s debt grew with about N75.26bn under him from DMO\u2019s record.\n\nData from DMO shows that Imo State had a total debt of N106.11bn as at December 31, 2018 which has not been repaid at present, and that the State\u2019s debt grew with about N75.26bn under Okorocha\u2019s leadership.\n\nGbenga Samuel Salau is a graduate of Communication and Language Arts, University of Ibadan.
