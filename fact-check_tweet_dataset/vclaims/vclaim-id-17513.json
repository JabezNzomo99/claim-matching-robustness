As in our previous fact check, Polygraph.info points to practices many advocates find troubling.\n\nAs Catherine Gallagher, an associate professor at George Mason University\u2019s Criminology, Law and Society unit, told Polygraph.info at the time, claiming Butina was unduly pressured to plea is \u201cvery hard to argue in the U.S. because it\u2019s the norm.\u201d\n\nButina herself, in a recent interview with Russian reporters, denied she faced torture, despite previous claims by Russian officials to the contrary.\n\n\"There was no torture, but I really was held in isolation for a long time,\u201d TASS on April 30 quoted her as telling journalists in a telephone interview. \u201cThe first 35 days in a Washington prison, then (after a two-month break) 35 days in isolation in the Alexandria jail, then 38 more days. For 22 hours, I was locked alone in my cell. For two hours at night, from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m., I was given time for a shower, to use my phone \u2013 absolutely anything.\"\n\n\u201cButina said that food was delivered directly to her cell,\u201d TASS reported. \u2018This is rather unpleasant and tough psychologically.' she stated.\u201d\n\nIn another report on that interview, state-owned television channel Rossiya-1 described Butina as having \u201cno complaints at the moment\u201d regarding her incarceration, saying her life is characterized by \u201cwork, gymnastics and books.\u201d\n\nButina spoke of the wealth of Russian literature available in the prison library, adding she is using this time to invest in her own development.\n\nDuring her sentencing, when asked by the judge, \u201cAre you pleading guilty not for any other reason but because you are guilty?\u201d Butina answered, \u201cYes, guilty.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department did not reply to our request for comment by the time of publication.\n\nRegardless, Polygraph.info finds no evidence that Butina faced \u201cunprecedented pressure\u201d during her incarceration. In addition, while it is arguable that systemic issues led Butina to accept a plea deal to avoid a stiffer prison sentence, that reality is faced by all defendants navigating the U.S. criminal justice system.\n\nPolygraph.info therefore finds the claims of the Russian lawmakers to be misleading.", "lang": "en"}
