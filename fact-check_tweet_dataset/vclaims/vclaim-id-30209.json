That has increasingly raised questions about the extent to which evangelical beliefs are influencing American diplomacy.\u201d\n\nThat questioning of Pompeo\u2019s mixture of religiosity and policy was reflected in a meme circulated in January 2020, amidst escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran over the U.S. airstrike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad:\n\nThe quote reproduced in this meme \u2014 about continuing to fight battles and struggle until the moment of the Rapture \u2014 was taken from a talk Pompeo delivered at a \u201cGod and Country Rally\u201d held at Summit Church in Wichita, Kansas, on June 28, 2015. The event was just a few days after the U.S. Supreme Court handed down the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges decision holding that same-sex couples have a constitutionally protected right to marry.\n\nThe words reproduced above were excerpted from a portion of Pompeo\u2019s speech, as captured here:\n\nHowever, that short clip doesn\u2019t provide the full context of Pompeo\u2019s remark, which was not specifically about military or political battles. We reproduce the surrounding context below, as taken from a video of the complete speech (beginning around the 23:19 mark):\n\nOn Friday, just hours after the Supreme Court\u2019s [Obergefell v. Hodges] decision, my wife entered a retail establishment here in Kansas. She went to the counter to pay for the products that she had purchased, and the man behind the counter saw the credit card that she was using and said \u201cAre you related?\u201d And before he could finish she said, \u201cYes, yes, yes, I\u2019m his wife,\u201d and he teared up and he said, \u201cThank your husband for what he\u2019s doing; thank you for allowing him to go do that. Have strength, Susan, and remember always that no matter what happens in Washington, D.C. or in Topeka, it is the Lord that is in control.\u201d This was a stranger to Susan. This was a man who[m] she had not met before, but he took time from his role to pray for her and to thank her and to make clear that his Christian understanding of our nation was not just in her heart but his, and that he would work every day to make sure that the Lord\u2019s work govern our actions each and every day. It was a remarkable moment. We are blessed to live in Kansas where there are so many people that understand that. We will continue to fight these battles. It is a never-ending struggle. Until that moment Pastor Fox spoke about, until the Rapture be part of it, be in the fight. Ask for forgiveness seek His wisdom, and heed your pastor\u2019s call to actions, and great things will be bestowed upon our nation and our world.", "lang": "en"}
