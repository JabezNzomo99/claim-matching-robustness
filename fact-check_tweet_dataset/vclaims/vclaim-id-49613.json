It also very similar to the Pakistani national flag, with the addition of a white band to its left.\n\nThe photo has been shared with the following caption:\n\nThe post has been shared more than 1300 times and has garnered around 8500 reactions on Facebook.\n\nUsing a reverse image search, we found a similar photo used in a tweet by Doordarshan News on December 18, 2018. However, the white crescent moon and the star was nowhere to be found in this photo.\n\nAccording to Doordarshan News, the image depicts Modi flagging off the first passenger train to pass through the Bogibeel Bridge, which is India's longest railroad bridge crossing over the Brahmaputra river in Assam.\n\nBOOM placed the photo used in the Facebook post and placed it next to the photo from the tweet, which revealed the doctoring of the former very clearly.\n\nBOOM searched for the Facebook page 'Bhashan Ya Rashan' in the newly launched Ad Library for India by Facebook and found that the post has been sponsored for Rs 500 - Rs 999 (approximate figure).\n\u2022 None Screenshot of the ad performance of the post\n\nHowever, Facebook eventually took down the ad as the advertiser did not provide his or her identity under the 'Paid for by' label.\n\nThis is in tune with the renewed advertisement policies by Facebook in their efforts to provide more transparency on political ads, which require advertisers to disclose their identity and location.", "lang": "en"}
