That, to me, is the most racist concept you can come up with,\u201d Biden said in the interview, which was entered into the congressional record. \u201cWhat it says is, \u2018In order for your child with curly black hair, brown eyes, and dark skin to be able to learn anything, he needs to sit next to my blond-haired, blue-eyed son.\u2019 That\u2019s racist!\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Harris was a young girl in California in the 1970s, a minority student who was bused to school in an affluent and predominantly white area. In the Democratic debate, she challenged Biden to say he was wrong to oppose busing. The Supreme Court in 1954 ruled to desegregate public schools in Brown v. Board of Education, but segregated schools were still a fact of life in the 1970s, Harris said. The government had to step in, and sometimes that meant forced busing, she said.\n\nBiden defended himself from Harris's attack by saying he supported some kinds of busing and opposed other kinds. But his statements in the 1970s, and decades later, were not so carefully hedged. His criticism of forced busing was broad and unqualified.\n\nIn his 2007 autobiography, \u201cPromises to Keep,\u201d Biden called busing \u201ca liberal train wreck.\u201d As we noted, Biden called the idea of busing \"asinine\" and \"racist\" in a 1975 interview with a Newark, Del., publication known as the People Paper. He also described it as a quota system that would \"insure mediocrity.\"\n\nIt didn't start out this way. In 1974, Biden cast votes in favor of court-ordered busing to promote desegregation. But that was a controversial position in Delaware at the time, and Biden soon took an opposite view.\n\n\"He emerged as the Democratic Party\u2019s leading anti-busing crusader \u2014 a position that put him in league with Southern segregationists, at odds with liberal Republicans and helped change the dynamic of the Senate, turning even some leaders in his own party against busing as a desegregation tool,\" the New York Times reported July 15. This meant introducing or supporting bills to limit what courts and prosecutors could do to mandate busing.\n\nDespite his views on busing, Biden generally has worked alongside civil rights leaders and been embraced by them. He supported the extension of the Voting Rights Act, amendments to the Fair Housing Act, sanctions against apartheid South Africa and the creation of a holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nAs a young man, Biden fought to desegregate a movie theater in Delaware, and worked as the only white employee at a largely black swimming pool. The former vice president also has defended himself from Harris's attacks by pointing to the civil rights agenda of President Barack Obama's administration.\n\nIn 1975, he said of forced busing: \u201cWhat it says is, \u2018In order for your child with curly black hair, brown eyes, and dark skin to be able to learn anything, he needs to sit next to my blond-haired, blue-eyed son.\u2019 That\u2019s racist!\u201d", "lang": "en"}
