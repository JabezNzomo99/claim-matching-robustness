We hereby endorse Donald J. Trump, and urge all Americans, especially the millions of lawful immigrants living within our country, to support Donald J. Trump, and to protect American jobs, wages and lives.\"\n\nThe National Border Patrol Council, which represents 16,500 agents, has also backed Trump. But that was based on a vote of just 11 leaders of the group, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nTrump said, \"ICE just endorsed me.\"\n\nHe made it sound like a federal agency had taken the remarkable step of formally supporting him. But ICE, which enforces federal immigration laws and employs more than 20,000 people, cannot do that.\n\nHe has the support of employee groups, but that\u2019s vastly different than what he said at the debate.\n\nWe rate his claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
