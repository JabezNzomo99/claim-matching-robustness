It said: \u201c\u2018Practice in the past does not make it legal.\u2019 Ang tagal na palang expire eh tuloy tuloy padin and pag operate ([ABS-CBN\u2019s franchise] expired a long time ago but they kept on operating).\u201d\n\nThe facts: In the video clip posted by News Scoop, Senator Lacson was not referring to ABS-CBN\u2019s existing franchise but was talking about the validity of a provisional permit from the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) \u2013 should Congress fail to approve ABS-CBN\u2019s franchise on time. It was taken during the Kapihan sa Senado media forum in February.\n\n\u201cPractice cannot make a law. Kung ang letter ng law ganito, maski pina-practice 'yan before, it cannot justify legally na gawin mo,\u201d Lacson said. (If this is the letter of the law and you say this is how it has been practiced before, that still cannot justify the act.)\n\nThis came after Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra told the Senate in February that Congress may authorize the NTC to give ABS-CBN a provisional permit to continue operating after its franchise expires. He said similar cases were done in the past and that the \"informal\" practice persisted because there were no complaints filed.\n\nGovernment officials also said during the Senate hearing on ABS-CBN's franchise renewal in February that the network has not committed any breach of laws or franchise terms.
