However, that figure was not accurate when it was posted, nor is it accurate now.\n\nMore than 9,200 health care workers had tested positive by April 9, almost a month before the claim was made, according to an April 17 report from the CDC. That figure \u201cmust be considered a lower bound because additional cases likely have gone unidentified or unreported,\u201d according to the report.\n\nMore recent data from the CDC indicates that there have been at least 67,100 cases of COVID-19 among health care personnel. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show California Department Of Social Services Letter About Coronavirus Testing)\n\nDespite the number of health care worker cases being incorrect, the Facebook post uses the figure to compare to those among workers at meat processing facilities, with the caption reading, \u201cDon\u2019t you find it quite interesting, that 5,000 meat packers tested positive! However, not 5,000 nurses & doctors!\u201d\n\nThat 5,000-figure for workers at meat processing facilities likely comes from a report the CDC put out in early May. It found over 4,900 cases of COVID-19 among U.S. workers in 115 meat and poultry processing facilities in 19 states.\n\nThe new coronavirus has sickened over 1.8 million people and killed some 106,000 others in the U.S. to date, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.", "lang": "en"}
