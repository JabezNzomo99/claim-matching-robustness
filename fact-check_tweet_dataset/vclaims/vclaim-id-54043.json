The answer options were \u201c0 hours\u201d, \u201cup to 5 hours\u201d, \u201c6 \u2013 10 hours\u201d and \u201c11 or more hours.\u201d\n\nOnly 3% of respondents said they did 11 or more hours of unpaid work per week, but this is what the Mirror reported as the average overtime.\n\nWe can\u2019t say exactly what the average overtime is for a few reasons.\n\nFirstly, we don\u2019t know if the results are representative of NHS workers overall. The survey was sent to around 1.2 million people, but only around half (540,000 people) answered this question and it\u2019s possible that there were differences in the amount of overtime worked between the people that did and didn\u2019t respond.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s plausible that people busy with lots of overtime did not have time to complete the survey, and so may have worked more overtime than those that did complete the survey.\n\nSecondly, respondents didn\u2019t give their exact overtime, but had to pick one of the answer ranges stated above. That means it\u2019s hard to work out a true average.\n\nIf you assume that staff typically worked the average amount of overtime within the range they selected (so 8 hours for those who answered 6-10 hours, for example), with the \u201c11 or more hours\u201d category being 11 hours exactly, then the average overtime among respondents is around two hours. But it could be slightly higher or lower.\n\nFinally, staff were only asked how much unpaid overtime they worked. Arguably it\u2019s also important to consider how many hours staff considered they were working under their contracted hours, if any, in order to understand whether, on average, NHS staff are overworked.", "lang": "en"}
