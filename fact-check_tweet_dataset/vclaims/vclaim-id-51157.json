No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to mislead Trump supporters and Republicans into sharing made up stories that are clearly marked as satire when you actually click them. Articles from the site are frequently copied by foreign-run fake news websites. The people liking and sharing these stories are enriching foreign website operators or a liberal from Maine via the ad revenue generated with the content which is probably not what they expected or wanted.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Taters Gonna Tate on November 24, 2019 titled \"Ilhan Omar:'After We Win, Deportations Of Trump Supporters Begins'\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nDemocrats prove that they are nothing more than fascist scum everyday. They want to restrict or take away all of our constitutional rights and freedoms and they demonstrate this desire everyday. The latest example of a leftist announcing to the world they are perfect fascists comes from the mouth of Minnesota House Representative, Ilhan Omar, who recently told a colleague her party's plans for America should the democrats regain control of the White House: \"President Trump and his supporters have tried to destroy America with their criminal actions and constitutional violations. This cannot and will not go unpunished.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe story was posted under two categories named \"Muslammicy Bacony Goodness Satire\" and \"Satire and/or Conservative Fan Fiction\" on a page with several satire disclaimers and logos that were prominently visible. In addition the page had an image of dancing potatoes in the header so it is be quite clear to even a casual observer that this was not a real news website.\n\nThe site is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run byself-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry extremely visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nThis story is quite similar to an earlier one about Kamala Harris that the network put out some months ago which we wrote about here:\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nHere is a video of Blair explaining how his process works:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes tatersgonnatate.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
