{"title": "Is This Derek Chauvin Wearing a \"Make Whites Great Again\" Hat?", "subtitle": "Chauvin is the former Minneapolis police officer identified in news reports as the killer of George Floyd.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2020-05-27T10:04:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-63548", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/make-whites-great-again-hat/", "vclaim": "In May 2020, Minneapolis resident George Floyd died after a police officer identified in news reports as Derek Chauvin pinned Floyd down, kneeled on his neck, and choked him. The incident, which was captured on a bystander\u2019s now-viral video, stirred anger; and citizens once again took to the streets to protest police violence and racial injustice. Chavin was fired on May 26 along with three other officers.\n\nAs the outrage swirled, so did online rumors. Along with a video allegedly showing Chauvin onstage at a Trump campaign rally (fact-checked here), social media users shared a photograph supposedly showing Chauvin in a \u201cMake Whites Great Again\u201d hat while picking a blackberry out of a fruit bowl:\n\nBut the man in the \u201cMake Whites Great Again\u201d hat above is not Chauvin. This photograph actually shows Jonathan Riches, a supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump who is also a former federal inmate and an online troll who has garnered a reputation for filing lawsuits.\n\nRiches confirmed to us that he\u2019s the person in this photograph, but claimed that the \u201cMake Whites Great Again\u201d slogan on this hat was photoshopped:\n\nHat is fake. Photocopied / photoshopped for sure.. I wear MAGA hats [\u2026] People don\u2019t like me because of my Trump political activism. In return they set up fake profiles of me, memes, fake screen shots etc. In return I re-post to my friends what these people do to me. Been doing it for years to me [\u2026] It\u2019s my face in the photo. Someone doctored or edited [the hat] and spread it as if I am the cop. Now I\u2019m being harassed.\n\nWe examined the photograph and see no obvious signs of digital editing. Riches also could not produce the original, undoctored photograph.\n\nFurthermore, a second photograph of Riches in a \u201cMake Whites Great Again\u201d was posted to a Facebook page in support of the two men charged in the killing of a black jogger in Georgia. Riches claimed that this image was posted by a \u201cfake profile.\u201d However, Riches shared a screenshot of this post to his Facebook page (which he has since deleted) and commented that he couldn\u2019t believe \u201cpeople can get so triggered by a red hat.\u201d At that time, Riches made no mention that the hat was fake.\n\nLastly, screenshots show that the image of Riches in a \u201cMake Whites Great Again\u201d hat while pulling a blackberry from a bowl of fruit appears to have been originally shared to the Facebook page of Christina Caldwell, who claims to be Riches\u2019 grandmother, along with the message: \u201cThe blacker the berry the sweeter the juice.\u201d That post, too, has been deleted, but Caldwell confirmed in a separate post that it was Riches in the photo. Caldwell made no mention of the hat being fake.\n\nIn sum, the photograph supposedly showing ex-Minneapolis police officer Chauvin in a \u201cMake Whites Great Again\u201d hat actually shows Riches. While the evidence appears to show that this hat is genuine, Riches claims that the \u201cMake Whites Great Again\u201d slogan was photoshopped.", "lang": "en"}
