That would make it theoretically possible for the Russian government to cut off the Russian internet from the rest of the World Wide Web, similar to China\u2019s so-called \u201cGreat Firewall.\u201d\n\nHowever, Russia\u2019s domestic internet \u2013 unlike China\u2019s \u2013 did not develop based on centralized, state-owned networks. This makes it more difficult to isolate Russia\u2019s internet from the global internet.\n\nWhile Putin says the new law is necessary to ensure Russia\u2019s internet security should it be cut off from the web by a foreign actor, critics cite numerous examples of internet censorship, including the banning of apps like Telegram, the blocking of hundreds of websites, and criminal prosecutions targeting social media posts. Demonstrations against the sovereign internet law erupted when it was introduced in March, with an estimated 15,000 protesting in Moscow.\n\nIn February, Polygraph.info fact-checked a statement by Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of Russia\u2019s State Duma, who denied that the sovereign internet legislation was aimed at cutting off Russia from the global internet. Instead, he claimed the purpose of the measure was \u201cnot to close, not to cut off, but to ensure the security of the internet of the Russian Federation.\u201d Polygraph.info deemed Volodin\u2019s claim \u201cmisleading,\u201d based on the fact that the legislation\u2019s provisions gave authorities \u201cunlimited control over access and content.\u201d\n\nUpdate, Dec. 20, 2019: DefenseOne reported on Thursday that the Russian government plans to cut off some access to the global internet as a test of its new RuNet system on Dec. 23. The information came from internal documents from Russia's Ministry of Digital Development, Communications, and Mass Media, which state that the upcoming exercise was designed to \"evaluate the possibility of intercepting subscriber traffic and revealing information about the subscriber, blocking communication services.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
