Vanity Fair summarized that argument as being, \u201cIt\u2019s illegal to investigate a sitting president for any crimes he may have committed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a lawsuit filed today against Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., who recently subpoenaed eight years of Trump\u2019s tax returns to determine if the Trump Organization falsified business records relating to Stormy Daniels payments, the president\u2019s lawyers claim such a request is unconstitutional because the founding fathers believed sitting presidents should not be subject to the criminal process.\n\n\u201c\u2018The framers of our Constitution understood that state and local prosecutors would be tempted to criminally investigate the president to advance their own careers and to advance their political agendas,\u2019 the suit reads. \u2018And they likewise understood that having to defend against these actions would distract the president from his constitutional duties.'\u201d\n\nThe Vanity Fair article did not quote Trump or any of his representatives or lawyers admitting any criminal action on his part, and it attributed the legal argument in question to the president\u2019s lawyers (not the president himself). The article also made clear that the statement, \u201cIt\u2019s illegal to investigate a sitting president for any crimes he may have committed,\u201d was the author\u2019s own summary of what Trump\u2019s attorneys had written, rather than a direct quotation from their court filings.\n\nDespite all that nuance, the article\u2019s headline had the effect of badly misleading those who did not carefully read the article itself. \u201cTrump: My Crimes Can\u2019t Be Investigated While I\u2019m President\u201d demonstrably created the false impression, among many readers, that Trump himself (as opposed to his lawyers) had said (rather than argued to the effect that), \u201cMy crimes can\u2019t be investigated while I\u2019m president,\u201d and that in doing so, Trump or his lawyers had admitted wrongdoing on the part of the president.\n\nTrump did not say that nor did his lawyers. Nor did his lawyers even present an argument that could fairly be summarized in that way because, in making the argument they made, his lawyers did not admit any criminal actions on Trump\u2019s part.\n\nUnfortunately, the misleading nature of the article\u2019s headline was borne out in full. The Twitter account @stonecold2050 tweeted a link to the Vanity Fair article, adding, \u201cTrump says \u2018my crimes can\u2019t be investigated while I\u2019m the president of the United States.\u2019 \u2018My Crimes,\u2019 What did he just say?\u201d\n\nThat widely shared tweet was one of many social media posts that clearly demonstrated an understanding of the article\u2019s headline as meaning that Trump had himself explicitly admitted to having committed crimes.\n\nThe left-leaning The Other 98% Facebook page further promulgated that false impression, borrowing from @stonecold2050\u2019s tweet:\n\nComments posted on Vanity Fair\u2019s own Facebook page, and in response to its own tweeting of the article, clearly show that a considerable number of readers, without any editorial mediation, understood the headline to mean that Trump himself had admitted to criminal wrongdoing and said, \u201cMy crimes can\u2019t be investigated while I\u2019m president.\u201d\n\nThe passages quoted in the Vanity Fair article were taken from a civil complaint by Trump against New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance, filed on Sept. 19 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nThe key argument made by Trump\u2019s lawyers in that complaint was that Vance\u2019s efforts to obtain the president\u2019s tax returns, by issuing a subpoena to his accountants at Mazars, were an unconstitutional effort to advance a criminal investigation into a sitting president:\n\n\u201cBecause the Mazars subpoena attempts to criminally investigate a sitting president, it is unconstitutional. This court should declare it invalid and enjoin its enforcement until the president is no longer in office.\u201d\n\nTo that extent, the Vanity Fair article was accurate in summarizing the argument as being, \u201cIt\u2019s illegal to investigate a sitting president for any crimes he may have committed,\u201d though it is worth stipulating that occupants of the White House can (and have been) investigated as part of federal civil lawsuits if those suits don\u2019t relate to their official actions as president.\n\nTrump\u2019s attorneys are asking the District Court to declare the subpoena invalid and issue an injunction preventing the D.A.\u2019s office from enforcing it and Mazars from complying with it. To that extent, Trump is also suing the accountancy firm.\n\nAs of Sept. 23, Trump\u2019s legal team had filed a complaint, an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, a proposed order granting that motion, and a memorandum of law in support of that motion. Across those dozens of pages of legal argument, none of Trump\u2019s lawyers has once averred or admitted that their client has engaged in any criminal actions.\n\nRather, they have argued that the U.S. Constitution forbids the D.A. from conducting a criminal investigation into Trump until he is no longer president, and that therefore the District Court must temporarily block the D.A.\u2019s efforts to obtain Trump\u2019s personal federal tax returns by issuing a subpoena to his accountants.\n\nAs such, the headline of Vanity Fair\u2019s article (as opposed to the article itself) was grossly misleading. Although it did not explicitly attribute a statement to Trump, the wording of the headline created that widespread false impression. Trump did not say, \u201cMy crimes can\u2019t be investigated while I\u2019m president,\u201d nor did he make any similar statement in which he admitted having acted criminally, nor did his lawyers make an argument that involved an admission of criminal wrongdoing on the president\u2019s part.\n\nSubsequent social media posts that attributed \u201cMy crimes can\u2019t be investigated while I\u2019m president\u201d to Trump, as a direct quotation, were downright false.", "lang": "en"}
