But his reasoning for doing so appeared to contradict his public commentary on the strength of the economy, prompting several Snopes readers to ask if the proposal was real.\n\nIt was. In the message, Trump stated that federal law \u201cauthorizes me to implement alternative plans for pay adjustments for civilian Federal employees covered by the General Schedule and certain other pay systems if, because of \u2018national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare,\u2019 I view the increases that would otherwise take effect as inappropriate.\u201d\n\nCongress approved a 3.1% raise for federal workers, which went into effect in 2020. It was the largest pay increase in a decade. Legislation introduced for 2021 calls for for a 3.5% increase. Trump on the other hand proposed a 1% raise that will go into effect unless Congress approves an alternate amount, confirmed Tim Kauffman, spokesman for the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the largest employee union representing federal workers.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for presidents to make efforts to prevent full pay raises for federal workers from going into effect, Kauffman said. What is unusual is that Trump is using the economy to justify cuts even as he has been outspoken about the strength of the economy. One day after his message to Congress, Trump tweeted, \u201cBEST USA ECONOMY IN HISTORY!\u201d\n\nWe sent a question to the White House Press Office asking for an explanation for the seeming contradiction but got no answer.\n\n\u201cIf the economy is doing so well, then why can\u2019t we afford to provide a pay raise to the federal workers, a third of whom are veterans, who ensure our democracy is working every day and ensure services are delivered,\u201d Kauffman said. \u201cCurrently federal employees make about 4% less today than they did at the start of the decade, counting for inflation.\u201d\n\nFederal employee raises fall under the purview of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990, a law that is intended to ensure that government worker compensation is on par with the salaries of their peers in the private sector.\n\nBut \u201cevery single president except maybe the first year [the law was in effect] under [George H.W. Bush], they have used national economic concerns to prevent the full raise from taking effect,\u201d Kauffman said.", "lang": "en"}
