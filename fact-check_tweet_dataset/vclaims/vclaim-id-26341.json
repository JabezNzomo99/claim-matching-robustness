The graphic started circulating on social media after reports of re-imposition of curfew in Srinagar on the eve of Eid.\n\nAnother user from the United Kingdom tweeted the same screenshot along with one more similar screengrab. It has been retweeted more than 2,500 times so far.\n\nAccording to the second screengrab, the reporter\u2019s name is Pramod Madhav.\n\nMirror Now calls out the fake graphic\n\nMirror Now editor Faye D\u2019Souza took to Twitter to debunk the photoshopped screengrab of the news channel viral on social media. She said, \u201cThis is a fake screen. FALSE. Photoshopped\u201d.\n\nShe pointed out the discrepancies in the morphed screengrab by referring to the actual composition of the screen and the fonts used by the broadcaster. D\u2019souza asserted that the news channel has not carried such a story. Moreover, we also found that Pramod Madhav, the reporter whose name is mentioned in the second viral screengrab, is reporting on Kerala floods right now and is NOT in Kashmir.\n\nIt may also be noted that the English text in the morphed screenshots of the news channel is grammatically incorrect. While the text in the screengrab reads, \u201cNo one can slaughter animal now\u201d, it should have said, \u201canimals\u201d and not \u201canimal\u201d.\n\nShehla Rashid, a political activist and general secretary of Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Movement had posted the fake graphic on Twitter and later clarified that these were photoshopped.\n\nIn conclusion, a photoshopped screengrab of Mirror Now was circulated on social media to falsely claim that the Indian government has banned animal slaughter in Kashmir during Eid.", "lang": "en"}
