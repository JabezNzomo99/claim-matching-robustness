Each side can muster experts to make their case, though in general we would note that few economic crises (like plane crashes) are the result of one single factor; there is a risk in overemphasizing one reason above others. Even Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who favors reinstalling a version of Glass-Steagall, has acknowledged that crisis probably could not have been avoided if Glass-Steagall had been in place. (The Sanders campaign likes to cite this analysis blaming Glass-Steagall by the regulatory reform group Better Markets.)\n\nPhillip Wallach, a Brookings Institution fellow and author of \u201cTo The Edge: Legality, Legitimacy, and the Responses to the 2008 Financial Crisis,\u201d agreed with that assessment: \u201cDo they think commercial banks couldn\u2019t make mortgages to whomever back under Glass-Steagall? That\u2019s what commercial banks did! The rise of mortgage-backed securities doesn\u2019t strike me as obviously inconsistent with Glass-Steagall (and obviously took off during the late part of the Glass-Steagall era).\u201d He added: \u201cI think they are stretching very hard to try to fit a square peg in a round hole, and it\u2019s not at all convincing as a matter of accurate historical description.\u201d\n\nHowever, James G. Rickards, a former general counsel of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management and a fierce critic of the 1999 law, says there was an important cultural shift after Glass-Steagall was repealed. Previously, he said, such shadow-bank loans required permission from the Federal Reserve under an application known as 4(c)(8). \u201cThe presumption was it was illegal unless the Fed said you can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter Glass-Steagall, we didn\u2019t have to ask permission, and it enabled the banks to do what they wanted.\u201d\n\nMuch of its business was conducted in London, and it was under the oversight of a relatively weak regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision. The FCIC said this was possible because of the deregulation of over-the-counter derivatives the resulted from another law signed by Clinton just weeks before he left office \u2014 the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. (Sanders voted in favor of this law.)\n\n\u201cCiti couldn\u2019t have been like it was in 2008 without Gramm-Leach-Bliley.\u201d Wallach said. \u201cThat is the best arrow in the Glass-Steagall revivalists\u2019 quiver. Citibank deposits were attached to Citibank bad investments, and Citi was the Too-Big-To-Fail-iest of them all. Now that\u2019s true enough and has to be behind what Bernie is saying for it to have any force \u2014 but of course Bear Stearns \u2026 and Lehman \u2026 and Merrill Lynch \u2026 and Morgan Stanley all managed to get enough funding to be systemically dangerous without the deposit bases, in fact in ways that would have been consistent with Glass-Steagall.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my view, he is correct that the repeal of Glass Steagall gave both commercial banks and investment banks who owned ILCs much greater flexibility to deploy their capital and their deposit funds to whatever purposes they wished,\u201d said Fine, who favors a restoration of Glass-Steagall but not Sanders\u2019s specific proposals. \u201cAnd those firms leveraged themselves many, many multiples of times more than they would have been allowed before the repeal of Glass-Steagall as a result.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
