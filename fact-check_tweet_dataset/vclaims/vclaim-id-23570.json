In the post, they went on to claim that the man caught was also one of those who carried out Sri Lankan Church bombings. Let\u2019s try to analyze the veracity of the claims made in the post.\n\nClaim 1: Sri Lankan Police caught a Buddhist man dressed as a Muslim woman, who was involved in the latest Church bombing. Fact: The video uploaded on Facebook is an old 2018 video. It has nothing to do with the latest Sri Lankan Church bombings. Hence the claim is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen the video in the post is run through the Invid, several key frames were obtained. On using Google Reverse Image technique for each key frame, a certain key frame was found in an article of the \u201cNeth News.lk\u201d website. As per this article, the man in the video was seeking revenge over some person on a loan issue. In the article, a YouTube video similar to the one in the post was also embedded. When the timestamp of the video is seen, it was found to be uploaded on August 29, 2018. So this video has nothing to do with the latest Sri Lankan bombings that took place on April 21, 2019.\n\nTo sum it up, the video or the man in that video has nothing to do with the Sri Lankan Church Bombing incident.", "lang": "en"}
