It goes on to suggest that the January 2018 press conference called by senior sitting judges of the Supreme Court was \"against the assignment of important matters to Justice Arun Mishra\".\n\nThe Bar is extremely pained at the partisan attitude of the court towards Justice Mishra, which has continued (since Chief Justice Dipak Misra) in Chief Justice of India SA Bobde's tenure. \"Justice Mishra has also behaved in Court as if he controls the entire Supreme Court which has also caused immense damage to the Supreme Court as an institution,\" it read.\n\nAccording to the convention, the SCBA organizes a farewell for retiring judges of the Supreme Court. In recent times, the SCBA did not organize farewell for two judges \u2013 Justices Jasti Chelameswar and Abhay Manohar Sapre \u2013 at their request.\n\n\n\nJustice Mishra was elevated to the Supreme Court on July 7, 2014. during his tenure that has lasted a little over six years, Justice Mishra has been part of benches that has delivered 297 verdicts till date. During his tenure as a high court judge at the high courts of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Calcutta, Justice Mishra decided approximately 97,000 cases. Before he retires on September 2, Justice Mishra will decide on the timeline for recovery of aggregate gross revenue from telecom companies, and he will also decide on the quantum of punishment for advocate Prashant Bhushan who was held guilty of contempt.", "lang": "en"}
