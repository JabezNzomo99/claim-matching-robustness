She never made such a statement, and the story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to mislead Trump supporters and Republicans into sharing made-up stories that are clearly marked as satire when you actually click them. Articles from the site are frequently copied by foreign-run fake news websites.\n\nThe people liking and sharing these stories are enriching foreign website operators or a liberal from Maine via the ad revenue generated with the content, which is probably not what they expected or wanted.\n\nThe claim appeared in an article (archived here) published by by America's Last Line Of Defense, or We Are ALLOD, on April 15, 2020, titled \"Michelle Obama Slams Country Music, Says It's 'Music for Morons.'\" The story read, in part:\n\nMichelle Obama and her husband Barack are music fans. They love it. Except for country music, apparently drives them around the bend. They were recently interviewed and asked what concerts they would see after the crisis was over. They both said the obvious. Jay-Z. Beyonc\u00e9. Maybe one of The Who's 427 farewell tours. When the interviewer, Joe Barron asked if they'd take in a few country shows, seeing as how Mr. Barron is a huge country music fan, Barack Obama said: \"not really a fan.\" Michelle Obama snorted and said, \"not over my dead body.\" When the shocked interviewer asked why, she went into a long diatribe of how much she disliked the true American form of music, much of it shrouded in patriotic themes and Americana.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThis is, of course, all nonsense. In fact, in November 2011, the then-first lady hosted a country music celebration at the White House. Here is part of a story from the Huffington Post about the event:\n\nAfter bravely trying her hand at NASCAR (with only partial success), Michelle Obama and her husband decided to go full-on country and throw a country music fest in the White House. We know, we couldn't believe it either. Unfortunately there were no ten-gallon hats involved, but the First Lady wore some brights to signal her partying mood (perhaps after she was booed in blue?). For the daytime activities, which included a \"History of Country Music: From Barn Dances to Pop Charts\" workshop with Kris Kristofferson, Darius Rucker and Lyle Lovett, FLOTUS popped in a bright red and pink three quarter-sleeve dress as she addressed the group of kids. \"We've invited you here because I want to make sure that the White House lives up to the name 'The People's House,'\" the first lady told the children, \"That's what everybody calls it, what we call it. And I want to be sure that it's not just a place for senators and diplomats and CEOs who have a chance to come here, but it's a place for all Americans, especially young people.\" \"The People's House\" -- that's a new one. But the Obamas proved it by having the kids sit right in the State Dining Room, with the fancy chairs and crystal chandeliers. Of course for such accommodations, Michelle got a bit more dolled up later that night. For the evening's concert, Mrs. O swept her hair up and picked a pink silk pantsuit, watching the concert from the front row with the president.\n\nThe fake story was pushed by a site that comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full-time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including wearethellod.com, bustatroll.org or bebest.website. Sometimes, he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story that Lead Stories wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites that often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past, but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer, it is, of course, also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalists to rank the reliability of websites, describes wearethellod.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard, the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
