Why does President Trump believe that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte refuse to let Barack Obama land his plane in Manila? Trump has said it not once, not twice, but three times. On Nov. 14, he even made a sweeping motion with his hand to indicate a landing plane. (See video above.)\n\nThe 2015 trip was tied to an Asian-Pacific summit meeting. \u201cObama toured a former Coast Guard frigate, now used by the Philippine navy, and announced that the U.S. military would donate two more ships to the Philippines,\u201d The Post reported. \u201cThe gesture was the latest by his administration to reassure allies that they could rely on the United States to maintain a close strategic partnership.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for an explanation of Trump\u2019s remarks. But Trump appears to be referring to Obama\u2019s decision that year to cancel a planned meeting during a conference of leaders in Asia in September 2016 after Duterte said he would call Obama a \u201cson of a bitch\u201d if Obama questioned extrajudicial killings by Philippine authorities in a sweeping crackdown on drug trafficking ordered by Duterte.\n\n\u201cI do not have any master except the Filipino people, nobody but nobody,\u201d Duterte had told reporters. \u201cYou must be respectful. Do not just throw questions. \u2018Putang ina\u2019 I will swear at you in that forum.\u201d That is the Tagalog phrase for \u201cson of a bitch\u201d or \u201cson of a whore.\u201d\n\nObama initially shrugged off the comments, noting that Duterte was \u201ca colorful guy\u201d but he wanted to be sure \u201cif I\u2019m having a meeting, it\u2019s productive and we\u2019re getting something done.\u201d Apparently, he did not get that satisfaction, as the White House announced Obama had replaced the planned meeting with Duterte with one with South Korean President Park Geun-hye.\n\nAt the time, more than 2,400 people had been killed since Duterte took office, and Obama made it clear he planned to raise his concerns. \u201cWe will always assert the need to have due process and engage the fight against drugs in a way that is consistent with basic international norms,\u201d he said. \u201cUndoubtedly, if and when we have a meeting, this is going to be something that\u2019s brought up.\u201d\n\nAfter the cancellation, Duterte scrambled to make amends. His office expressed regret that his comments \u201ccame across as a personal attack\u201d on the U.S. president. Duterte\u2019s press service then said he would be seated next to Obama at an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) gala dinner in Laos the next day, but that did not happen.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t take the kinds of comments personally,\u201d Obama said. He noted that Duterte had used the same phrase when talking about other world leaders, including the pope. It seems to be \u201ca habit, a way of speaking for him.\u201d\n\nThe number of people killed in the crackdown has now risen to more than 7,000, according to Human Rights Watch. During Trump\u2019s recent trip to the Philippines, Trump appears to have barely raised the issue, if at all.\n\nClearly, Trump has gotten this story completely mixed up. Obama\u2019s visits to the Philippines were uneventful. When Duterte threatened to insult Obama, it was in another Asian country \u2014 and it was Obama who canceled the meeting. In any case, there was no circling Air Force One that \u201cnever got to land.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
