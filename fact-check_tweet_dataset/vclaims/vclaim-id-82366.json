This tweet was posted by Twitter user, Ankur Singh in the backdrop of the tragic terror attack in Pulwama, Jammu & Kashmir, which claimed lives of over 40 CRPF jawans. The 11 second video attached to the tweet showed Priyanka Gandhi, stand up saying \u201cBahut bahut dhanyawad\u201d (translated: thank you very much). The term \u201cvultures\u201d is typically used for those who prey on the dead in a tragedy.\n\nThe 11 second clip tweeted by Ankur Singh is part of a longer video where Priyanka Gandhi is seen condoling the death of the soldiers. She starts the press conference by stating, \u201cAs you know, this press conference had been organised to discuss certain political issues. However, in view of the terror attack in Pulwama in which our jawans have been martyred, it would be inappropriate to discuss politics at this point in time\u201c. While condoling the death of the soldiers, she stated, \u201cI want to tell their families that the entire nation is with them at this time,\u201d and ended the short conference by thanking the audience and urged them to maintain a two-minute silence on this tragic and solemn occasion.\n\nWatching the video in its entirety, it is clear that Priyanka Gandhi did not laugh at any point and that a cropped version was shared to push a false narrative.\n\nAnkur Singh is followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on twitter. He recently featured as a \u201ctech expert\u2019 in a debate on Mirror Now where he spoke about Twitter bias against right wing accounts. His Twitter account was recently suspended and revoked.\n\nSeveral news channels have reported about Priyanka Gandhi cancelling her press conference in wake of the unfortunate Pulwama attack.\n\nThe death of CRPF jawans is a national tragedy. At a time like this, it is unfortunate to see social media users attempt to politicise the tragedy by posting cropped videos.", "lang": "en"}
