Andrew M. Cuomo said high levels of student loan debt motivated his proposal for free tuition at any public university or community college in New York state for students from families earning less than $125,000 a year.\n\n\"It is incredibly expensive, and the debt is so high it\u2019s like starting a race with an anchor tied to your leg,\" Cuomo said of paying for college. \"Average college debt -- $30,000 per student.\"\n\nThe governor\u2019s office projected 210,000 students would seek the benefit. If so, the program would cost the state $163 million annually by 2019.\n\nSo is Cuomo right about the average student debt load in New York state?\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York collected 2015 data on student loan debt in the state.\n\nThe Fed reports 17.9 percent of consumers in New York state have a student loan, and their average college debt is $32,200. That\u2019s higher than the national average of $29,700, the Fed said.\n\nThe debt steadily increased for a decade. According to a September report from the State Comptroller\u2019s office, the average student debt load in New York State increased by more than 47 percent between 2005 and 2015. The national average grew by 56 percent.\n\nTotal student debt statewide more than doubled during that time period.\n\nThe Institute for College Access & Success, an independent, non-profit organization, pegged the average debt of the state\u2019s college graduates in 2015 at $29,320. That ranked 18th highest among the states. Fifty-nine percent of the students graduated with debt, the organization said.\n\nThe average debt among graduates of State University of New York campuses was generally lower than their private college counterparts. The average debt for University at Buffalo graduates was $26,165, followed by those at Binghamton University, $25,844; SUNY Albany, $25,727; and Stony Brook University, $23,542.\n\nThe average debt for graduates fluctuated among private colleges in New York state. Among the higher averages were incurred by graduates of Ithaca College, $39,771; Rochester Institute of Technology, $38,198; St. Bonaventure University, $38,073; Fordham University, $37,607; and Syracuse University, $36,500, according to the institute.\n\nThe average debt was lower - but still significant - for graduates at other private universities: Colgate University, $20,859; Cornell University, $24,394; Clarkson University, $29,000; New York University, $30,480; St. John\u2019s University, $33,179.\n\nCuomo said the average college debt for those who borrowed for college in New York state is \"$30,000 per student.\"\n\nCuomo gets it right, according to the Institute for College Access & Success, which analyzed debt for 2015 graduates in New York State. And his claim is about what the Federal Reserve Bank of New York calculates for all New York state consumers with college debt.\n\nWe rate his claim as True.", "lang": "en"}
