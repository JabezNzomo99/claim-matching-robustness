Sanders\u2019s most recent grade from the NRA was a D-minus. Since 1992, the first year the NRA issued a grade for Sanders, he has received between a C-minus and F. Since 1988, Sanders has been consistent on restricting the use of semiautomatic firearms (often called \u201cassault weapons\u201d). But now, he suggests that his stance against assault weapons cost him the 1988 election \u2014 because his two opponents in the three-way race opposed banning such firearms and had the NRA\u2019s support. Was that really the case? The evidence is mixed. He could have just as easily lost the election because he split votes with a Democrat, as opposed to being the only candidate without an NRA endorsement.\n\nClinton has attacked Sanders for voting five times against the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which established a background check system and wait periods for people buying handguns from licensed dealers. Sanders often responds to this attack by highlighting his long-time support for \u201cinstant background checks.\u201d That\u2019s true, but there\u2019s more to the story. When the Brady bill was being debated, the \u201cinstant\u201d background checks that Sanders supported actually would\u2019ve killed the Brady bill. That\u2019s because the technology for such an instant check did not exist then, and the provision would\u2019ve rendered the background check ineffective. After the 2012 shootings in Newtown, Conn., Sanders did vote in support of several amendments seeking to expand background checks for all firearm sales and to prohibit straw purchases.\n\nClinton\u2019s claim that Sanders voted for the \u201cCharleston loophole\u201d\n\nClinton repeatedly has drawn a direct link between a vote taken by Sanders to a recent gun tragedy \u2014 the June 17, 2015, killing of nine people by Dylann Roof at a historic black church in Charleston, S.C. Roof legally purchased his .45-caliber Glock pistol from a store, even though he had been charged with possessing a Schedule III narcotic without a prescription. This was not caught before the three-day waiting period ended because of clerical mistakes, so the store went through with the purchase. The \u201cCharleston loophole\u201d refers to the three-day waiting period. Sanders did not specifically vote for a three-day period, he did vote for an even shorter one-day window \u2014 and eventually, he voted against requiring any background checks at all. The vote in question took place almost a quarter-century ago, but there is a relatively straight line from the 1993 vote to the 2015 shooting. Clinton earns the elusive Geppetto Checkmark.\n\nSince the beginning of his campaign, Sanders has been confronted about his vote for a controversial 2005 law giving broad federal immunity to gun manufacturers. Clinton repeatedly has attacked him on this vote, noting she voted against it. Sanders now says he would support repealing the law. Sanders has described the law as protecting gun manufacturers from being held responsible if a murderer uses their gun to kill someone \u2014 just as a hammer company should not be responsible if somebody used a hammer as a weapon. But the law does more than that; it provides a unique federal legal shield that most consumer goods manufacturers do not have \u2014 protecting them from most claims of negligence, and even certain claims relating to the gun\u2019s design. His characterization earned Two Pinocchios.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s claim that the gun immunity law limits the Sandy Hook families\u2019 lawsuit\n\nAhead of the Connecticut primary, Clinton has been focusing on the consequences of the 2005 law on victims of gun violence, such as the families of the 20 children and six adults killed at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn. The families are suing the Remington Arms Company, manufacturer of the type of gun used in the shooting: the AR-15 rifle, which is among the guns often referred to as \u201cassault weapons.\u201d But the families are now having to use a complicated legal process in order to avoid restrictions in the gun immunity law, which Sanders supported and Clinton opposed. The case is pending, and manufacturers can raise the immunity law as a defense to get the lawsuit dismissed. Such lawsuits against manufacturers are already difficult to win, but the immunity law makes it difficult to even bring to court. Clinton correctly characterizes the law\u2019s potential impact on the Sandy Hook lawsuit, and earned a Geppetto Checkmark.\n\nAt the Jan. 17, 2016, Democratic debate, Clinton listed off a series of Sanders votes: to allow law-abiding passengers to bring firearms in their checked baggage on Amtrak; to allow law-abiding, licensed gun owners to bring firearms into national parks and wildlife refugees; and to reject additional funding to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for research on issues related to firearms. Those three points checked out, as we noted in our debate fact-check round-up (we don\u2019t issue Pinocchio ratings during live fact-checks). On the campaign trail, Sanders has called on more funding for CDC to fund gun violence studies.", "lang": "en"}
