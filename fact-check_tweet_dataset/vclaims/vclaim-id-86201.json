But both numbers can only be estimates; there is no actual count of undocumented immigrants, and there is a big dispute over what kind of financial drain, if any, illegal immigration places on the United States.\n\nThe president indicates that these figures are from the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), but instead they appear to come from the president\u2019s avid TV-watching. Here\u2019s an image of a tally that recently appeared on the right-leaning One America News Network:\n\nIn December, DHS released a report that there were nearly 12 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States in January 2015. The report said the population had dropped after reaching a peak in 2007, before the Great Recession, but there had been a gain of 800,000 between 2013 and 2015, \u201ca result that may have been driven in part by rising unlawful arrivals at the southwest border in 2014.\u201d But still, the report said, \u201cthe 2015 population was likely substantially smaller than the 2007 peak.\"\n\nThe same report indicated there are 24.5 million legal residents in the United States, so the combined immigrant population would be about 36 million, not 26 million as indicated in the OAN tally. We sought a response from OAN for how its numbers were calculated but did not receive a reply.\n\nThe DHS estimate of 12 million in 2015 is within the range of other estimates by outside groups. The Center for Migration Studies estimated the number in 2015 was about 11 million; as of 2017, the undocumented population has fallen to 10.7 million, the group estimated. That represented a drop of more than 1 million since 2010.\n\nBut even the Yale estimate agreed the population size has been relatively stable since 2008; it just assumes higher (previously unknown) growth in the 1990s. Moreover, a population of that size would undercut Trump\u2019s frequent claims that undocumented immigrants spread crime because the findings \u201csuggest that the [crime] rate is even lower than previously believed,\u201d the study said.\n\nThe FAIR estimate is already considered a rather high estimate \u2014 one that is fiercely disputed. The Cato Institute, which favors immigration, said the study had serious methodological errors that, once considered, reduced the fiscal cost to $3.3 billion to $15.6 billion before accounting for economic activity generated by illegal immigrants.\n\nClearly, there are many ways to crunch these numbers. Undocumented immigrants generally pay taxes, such as Social Security, but receive no government benefits. Moreover, while undocumented immigrants initially may result in a fiscal shortfall, the next generation likely provides a net benefit. Over 75 years, each immigrant represents $259,000 in net present value for federal, state and local governments, according to a September 2016 report by National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine on the economic impact of the U.S. immigration system.\n\nOnce again, we have an example of the president \u2014 who probably has access to more information than any other person on Earth \u2014 latching on to dubious numbers that he saw on television. Compounding this error, he apparently misunderstood one number, assuming \u201caliens\u201d meant \u201cillegal aliens,\u201d and then tweeted it out to the nation as a new, unknown fact.", "lang": "en"}
