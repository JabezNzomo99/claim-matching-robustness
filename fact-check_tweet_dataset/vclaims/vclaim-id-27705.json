This statement, while often attributed to Plato, seems to fall into that category. (RELATED: Did Plato Say, \u2018Be Kind, Everyone You Meet Is Fighting A Hard Battle\u2019?)\n\nAn internet search reveals a number of blogs debating the origin of the quote, though none credibly link it to the ancient Greek philosopher. The Daily Caller News Foundation found no record of the expression in Plato\u2019s complete works.\n\n\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t sound to me like Plato,\u201d says University of Chicago professor and Plato expert Nathan Tarcov in an email to the DCNF. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a dialogue where it would fit.\u201d\n\nThe quote has also been ascribed to Spanish-American philosopher George Santayana, though it\u2019s unclear if he coined the expression. It appears in his 1922 book \u201cSoliloquies in England and Later Soliloquies,\u201d where he writes without attributing it to another source, \u201cOnly the dead are safe; only the dead have seen the end of war.\u201d\n\nThe attribution to Plato gained popularity in the 1960s after General Douglas MacArthur credited the ancient Greek philosopher with coining it in a 1962 address to West Point cadets.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
