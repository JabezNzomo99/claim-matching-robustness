The premise set in the exchange above is that the ethanol mandate is \u201cset to expire by 2022.\u201d But there is no actual end date to the program in statute.\n\nCongress created the RFS through the Energy Policy Act of 2005. This law mandated the expansion of renewable energy in the U.S. gasoline supply, requiring increasing amounts of biofuels to be mixed into the supply each year. Congress set the minimum volume of renewable fuel required each year, as shown below (from the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007):\n\nBut this is misleading rhetoric. The mandate doesn\u2019t go away at all. In fact, statutes require after 2022, the Environmental Protection Agency set the minimum levels through regulations. The EPA administrator must use six criteria to set the new standard beyond 2022, such as the impact of renewable fuels on the energy security in the United States and on the cost of gasoline for consumers.\n\nThe law also makes it clear that the new levels set by the EPA can\u2019t be lower than the amount required for 2022. [Update: We had written that EPA can\u2019t lower the amount beyond 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel. But EPA has authority reduce the volume. The law allows EPA to issue a waiver to set the volume at a lower level than specified in the law, essentially \u201cresetting\" the volume. EPA has not used this authority yet. The Pinocchio Test is also corrected to reflect this change.]\n\n\u201cThe RFS has proven unworkable and costly. Its mandate that an increasing percentage of renewable biofuels be blended into gasoline and diesel each year ignores the reality there are insufficient amounts of some biofuels to meet the standard,\u201d according to a news release on Cruz\u2019s Senate website about his stance against the RFS. \u201cIt imposes significant costs, and offers few, if any, benefits. The RFS should be phased out so producers and refiners can focus on maximizing domestic resource potential.\u201d\n\nOn the campaign trail, Cruz has framed his opposition to the renewable-fuels mandate as his fight against Washington. In a Jan. 6, 2016, op-ed in the Des Moines Register, Cruz argued that he is fighting against the EPA from regulating ethanol, and instead creating a level playing field without the mandate and without any energy subsidies.\n\n\u201cIf they did not pass legislation phasing out the standard, as you note, the standard shifts from a legislative mandate to a \u2018future rule\u2019 set primarily by EPA,\u201d said Cruz\u2019s campaign spokesman Rick Tyler. \u201cUnder a Cruz administration, in 2022, in the absence of phase out legislation, the standard would be set to zero.\u201d\n\nThis is a wonky topic, and that\u2019s precisely why confusion like this occurs. As shown in the exchange we\u2019re fact-checking, the voter presents the premise that the ethanol mandate will \u201cexpire in 2022.\u201d It will not expire in 2022 unless the law is repealed. Yet Cruz answers her by confirming the inaccurate premise: \u201cYou rightly noted that the RFS is set to expire in 2022.\u201d\n\nHere are the facts: Cruz wants to phase it out from 2017 through 2022, with a full repeal by the end of 2022. But unless Cruz \u2014 or whoever the new president is \u2014 is able to convince Congress to repeal the current law, the ethanol program will continue. The current standards set in statute lasts through 2022, and after that, the EPA will decide on the levels from 2023 and beyond.", "lang": "en"}
