The original quote card was from the artist's emotional narration of how she felt upon learning of the shutdown, which she expressed during the May 8 Laban, Kapamilya Facebook (FB) livestream of ABS-CBN artists:\n\n\u201cHindi po ako makagalaw after mag-sign off. Sa 50 plus days na mag-isa ako sa bahay, \u2018yun po yung pinakatahimik na moment para sa akin\u2026 Para sa taong hindi naman matatakutin at hindi naman masyadong madamdamin, natakot po ako (I couldn\u2019t move after [ABS-CBN] signed off. In the 50 plus days I\u2019ve been home alone, that was the quietest moment for me\u2026 For a person who\u2019s not very fearful nor emotional, I became afraid).\u201d\n\nBela made no mention of neither Robin nor Duterte in her message. A search through the actress\u2019 official social media accounts, and a keyword search on Google, bore no result of the artist making the statement being attributed to her.\n\nOn May 10, ABS-CBN issued a \u201cdisinformation alert,\u201d disowning the graphic \u201ccontaining a fabricated statement of the actress.\u201d\n\nThe earliest version of the fake post flagged by VERA Files was published by Facebook page BULAG PIPI AT BINGI around noon on May 9, and has been shared over 210 times.\n\nTwo other ABS-CBN talents -- actress Kim Chui and actor Coco Martin -- who also took part in the May 8 live stream, figured in manipulated graphics dubiously imitating the network's template. One is a post that duplicated the news organization\u2019s May 6 quote card on Martin, but was edited by a netizen to quote him speaking with a lisp. The false post also photoshopped the logo of ABS-CBN to read \u201cAB-ET TBN.\u201d\n\nThe version on Chui edited out the logos of ABS-CBN from the network\u2019s original May 8 graphic on the actress, and replaced the original quote with a different statement the actress made in her message on the FB livestream that day.", "lang": "en"}
