A source familiar with numismatics or the study of coins confirmed that these \u2018fantasy\u2019 coins combined features of Ramatanka(s) or \u2018temple tokens\u2019 and were not meant for commercial use. Temple tokens with motifs or designs of Hindu gods and goddesses were symbolic and were never used commercially or as legal tender. These temple tokens did not have currency values engraved on them as they relied on the intrinsic value of the metal they were made of. BOOM had debunked a similar image in April 2017.", "lang": "en"}
