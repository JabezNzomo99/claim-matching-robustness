A purported transcript of what he said was converted into a widely shared meme posted to Facebook:\n\nThose reports were accurate. In a roundtable meeting at the White House on Dec. 6, Trump did indeed hold forth on what he presented as the need to review decades-old regulations on water pressure, and he did claim that those regulations had effectively forced people to flush their toilet 10 or 15 times in order to be effective.\n\nThe meeting was on the subject of \u201csmall business and red tape reduction accomplishments.\u201d A full transcript of Trump\u2019s remarks is available here and a video can be viewed here.\n\nIn the lead-up to the most relevant section of his remarks, Trump had been encouraging a relaxation of regulations in various sectors, including the auto industry, trucking industry, and in the production and sale of lightbulbs. Then he moved on to toilets and sinks, saying he had instructed the EPA to look \u201cvery strongly\u201d at regulations around water pressure:\n\nWe have a situation where we\u2019re looking very strongly at sinks and showers and other elements of bathrooms, where you turn the faucet on \u2014 in areas where there\u2019s [sic] tremendous amounts of water, the water rushes out to sea because you could never handle it \u2014 and you don\u2019t get any water. You turn on the faucet and you don\u2019t get any water. They take a shower and water comes dripping out, it\u2019s dripping out, very quietly dripping out. People are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once. They end up using more water. So EPA is looking at that very strongly, at my suggestion. You go into a new building or a new house or new home, and they have standards where you don\u2019t get water. You can\u2019t wash your hands, practically, there\u2019s so little water comes out of the faucet. And the end result is you leave the faucet on and it takes you much longer to wash your hands. You end up using the same amount of water. So we\u2019re looking at, very seriously, at opening up the standard. And there may be some areas where we\u2019ll go the other route \u2014 desert areas \u2014 but for the most part you have many states where they have so much water that \u2014 it comes down, it\u2019s called \u2018rain\u2019 [laughter] \u2014 that they don\u2019t know what to do with it. So we\u2019re going to be opening up that, I believe, and we\u2019re look at changing the standards very soon.\n\nTrump appears to have been referring to regulations signed into law by President George H.W. Bush in 1992 and President Bill Clinton in 1994, which required newly built toilets and showers, respectively, to be designed in such a way that they restricted the volume of water produced with each usage.\n\nAs Mother Jones and the Atlantic have reported, such regulations have been a bug-bear of libertarians and anti-regulation conservatives for years.", "lang": "en"}
