The message went on to provide a set of steps to secure the phone lines.\n\n\n\nThe steps provided in the message are as follows:\n\u2022 The message asks users to dial *#61# to know whether the phone line is being monitored. According to the message, if the users gets the message \"Call Forwarded\" upon dialing the code, it suggests that the call is being monitored.\n\u2022 It also urges users to dial ##002# to \"remove the monitoring device\", and secure the phone line.\n\nBOOM did a quick search of vertical service codes, like the ones provided in the message, to ascertain whether the steps mentioned in the message have any link to telephone devices being monitored. Since service codes are ubiquitous, it is in-built in every single phone around the world.\n\n\n\nAmerican computer magazine PCMag listed down a series of service codes in an article to \"unlock hidden features\". According to the article, the service code *#61# is aimed at providing information on the status of call forwarding on that phone. Call forwarding is a call management technique which allows users to redirect calls to a desired number in case of unavailability. Upon dialing the code, the user gets to know whether he/she has activated the service on their device.\n\nIt must be mentioned that the call forwarding service by itself has no link to phones being monitored - and can be activated and deactivated by the user.\n\nBelgium telephone service provider Proximus also lists down a series of service codes related to call diversion - a feature similar to call forwarding. According to the FAQs, the service code ##002# is simply a method to deactivate \"call divert\" services, if the user had activated it previously.\n\nThe codes provided in the viral message are call forwarding and call diversion features, available in every cellular phone around the world. They do not reveal instances of calls or data being monitored by third parties, nor do they secure your calls from being monitored.\n\n\n\nThe entire narrative about \"security agents\" monitoring telephones is unrelated to these features.", "lang": "en"}
