Wendy Davis said in a Dec. 3, 2013, post on her campaign website .\n\n\"Greg Abbott\u2019s actions speak louder than his words. While I fought against over $5 billion in unconstitutional budget cuts to our public schools,\" Davis said, Abbott \"wasted taxpayer funds to defend those cuts in court.\"\n\nDavis, a Fort Worth state senator, helped force a special legislative session in 2011 , and temporarily delaying, a decision by the revenue-strapped Republican-majority Legislature to by more than $5 billion through 2012-13.\n\nAnd did Abbott, the state\u2019s attorney general, defend the cuts in court?\n\nThat\u2019s been acknowledged. Abbott was quoted during his Dec. 3, 2013, Plano visit as the reason he\u2019s defending the cuts is because the Legislature passed them and it\u2019s his job to defend them. \"The attorney general in Texas takes an oath of office to defend the laws passed by the legislature,\" Abbott said, according to the News. \"I\u2019m fulfilling that duty.\"\n\nThat news story came to our attention in an email from Davis\u2019 campaign spokeswoman Rebecca Acu\u00f1a, who responded to our request for the basis of Davis\u2019 statement with a listing web links to additional news stories as well as by Abbott\u2019s office in defending the school funding system in the latest round of litigation likely headed to the Texas Supreme Court. In February 2013, a Travis County state district judge, John Dietz, ruled the system unconstitutional, though he later reacted to legislative actions restoring $3.4 billion in spending cuts and easing mandated high-school tests by scheduling fresh hearings for early 2014, the Austin American-Statesman reported in a posted online June 19, 2013.\n\nA vital issue in the original trial, the Statesman said in a posted online Oct. 20, 2012, was the charge by two-thirds of the state\u2019s school districts accounting for three-quarters of Texas students that the state was failing to ensure that districts had adequate resources to bring students up to what lawmakers handed down in tougher academic expectations.\n\nTexas districts have litigated how the state funds the schools for decades. Each time, expert lawyers told us, the state attorney general has defended the existing law just as Abbott has in the latest legal battle, which is expected to resume in early 2014.\n\nThat\u2019s in keeping with the duties of the attorney general as specified in the Texas Constitution, which the attorney general \"shall represent the state in all suits and pleas in the Supreme Court of the state in which the state may be a party.\"\n\nLawyers representing groups of districts in the latest lawsuits each said it would be unusual for an attorney general not to defend a state law and related legislative decisions.\n\nBuck Wood of Austin, who has long represented property-poor districts in school finance suits, said deputies to Abbott \"vigorously defended\" the law during the latest trial before Dietz.\n\nAustin lawyer Rick Gray, representing some 400 districts in the latest litigation, said he could not recall any attorney general backing down from defending the school finance system through the decades of court battles.\n\nDavid Thompson of Houston, who represents districts (including the Austin one) serving more than 1.8 million children, stressed that Abbott\u2019s office has defended the constitutionality of the funding system and the legislated cuts, not necessarily speaking to whether the spending reductions were good policy. \"The attorney general\u2019s office is actively and I would say vigorously defending the state\u2019s actions,\" Thompson said. \"That would include specifically the cuts to funding as well as just the overall design and structure of the (funding) system.\"\n\nThe lawyers each added that while it\u2019s an attorney general\u2019s duty to defend the state and actions taken on behalf of the state, he or she also has discretion to settle cases.\n\nOur search of news stories and Abbott-issued press releases yielded no sign of Abbott personally appearing in the courtroom during the latest school funding trial. At our request, Catherine Clark, an administrator for the Texas Association of School Boards, reviewed her notes from the trial. By telephone, Clark said she found no instances of state attorneys defending the 2011 cuts in education aid except to elicit testimony that the reductions were less dramatic than other state budget cuts that year. \"I don\u2019t see them standing up there and saying, gosh, we needed to\" make those cuts, Clark said. \"But they did admit there were cuts.\"\n\nWe asked a spokeswoman for the attorney general, Lauren Bean, if Davis is correct that Abbott has defended the 2011 cuts in the school funding lawsuits. By email, Bean said yes, Abbott\u2019s \"office defended the law in court.\" In a follow-up email, she listed court rulings specifying the attorney general has an exclusive role in representing state agencies.\n\nDavis said Abbott defended more than $5 billion in cuts in public school funding in fighting hundreds of school districts in court.\n\nThat\u2019s factually correct as far as it goes, but this claim is missing important details and context in that the state attorney general has a legal duty to represent the state in challenges reaching the Texas Supreme Court, which the latest school finance lawsuits are expected to do. It would be unusual for an attorney general not to defend a law and legislative actions in such a suit.\n\nWe rate this partly accurate claim as Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
