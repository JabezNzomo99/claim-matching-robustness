And some say New Englanders could see higher electricity prices without an ample supply of natural gas.\n\nThis is where Richard Paglia and his company, Houston-based Spectra Energy, come in. An upgrade to gas pipelines and gas storage capacity would expand supply and lower electricity prices, says Paglia.\n\nSome critics of Spectra\u2019s various infrastructure projects, including two men who locked themselves to the front gates of the company\u2019s Burrillville compressor station over the summer, oppose greater use of fossil fuels.\n\n\"Without that project going forward, we will really be constrained,\" Paglia said during an appearance on WPRI\u2019s Executive Suite. \"We already pay the highest electricity prices in the country here in New England.\"\n\nThe costliest electricity in the country?\n\nWe thought this was worth a check.\n\nOur research found that the average cost of electricity in New England is higher than other regions of the continental United States. But an emphasis on the words \"region\" and \"continental\" is important.\n\nIn August 2015, the average price of electricity for New England\u2019s six states was about 18.1 cents per kilowatt hour, according to a price monitoring report issued by the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Oct. 27.\n\nThe average price for electricity in the state of California, 18.2 cents, slightly exceeded New England\u2019s average. But California\u2019s averages were lower during the winter of 2015.\n\nAlso, in August, California\u2019s region, which encompasses Oregon and Washington, had less expensive electricity than New England. Washington state\u2019s average of 9.4 cents \u2013 the lowest in the country \u2013 helped hold the average price in its Pacific coast region to 15.7 cents.\n\nIn comparison, the average for Rhode Island this past August was 18.7 cents.\n\nIn the region that encompasses New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania, the average was 16.5 cents.\n\nIn general, electricity was significantly less expensive elsewhere in the continental United States, away from the northeast and California coast.\n\nBut in a region that the EIA refers to as \"Pacific Noncontiguous,\" which encompasses just Alaska and Hawaii, the average price of electricity was almost 27 cents.\n\nHawaii\u2019s average electricity price was about 30 cents while Alaska\u2019s was 21 cents.\n\nA spokesman for Spectra, Creighton A. Welch, acknowledged that the New England region\u2019s electricity prices are only highest in the continental United States.\n\n\"The main message here,\" said Welch, \"is that it\u2019s a shame New England\u2019s electric costs are so high relative to nearby regions \u2013 especially when practically next door sits a vast supply of affordable, domestic natural gas \u2013 that they are limiting economic competitiveness and growth in the region. It\u2019s critical that we solve this energy challenge.\"\n\nNew England had the priciest electricity in the continental United States according to a government report that compares New England to other regions of the country.\n\nThe same report shows that California\u2019s electricity was more expensive than electricity in four of six New England states.\n\nMeanwhile, Hawaii and Alaska are U.S. states and electricity within both of those states was more expensive than the New England region\u2019s average. The average for the region that both states are grouped in was more expensive, too.\n\nThe statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details.
