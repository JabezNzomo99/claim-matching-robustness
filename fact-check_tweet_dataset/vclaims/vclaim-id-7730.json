The difference between the authentic image and the altered one? A smile the North Korean leader didn\u2019t have, or at least not serious look of the original photo.\n\nThe image, used as a backdrop ahead of Kiselev\u2019s feature, credited RIA Novosti as the source. TV Rain reported that the agency image bank has only one copy of the image, in which Kim is not smiling.\n\nThe AFP, Reuters and AP image banks, crediting TASS news agency and MID\u2019s press pool, also store only one official copy of the image, without a smile.\n\nRIA Novosti, alongside with Sputnik News, is a government news agency currently owned by \u201cRussia Today\u201d and managed by Dmitry Kiselev himself. There is no reason to believe it would use any other official government images from the meeting between Lavrov and Kim Jong Un.\n\nAn inspection of the original photo shows that it was taken with a Canon EOS-1D and processed through Adobe Photoshop CS6.\n\nDmitry Kiselev dismissed the widespread media response in a comment to Radio Moscow on June 4. He said that Kim\u2019s smile, appearing only in the image broadcast by his show, was the result of HDR photography that yielded multiple versions of the same photograph. This is false.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry also released a video capturing the moment in which Lavrov and Kim Jong Un were posing for the picture. In the video, Kim was not smiling at any time while the photos were taken.\n\nDmitry Kiselev is often referred to as the \u201cchief Kremlin propagandist.\u201d His weekly 60-minute show \u201cSunday News\u201d broadcasts to over 100 million Russians and almost entirely focuses on Russia\u2019s foreign policy and propaganda narratives.", "lang": "en"}
