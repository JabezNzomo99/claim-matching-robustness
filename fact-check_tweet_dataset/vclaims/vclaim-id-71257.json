The message also predicts India\u2019s future course based on the same model.\n\nWe fact-checked the above message and found it to be misleading.\n\nOn running a search with relevant keywords, we found a news report by Business Today, titled, \u201cCoronavirus: India needs 49-day lockdown, not 21, say Cambridge researchers.\u201d\n\nAccording to the article, two Indian-origin University of Cambridge scholars, Rajesh Singh and R Adhikari presented a paper based on their mathematical calculation. The paper states that to effectively deal with COVID-19, the Indian government must extend the lockdown to 49 days.\n\nTheir paper, Age-structured impact of social distancing on the COVID-19 epidemic in India, predicts a single 49-day lockdown, or a series of shorter lockdowns, extending over two months may be necessary.\n\nThe model compares case data, age distribution and social structures of India, China and Italy. Calculating the various control measures at home, office and elsewhere in the society, the paper concluded that the 21-day lockdown would not be enough and the cases will resurge as soon as the lockdown is lifted.\n\nSo, based on the calculations, the paper suggested two effective models of lockdown:\n\u2022 Three consecutive lockdowns with the first one lasting 21 days, second 28 days and the third one for 18 days with a five-day gap between each lockdown.\n\nMoreover, as of yet (the time of filing the report), the government has made no announcements regarding the extension of the 21-day lockdown.\n\nIn fact, on March 30, Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba clarified that the government had no plans of extending the lockdown.\n\nWith the above information, we can conclude that the four-step model being circulated on social media has been falsely attributed to WHO.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
