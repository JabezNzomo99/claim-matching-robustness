Not so.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2019-05-01T07:00:07.778Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-17549", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/01/bidens-false-claim-that-no-one-rich-got-trumps-tax-cuts/?utm_term=.9b3ca3243e30", "vclaim": "Technically, the tax cut signed into law by Trump had an estimated revenue loss of a little under $1.5 trillion over 10 years. So Biden is rounding up here, though one could get the figure up to $2 trillion if you include the cost of additional interest on the national debt or the cost of extending tax cuts that expire (more on that later).\n\nBecause there are far more people in the middle class, there are fewer dollars to share per taxpayer when the savings from a tax cut are divvied up. The nonpartisan Joint Committee of Taxation estimates that 572,000 taxpayers will file returns with an income category of more than $1 million, compared with more than 27 million in the $50,000 to $75,000 category and almost 70 million in the under-$50,000 category.\n\nIf the wealthy end up with more money because they pay more in taxes, that\u2019s not necessarily a fair way to look at tax legislation. The top 1 percent in 2014 earned 20 percent of adjusted gross income and paid nearly 40 percent of federal taxes, according to the Tax Foundation. The Tax Policy Center estimates that in 2018, the top 1 percent would get 20.5 percent of the tax cuts.\n\nMoreover, when both the Joint Tax Committee and the Tax Policy Center looked at the impact of the tax bill, they concluded that in 2018, most people would see an overall reduction in taxes. The Tax Policy Center found that 80.4 percent of all taxpayers would have a tax cut, compared with about 5 percent experiencing a tax increase. In the middle quintile, 91 percent would get a tax cut, averaging about $1,090, with 7.3 percent facing a tax increase averaging about $910.\n\nIn terms of just individual tax cuts \u2014 which we should consider given that Biden was addressing union workers and other campaign supporters \u2014 the Tax Policy Center found 65 percent of taxpayers would get tax cuts. In the $50,000 to $75,000 range, 82 percent would get tax cuts, with people who got a tax cut ending up with an average of almost $1,000.\n\nChris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute has argued that both the Joint Tax Committee and the Tax Policy Center present a misleading picture because they include payroll taxes (such as for Social Security and Medicare) \u2014 and the Trump tax legislation left payroll taxes untouched. When you exclude payroll taxes, it appears as though the largest share of the tax changes goes to the middle-income quintile, according to his calculations.\n\nThe left-leaning Institution of Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) acknowledges that most people would get a tax cut but says the tax changes as a share of pretax income are larger for the wealthy. The average pretax share is estimated to be 2.1 percent for all taxpayers in 2018, but the richest 1 percent would get 2.6 percent and the middle quintile would receive 1.6 percent, ITEP said.\n\nMeanwhile, as this year\u2019s tax season ended, H&R Block reported that its clients experienced a 25 percent reduction in tax liability, which translates to about $1,200 on average. Tax refunds were mostly flat, however, as the Internal Revenue Service changed the withholding tables so people would see more in their paychecks. So that worked out to about $25 extra every week \u2014 or $3.50 a day \u2014 starting in March.\n\nNow, this may be one reason Biden\u2019s audience readily agreed with his statement that they didn\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d the tax cut. An extra $3.50 a day might easily be missed, especially if the tax refund barely changed. The size of a tax refund appears to be very important for many Americans, even if it\u2019s in effect an interest-free loan to the government. Nevertheless, the average reduction in tax liability was 25 percent, which also serves to illustrate that many Americans do not pay much in federal income taxes.\n\nWhen we queried the Biden campaign, we first received a series of links to articles that discussed how by 2027, middle-class taxes would rise under the tax law. That\u2019s because the individual tax cuts expire over the course of the decade. Republicans structured the tax cut this way to keep the whole package \u2014 especially the corporate tax cut \u2014 in a budget box that allowed only for a $1.5 trillion increase in the federal deficit over 10 years.\n\nThe assumption \u2014 possibly a big one \u2014 is that Congress will vote to extend the tax cuts when they begin to expire, just as most of the George W. Bush tax cuts were extended, with the eventual support of Democrats who had long opposed the Bush-era cuts. Still, the law is the law, and it\u2019s certainly fair to cite the projected impact of the tax cut in 2027, the end of the 10-year budget window.\n\nBut other Democrats have been more adept about adding phrases such as \u201cin the long run\u201d or \u201cby the end of the decade\u201d when citing the 2027 data. Not Biden. He frames the expiration of the individual rate cuts as happening now \u2014 and so incorrectly claims only the wealthy and corporations ended up with tax cuts in 2018.\n\n\u201cAs he told the Teamsters Local 249 yesterday, Joe Biden is committed to reversing the Republican tax plan because it is overwhelmingly a giveaway to the wealthy and big corporations that hard-working families can\u2019t afford,\u201d said spokesman Andrew Bates. \u201cForty percent of Americans can\u2019t withstand a $400 emergency and 60 percent of our largest corporations are paying no taxes at all, which is exactly why Joe Biden is fighting to rebuild the middle class and ensure that we reward work \u2014 not just wealth.\u201d\n\nThis is a good example of how precise words and context matter in a fact check. We\u2019ve previously given Democrats and Republicans Two Pinocchios for failing to make clear whether they are talking about the long-term or short-term tax-cut estimates for the law. But Biden, with his loose language, ends up in the Four-Pinocchio territory. He asserts that no Americans but those at the top received any tax cut in 2018, which is clearly false.", "lang": "en"}
