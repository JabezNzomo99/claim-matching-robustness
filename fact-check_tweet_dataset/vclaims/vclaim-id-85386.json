This is entirely different from Trump\u2019s original claim about phone taps during the election, but the White House often acts as if it is similar.\n\n\u201cI was urging my former colleagues, and, and frankly speaking, the people on the Hill, it was more actually aimed at telling the Hill people, get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can before President Obama leaves the administration,\u201d Farkas said. \u201cI had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior people that left. So it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nSomehow, the administration has tried to twist her comments into a confirmation that Trump was spied on. Spicer even misquoted Farkas as saying, \u201cI had a fear that they were essentially watching the Trump staff and he was worried about the Trump administration.\u201d But she did not suggest surveillance of Trump, and neither did the Times article. She also did not say the Obama administration tried to spread classified information.\n\nSpicer makes a series of misleading statements in an effort to suggest that former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, the loser of the presidential race, was guiltier of seeking better ties with Russia. (Trump, of course, during the campaign was vocal in the need to improve relations, even as evidence surfaced of Russian interference.)\n\nThe line about Clinton trying to strengthen Russia is taken out of context. She was speaking in terms of economic strength, specifically about helping American businesses invest more in Russia and overcome bureaucratic obstacles in the country. \u201cWe want to break down barriers,\u201d she said in a March 19, 2010, interview. \u201cWe want to create more free flow of people and information.\u201d\n\nSpicer also repeats the Four-Pinocchio claim that Clinton sold off one-fifth of U.S. uranium as part of \u201cconcession after concession.\u201d But, as we have reported, Clinton was not directly involved in the 2010 decision to approve greater Russian control of a Canadian company with U.S. uranium rights. The key players in the transaction were the Treasury Department and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The company, Uranium One, does have control over 20 percent of U.S. uranium extraction capacity. But it cannot export the uranium.\n\nRice, as national security adviser, certainly had the authority to request the identities of U.S. citizens picked up as part of National Security Agency intercepts of communications by foreign officials. (The reports would come to the NSC with the names of U.S. citizens redacted, replaced by a phrase such as \u201cU.S. person 1.\u201d) Bloomberg News\u2019s Lake wrote, \u201cRice\u2019s unmasking requests were likely within the law,\u201d in part because the standard for a request is that it must have some foreign intelligence value. (The NSA on its own can strip away anonymity if it suspects criminal activity in the intercepted communications.)\n\nMost of the reports were said to be summaries of conversations of foreign officials discussing the Trump transition, but some included conversations between foreign officials and Trump associates. The disclosure that Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak spoke several times with Trump incoming national security adviser Michael Flynn \u2014 and that Flynn had misled Trump officials about the nature of the calls \u2014 led to his firing by the president just three weeks after Trump took office.\n\n\u201cIt was not that common, as far as I know,\u201d said former George W. Bush NSC aide Michael Doran, now at the Hudson Institute. \u201cI did it a couple of times. One that I remember clearly. The procedure then was to submit a request to the NSA with your justification.\u201d The NSA then must approve the request. Doran said that intelligence reports \u201care often gists with quotes rather than verbatim transcripts,\u201d so it would be difficult to identify the U.S. person involved in the conversation without requesting unmasking.", "lang": "en"}
