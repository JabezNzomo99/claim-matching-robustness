President Donald Trump said blame for the attack lies with his predecessor, Barack Obama.\n\n\"These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administration\u2019s weakness and irresolution. President Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a \u2018red line\u2019 against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing,\" Trump said in an official White House statement April 4.\n\nMany commentators noted that this was a departure from Trump\u2019s past position on Syria, including Greta Van Susteren, who recently moved from Fox News to MSNBC.\n\n\"A few years ago in the midst of the debate whether President Obama should use force in Syria, then Mr. Trump, now President Trump, had a different opinion,\" Susteren said on her show April 4. \"In a tweet, then Mr. Trump said, quote, \u2018President Obama, do not attack Syria.\u2019 \"\n\nTrump conceded during an April 5, 2017, press conference that his stance on Syria and Assad has shifted, saying he is proud of his willingness to change his position based on current events.\n\n\"My attitude on Syria and Assad has changed very much,\" he said, in part because \"that attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me.\"\n\nWhat Trump said about Syria in 2013\n\nObama made the \"red line\" comment in August 2012, when he said he would change his calculus on armed intervention in Syria if Assad used or moved chemical weapons.\n\nAlmost a year later, Assad\u2019s regime killed more than 1,400 people in a chemical weapons attack on the city of Damascus. Even though Assad crossed the \"red line,\" Obama chose not to strike Syria and instead looked to Congress to authorize force. Eventually, through a deal with Russia, Syria handed over its chemical weapons, and no strikes were fired in direct retaliation for the chemical attacks.\n\nThroughout August and September 2013, as policymakers and pundits debated how to respond to the Syrian chemical attack, Trump lambasted the Obama administration, while simultaneously saying the United States should not intervene. We found more than 20 Trump tweets making that point. Here\u2019s a sample:\n\n\"What I am saying is stay out of Syria,\" he wrote Sept. 3, 2013.\n\nSept. 5, 2013, he wrote, \"The only reason President Obama wants to attack Syria is to save face over his very dumb RED LINE statement. Do NOT attack Syria,fix U.S.A.\"\n\n\"AGAIN, TO OUR VERY FOOLISH LEADER, DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA - IF YOU DO MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN & FROM THAT FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING!\" he tweeted the same day.\n\nAlthough Trump\u2019s position seems to have changed from 2013, there is an important consistency: his critique of Obama\u2019s decision to set a red line in the first place then ignore it.\n\n\"President Obama's weakness and indecision may have saved us from doing a horrible and very costly (in more ways than money) attack on Syria!\" he tweeted Sept. 1, 2013.\n\nHe reiterated this point in the April 2017 press conference.\n\n\"The Obama administration had a great opportunity to solve this crisis a long time ago when he said the red line in the sand,\" Trump said. \"And when he didn't cross that line after making the threat, I think that set us back a long ways, not only in Syria, but in many other parts of the world because it was a blank threat.\"\n\nTrump added that the most recent chemical attacks \"crossed a lot of lines,\" yet he declined to say whether he would take military action in retaliation because he doesn\u2019t want to tip off Assad.\n\n\"I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m doing anything one way or the other, but I\u2019m certainly not telling you, as much as I respect you,\" Trump said to a reporter.\n\nThe Trump administration has accelerated airstrikes and other actions in Syria that began at the tail end of the Obama\u2019s second term. In March, the Trump administration said it would send 400 additional troops to Syria to fight the Islamic State.\n\nVan Susteren said Trump \"had a different opinion\" in 2013 than he does now about whether Obama should have intervened in Syria after Obama\u2019s \"red line\" was crossed.\n\nIn 2013, Trump said emphatically that the United States should not attack Syria even though the Assad regime crossed the line by using chemical weapons. But in 2017, he criticized the Obama administration for not reacting to the 2013 chemical weapon attack with force.\n\nTrump admitted that his position on Assad has changed.
