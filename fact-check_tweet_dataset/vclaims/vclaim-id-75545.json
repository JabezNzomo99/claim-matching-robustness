Meanwhile former president Pranab Mukherjee's tweets will be archived with the handle @POI13. (Read Twitter's statement- The Digital Transition of the President of India\u2019s Official Account)\n\nThe blog post also said that those users who were following @RashtrapatiBhvn would by default follow both accounts @RashtrapatiBhvn and @POI13 and had the option to 'unfollow' through Twitter's normal process.\n\n\"Those who were following @RashtrapatiBhvn will now automatically follow BOTH accounts: @RashtrapatiBhvn and @POI13, to facilitate communication from the official President of India account to its audience. Users who do not wish to follow either accounts may unfollow through our normal process.\" - Twitter\n\nThis means that the ' whopping 3 million followers' that news outlets reported about were not 'new' and a significant number of users were already following the account. At the time of writing this story @RashtrapatiBhvn had 3.29 million followers while @POI13 had 3.31 million followers.

Narayanan and the first person from the Bharatiya Janata Party to hold the office of President. The former governor of Bihar's first tweet was that he was honoured to be sworn in as India's 14th President and that he will carry out his responsibilities with humility. A description of the account said it was managed by the President\u2019s Secretariat and that tweets from the president are signed \u2013 President Kovind.\n\nTwitter's blog post also stated that Pranab Mukherjee was India's first president on Twitter and that his followers can engage with him through his personal Twitter account @CitiznMukherjee.\n\nTwitter is a keenly watched political battleground in India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is extremely active on Twitter and has over 32 million followers. In June, BOOM had written a story how fake Ram Nath Kovind accounts had sprouted on Twitter.
