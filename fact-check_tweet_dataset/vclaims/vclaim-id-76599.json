And the article is 100 percent fiction.\n\nFirst of all, a search of all of Obama\u2019s executive orders shows that he never issued an order banning Christmas cards to the military.\n\nIn fact, the 2016 White House holiday website prompts visitors to send a USO e-card to members of the military. One of the pre-written message options is, \"We are grateful for all you do. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!\"\n\nThe tdtalliance.com article quotes a Hyman Stratcher, litigation director at the Liberty Institute. The Liberty Institute is a real right-wing advocacy group based in Texas, but Stratcher is a made-up person. (The institute\u2019s real head of litigation is named Hiram Sasser.)\n\nThe article also quotes Imam Al-Suq Akweer of the Islamic Friendship Coalition, and neither the person nor the organization are real.\n\nFinally, the article includes an image that has been edited to look like an on-air Fox News report featuring anchor Martha MacCallum, captioned, \"Obama orders ban on all Christmas cards to overseas servicemen. Pentagon to censor all outgoing mail that appears to be Christmas themed.\"\n\nWhile Fox has published numerous stories about the so-called \"War on Christmas,\" they did not run this fabricated story about banning Christmas cards.\n\nSide note: In researching this fact-check, we came across a 2013 Fox article that says a Veterans Administration hospital in Dallas refused to accept cards that say \"Merry Christmas.\" However, that article is misleading because it does not explain that a VA chaplain reviews and distributes Christmas cards to veterans who want to receive cards with a religious message.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Tdtalliance.com posted the same article in 2015. Our friends at Snopes debunked it back then, too.\n\nThis article claiming that Obama issued an executive order that bans sending Christmas cards to overseas soldiers is fake news, designed to deceive.
