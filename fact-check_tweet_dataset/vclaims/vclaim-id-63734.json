In July 2020, Trump boasted about his own mental fitness after having taken a cognitive test himself and challenged the 77-year-old Biden to do the same.\n\nIn a clip shared on Barnett\u2019s Twitter account and YouTube channel on Aug. 5, 2020, Biden scoffed when the journalist asked if he planned to take a cognitive test.\n\n\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t taken a test. Why the hell would I take a test? Come on, man. That\u2019s like saying to you before you got on this program if you had taken a test [on] were you taking cocaine or not?\u201d Biden said. \u201cWhat do you think, huh? Are you a junkie?\u201d\n\nBarnett then asked Biden to comment on Trump\u2019s mental state, who the reporter said \u201cbrags about his test\u201d and makes Biden\u2019s \u201cmental state an issue for voters.\u201d Biden visibly laughed in response, saying that if the president \u201ccan\u2019t figure out the difference between an elephant and a lion, I don\u2019t know what the hell he\u2019s talking about.\u201d\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, man. I know you\u2019re trying to goad me but, I mean, I\u2019m so forward looking to have an opportunity to sit with the president or stand with the president in the debates,\u201d he continued, before he said he was cutting himself off in order not to say something he \u201cprobably shouldn\u2019t say.\u201d\n\nIn July 2020, Biden contended that he was \u201cconstantly tested\u201d for cognitive decline on the campaign trail, news website Axios reported at the time.\n\nThe NABJ/NAHJ convention is sponsored by Yahoo News and is the largest annual gathering of journalists of color in the U.S. Trump was also invited by organizers to attend the panel but reportedly did not respond.", "lang": "en"}
