In the video, people sitting or lying on the ground and getting assistance from a team presumably of emergency workers. At the four-second mark, we can hear a woman cough. The video is circulating with the text \u201cThe Ethiopian Airlines flight \ud83d\udeec\u2708from Italy this evening to Addis Ababa airport. Most of the passengers are infected with the virus, and there is no strength except in God.\u201d\n\nAlt News also noticed that the viral video has been shared on Facebook and WhatsApp.\n\nWe have received several requests to fact-check the video on WhatsApp (+917600011160) and on our official Android application.\n\nAlt News found the viral video on a November 2019 article by Dakaractu, a French TV channel. According to the article, the video is from Blaise Diagne International Airport in Senegal. It is 43 kilometres from Dakar. The video shows a hostage-taking scenario drill. The 15-second viral video has been made from editing the first 43 seconds of the video uploaded by Dakaractu.\n\nAlt News analysed the viral video using InVid, a video verification tool and performed a reverse image search on Google. This led us to a March 13 fact-check report by France 24 which in turn led us to the video uploaded by Dakaractu.\n\nFrance 24 reported, \u201cIt turns out that this video actually shows a training exercise carried out in November 2019 at Blaise Diagne Airport in Dakar where police, gendarmes and members of staff had to practise what they\u2019d do in case of a hostage-taking scenario, according to site Thi\u00e8s Info. The actors taking part in the simulation are all wearing red armbands.\u201d\n\nTherefore, the claim made that video shows people suffering from coronavirus after an \u201cEthiopian Airlines flight landed from Italy this evening to Addis Ababa\u201d is false and misleading.\n\nAs world-wide coronavirus pandemic continues, Alt News has been debunking misinformation related to it circulating online.
