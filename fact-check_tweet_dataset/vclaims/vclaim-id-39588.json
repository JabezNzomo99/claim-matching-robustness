The Prime Minister says he wants to leave on 31 October with a deal. If he does, the UK will be in a transition period to the end of December 2020, during which it will pay into the EU budget anyway.\n\nSo extending the date of Brexit into 2020 won\u2019t, by itself, cost us any more in budget contributions than leaving with a deal in October this year would. Those payments just get taken off the final \u201cdivorce bill\u201d when we leave.\n\nThe government has given no indication that it plans to renegotiate either the financial settlement part of the deal\u2014the divorce bill\u2014or the transition period in the month remaining. That situation hasn\u2019t changed since we first fact checked this a month ago.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re not planning to renegotiate the divorce bill or the transition, then the only way you can claim extending would cost us \u00a31 billion more is if you\u2019re comparing it to leaving with no deal, and refusing to pay the divorce bill.\n\nThe Prime Minister has said that, in the event of no deal, he does plan to not pay the financial settlement (the legal situation of that would be uncertain). But he also repeated in his Today interview that his plan is to leave with a deal.\n\nThe EU has also made clear that it will make the divorce bill a condition of any future trade deal.\n\nYou can see evidence that a short extension wouldn\u2019t cost us more from the fact this has already happened once. Because the UK has stayed a full EU member longer than expected, we have paid budget contributions since 29 March. But all that means is that the divorce bill has gone down by the same amount: the original divorce bill was around \u00a339 billion in March, but this has now gone down to \u00a333 billion. It does not in itself make any difference to how much we pay.\n\nIf the UK had a deal but extended the transition to 2021 or 2022 (which is possible under the current agreement if both sides agree, but is not something the Prime Minister has said he wants to do), then the UK would pay more, as it would continue contributing to the EU budget for those extra years. But we don\u2019t know how much that would be, as the EU hasn\u2019t yet set its budget for then.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s government has publicly said it is committed to getting a deal with the EU, and hasn\u2019t said it wants to renegotiate the divorce bill or the transition. That\u2019s what makes this claim wrong.\n\nIf the government publicly said its policy was to go for no deal, then it could argue that it would try to avoid paying the divorce bill. If they then succeeded in avoiding that bill, this claim might be in the right ballpark (although still not quite right, as BBC Reality Check have pointed out).\n\nBut as it stands, the Prime Minister asserted two contradictory things in the same interview. You can say your plan is to leave with a deal, or you can say an extension will cost \u00a31 billion a month, but you can't say both.", "lang": "en"}
