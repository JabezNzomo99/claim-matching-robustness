This quote about optimism appears to fall in the latter category. (RELATED: Did Winston Churchill Say, \u2018Attitude Is A Little Thing That Makes A Big Difference\u2019?)\n\nTheDCNF searched for the phrase in the complete works of Churchill, as well as the Churchill Archive, a digital database that contains around 800,000 pages of original documents associated with the prime minister, but found no matches.\n\n\u201cThe quote is often attributed to Churchill, but there is no known documentation to show that he ever said or wrote it,\u201d confirmed David Freeman, director of publications at the International Churchill Society, in an email to TheDCNF.\n\nA number of other Churchill experts \u2013 Timothy Riley, Lee Pollock and Richard Langworth \u2013 concurred with Freeman\u2019s assessment of it being falsely attributed, but some added that it sounded like something Churchill would say.\n\n\u201cA nice phrase with a Churchillian ring \u2013 but not attributable to him,\u201d said Pollock, an International Churchill Society trustee, in an email to TheDCNF.\n\nRiley, director and chief curator of the National Churchill Museum, told TheDCNF, \u201cThe rather upbeat sentiment is certainly Churchillian, however, and recalls a quip he made in a 9 November 1954 speech at the Lord Mayor\u2019s Banquet in London.\u201d\n\nLangworth and Pollock also pointed to that same 1954 speech in which Churchill said, \u201cFor myself I am an optimist \u2013 it does not seem to be much use being anything else.\u201d\n\nThe website Quote Investigator traced the origin of the quote to a 1919 speech by Bertram Carr, the then-mayor of Carlisle, England, though elements of the quote appeared earlier. The portion of the speech containing the statement reads as follows:\n\n\u201cThe past history of an old walled city such as this leaves its legacy of ideas antiquated and out of date. These, as expressed in tangible form, are an embarrassment, and hinder the wheels of progress, but we view these, I hope, in the spirit of the optimist to whom every difficulty is an opportunity, and not as the pessimist, to whom every opportunity presents some difficulty.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
