This message, accompanied with an image, was circulated by the Facebook page \u2018We Support Prakash Raj\u2019 on July 13. The page has a following of over 3 lakh people and the post was shared a few thousand times. However, it has now been deleted. The image showed a bearded man held by two jawans.\n\nA Facebook page named \u2018Bahujan Samachar\u2019 also shared the image on July 12, with the caption \u2013 \u201cIs this news true? Many BJP workers have been caught providing confidential information about the country to terrorist organisations. (translated)\u201d To give the image an appearance of genuineness, it has a fake BBC logo on the upper right corner.\n\nThe same photograph has also been circulated with an entirely contrasting narrative, putting the blame on Congress. With the claim \u2013 \u201cKashmiri terrorists captured alive said during interrogation that the Congress government supplied weapons and money to them and asked them to kill Hindus so that India becomes a Muslim state. (translated)\u201d \u2013 the image was shared on the Facebook group \u2018I Am Support Rahul Gandhi Ji\u2026Congress\u2019.\n\nThe photograph is also shared with the aforementioned claim on Twitter as well.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nAs the photograph had text on it, a reverse image search on Google did not display the original picture. However, cropping out the text prior to the search accomplished the needful. Alt News\u2019 investigation of the photograph can be viewed in the video posted below.\n\nWe found the original image on a report dated September 25, 2016, by news outlet Patrika. According to the report, \u201cBSF jawans caught Lashkar-e-taiba terrorist, Abdul Qayoom, when he was crossing the Indian border through Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s Akhnoor. Qayoom told BSF jawans that he is a resident of Sialkot, Pakistan and was being trained in Pakistan\u2019s Mukride, Sheikhupura zilla. During interrogation, Qayoom revealed that he is collecting funds for Lashkar.\u201d Along with Jammu\u2019s local news website News State, several prominent media channels, India TV, NewsX, India Today, News18 and The Quint, also ran the story. None of these reports mentioned that RSS or Congress supplied weapons and money to terrorists. Hence, both the claims stand unsubstantiated.\n\nWe have noticed in the past as well that images are often placed out of context with alternate narratives. Earlier, an image was widely shared as that of both Congress and BJP leaders in Karnataka. Posting an old image with fake narratives by supporters of both parties adversely affects only social media users who might be influenced by the misinformation. It is pertinent that provocative information, circulated without a credible source, is not blindly believed.", "lang": "en"}
