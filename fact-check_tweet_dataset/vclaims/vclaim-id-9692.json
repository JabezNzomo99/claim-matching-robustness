No, the videos that are circulating online that appear to be showing just that are staged with wires.\n\nWe spotted our first flying Samurai fight in a trending tweet (archived here) which we embedded below:\n\nAfter a little bit of searching we already found several copies of the video online on YouTube, here is an example:\n\nAnd another one on Facebook with almost a million-and-a-half views:\n\nThis seems to be the original Japanese version, from March 20, 2018 (archived version here):\n\nFrom analyzing the video it is pretty obvious the whole thing is staged and that the two people are suspended by wires. Observe when they push against each other: they both swing outward, then back, like a pendulum would. The \"jetpacks\" also swing around wildly at some points yet the wearers don't fly off in every direction as you would expect them to do if they were really producing thrust.\n\nThat, and at the end of the video you can actually see the shadow of the crane they used near the bottom of the frame.", "lang": "en"}
