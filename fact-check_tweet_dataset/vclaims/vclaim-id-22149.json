She does compare the bonuses to what \u201ccorporate America received.\u201d Readers can decide for themselves whether the comment is appropriate.\n\nFirst, here\u2019s how the president and vice president characterized Pelosi\u2019s words.\n\nSpeaking at a Republican congressional retreat on Jan. 31, Pence first joked that he comes from the \u201cJoseph A. Bank wing of the West Wing,\u201d buying suits \u201ctwo-for-one.\u201d He went on to say that calling $1,000 bonuses \u201ccrumbs\u201d shows that Pelosi is \u201cout of touch with the American people.\u201d\n\nPence, Feb. 1: It\u2019s just amazing to me that after this tax cut passes, 3 million Americans get another thousand dollars in their pockets, in many cases. She actually described that as \u201ccrumbs.\u201d \u2026 Okay, so if you\u2019re going to say $1,000 is crumbs, you live in a different world than I live in. \u2026 I mean, the truth is, any leader in America that would say $1,000 in the pockets of working families is crumbs is out of touch with the American people.\n\nThe following day, Trump joined the fray.\n\nAmericans for Tax Reform, a group that advocates lower taxes, is keeping a running list of more than 300 companies they say \u201chave announced tax reform bonuses, pay raises, or 401(k) hikes.\u201d That includes an announcement by AT&T that as a result of the tax plan it would \u201cinvest an additional $1 billion in the United States in 2018 and pay a special $1,000 bonus to more than 200,000 AT&T U.S. employees.\u201d\n\nThe president and vice president are referring to a comment Pelosi first made during a weekly press briefing on Jan. 11 after a reporter asked, \u201cA number of companies are attributing the tax bill for being able to give higher wages to their employees as well as being able to give a number of bonuses to their employees. How do you respond to that?\u201d\n\nPelosi first cited the example of AT&T, noting that some of the bonus money paid was already in a union contract. (A spokeswoman for the Communications Workers of America told the Washington Post that the bonuses were not a part of a union contract agreement announced in late December, but \u201care a result of conversations between CWA President Christopher Shelton and AT&T\u2019s [chief executive Randall] Stephenson.\u201d) Pelosi then addressed the tax bill more generally (starting at the 13:53 mark).\n\nShe repeated the \u201ccrumbs\u201d analogy at a town hall meeting at Florida Atlantic University on Jan. 25. Pelosi described a cartoon she saw that shows a mousetrap with \u201ca little piece of cheese on there.\u201d The mouse represents the middle class, she said, and the mouse is surrounded by \u201cfat cats.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the thing,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cYou [middle class] get this little thing and we [corporate \u2018fat cats\u2019] get this big bonanza. You get the crumb, we get the banquet.\u201d\n\nIn a panel discussion hosted by the Washington Post on Jan. 29, Post reporter Karen Tumulty noted that the \u201ccrumbs\u201d comment had already made it into Republican advertising. One example is an ad called \u201cCrumbs\u201d from the self-described \u201ccenter-right\u201d group American Action Network. Tumulty asked Pelosi if, in light of the attacks from Republicans, she had used the word \u201cgoodies\u201d earlier in the interview instead of \u201ccrumbs\u201d (starting at the 52:19 mark).\n\n\u201cEither one,\u201d Pelosi responded. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not a question of $1,000, it\u2019s a question of the billions of dollars, the banquet that they have put for the top 1 percent. Now I don\u2019t begrudge anybody their success, their wealth, their achievement. God bless you for that.\u201d\n\nPelosi then repeated the anecdote about the cartoon with the mousetrap and \u201cthe fat cats just waiting for that middle-class person to take\u201d the piece of cheese.\n\n\u201cThis is unconscionable that they would have 83 percent of the benefits going to the top 1 percent,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cSo that\u2019s my point. It\u2019s not what it is, it\u2019s what it isn\u2019t. And what it is, the banquet of money at the top, the extraction of money, but trying to sell it as something that you should be just be so glad to get. No, our people deserve better.\u201d\n\nAs we have written, Pelosi\u2019s claim that 83 percent of the tax cuts go to the wealthiest 1 percent is cherry-picking. That\u2019s true for 2027, but only because most of the individual income tax changes expire by then. In 2018, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center, the top 1 percent of income earners would get 20.5 percent of the tax cut benefits.\n\nHenry Connelly, a spokesman for Pelosi, told us via email that the president and vice president are taking Pelosi\u2019s words out of context and that the point was that \u201cthese meager one-time bonuses to workers are absolutely dwarfed by the staggering windfalls corporations are pocketing for themselves.\u201d\n\nAs an example, Connelly noted that AT&T\u2019s announcement of a $1,000 bonus for 200,000 employees \u201cis only 6 percent of the $3 billion tax windfall.\u201d (According to Reuters and Fortune, \u201cThe corporate tax overhaul passed by the Trump administration in December helped the telecom book a $19 billion profit in the fourth quarter that will result in $3 billion in extra cash this year.\u201d) Other companies are \u201cpocketing billions of dollars while laying off workers or eliminating benefits for consumers,\u201d he said.\n\nConnelly cited a Reuters/Ipsos poll that found just 2 percent of American adults said they had gotten a raise, bonus or other additional benefits due to the Republican tax law.\n\nAs for Pence\u2019s comment that \u201cany leader in America that would say $1,000 in the pockets of working families is crumbs is out of touch with the American people,\u201d we recall that in 2009, Republican leaders, including Pence, mocked the \u201cMaking Work Pay\u201d tax credit enacted by Democrats as part of the stimulus package as small. The tax credit amounted to $400 a year for individuals and $800 for couples.\n\nThe $800 then \u2014 which has purchasing power today of $934 \u2014 is pretty close to the $1,000 Pence talked about this week. Then-House Republican leader John Boehner called the \u201cMaking Work Pay\u201d tax credit \u201cpaltry.\u201d\n\nAnd here\u2019s what Pence, then the House Republican Conference chairman, said about it from the floor of the House on Feb. 13, 2009: \u201cThe American people are asking, \u2018What\u2019s 13 bucks a week going to do to get the economy moving again for the average American?'\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s how Pence described $13 a week, which is $676 a year ($785 in today\u2019s dollars). Here\u2019s how he described a one-time $1,000 bonus this week: \u201cAnother thousand dollars \u2014 back when our kids were little, another thousand dollars in my pocket at the end of the year, I had a term for that: Christmas. Am I right? Or maybe a little something extra for Mrs. Pence under the tree. Or maybe a new refrigerator, a down payment on a car, or \u2014 this is big stuff.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
