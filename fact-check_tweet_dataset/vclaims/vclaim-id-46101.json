On the Ghana case, I can\u2019t tell. I suspect ECOWAS picked it because we ourselves may have put it out through some form of communication. They were right on the number of cases [in Ghana.] I can\u2019t fault them for the 31 but if I now hear that it is 3, then clearly someone was miscommunicating.\u201d\n\nSeveral online portals including myjoyonline.com, apanews.net and ghanareport.com wrongly reported that 31 coronavirus patients in Ghana had recovered on March 31.\n\nThe various online articles referenced Ghana\u2019s Minister of Health Kwaku Agyeman Manu as the source of the information.\n\nThe video clip of the interview by the health minister examined by GhanaFact showed the minister said:\n\n\u201cWe have the 152 that we have tested positive and taken to care. Thirty (31) of them have been discharged, they just don\u2019t discharge, they keep testing about three or four times for it to show negative before they do the discharge. The discharge is not allowing you to come freely outside, they go visit your home, look at other factors, and try to put you into self-quarantine though you are ok so that they continue monitoring you for the next week or two before they allow you to go free. As at yesterday, there was only one that had been discharged from Kumasi, but I need to check on it as to where these people have actually been discharged. But there are a lot of them in Accra, I need numbers that I don\u2019t have immediately in my hands.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Ghana Health Service in an update on their dedicated website for providing credible information on the coronavirus spread in Ghana categorized the 31 patients as discharged for home management.\n\n\u201cPeople with signs and symptoms initially (it can be severe, mild or moderate) that are no more having symptoms but are not negative yet,\u201d Dr Badu Sarkodie clarified are those that have been discharged and being managed at home pending further tests.\n\nAs of April 6, Ghana had a total of 49 patients who had been discharged for home management [31 of the cases were recorded following the government directive for travelers to be mandatory quarantine in Accra and the 18 others following routine surveillance by health authorities in the country.]\n\nPatients can only be categorized as recovered if \u201cthey have been retested and they are negative,\u201d the Director of Public Health, Ghana Health Service (GHS), Dr Badu Sarkodie stated.\n\nHe noted that the critically ill category is for patients who are on ventilators.\n\nGhana has a total of 287 cases of COVID-19 with five (5) deaths as of April 6.\n\nThe regional distribution of the cases are as follows: Greater Accra Region has most cases (256) followed by the Ashanti Region (18), Northern Region (10), Upper West Region (1), Eastern Region (1) and Upper East Region (1).\n\nOn March 20, the Ghana Health Service rejected similar reports that 8 coronavirus patients in Ghana have recovered.\n\nSocial media including Facebook and Twitter had been buzzing with reports about the recovered patients and at a point, #8Ghanaians was trending as one of the most discussed topics on twitter in Ghana.\n\nRead more- Fact-check: Have 8 coronavirus patients in Ghana recovered?\n\nGhana has recorded 26 new coronavirus cases, taking the total number to 313, Ghana Health Service has confirmed in its latest update.\n\nThe regional distribution of the cases are as follows: Greater Accra Region has most cases (274) followed by the Ashanti Region (25), Northern Region (10), Upper West Region (1), Eastern Region (1), Upper East Region (1) and Central Region (1).\n\nMeanwhile, the West African Health Organization has duly corrected its report on the number of recovered COVID-19 cases in Ghana.", "lang": "en"}
