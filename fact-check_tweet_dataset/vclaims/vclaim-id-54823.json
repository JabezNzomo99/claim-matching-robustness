Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez compared President Donald Trump to Jesus Christ.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound too egregious until you read the entire headline: \"AOC Laughs \u2018Jesus Was A Lot Like Trump, Both Con Artists\u2019\"\n\nThe story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
