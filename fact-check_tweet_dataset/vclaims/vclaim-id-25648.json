It has been shared over 3,000 times.\n\nThis is incorrect. The Polish embassy in London told us that it is not government policy. They added that there are mosques in Poland.\n\nHowever, a similar sentiment\u2014that Poland should refuse to allow Saudi Arabia to build a mosque in Poland until Poland is allowed to build a cathedral in Saudi Arabia\u2014has been expressed by the Polish politician Dominik Tarczy\u0144ski. The Polish factcheckers Demagog found and translated two tweets by Mr Tarczy\u0144ski for us.\n\nIn January 2018, Mr Tarczy\u0144ski wrote: \u201cIf Saudi Arabia wants to pay for a mosque in Poland, then Poland wants to pay for the cathedral in Saudi Arabia. You agree with it? Very well. If not - goodbye!!!\u201d\n\nAnd in August 2018 he wrote: \u201cThey want a mosque in Poland? Ok. We want a cathedral in Saudi Arabia. Respect for religion and symmetry in practicing of faith. NO TO THE ISLAMISATION OF EUROPE!\u201d\u201d\n\nHe also expressed similar views in an interview with Breitbart.", "lang": "en"}
