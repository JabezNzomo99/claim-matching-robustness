It was 327,000 for the year ending March 2016.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics says that \u201cnet migration remains at record levels although the recent trend is broadly flat\u201d. This year\u2019s level hasn\u2019t changed much from last year\u2019s.\n\nAn estimated 633,000 people came to the UK and around 306,000 left. This is around the same as the year before.\n\nLooking at the rate of increase in net migration each year is trickier, because there\u2019s a large margin of error in the figures.\n\nThe largest increase for at least the last 20 years appears to have been in 1998 under Labour, based on the best estimates we have. Net migration rose from around 48,000 in 1997 to almost 140,000 in 1998, a threefold increase.\n\nThe most recent significant increase we\u2019ve seen was between 2013 and 2014 when it increased by around 50%, from 209,000 to 313,000.", "lang": "en"}
