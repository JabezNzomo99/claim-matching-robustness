The ministry said that \"besides providing similar protection /guarantee of Rs.1 lakh to depositors,as it exists today, the rights of uninsured depositors are being placed at an elevated status in the FRDI Bill compared to existing legal arrangements over the unsecured creditors and even Government dues.\"\n\nThis clarification comes after a series of news articles and columns in the media expressing concerns over the safety of deposits in the banking system once the FRDI Bill becomes an Act and is notified by the government. That the government machinery is rattled by the voices against the bill could be gauged from the fact that finance minister Arun Jaitley was also forced to issue a clarification on Wednesday evening on Twitter.\n\nA viral message going around on WhatsApp, apparently written by a Mumbai based CA, titled \"This Tsunami will wipe out your money lying in the Banks\" has also created panic among depositors. PSU bank unions are protesting the move as they have argued that several provisions in the bill are against depositors and will cause an environment of mistrust between the banks and depositors.\n\nIn the last ten days, several messages were circulated on WhatsApp that talks about the bail-in clause in the new bill that will give more teeth to the banks and regulators to use public deposits to make good the losses suffered by way of loans that are never recovered from big borrowers.\n\n1) But first, let us understand what are the provisions today when a bank goes bust?\n\nIn 70-years of independent India history, no PSU bank has gone bust. There are cases of several co-operative banks and private sector banks that have shut down, but the RBI has stepped-in to merge banks on the verge of a collapse with bigger banks. In 2014, public sector bank Canara Bank took over the assets of Amanath Co-operative Bank Ltd, Karnataka\u2019s first scheduled urban co-operative bank. According to this report in the Livemint, while deposits up to Rs 1 lakh were protected under the insurance scheme, any deposits above that had to take a 18% haircut.\n\nIn 2004, Global Trust Bank went bust following high exposure to the stock market in the 2001 Ketan Parekh scam. In a bid to save one million depositors, RBI stepped in and forced the bank to merge with Oriental Bank of Commerce. While the shareholders took a hit as no share swap deal was provided for, the depositors were protected by the merger.\n\nAlso in 2004, Mumbai-based South Indian co-operative bank shut down following nexus between bank employees and politicians resulting in issuance of loans that could never be recovered. The country\u2019s biggest co-operative bank, Saraswat Bank finally took over in 2008 and it was widely reported that depositors would have to forego some part of their unsecured deposits.\n\nBut 45-year old John Samuel whose family had multiple deposits worth Rs 10 lakhs in the bank told BOOM that all they got was Rs 3 lakhs (Rs 1 lakh insured amount for each account) under the deposit insurance scheme. The rest of the unsecured deposits never came back even after Saraswat took over the bank in 2008.\n\n2) How much has DICGC paid to depositors by way of insurance claims?\n\nThe Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation has paid claims amounting to Rs 5,000 cr since 1962 when the Act came into force. The DICGC\u2019s Deposit Insurance Fund has around Rs 80,000 crores that covers 92% of all account holders in the banking system. 30 per cent of the total deposits are insured - in line with international norms that mandate 20-30% of the deposits to be insured. According to DICGC\u2019s annual report of 2016-17, 2125 banks are covered by their scheme.\n\nSources at DICGC point out that 90% of the total insurance claims have come from depositors of co-operative banks since inception.\n\nContrary to popular perception, the FRDI Bill is not an invention of the Narendra Modi government. India is part of the Group of 20 economies (G20) group that have endorsed The Financial Stability Board\u2019s proposal called \u2018Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions\u2019. This proposal has a provision for \u2018bail-in\u2019 to ensure that a country\u2019s economy is not destabilised in the event of a big default by a large bank(s).\n\nThe Financial Stability Board was set up in 2009 post the global financial crisis in 2008 when US had to bail out big banks with taxpayer money to prevent a large scale systemic collapse. The learnings from this catastrophic event for central bankers was to never reach a similar situation where governments have to dip into taxpayers money to bail out banks or allow any institution to become 'too big to fail'.\n\nThe FRDI Bill thus aims to operationalise the setting up of a Resolution Corporation that would help stabilise financial institutions in an orderly manner without taxpayer exposure to loss from solvency support, while ensuring key areas of operations do not suffer.\n\n4) But what about depositors? What has changed for them?\n\nGiven below is the text of the preamble taken from the Financial Stability Board's website.\n\nHere is where the concept of the bail-in comes into force through section 52 of the FRDI Bill. A bail-in is opposite of a bail-out and ensures that in the event of a financial institution's collapse, the creditors and depositors will have to absorb some of the losses.\n\nThe Bill however makes it clear that the bail-in clause will not apply to the insured deposits and several other categories.\n\nTo make it clear, from a depositor's point of view, the risk profile has not changed substantially as it exists today. Post the notification of the Act, a bail-in clause will not apply to the deposits covered by insurance. The Bill is however silent on the upper limit of deposit insurance with divergent views among banking industry experts if the limit of Rs 1 lakh per account will be maintained or whether it will be increased. However most industry watchers are unanimous in their view that there is very little chance the government will reduce the present insurance cover of Rs 1 lakh.\n\nConsidering that the depositors are looking at the bail-in clause with suspicion, the finance ministry has also clarified that the legal provisions in the bill will ensure that the rights of the depositors are considered at an elevated level over unsecured creditors and dues owed to the government.\n\nWhile it is too early to give a clean-chit to the bail-in provisions, banking experts argue that it will be politically suicidal for any government to hurt the interests of depositors, unless in extreme cases where the country's economic ecosystem is on the verge of a collapse.\n\n5) When can the Resolution Corporation go for liquidation of a bank and how are unsecured deposits protected?\n\nAccording to the Bill, the Corporation, in consultation with the respective regulators (e.g. RBI for banks, and IRDA for insurance companies) will specify criteria for classifying service providers based on their risk of failure. The 5 categories are \"Low, Moderate, Material, Imminent and Critical\".\n\nOut of these five categories, the threat to a depositor's unsecured deposits only comes in when a institution is categorised as 'critical'. The Corporation will undertake its resolution by using options which include: (i) transfer of its assets and liabilities to another person, (ii) merger or acquisition, and (iii) liquidation, among others.\n\nProceeds from the sale of assets will be distributed in the following order:\n\u2022 Amount paid by Corporation as deposit insurance to insured depositors\n\u2022 Wages owed to employees other than workmen for the period of twelve months preceding the date of the commencement of liquidation commencement date\n\u2022 Amount to uninsured depositors and other insurance related amounts\n\nWhile in the case of South Indian co-operative bank in 2008, depositors have complained that they did not receive any of their deposits beyond the insured Rs 1 lakh, the FRDI Act has clearly laid out procedures on how the proceeds from the sale of assets should be distributed. Though unsecured deposits will have to take a haircut if the sale of assets are not enough to meet all categories of claims, the remaining amount will be disbursed proportionately within each class of claims as mentioned above.\n\nDespite the entry of several private banks in the country in the last 25 years, a public sector bank is still seen as a highly safe avenue to park your deposits. This is one reason why depositors, especially senior citizens park their savings in PSU banks despite a low interest regime in recent years and better avenues of investment like mutual funds.\n\nBut a bail-in option implicitly holds a depositor who provides low-cost capital to the bank to lend to others, responsible for the losses of the bank along with other unsecured creditors. Also the failure of the bill to quantify the deposits that will come under the insurance scheme has also led to worries among depositors if their interests will actually be protected.\n\nThe government recently provided Rs 2 lakh crore by way of recapitalisation of PSU banks. Total bad loans of the country's 38 listed commercial banks have touched the Rs 10 lakh crore figure at the end of September quarter this year. This amounts to over 12 per cent of the total loans given by the banking industry.\n\nBut here is the catch. PSU banks have over 90 per cent of these non-performing assets on their books. The government has already made its intention clear to consolidate loss making banks with bigger banks in order to improve the financial health of these entities.\n\nUnless these moves are matched by a tight rap on the knuckles of wilful defaulters and accountability of bankers who manage the disbursal of loans made under questionable circumstances, the bail-in clause will always be looked at with suspicion as a case of \"robbing Peter to pay Paul\".", "lang": "en"}
