But Fine is a career federal official who has worked under both parties.\n\u2022 None Trump falsely claimed that Wisconsin Democrats acted at the 11th hour to postpone the state\u2019s April 7 election after he endorsed Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly on April 3. In fact, Trump endorsed Kelly on Jan. 14; the Democratic governor acted because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAsked to explain his decision to replace Fine, Trump started by saying he has been replacing inspectors general from \u201cthe Obama era\u201d when the administration gets \u201creports of bias.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we have \u2026 IGs in from the Obama era,\u201d said Trump, using the common Washington shorthand for inspector general.\n\nWhen he was told Fine wasn\u2019t necessarily linked to President Barack Obama, Trump replied, \u201cMaybe he was from Clinton.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Fine has worked in federal government during both Republican and Democratic administrations and does not have a reputation as a political figure, but rather as an aggressive, independent investigator.\n\nFine became the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general in 2000, under President Bill Clinton, and served in that role until 2011 during both terms of Republican President George W. Bush, finishing up under Obama, like Clinton a Democrat. After four years in private practice, he returned to the federal government under Obama.\n\nFine was named the Defense Department\u2019s principal deputy inspector general on June 1, 2015. He became the Pentagon\u2019s acting inspector general the following January and has spent three-and-a-half years in the Trump administration.\n\nFine, co-captain of Harvard\u2019s basketball team and a 10th-round draft choice of the San Antonio Spurs, served as special counsel to the DOJ inspector general and as director of the special investigations and review unit under Clinton from 1995 to 2000.\n\nFine was named chair of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee on March 30. The committee\u2019s mission is to oversee how money is spent under the recently enacted $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief legislation. The panel\u2019s members must be inspectors general. By dismissing him from the Pentagon IG position, Trump effectively relieved Fine from leading the pandemic spending committee.\n\nOn April 8, House Democrats introduced legislation that would allow Fine, who is now the Pentagon\u2019s principal deputy inspector general, to chair the pandemic review committee.\n\nIn announcing Fine\u2019s appointment, Michael Horowitz, chair of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, said, \u201cMr. Fine is uniquely qualified to lead the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, given his more than 15 years of experience as an Inspector General overseeing large organizations.\u201d\n\nFine\u2019s former boss, James Mattis, who served as defense secretary under Trump, came to Fine\u2019s defense after he was let go.\n\n\u201cMr. Fine is a public servant in the finest tradition of honest, competent governance,\u201d Mattis told Yahoo News in an email. \u201cIn my years of extensive engagement with him as our Department of Defense\u2019s acting Inspector General, he proved to be a leader whose personal and managerial integrity were always of the highest order.\u201d\n\nHorowitz will head a group of inspectors general who will name a new head of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee. Replacing Fine as the Pentagon\u2019s acting inspector general will be Sean O\u2019Donnell, the inspector general at the Environmental Protection Agency, who retains his current position.\n\nAn oversight mechanism for the mammoth coronavirus relief aid package was a key demand from Democrats as the bill was negotiated.\n\nFine is not the only inspector general to come into Trump\u2019s sights recently.\n\nOn April 3, Trump fired Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community inspector general who told Congress about the whistleblower complaint, leading to Trump\u2019s impeachment. And on April 6 Trump raised questions about Principal Deputy Inspector General Christi Grimm of the Department of Health and Human Services because of her report that found shortages and testing delays at hospitals. Like Fine, Grimm is a career government official.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers issued an 11th-hour executive order to move the state\u2019s April 7 election to June because of the coronavirus pandemic. Evers, a Democrat who had been under pressure from his own party for weeks to postpone the election, issued the order on April 6, seeking to delay the election until June 9 or a date that the governor and Republican Legislature could agree upon.\n\nBut the Republican state legislative leaders immediately went to the state Supreme Court, which ruled that the governor\u2019s decision was unconstitutional. That ruling was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, allowing the election to take place on April 7.\n\nDespite complaints of voter suppression, the election went off as planned. The state\u2019s largest city, Milwaukee, had only five of its 180 polling places open, because of health concerns. In Green Bay, only two of its 31 polling places were open.\n\nAt his daily coronavirus press briefing, Trump said the U.S. Supreme Court properly allowed the election to take place as scheduled.\n\nThe president then falsely claimed that Wisconsin Democrats acted at the last minute to postpone the April 7 election not because of safety concerns but because he endorsed state Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly \u201cjust the other day\u201d on social media, referring to an April 3 tweet.\n\nTrump, April 7: Of course they were right. Yeah. Look, the Supreme Court \u2014 well, of course they were right, because what the Democrats wanted \u2014 and you know why this happened. I supported a man named Justice Kelly, who\u2019s \u2014 Daniel Kelly, highly respected justice. And I supported him just the other day \u2014 social media. I know of him. He\u2019s a \u2014 just a, you know, fantastic judge, justice. And I endorsed him. And as soon as I endorsed him, they wanted to move the election. They didn\u2019t want to move the election. As soon as I endorsed him, the Wisconsin Democrats say, \u201cOh, let\u2019s move the election to two months later.\u201d They didn\u2019t mind having the election until I endorsed him, which is very interesting. Now they talk about, \u201cOh, safety, safety.\u201d Well, it was 15 minutes after I put out an endorsement that they said, \u201cWe have to move the election.\u201d They didn\u2019t want to move the election before that.\n\nTrump leaves the impression that his April 3 tweet set in motion a last-minute attempt by Wisconsin Democrats to delay the election. In fact, Democrats were pressuring Evers to postpone the April 7 election for weeks, but the governor resisted and instead urged voters to vote by mail ballots.\n\nFor example, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat, urged the governor on March 24 to hold the election by mail and suspend in-person voting.\n\nAlso, Trump endorsed Kelly on Jan. 14 at a rally, as the state Republican Party noted in a press release a day after the rally.\n\nThe press release included a video of Trump\u2019s endorsement of Kelly.\n\nAt the time, the conservative incumbent justice was running in a three-way nonpartisan primary against two \u201cliberal-leaning challengers,\u201d as the Associated Press described the race. The top two vote-getters in the February primary \u2013 Kelly and Jill Karofsky \u2014 advanced to the general election, which was held on April 7.\n\nThe state GOP supported Kelly, who was also endorsed by the National Rifle Association and state anti-abortion groups. Karofsky, his challenger, was endorsed by the state\u2019s top Democrats, labor unions and women\u2019s groups.\n\nTrump did tweet on April 3 that Kelly has his \u201cComplete Endorsement,\u201d but that was the case back on Jan. 14. There is no evidence that that tweet had anything to do with attempts to move the date of the election.", "lang": "en"}
