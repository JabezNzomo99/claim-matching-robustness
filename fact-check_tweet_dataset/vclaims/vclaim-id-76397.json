But Tapper was right, adopting and implementing Common Core is a state choice, not a federal one.\n\nLet\u2019s review, shall we? (There won\u2019t be a quiz, we promise.)\n\nThe Common Core State Standards are a set of benchmarks for English and math developed after years of discussion between state education departments and private, nonprofit groups.\n\nThe aim was simple: Prepare pupils for college-level work and careers, and to make sure children in different states across the country were all learning the same things in school.\n\nThis goes back to 2007, when the state education officials in the Council of Chief State School Officers discussed creating standards everyone could use. The idea was that kids in, say, California schools would have the same academic goals as children in Alabama.\n\nTwo years later, in 2009, the council and the National Governors Association agreed to create Common Core with input from teachers, parents and education experts. The final guidelines were released in 2010, and states were free to implement them or not.\n\nSo far, 42 states have agreed to use them, with varying degrees of actual support. Minnesota only chose to use the English standards. South Carolina, Indiana and Oklahoma initially agreed to use Common Core, but have since withdrawn.\n\nIn the 2016 presidential race, several GOP candidates have vilified the standards as Trump has, accusing the federal government of overreach in trying to unify school boards under the U.S. Education Department.\n\nWashington has done a bit to encourage states to adopt the standards. President Barack Obama\u2019s signature education program, Race to the Top, gave states that have adopted a set of standards extra points (40 of a possible 500) when competing for grants.\n\nBut the federal government didn\u2019t help create the standards, and has no control over how they\u2019re implemented. Even states that have adopted the standards are still free to set their own curricula.\n\nIn short, it doesn\u2019t matter who the president is, because there\u2019s not much the federal government can do about Common Core.\n\nTrump said Common Core is \"education through Washington D.C.\"\n\nThe education standards for English and math were unveiled in 2010 after state school officials, nonprofits, teachers, parents and experts settled on broad education goals. Washington was not a player in that game, although Obama has given states that have education standards a leg up when applying for grant money.", "lang": "en"}
