THE 02 CAMP IS STARTING TO PANIC because major CLERICS in Indonesia have officially supported JOKOWI.\u201d\n\n\u2018Monas\u2019 refers to the National Monument complex in Central Jakarta. \u2018212 people\u2019 refers to participants of a rally held on December 2, 2016, that demanded the prosecution of then-Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, better known as Ahok, for blasphemy.\n\nThe \u201802 camp\u2019 refers to Widodo\u2019s sole challenger in the coming election, retired general Prabowo Subianto who has ballot number 2.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post: \n\n\n\nThe first image in the misleading post shows a large group of Muslim women wearing green and standing on a stage holding various flags.\n\nThe second photo depicts scores of women, also wearing green, sitting in bleachers.
