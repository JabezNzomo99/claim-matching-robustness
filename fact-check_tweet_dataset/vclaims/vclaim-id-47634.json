Figure that one out.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook).\n\nAre farmers really getting paid less even as retail milk prices go up?\n\nLet\u2019s dive into the data behind this dairy dichotomy.\n\nFor starters, connecting any pair of dots to explain milk pricing is tricky.\n\nThis post referenced liquid milk prices, but only 30% of the milk produced in the U.S. is actually sold in liquid form, said Michael Nepveux, an economist with the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n\n\"While we may see fluid milk flying off grocery shelves and wonder why farmers are having to dump milk, it must be remembered that many of these other products rely heavily on the foodservice and restaurant sector,\" he said.\n\nAnd farmer\u2019s pricing is part of a system that is complex to say the least.\n\nRELATED: Are bottling limitations on liquid milk to blame for milk dumping?\n\nNepveux spent nearly 2,000 words and a handful of charts detailing how pricing works in a primer the Farm Bureau posted in June 2019. It started this way: \"There\u2019s an old adage in the dairy industry that \u2018only five people in the world know how milk is priced in the U.S. \u2013 and four of them are dead.\u2019\"\n\nMilk payments to farmers are influenced by commodity prices, geography and whether the milk is being used for liquid sales, yogurt, cheese, butter, etc.\n\nWe started with Hemsarth himself.\n\nThough the numbers in the post are stated generally, he told PolitiFact Wisconsin he was actually referring only to his own observations. Hemsarth was comparing the price of milk at a grocer in Bloomsburg, Penn., to a picture he took of the milk case a year prior. And he was looking at payments he received for milk he sold compared to a year ago.\n\nGiven the generic wording and wide sharing of this post, most readers likely assumed it referenced some broader dataset, at either the state or national level.\n\nNational data shows the trend Hemsarth highlighted isn\u2019t confined to his corner of the world. Prices paid to farmers have dropped even as retail prices rose.\n\nThe retail price for a gallon of milk averaged $3.27 in April, according to the latest data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That\u2019s up 9.6% from the April 2019 mark ($2.98).\n\nData provided by Dairy Management Inc., a group funded by farmers to help increase sales of dairy products, shows a nearly identical comparison. They reported a national average of $3.11 as of mid-April, compared to $2.83 a year prior. That\u2019s an increase of 9.9%.\n\nA state-level breakdown showed a year-over-year increase in all but one state. The largest jump was in Ohio \u2014 more than 28%. Pennsylvania prices increased 9.5%, and Wisconsin was up 8.7%.\n\nSo, on that part of the equation, the post was in the ballpark \u2014 actually understating the magnitude of the retail increase nationally.\n\nOn the farm payment side, Hemsarth reported a milk payment drop of 23%.\n\nThe Farm Bureau, using U.S. Department of Agriculture data, reported a 21.1% drop in the price paid to farmers in May 2020 compared to May 2019. Nepveux said that is based on Class 1 fluid milk, the highest valued class of milk.\n\nA month earlier, in April, farmers were seeing payments 5.6% higher than the year prior. May is the first month where 2020 was lower than that month in 2019, though prices have fallen each month since December.\n\nMay milk prices dropped because the formula relies heavily on commodity prices, and those dropped sharply in April, Nepveux said.\n\nA viral Facebook post said retail milk prices are up 7.5% from last year while the price paid to farmers dropped 23%.\n\nThe farmer who provided these numbers was just referencing payments for the milk he sold and prices at a local grocer, but the trends are in line with what we see nationally.\n\nNationwide, retail milk prices in April were up nearly 10% from the prior year, while the price paid to farmers dropped sharply in May to about 21% below the prior year.\n\nThe comparison oversimplifies things a bit, since the majority of milk produced in the U.S. isn\u2019t sold in liquid form. And the specific numbers aren\u2019t exactly right. But the general point is.\n\nWe rate this Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
