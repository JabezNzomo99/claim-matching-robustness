Bernie Sanders.\n\nWhile Stein\u2019s campaign made inroads with disgruntled progressives, a counterpoint repeatedly emerged: According to some opinion pieces and rumors, Dr. Stein (an internist with 17 years of field experience) opposes the use of vaccines. The rumor stemmed from an 11 May 2016 Reddit AMA (\u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d) hosted by Stein, in which she fielded questions from site users, during which she was asked \u201cWhat is your campaign\u2019s official stance on vaccines and homeopathic medicine?\u201d\n\nStein responded at length, but she mostly offered her views on the \u201cmedical-industrial complex\u201d rather than addressing the subject of vaccinations and homeopathic medicine. She praised vaccines\u2019 \u201chuge contribution to public health\u201d while tacitly criticizing mandatory vaccination policies and U.S. regulatory agencies:\n\nI don\u2019t know if we have an \u201cofficial\u201d stance, but I can tell you my personal stance at this point. According to the most recent review of vaccination policies across the globe, mandatory vaccination that doesn\u2019t allow for medical exemptions is practically unheard of. In most countries, people trust their regulatory agencies and have very high rates of vaccination through voluntary programs. In the US, however, regulatory agencies are routinely packed with corporate lobbyists and CEOs. So the foxes are guarding the chicken coop as usual in the US. So who wouldn\u2019t be skeptical? I think dropping vaccinations rates that can and must be fixed in order to get at the vaccination issue: the widespread distrust of the medical-industrial complex. Vaccines in general have made a huge contribution to public health. Reducing or eliminating devastating diseases like smallpox and polio. In Canada, where I happen to have some numbers, hundreds of annual death from measles and whooping cough were eliminated after vaccines were introduced. Still, vaccines should be treated like any medical procedure \u2014 each one needs to be tested and regulated by parties that do not have a financial interest in them. In an age when industry lobbyists and CEOs are routinely appointed to key regulatory positions through the notorious revolving door, its no wonder many Americans don\u2019t trust the FDA to be an unbiased source of sound advice. Monsanto lobbyists and CEOs like Michael Taylor, former high-ranking DEA official, should not decide what food is safe for you to eat. Same goes for vaccines and pharmaceuticals. We need to take the corporate influence out of government so people will trust our health authorities, and the rest of the government for that matter. End the revolving door. Appoint qualified professionals without a financial interest in the product being regulated. Create public funding of elections to stop the buying of elections by corporations and the super-rich.\n\nWe contacted Dr. Jill Stein\u2019s campaign for clarification on her position regarding vaccinations, and while we did not receive an immediate response, Stein shared our article and tweeted to proclaim that \u201cof course I support vaccinations\u201d:\n\nOn 30 July 2016, we received a response to our query from Press Director Meleiza Figueroa, who provided a statement from Dr. Stein to clarify her stance on vaccines:\n\nNonetheless, David Weigel noted in the Washington Post that Dr. Stein\u2019s statements echo language used by vaccination opponents, and that her call for vaccines \u201cto be tested and regulated by parties that do not have a financial interest in them\u201d may be misplaced:\n\nDr. Stein\u2019s stated position is that she \u201csupports vaccinations\u201d and acknowledges that \u201cwe have a real compelling need for vaccinations,\u201d so it\u2019s not true to say that she is on record as holding an anti-vaccination political position. However, her somewhat equivocal statements surrounding that issue allow for a fair bit of leeway and interpretation \u2014 many others who proclaim to \u201csupport vaccinations\u201d in concept effectively undercut their positions by raising objections to the \u201cvaccination process\u201d or the \u201cvaccination industry.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
