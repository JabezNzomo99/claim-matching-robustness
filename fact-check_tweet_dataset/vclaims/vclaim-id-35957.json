It was said, however, by the fictional Thoreau in the play \u201cThe Night Thoreau Spent in Jail.\u201d\n\nAn essayist and poet, Thoreau was a prominent member of the transcendentalist movement that emphasized intuitive, spiritual thinking over scientific, empirical thinking. He is perhaps best known for his 1854 book \u201cWalden,\u201d which is widely considered a literary classic.\n\nAlthough Thoreau discussed authentic self-expression in some of his works, he did not write the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. The Walden Woods Project, a Massachusetts non-profit dedicated to preserving Thoreau\u2019s legacy and the Walden Woods, includes the saying on its \u201cMis-Quotations\u201d list.\n\nFurthermore, the Daily Caller found no record of the quote in any collections of his books, essays, poems or letters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very common misattribution,\u201d confirmed Thoreau Institute Library Curator Jeffrey Cramer in an email to the Caller. (RELATED: Did Oscar Wilde Say, \u2018Be Yourself; Everyone Else Is Already Taken\u2019?)\n\n\u201cThis quote isn\u2019t by Thoreau himself,\u201d said University of Notre Dame professor Laura Dassow Walls in an email to the Caller, \u201cbut is spoken [by] the character of Thoreau in the 1970 play, \u2018The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail,\u2019 by Robert Edwin Lee and Jerome Lawrence.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the quote comes from Lee and Lawrence\u2019s play \u201cThe Night Thoreau Spent in Jail,\u201d uttered by the Thoreau character. However, the lines were imagined by the play\u2019s writers, not the historical figure of Thoreau that this character is based on.", "lang": "en"}
