Yet Indian Govt continues to alienate Kashmir. Unarmed men, women, children being attacked by Indian Army. Inhumane! #Kashmir\u201d\n\nThe archived tweet can be accessed here.\n\nThe video documents scenes of violent protest amid a standoff between stonepelters and security personnel.\n\nThe bulletin also has a ticker running below in Urdu, which roughly translates to, \"After the call of the Hurriyat leaders' strike, the intensity of protesters has risen in occupied Kashmir.\"\n\nInterestingly, a logo of JK News and a dateline of August 23, 2019 is mentioned in the bulletin, to imply that the video must have been shot recently. Furthermore, there is also a Facebook Live icon on the top left of the footage, that can be visible throughout the clip.\n\nBOOM was able to ascertain that the premises of the two protests are different.\n\nBOOM broke the video into its key frames and performed a keyword search for both the videos, which have been added together to compose a bulletin.\n\nThe first part of the bulletin from 0 to 1:29 second mark is the footage of heavy stone pelting that occurred in the HMT area of Srinagar in June 22, 2018. The same video was uploaded to YouTube in October last year.\n\nBelow is a frame comparison of the videos tweeted by PTI and YouTube video BOOM found.\n\nThe same video, shot from a different location, was uploaded by Rising Kashmir.\n\nClashes erupted in Srinagar's HMT area in June last year, after after Islamic State Jammu Kashmir (ISJK) chief Dawood Salafi was killed in a gunfight with forces in Srigufwara area of south Kashmir\u2019s Anantnag district.\n\nThe later half of the video are visuals of stone pelting that occurred in Srinagar on July 2017, 'following the death of Kashmiri rebel Sajad Ahmed', reported the international news agency AP.\n\nPolice fired tear gases and pellet guns on people carrying the body of Sajad Ahmed.\n\nBOOM also reached out to the admin of JK News Channel, the logo of which has been used in the video. The article will be updated as and when we get a response.\n\nSince August 5, sporadic protests have taken place in Kashmir. While internet services remain suspended in Kashmir, images and videos of protest being shared online have often been old. BOOM has debunked various pieces of misinformation surrounding the same.", "lang": "en"}
