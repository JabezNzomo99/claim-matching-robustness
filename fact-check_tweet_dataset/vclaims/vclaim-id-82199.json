House Democrats, Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Bob McDonald and some veterans groups opposed the bill, saying it inadequately pays for veterans\u2019 medical needs and construction projects that could help expand their access to care. The White House has threatened to veto the measure.\n\nFor the medical-services portion of the veterans\u2019 health budget, the president\u2019s budget requested $1.1 billion over what already was enacted for fiscal 2016. The appropriations bill agreed to 86 percent of that additional request. The House Appropriations Committee said the request was \u201cunusually large\u201d and that the need likely will decrease after a pending VA policy change.\n\nThe committee said it has \u201ccontinuing concern over VA\u2019s ability to effectively manage the cost of non-VA care,\u201d because it is under-utilizing its community-care program. If VA used that program more, it could decrease costs and improve the convenience of care for patients, it said.\n\nThe president\u2019s budget asked for double the current funding for construction projects, but the committee rejected it. McDonald said the House bill would halt major medical center projects and cemetery expansion efforts. But the committee said it is \u201cseriously disturbed\u201d by recent findings of mismanagement of a VA construction project in Colorado that has run more than $1 billion over budget.\n\nThe $1.4 billion overall shortfall would cause veterans to suffer, according to McDonald. Pelosi was citing McDonald\u2019s presentation to the House Democratic Caucus from April 29, 2015, in which McDonald used the $690 million and 70,000 veterans figures. The VA arrived at the 70,000 figure by estimating an annual cost of health care per veteran at $9,831 for fiscal 2016.\n\nYet, in addition to this appropriations bill, VA now has access to an extraordinary amount of money to make sure veterans get medical care. In August 2014, Congress passed the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act \u2014 a bipartisan response to the scandal that erupted over veterans\u2019 delayed access to medical care at VA facilities across the country.\n\nThat legislation allowed VA to spend $5 billion to improve infrastructure and hire physicians and medical staff. Another $10 billion allowed the agency to pay for veterans to get medical care outside of the system if they live far away from a VA facility or if they wait longer than 30 days for an appointment. This is separate from the House appropriations bill. (There is a three-year sunset on the $10 billion portion.)\n\nDrew Hammill, Pelosi\u2019s spokesman, wrote to The Fact Checker that the House bill \u201cinadequately addresses the needs of our nation\u2019s veterans as the VFW, American Legion and other advocacy groups noted in letters to Congress. The leader made clear she was referencing this as cut vis-\u00e0-vis the president\u2019s budget request. The VA has noted that they have done an extensive analysis of what the needs of our veterans are. This bill fails to address that need.\u201d\n\nThe VA issued a statement to The Fact Checker that the appropriations bill is independent of the funding made available through the Choice Act, and that \u201cit is illustrative of the magnitude of the cut to VA\u2019s regular budget in the House-passed 2016 funding bill, compared to the president\u2019s budget.\u201d\n\nTo call the funding in the House bill a \u201ccut\u201d is not accurate. The president\u2019s budget proposal is just that: a proposal. The House bill is, indeed, lower than what the president and VA proposed, and what many veterans groups hoped to see. But the House appropriations bill increased VA\u2019s total budget and its discretionary spending over fiscal 2015 levels. This is more money than the agency ever has had, and the total VA funding has grown by nearly 73 percent since 2009. It is also difficult to see how rescissions of bonuses or pay raises would lead to fewer veterans receiving care.\n\nAside from this bill, VA also has access to billions of additional dollars that was allotted to deal with its access-to-care problems. The agency has more than $14 billion left to spend. Congress passed the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act specifically to allow veterans to cut through bureaucracy. The argument that 70,000 fewer veterans would access medical care because of the House appropriations bill is perplexing and clearly an exaggeration.", "lang": "en"}
