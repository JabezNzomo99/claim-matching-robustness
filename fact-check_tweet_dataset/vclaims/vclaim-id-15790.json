Today in Nagpur.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Youth Congress\u2019 tweet can be viewed below and its archived version here.\n\nThe image was also tweeted by Vinayak Dalmia, the spokesperson of the party.\n\nBOOM analysed the four images and observed that one of the images in the set was grainier than the rest. The same image also had a watermark of Nagpur Today, a Nagpur based news portal and publication house.\n\n\n\nA keyword search with Congress Rally and Nagpur Today, custom ranged with time, led us to an article published by Nagpur Today on April 11, 2016. The photo was published with an article about Sonia and Rahul Gandhi's rally from 2016 in Nagpur.\n\nBOOM reached out to Neelabh Kumar, the news editor of Nagpur Today, who confirmed that the image was taken by their in-house photographer Sandeep Burghate in 2016. \u201cWe are aware of the image that is doing the rounds on several social media platforms. We would want to state that the image belongs to Nagpur Today and had been shot in 2016 and not in the recent rally as is being claimed,\u201d Kumar said.\n\nThe same photo was tweeted by Gaurav Pandhi a Congress supporter on April 11, 2016 a day after the rally held by Sonia and Rahul Gandhi in Nagpur.", "lang": "en"}
