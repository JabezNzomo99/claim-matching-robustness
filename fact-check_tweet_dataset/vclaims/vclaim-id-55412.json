According to Asianet News, Mursan police were conducting a vehicle check near Karwan river when two youth riding a motorcycle were asked to halt for allegedly not wearing helmets. The youth sped away and stopped the bike at a distance. An enraged cop allegedly hit one of the youth on his head with a baton, rendering him unconscious. He was later taken to the hospital.\n\nDainik Bhaskar, however, reports the incident differently. As per the media outlet, the youth were asked to stop because they were riding a bike without a number plate. Phool Singh, a resident of Rajasthan, was travelling with his brother Anubhav when cops stopped him at Karwan river bridge. When the duo tried to speed away, SI Akhand Upadhayay allegedly thrashed Singh with a baton and rendered him unconscious.\n\nSingh was later admitted to the hospital and sent home after recovery, per Dainik Bhaskar. This suggests that social media claims alleging that the youth died on the spot are incorrect.\n\nAccording to both the above-mentioned reports, the police denied hitting the youth with a baton. According to Asianet News, SSP Siddharth Verma said, \u201cInitial investigation has found that the two youth were on a bike. They were asked to stop during checking because they were riding without helmets. They first halted the bike but later tried to speed away. A constable held the bike from behind in order to stop it. This caused the bike to fall and the youth sustained injuries. He was later admitted to the hospital. The bike also did not have a number plate and the youth was inebriated. An investigation is underway. If any policeman is found guilty, necessary actions will be taken.\u201d (Translated from Hindi)\n\nA different version of SSP Verma\u2019s statement was given by Dainik Bhaskar. He said that the police investigation found the allegation of the use of a baton false and further added that the motorcycle toppled over on a speed breaker when the duo tried to flee. He also said that a medical examination later found the rider to be under the influence of alcohol.\n\nYet another version was stated by the police on Twitter. In a reply to a user, UP police reiterated that the rider was drunk and he wasn\u2019t hit with a baton. The alleged newspaper clipping shared by the police, however, gave further details which do not match with the previous statements. According to the purported clipping, the bike slipped and fell which caused the injury. It adds that passers-by are witnesses to the motorcycle slipping when the duo tried to flee and that the police did not hit the youth with a baton.\n\nIn the video, however, passers-by can be heard saying, \u201c\u0938\u093f\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0921\u0902\u0921\u093e \u092e\u093e\u0930\u094b \u091a\u0932\u0924\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 (Hit on the head while the bike was running.)\u201d This is repeated multiple times throughout the video.\n\nThe clip does not represent police atrocity after the enforcement of MVA 2019. Furthermore, contrary to social media claims, the youth did not succumb to his injuries as claimed on social media. The incident, however, did occur although specific details about the cause of wounds cannot be conclusively established due to a mismatch in police statements across media reports.", "lang": "en"}
