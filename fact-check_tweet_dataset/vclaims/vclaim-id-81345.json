It frequently is called the \u201cIRS code\u201d or \u201cIRS tax code\u201d by politicians and media, especially when describing legislative changes to tax laws. Those terms often are used in conjunction with rhetoric calling for Congress to \u201cabolish the IRS\u201d and get rid of the \u201cIRS code\u201d or \u201cIRS tax code.\u201d\n\nSuch usage dates to the late 1990s, and there are too many examples to count. Our review of news articles just in the past five years showed that the phrase \u201cIRS tax code\u201d was used in more than 600 articles in local, regional and national news coverage.\n\nThe problem is that the phrase implies the Internal Revenue Service is responsible for the way the code is written, according to some tax law experts. When members of Congress use it, lawmakers are misleading the public as if IRS solely is responsible for it, they say.\n\nThe term came about during tax policy debates and contentious IRS hearings in 1997, according to experts. In fall 1997, the anti-tax wing of the GOP \u201cturned against\u201d the IRS, wrote Sheldon Pollack in \u201cThe Politics of Taxation.\u201d \u201cTapping what they perceived to be a strong undercurrent of antitax sentiment, Republican leaders focused popular discontent with the tax laws on the IRS,\u201d Pollack wrote. On the campaign trail, Republican politicians began blaming the IRS for the excessive complexity of the tax laws and the burden of taxation, and dubbed the code the \u201cIRS code.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this were an isolated occurrence (for example, if someone who was unfamiliar with tax matters used the term at a hearing), we\u2019d take no notice,\u201d Bell wrote. \u201cBut over the past year, several members of Congress \u2014 including some taxwriters \u2014 and even a couple of courts have made reference to the nonexistent \u2018IRS Code.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe article lists many lawmakers who had used the phrase, especially in terms of \u201cabolishing\u201d the IRS, that the \u201cIRS code\u201d is much longer than the Bible, and how complex the \u201cIRS code\u201d is. (It appears the political talking points have not changed in 18 years.) Among them: then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), then-Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss)., former lawmakers Don Nickles (R-Okla.), Jennifer Dunn (R-Wash.), Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), and more.\n\nBell wrote that members of Congress, especially ones on taxwriting committees, should know better than to call it the \u201cIRS code.\u201d The phrase implies that it belongs to the IRS, that the IRS is responsible for it, and that IRS wrote it, Bell wrote. \u201cNone of that, of course, is true.\u201d\n\nThe term was used occasionally before the 1997 hearings, said Edward Kleinbard, University of Southern California law professor and former Joint Committee on Taxation chief of staff. But then it was picked up by other members of Congress and repeated in publications, testimonies and news coverage. And now, it\u2019s used inadvertently by many, he said.\n\nAndy Grewal, University of Iowa law professor, noted that a search of pre-1996 federal court cases showed 200 judicial uses of the \u201cIRS code,\u201d starting in 1968. Grewal sees the use of the term is sloppy, but believes it may not be as nefarious as some portray. After all, the IRS does administer the code.\n\nPhil Novack, Cruz\u2019s spokesman, called it a \u201cdistinction without a difference.\u201d The senator \u201ccalls it the \u2018IRS Code\u2019 because that is what it is. Its name is literally the Internal Revenue Code. Some may disagree with that label, but that does not change the fact about what it is called.\u201d\n\nWe will not make a judgment call on whether the term is misleading or not. Whether you call it the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS code or the IRS tax code, it\u2019s all referring to the same text. Even though the term was used prior to 1997, it clearly had picked up enough steam that year. Tax law experts began to notice it, and found it was used most commonly in connection with criticisms of the IRS or taxation in general.\n\nThis is a reminder that some of the most commonly used words in political lexicon can have powerful implications. Politicians and those in the media \u2013 including The Fact Checker \u2013 should consider these factors when repeating such a phrase, and beware that it can carry unintended implications.", "lang": "en"}
