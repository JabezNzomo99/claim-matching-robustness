The PM informed that the details of the plan would be shared by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman the next day. Since then Sitharaman has made an announcement in three tranches. The Financial Express reported live updates of the third tranche on May 15.\n\nA WhatsApp text claims that labourers who have been working between 1990-2020 will get Rs 1.2 lakhs from the Ministry of Labour and Employment (MLE). The message is followed by a suspicious link \u2018https://lI.IlllI.uno\u2019 however the text includes a preview of the official website of MLE \u2014 labour.gov.in. The preview reads, \u201cMinistry of Labour and Employment: Benefits available obtain \u20b9120000.\u201d\n\nAlt News received several requests to fact-check this on WhatsApp (+917600011160) and on our official Android application.\n\nAlt News opened the suspicious link \u2018https://lI.IlllI.uno\u2019 and it directed to another domain \u2018labour.rebajas.live\u2019. Both websites are no longer accessible.\n\nA Twitter user who tagged MLE to authenticate the message has attached the screenshots of the website when it was accessible.\n\nOn May 14, the Press Information Bureau (PIB) debunked the viral WhatsApp text on Twitter. \u201cThere is no such announcement by Govt. of India. Beware of such fraudulent websites,\u201d reads the tweet.\n\nAlt News found at least three variants of the viral WhatsApp text from 2019. According to them, the Government of Singapore, Malaysia, and Canada were giving similar benefits. The Strait Times reported that WhatsApp text claiming workers can claim $2,800 from the government was debunked the Ministry of Manpower, Singapore.\n\nLast year, Alt News published a report debunking the social media claim that Employees\u2019 Provident Fund is giving Rs 80,000 as benefits.", "lang": "en"}
