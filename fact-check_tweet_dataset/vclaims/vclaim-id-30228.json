As the popularity of these posts and pages grows, so do the opportunities to scam social media users. For instance, a fraudster may edit a post to include a malware link or request personal information \u2014 or, if the audience has grown large enough, change the page\u2019s focus entirely and start selling spammy products.\n\nIn January 2020, the popular grocery chain Aldi was used in one such scam. A fraudulent post from a page resembling the official Aldi USA Facebook page promised everyone who shared or commented on it the chance to win a year\u2019s worth of free groceries:\n\nThis post did not originate with the official Aldi Facebook page, and the grocery chain is not giving away a year of free groceries to any Facebook fans who like, comment, or share this post.\n\nFor starters, the post does not appear on the official Aldi USA Facebook page, nor on any of the store\u2019s other social media pages. We also checked the grocery chain\u2019s website for any mention of a grocery giveaway, but this too-good-to-be-true deal is not listed among Aldi\u2019s specials.\n\nLastly, this fraudulent Facebook post follows the same script of dozens of other like-farming scams: It makes a big promise (a year of free groceries) in order to entice readers, then makes a simple request (to comment or share) to ensure that this post reaches a larger audience. The post is also light on specifics (11 pm in what time zone? And what Sunday?) and originated on a page unaffiliated with the grocery chain.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Better Business Bureau described like-farming scams:\n\nWhat Exactly is Like-Farming? Like-farming on Facebook is a technique in which scammers create an eye-catching post designed to get many likes and shares. Posts often give people emotional reasons to click, like, and share, such as adorable animals, sick children, or political messages. For example, some posts claim that Facebook will donate money for every comment or share. As more people like and share the post, it appears in more news feeds, giving the post a much wider audience. Why Do Scammers \u201cFarm\u201d for Likes? As with many scams, like-farming has several different aims. When scammers ask you to \u201cregister\u201d in order to win a free iPad or a free flight, this is a way to steal your personal information. Other versions can be more complex. Often, the post itself is initially harmless \u2013 albeit completely fictional. But when the scammer collects enough likes and shares, they will edit the post and add something malicious. That\u2019s often a link to a website that downloads malware to your machine. Other times, once scammers reach their target number of likes, they strip the page\u2019s original content and use it to promote spammy products. They may also resell the page on the black market. These buyers can use it to spam followers or harvest the information Facebook provides.\n\nThis is not the first time that Aldi has been used for this type of scam. In 2015 (and again in 2019), a scam post offering free Aldi coupons was circulated on social media.\n\nWe reached out to Aldi for more details and will update this article if more information becomes available.", "lang": "en"}
