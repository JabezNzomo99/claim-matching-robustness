That\u2019s around the same level as it was in 2012/13 (though it did drop in the intervening years).\n\nIf you look at all admissions where the primary or secondary diagnosis was obesity then the number has doubled in the last four years. The figure increased from 292,000 in 2012/13 to 617,000 in 2016/17.\n\nBut having a secondary diagnosis of obesity doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that\u2019s what the patient has been admitted to hospital for.\n\nAccording to NHS Digital \u201cA secondary diagnosis of obesity does not necessarily indicate obesity as a contributing factor for the admission, but may instead indicate that obesity is a factor relevant to a patient\u2019s episode of care\u201d.\n\nSo it is not correct that these are all admissions \u201cfor obesity\u201d, but rather where obesity was a factor in some way relevant to the patient\u2019s care.\n\nThese admissions don\u2019t represent individual patients, as one patient may be admitted several times in a year. It also only counts patients once their period of hospital admission has ended.\n\nNHS Digital also say that the way the figures are collected has improved over this period which may be reflected in the increasing numbers.\n\n26% of adults in the England are obese, according to a 2016 health survey\n\nThe Health Survey for England 2016, interviewed 8,000 adults and 2,000 children and their heights and weights were measured to calculate their BMI. The results were then weighted to be representative of the wider population.\n\nBMI was used to indicate whether people were underweight, a healthy weight, overweight, obese or very obese.\n\n26% of men and 27% of women were found to be in the obese category, with BMIs over 30. This means they were either obese, or morbidly obese if they had a BMI over 40.\n\nIn their report, NHS Digital said that the \u201cproportion of adults who were obese has been similar since 2010\u201d at around one quarter.", "lang": "en"}
