A popular internet rumor that made the rounds in June 2020 claimed the former first lady completed her research doctorate in law after U.S. President Barack Obama left office and their daughters went to college.\n\nSnopes readers asked us if this was true, and we found no evidence that she completed coursework for a Ph.D.\n\nWe know that Obama graduated from Harvard Law School in 1988 with a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree, which is a professional degree required to practice law in the United States. One usually has to have a J.D. in order to get a Ph.D in law \u2014 also known as a research doctorate \u2014 which mainly prepares students for careers as legal scholars and teachers.\n\nObama was a practicing lawyer in the late 1980s and early \u201990s, but in her 2018 book \u201cBecoming,\u201d she famously recounted hating the work. She told Oprah Winfrey:\n\nBased on this recollection, it seems highly unlikely that Obama would have gone back to study more law.\n\nShe did, however, receive a number of honorary doctorate degrees, which are given to outstanding non-students. In 2013, while still first lady, Obama received an Honorary Doctorate of Law from Bowie State University. Such degrees are recognition of achievement, don\u2019t require completing coursework, and recipients don\u2019t really use them for anything, mainly because such people are already so accomplished.\n\nSince departing the White House in 2017, she has written a memoir, received an honorary induction into the Academy of Arts and Sciences, and signed a production deal with Netflix.\n\nIn sum, while Obama has indeed received degrees in law, including an honorary doctorate, she did not actively pursue or complete coursework for a Ph.D. in law. We thus rate this claim \u201cMostly False.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
