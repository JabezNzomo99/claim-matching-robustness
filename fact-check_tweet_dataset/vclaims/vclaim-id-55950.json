Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Hong Kong approved a new map that includes China-occupied regions under India\u2019s territory. Fact: Hong Kong Legislative council has not approved any such map including China-occupied regions as part of India. The photos shown in the post were related to the \u2018National Anthem ordinance\u2019 passed by the legislative council of Hong Kong. In the photo, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng is seen signing that ordinance. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for the information with the keywords, It is found that the Hong Kong Legislative Council has not approved any such map including China-occupied regions in India\u2019s territory. Hong Kong is a metropolitan area that is a Special Administrative Region of the People\u2019s Republic of China. More information about the Hong Kong legislative council could be seen here.\n\nOn reverse image search, similar photos as those shared in the post were found in a Press Release of Hong Kong Government with the title \u2018CE signs National Anthem Ordinance\u2019. This Ordinance was introduced to promote and protect China\u2019s National Anthem in Hong Kong. Complete information about this ordinance could be seen here. Nothing related to India\u2019s map was mentioned in this Ordinance.\n\nThe tweet shown in the post was not posted by the Carry Lam Cheng (Chief Executive of Hong Kong). It\u2019s a fake account created in the name of Carry Lam Cheng (@carrylamcheng). Carry Lam Cheng doesn\u2019t have an official Twitter account. In 2014, the same fake account created in the name of Carry Lam, posted tweets from India. Except for the tweets posted by this fake account in recent times, all the other posts are related to India. In 2014, a reply to the tweet posted from this account showed the profile name as \u2018@dreamer_patel7\u2019. Also, the official website of Chief Executive of Hong Kong, shared only the Facebook and Instagram accounts links of Carry Lam Chieng.\n\nTo sum it up, Hong Kong has not approved any map that includes China-occupied regions as part of India under Union Territory Ladakh.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
