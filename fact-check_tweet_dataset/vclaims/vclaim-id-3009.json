The former first lady hasn\u2019t said anything like that publicly.\n\nAccording to data from the not-for-profit organization Gun Violence Archive, there were 30 mass shootings in the United States between the beginning of the year and Feb. 14 \u2014 when Nikolas Cruz was arrested for killing 17 students at his former high school in Parkland, Florida.\n\nThat organization classifies any incident that involves four or more people being shot or killed, not including the shooter, as a mass shooting. According to its statistics, the 2018 figure is very close to the average of 29.2 mass shootings by Feb. 14 over the past five years. (In 2017, there had been 43 mass shootings by that date; in 2016 there had been 22; in 2015, 29; and in 2014, 22.)\n\nRegardless of how many shootings there have been, former First Lady Michelle Obama hasn\u2019t recently blamed Trump for them.\n\nBut a made-up story circulating on Facebook is claiming that she has. Users of the social media site rightly flagged it as potentially false.\n\nThe headline on the false story says: \u201cMichelle Obama: \u2018Florida Shooting Is Clearly Trump\u2019s Fault, These Shootings Are Happening Constantly Since He Became Our President. We Must Protect Our Children From This Tyrant.\u2018\u201d\n\nThe only public comment that Obama has made about the recent shooting is retweeting a post from Barack Obama\u2019s Twitter account:\n\nThe false story claims that Michelle Obama made the remark during the \u201cObama Foundation worldwide event.\u201d But the Obama Foundation has had no events since Feb. 14 and doesn\u2019t appear to have ever hosted an event by that name.\n\nThe foundation did have a \u201csummit\u201d last fall, and the rest of the viral story is comprised of quotes taken from a public interview that Obama gave during that summit.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cMichelle Obama: \u2018Florida Shooting Is Clearly Trump\u2019s Fault, These Shootings Are Happening Constantly Since He Became Our President.We Must Protect Our Children From This Tyrant.'\u201d ustoday.website. 16 Feb 2018.", "lang": "en"}
