Even for a Washington insider, it takes a special kind of dishonesty to publicly oppose Obamacare while personally profiting from it.\"\n\nGiven Jolly\u2019s stance to repeal the Affordable Care Act, it would indeed be awkward if he made $80,000 lobbying for the law. We decided to check the paperwork on this one.\n\nJolly worked as an aide and general counsel for the late U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young for more than a decade before becoming a lobbyist in 2007 for Washington firm Van Scoyoc Associates. He then lobbied through his own firm, Three Bridges Advisors, from 2011 until earlier this year, when he de-registered as a lobbyist to run for Young\u2019s vacant House seat.\n\nLobbyists are required by law to disclose their clients, and Jolly listed work as a consultant for Faneuil in statements filed Dec. 2. The form requires candidates to list all positions both paid and unpaid in the current calendar year and the two years prior. Faneuil is a Virginia company that specializes in \"business processing solutions,\" such as running call centers, managing data entry or billing and providing customer service by phone or email.\n\nPeters couldn\u2019t provide specifics to link Jolly to lobbying in connection with the health care law, while Jolly\u2019s team said he worked for the company to advocate for \"transportation interests in Florida.\" Faneuil provides toll collectors and other employees under a staffing contract with the Florida Department of Transportation.\n\nFaneuil general counsel Alden J. Eldredge also said Jolly didn\u2019t work on matters dealing with the health care law.\n\nFaneuil employed Jolly\u2019s Three Bridges Advisors firm in the Sunshine State from May to December 2012. In March 2013, Faneuil announced it had been selected to operate a Spokane, Wash., call center for the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, Washington Healthplanfinder. The center began taking calls for enrollment assistance on Oct. 1.\n\nNeither Jolly nor Faneuil would further specify Jolly\u2019s role with the company, although Jolly\u2019s campaign emphasized that the Washington call center contract wasn\u2019t awarded to Faneuil until March 2013, when Jolly was no longer being paid.\n\nPeters didn\u2019t connect her own dots in the ensuing days. The following week, a flier appeared throughout Pinellas County mailboxes with slightly different wording:\n\n\"Last year, Washington lobbyist Jolly was paid at least $80,000 to represent a D.C.-area company that signs up people for Obamacare,\" it reads. \"Yet, as a candidate, he continues to claim he\u2019s opposed to Obamacare \u2026 and makes false attacks against Kathleen Peters for her position.\"\n\nThat last part is aimed at Jolly\u2019s previous assertion that Peters was not clearly in favor of repealing the Affordable Care Act. PolitiFact Florida checked a previous mailer from Jolly\u2019s campaign that alleged Peters \"refuses to \u2018take a stand\u2019 to repeal Obamacare.\" We found that claim .\n\nOtherwise, the mailer avoids saying specifically that Jolly had been \"lobbying for government-run health care,\" as she said in the press conference.\n\nPeters said at a press conference that Jolly was guilty of \"lobbying for government-run health care just last year.\" She was attempting to link her opponent with Faneuil, a company that has worked with Washington state to operate a health care exchange.\n\nBoth Jolly and Faneuil say Jolly wasn\u2019t lobbying on health care, and we didn\u2019t find specific evidence to show that he worked on that project. Peters later backed off the accusation, changing the wording in a mailer to point out Jolly was being paid by a company that also is paid for operating an Obamacare health exchange.\n\nPeters didn\u2019t find any specific evidence linking Jolly to the Washington call center project, and we didn\u2019t find anything more in our own review of the public records. Meanwhile, the Jolly campaign offers a plausible explanation for what kind of work he did for the company. Due to a lack of evidence, we rate Peters\u2019 statement False.", "lang": "en"}
