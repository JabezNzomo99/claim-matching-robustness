Despite these orders, many locales saw people gathering at beaches and for religious events. This left officials in a bit of conundrum: How do you make sure a population obeys a self-quarantine order?\n\nAccording to an internet rumor, Russia solved the problem by releasing 500 lions.\n\nBut Russian President Vladimir Putin did no such thing.\n\nWhile the above-displayed image does not show a real \u201cbreaking news\u201d alert, it does feature a real image of a lion roaming a public street. This image comes from an incident in 2016 in which a large lion was spotted roaming the streets in Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nThe New York Post reported in April 2016:\n\nJohannesburg residents were startled to discover Columbus the lion roaming through their concrete jungle this week. The big cat was wandering the streets of the South African city after being released by a local film company that borrowed him from a nearby lion park. According to the Johannesburg Roads Agency, the filming had not been approved and the film company took a risk by springing the lion without getting the OK to close several roads.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who created the fake news graphic above. Some versions of this image carried a watermark for Break Your Own News, a website that allows users to generate their own news headlines.\n\nAccording to BBC News, Putin has yet to announce any sort of lockdown or shelter-in-place measures and therefore has no need for this fictional lion brute squad. According to the Russian president, the outbreak of COVID-19 is currently \u201cunder control\u201d in the country.", "lang": "en"}
