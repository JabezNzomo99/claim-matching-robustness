(Is this an attack on Christianity by Islamic forces?) \"\n\nOne of our community members asked us to verify the authenticity of the 45-second ling video clip.\n\n\n\nThe video is doctored one. On observing closely, the watermark of a 'JJPD Producciones' can be seen on the top right corner of the video clip.\n\nThe keywords 'JJPD Producciones' on YouTube gives out a channel by the same name.\n\n\n\nOn June 3, 2019, this channel uploaded the viral video with the title \"Demonio Aterroriza en Ciudad de Granada \u2013 Nicaragua 2019 \u2013 Gargola (Demon Terrifies in Granada City \u2013 Nicaragua 2019 \u2013 Gargoyle?)\"\n\nFrom their channel, it seems like, JJPD Producciones focuses on content similar to the viral video.\n\nThe 'About' section of the channel read, \"We are two Nicaraguan YouTubers, Brothers, creators of videos with special effects, videos of paranormal encounters, fictional short films, Horror Tales and more. (Translated to English) \"\n\nOn September 2019, the brothers had uploaded a tutorial sort of video which showed how the gargoyle can be created digitally.\n\nGiven the evidence, it can be confirmed that a doctored video is being falsely shared as Islamic forces attacking an Italian Church\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343\n\nAlso Read: Fact Check: Did Vladimir Putin Unleash Lions To Keep Russians Indoor?", "lang": "en"}
