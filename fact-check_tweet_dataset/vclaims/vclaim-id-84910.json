For the past four decades, every major-party presidential candidate has released tax returns \u2014 and most of them had done so by the time they were officially nominated at the conventions.\n\nThat is not the case this year. Donald Trump has consistently refused to release his returns, and there\u2019s no indication he will do so before the election. By contrast, Hillary Clinton has released three decades\u2019 worth of tax returns. Only Jeb Bush had released more tax returns than Clinton out of all the candidates who sought their parties\u2019 presidential nomination this year.\n\nTrump once declared that there\u2019s \u201cnothing to learn\u201d from the returns, which was Four-Pinocchio false. He is now citing a pending Internal Revenue Service audit, even though the first president to release his taxes, Richard Nixon, did so in the middle of an audit. Moreover, Trump has not released his tax returns from before 2009, which are no longer under audit, according to his attorney.\n\nVice-presidential nominees also have routinely released their tax returns. Republican Mike Pence and Democrat Tim Kaine have not yet released their returns. We have not heard back from the Trump campaign about whether Pence will release his returns; we will update this column if we do. A Clinton campaign official said Kaine \u201cwill release his tax returns in the near future.\u201d\n\nPresidential candidates have no legal obligation to release their returns, but there has long been a tradition to do so for the sake of transparency. While Trump has not released the returns, his long history of litigation has given the public a sense of what is in his returns.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what we know about Trump\u2019s taxes: He did not pay any (or nearly any) income taxes at least five times in the past 40 years. [Update: On Oct. 1, the New York Times revealed Trump had reported a $916 million loss in 1995, which would have been large enough to allow Trump to avoid paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years.]\n\nThe earliest record of Trump\u2019s publicly revealed income tax information dates to the late 1970s, when Trump paid no federal income tax for at least two years. Trump\u2019s tax returns, examined by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in 1981, showed that he paid $0 in federal income taxes in 1978 and 1979, The Washington Post found. During those two years, he had no federal income tax liability primarily because of the losses he incurred operating his rental properties.\n\nThe next record available is from 1984, when Trump also reported no income. In a Daily Beast article, David Cay Johnston wrote about rulings in two tax appeal cases (Trump lost both) that shed new light on Trump\u2019s finances in 1984. (The judges\u2019 rulings in the two cases are embedded at the end of this factcheck.)\n\nIn one case, Trump contested whether he was subject to a city business tax on his gains from selling a condominium unit in 1984. A New York City administrative law judge found that Trump had reported no personal income in his 1984 federal income tax but reported a $2,365,352 capital gain from the sale and total deductions of $626,264. Yet Trump had not provided documentation justifying the deductions.\n\nTrump provided a photocopy of his tax return, which had the signature of his longtime accountant, Jack Mitnick. But Mitnick testified that neither he nor his firm prepared the tax return and that he did not know who did. Johnston wrote: \u201cAmong the issues raised by Mitnick\u2019s 1992 testimony is whether Trump or someone acting on his behalf substituted a return that he or someone else prepared and then transferred Mitnick\u2019s signature using a photocopier.\u201d\n\nThe judge ruled that Trump was \u201cengaged in a taxable trade or business\u201d and was, therefore, subject to the business tax. The judge didn\u2019t buy Trump\u2019s complaint that he was being double-taxed. The judge said, \u201cThe problem at issue is not one of double taxation, but of no taxation.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
