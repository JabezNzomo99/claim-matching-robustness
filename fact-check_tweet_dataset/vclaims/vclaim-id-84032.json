Many people like \u2018Ashwani Gupta\u2019 in the image above, who has a picture of PM Modi in his cover image, have shared a fake video of Gurmehar Kaur endlessly on social media, whatsapp and youtube and have made this video go viral. They are circulating a video of a young woman singing/dancing in a moving car with her friends, having drinks, and they claim that the young woman is Gurmehar Kaur. To start with, what is wrong with a woman drinking or dancing? Nothing at all. However, the bhakt gang knows that to defame a woman, especially in eyes of the regressive sections of India\u2019s population, a video of a woman dancing, drinking is enough to vilify her character. One such instance on youtube can be seen below.\n\nThis anonymous video was seemingly uploaded to youtube sometime in September last year based on the following Google Search (reverse image search). The identity of the occupants of the car is unknown.\n\nThe same video has now been uploaded multiple times to youtube, facebook, twitter etc claiming it is Gurmehar. Here are a few recent search results as seen on the youtube website.\n\nBased on our research, the video was first uploaded on Facebook by a man called Vikram Bhanushali. This was the source where over 135k people video viewed it and forwarded it using various platforms.\n\nThat Vikram Bhanusali is a Modi fan is evident from the posts on his Facebook profile. For eg, in this post on his Facebook timeline, he alleges that media is working overtime to ensure PM Modi\u2019s defeat in Varanasi.\n\nThe ramification of such vilification is that Gurmehar Kaur\u2019s mother had to come forward and state that the video is indeed fake. A report on India Today site states the following:\n\nGurmehar\u2019s mother Rajvinder has outrightly rubbished the video. In a phone call, Rajvinder was very confident when she denied that the girl shown in the video was her daughter. Instead, she objected to the way a pretty girl was being maligned for no reason. Many of Gurmehar\u2019s friends and relatives have rang in too, to ask Rajvinder to confirm if it was her daughter in the video.\n\nSo after issuing rape threats and abusing in the most vulgar fashion, this is the latest vilification campaign by the right wing against Gurmehar.", "lang": "en"}
