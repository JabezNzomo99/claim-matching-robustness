After all 3 were found to be positive for the disease, Magufuli \"kicked out the WHO from the country.\"\n\nThis claim was repeated by a Filipino blogger in a video on her Facebook page, \"Lynn Channel,\" citing greatgameindia.com as her source. The video has since garnered a thousand shares, 1,652 reactions, and 388 comments since it was uploaded on June 29.\n\nThe WHO Africa Regional Office website lists a country office in the United Republic of Tanzania as of Tuesday, September 1. United Nations Tanzania's official website also lists a WHO representative in the country, doctor Tigest Ketsela Mengestu.\n\nThe WHO mentions Tanzania in its official social media accounts. The Twitter account of WHO African Region included Tanzania in its regular COVID-19 update also on September 1. The Twitter account of WHO Tanzania has also been tweeting regularly since June. Their latest post is dated September 1.\n\nThere have been no official statements from WHO or the Tanzanian government about the country \"kicking out\" the organization.\n\nOn May 3, Tanzanian President John Magufuli did question the reliability of the COVID-19 test kits they were importing after samples from a goat and a papaya tested positive for the disease. The next day, Tanzania suspended the head of their national health laboratory, which was in charge of testing, to make way for an investigation. There have been no reports on the investigation as of September 1.", "lang": "en"}
