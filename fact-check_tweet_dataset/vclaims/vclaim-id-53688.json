This quote, shared nearly 600 times on Facebook, is one such example. (RELATED: Does This Image Show Michelle Obama Texting During The Pledge Of Allegiance?)\n\nThe Daily Caller found no evidence of the former first lady ever saying or writing the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post. In fact, an internet search revealed that credible online sources have only reported on the statement in order to debunk it.\n\nThe alleged quote, debunked by Snopes in 2015, may come from the headline of a post published by JewsNews.com. The post, titled \u201cMichelle Obama says \u2018White Folks\u2019 are what\u2019s Wrong with America,\u201d discusses the commencement address that Michelle Obama gave at Tuskegee University in 2015.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that some readers interpreted the entire headline, not just the two words in quotation marks, as a direct quote from the former first lady.\n\nHer remarks did include a discussion of race and racism, but the transcript and video of the speech show that Michelle Obama only used the words \u201cwhite folks\u201d once. While she was talking about the experiences of the Tuskegee Airmen, she said, \u201cThey went on to show the world that if black folks and white folks could fight together, and fly together, then surely \u2013 surely \u2013 they could eat at a lunch counter together.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
