Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image, the same video was found to be on the internet at least from February 2020. Also, a YouTube user has posted a video with similar visuals in January 2020 with the title \u2013 \u2018Sri Ranganatha Swamy Temple, Jiyaguda, Hyderabad\u2019.\n\nSo, when searched with the keywords, it was found that the decoration was made for \u2018Vaikunta Ekadasi 2020\u2019 at a temple in Hyderabad. The related news report can be found here. Other videos related to the decoration and the event can be watched here and here. So, the video is not related to Ayodhya.\n\nThe same video was found to be uploaded on YouTube in April 2019 with the title \u2013 \u2018LASER LIGHT SHOW||RAMNAVAMI||2019\u2019. Also, a similar laser show video with the same surroundings was posted by a user in April 2019. When asked about the video by a user, the uploader has replied that the video was taken during a Ram Navami rally at Shahada in Maharashtra.\n\nSo, when searched with keywords, a video with the same visuals was found to be uploaded by a Marathi local channel as a video related to Ram Navami rally in Shahada (Maharashtra). So, this video is also old and not related to Ayodhya\n\nWhile both the posted videos are not related to Ayodhya, the recent video related to Ayodhya can be watched here. \u2018ANI\u2019 has reported that several parts of Ayodhya were illuminated ahead of foundation stone laying ceremony of Ram Temple on 05 August 2020.\n\nTo sum it up, old & unrelated videos are falsely shared in the context of Ayodhya Ram Temple foundation stone laying ceremony.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
