Her funeral was held on July 17 in Fourways, an area north of Johannesburg in the South African province of Gauteng, according to South African outlet SABC News.\n\nThe Facebook post claims in the caption that the video being shared shows mourners at her funeral violating social distancing guidelines. South Africa is currently at level three in its COVID-19 alert system, meaning that funeral gatherings must be limited to 50 people at this time, per the country\u2019s online coronavirus resources portal.\n\n\u201cZindsi Mandela\u2019s funeral at fourways on Friday \u2026. . no facemaks (sic) \u2026. .100\u2019s of people, not only 50\u2026..no social distancing,\u201d reads the video\u2019s caption. \u201cThis is the government dictating that we may not visit our parents or children but we may we ride in a 100% fill taxi to their funeral???? How stuffing warped is this??\u201d\n\nBut the video doesn\u2019t show Zindzi Mandela\u2019s funeral. SABC News footage from her memorial service shows different buildings in the background and a much smaller crowd wearing face masks.
