Nope, that's not true: the fake story was intended as a piece of satire and the news is not real.\n\nIt appeared on The Babylon Bee on April 5, 2018 underd the headline \"Rotten Tomatoes Introduces New Negative Scores For Faith-Based Films\" (archived here) and opened:\n\nU.S.--Shortly after the release of God's Not Dead: A Light in the Darkness, popular review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes announced it would now be allowing negative scores exclusively for faith-based films. Well-reviewed films will continue to receive a \"fresh\" rating, while films with lots of negative reviews will continue to receive a \"rotten\" rating, and aggressively bad faith-based films will now receive the site's new \"putrid pile of festering garbage\" rating.\n\nThe story said the minimum possible score was now -382% and that the 2018 movie \"God's Not Dead\" was the first to receive such a rating.\n\nA quick check of the actual rating of the movie on Rotten Tomatoes reveals the truth:\n\nSeveral people clearly think the movie stinks but the review system does not allow negative ratings.\n\nWhich shouldn't be too surprising as The Babylon Bee comes with following dislaimer on every page:\n\nSome of their greatest past hits include:\n\u2022 Joel Osteen Sails Luxury Yacht Through Flooded Houston To Pass Out Copies Of 'Your Best Life Now'\n\u2022 Another Actress Accuses Kirk Cameron Of Treating Her With Respect\n\u2022 ISIS Lays Down Arms After Katy Perry's Impassioned Plea To 'Like, Just Co-Exist'\n\nWith a track record like that it is clear that you shouldn't take anything posted on the site seriously and you definitely shouldn't confuse it with real news.
