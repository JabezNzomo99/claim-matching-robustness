Andrew Cuomo ordered thousands of COVID-19 patients to be sent to nursing homes, while the USNS Comfort, a hospital ship sent to New York to help treat patients, sat empty and unused.\n\nUSNS Comfort was not empty and completely unused. After three weeks, it had treated 179 patients. The underutilization of the ship, however, cannot be blamed solely on Cuomo but on a combination of bureaucratic and military restrictions, as well as the use of the Javits Center as a temporary hospital.\n\nDue to a March 25, 2020, New York state directive, recovering COVID-19 patients were discharged from hospitals and sent to nursing homes. USNS Comfort, a hospital ship, was sent to New York City that month to aid the city's hospitals, but the ship's resources were underused.\n\nA meme about New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was making the rounds in May 2020 that criticized his management of COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic patients in New York and the resources at his disposal. The meme said, \u201cWhile the USNS Comfort sat in New York empty and unused, Andrew Cuomo mandated nursing homes to take COVID patients.\u201d\n\nThe reality is a bit more complicated. While Cuomo did indeed direct that COVID-19 patients be sent to nursing homes to help ease the burden on hospitals, the underutilization of the USNS Comfort was due to a wide range of factors.\n\nOn March 25, Cuomo and the state New York Health Department directed that recovering COVID-19 patients be discharged from hospitals and sent to nursing homes. At least 4,500 patients were sent to \u201calready vulnerable\u201d nursing homes, according to data compiled by The Associated Press (AP). Many blamed the controversial order for more than 5,800 deaths in nursing and adult care facilities in New York, more than in any other state.\n\nThat order, from the office of New York State Health Commissioner Howard Zucker, came amid a \u201cscramble to provide more hospital beds.\u201d The order said:\n\nThe plan, according to AP, quickly came under attack:\n\nOn May 10, Cuomo reversed the order, saying now only patients who tested negative for the virus could be released to nursing homes. He continued to defend the decision, arguing he was following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines. He also said:\n\nMeanwhile, at the end of March, according to The New York Times, the USNS Comfort was sent to New York City to aid hospitals overburdened with COVID-19 patients by taking on non-coronavirus cases. U.S. President Donald Trump himself oversaw the ship\u2019s departure from Norfolk, Virginia. But on April 2, the 1,000-bed facility only had 20 patients.\n\nA combination of military protocols and bureaucratic hurdles prevented the ship from accepting many patients, frustrating many hospital leaders. The New York Times report outlined the hurdles that restricted patient intake in early April:\n\nAt the same time, according to the Times, the number of non-COVID-19 patients in New York City hospitals had dropped:\n\nMichael Dowling, head of New York\u2019s largest hospital system, expressed his frustration over the hurdles getting patients to the hospital ship:\n\nUltimately, Mr. Dowling and others said, if the Comfort refuses to take Covid patients, there are few patients to send. And given the pernicious spread of the disease in New York City, where nearly 50,000 were infected as of Thursday, dividing patients into those who have it and those who do not is pointless, he said. The solution, he and others said, was to open the Comfort to patients with Covid-19. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to help us with the people we need help with, what\u2019s the purpose?\u201d\n\nOn April 6, Cuomo asked Trump for permission to treat coronavirus patients on the ship. Trump agreed, and the Navy reconfigured the ship into a 500-bed hospital so it could space out patients to avoid spreading the disease. But on that same day, a crew member tested positive for the disease, even after the crew had been ordered to quarantine for two weeks before their departure for New York. The number of infected grew to four in the following weeks. By April 21, the ship had treated only 179 patients, not even close to its capacity.\n\nTrump acknowledged during a White House briefing that the reason the ship wasn\u2019t put to much use was because its arrival coincided with the opening of a military-supported temporary hospital at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. A commander of the Comfort\u2019s task force supporting the COVID-19 mission in New York City echoed the sentiment:\n\nThe Javits center\u2019s makeshift hospital treated around 1,000 patients during its run, and was closed by May 1 after it appeared that New York City was past the peak of the pandemic. Days before, Cuomo met Trump at the White House, where the president asked him about relocating the Comfort back to its base where it could be dispatched to other locations. Cuomo later told MSNBC that the state no longer needed the hospital ship. Barely a month after the ship arrived in New York, it returned to Norfolk.\n\nIn summary, Cuomo\u2019s administration did issue a controversial directive that sent recovering COVID-19 patients to nursing homes, which may have contributed to a spike in COVID-19-related deaths in those facilities. Officials reversed the order in May. The USNS Comfort\u2019s inability to take in more patients was due to a combination of bureaucratic hurdles for New York City hospitals who found it difficult to send patients to the ship in the first place. Even after the ship opened up to treating COVID-19 patients, it was still unable to fill all of its beds. Therefore, we rate this claim as a \u201cMixture.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
