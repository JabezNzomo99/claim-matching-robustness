The posts often include a black and white photograph of a soldier and two men while the soldier checks a document.\n\nIn one post, the top part of the image breaks down each letter of COVID-19 by the corresponding word and then says, \u201clet this sink in.... Certificate Of Vaccination Identification (COVID).\u201d It explains the number 19 by saying it is a reference to artificial intelligence, or A.I. (the first and ninth letters of the alphabet).\n\nThere is no evidence to support this claim. The images do not offer a source or justification.\n\nA reverse Google image search of the photograph reveals that it was taken in 1941 in Warsaw, Poland, during World War II. An Austrian digital database provides a description of the photograph, reading (in German): \"German guard controls Jewish workers at the ghetto entrance.\" ( here )\u200b\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) explains on its website how the novel coronavirus was named. \u200bThis virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease it causes is called COVID-19, also known as the novel coronavirus ( here )\u200b.\n\nThe International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) gives viruses their names according to their genetic structure and for the benefit of scientific research. It named the virus as SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, due to its genetic relation to SARS.\n\nThe term COVID-19 refers to \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\" ( here )\u200b.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explains on its website: \u201cThe new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, \u2018CO\u2019 stands for \u2018corona,\u2019 \u2018VI\u2019 for \u2018virus,\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019 for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as \u201c2019 novel coronavirus\u201d or \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d.\u201d ( here. )\u200b\n\nFalse: COVID-19 is not an abbreviation for Certificate of Vaccination Identification by Artificial Intelligence, it stands for \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
