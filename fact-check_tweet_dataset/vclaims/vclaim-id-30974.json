Why do you want to visit Kashmir and trouble us. Please go back\u2019. Let\u2019s check the authenticity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Kashmir people in the flight have said to Rahul- \u2018Modi is doing good for us. Why do you want to visit Kashmir and trouble us\u2019. Fact: The woman in the video has explained to Rahul Gandhi about the existing situation in Kashmir due to the restrictions in place after the abrogation of Article 370. She hasn\u2019t spoken anything that was claimed in the post. Hence, the claim made in the post stands FALSE.\n\nIn the entire video, a woman can be seen speaking to Rahul Gandhi. She narrated to Rahul Gandhi about the conditions in which the Kashmiris are living due to the existing restrictions there. She has spoken in Hindi and its English translation is- \u2018Even children aren\u2019t allowed to step out of their houses. In case if any child goes missing, they are holding the person who goes in search of him. My brother is a heart patient. He was held when he went in search of his missing child. It\u2019s been 10 days and we do not know where he is and how he is. We are living in stress in all the ways\u2019. In the video, the woman has nowhere questioned Rahul Gandhi about the purpose of his visit to Kashmir and she did not even tell him to go back.\n\nFrom \u2018The Indian Express\u2019 article, which carried a story about this video, it was found that this incident took place when Rahul Gandhi was returning to Delhi in a flight after he was prevented from entering Srinagar.\n\nTo conclude, Kashmir people in the flight neither questioned Rahul Gandhi about the purpose of his visit nor did they tell him to go back\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
