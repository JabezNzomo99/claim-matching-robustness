No, that's not true: the story came from a site that makes up stories about bizarre crimes and sex acts for entertainment purposes, it is not real and did not happen.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on June 4, 2018 titled \"Drug mule arrested after diarrhea ejects cocaine in middle of airport\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil | An American tourist was arrested after more than 40 of the pellets of cocaine hidden in her anal cavity were ejected by a severe case of diarrhea while she was standing in front of airport security officers. 27-year old Tania Smith, from Fort Lauderdale in Florida, was getting ready to board a plane back to the United States after spending two weeks in Brazil when the incident occurred. The young woman looked visibly ill and feverish while waiting in line before boarding, and several witnesses said kept groaning and swearing loudly. At the moment she was called up to present her ticket, she suffered a severe incident of diarrhea which ejected dozens of drugs pellets from her rectum, directly on the airport floor.\n\nThe woman in the picture is actually Amy Sharp from Sydney, Australia, who taunted the police via Facebook in 2016 saying they should use a better photo after she escaped from a corrective centre:\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories.
