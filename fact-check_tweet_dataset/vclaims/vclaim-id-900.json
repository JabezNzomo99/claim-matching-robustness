In the most recent year for which there are figures\u20142014\u2014around \u00a314 million of investment per day came into the UK from other EU countries.\n\n\u00a365 million a day\u2014or \u00a3460 million a week\u2014is more than any estimate of the UK\u2019s annual EU membership fee, which was \u00a323 million a day in 2015. But the investment in 2014 was less than we pay.\n\nThe average is higher because \u2018foreign direct investment\u2019\u2014which is when companies abroad invest in companies here\u2014used to be much higher prior to the financial crash in 2008.\n\nIn that sense, the claim isn\u2019t telling the whole story. Foreign investment directly into UK companies have fallen over the past decade and are far from the levels they reached in the 2000s.\n\nIt\u2019s still the case that about half of investment stocks in the UK come from EU countries.\n\nBoth the Treasury and the House of Commons Library have stated how difficult it is to work out whether being an EU member has in itself encouraged more investment in the UK than would have otherwise been the case. We\u2019ve written more about this here.", "lang": "en"}
