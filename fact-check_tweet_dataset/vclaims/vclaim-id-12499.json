Some of the individual claims are accurate (including the fact that the UK is one of the biggest contributors to the EU budget), but some are not.\n\nThe UK, Germany and France are the three biggest \u201cnet contributors\u201d to the EU budget (meaning they all pay in more than they get out), so the UK\u2019s EU budget contributions are not subsidising French and German workers.\n\nThe Polish retirement age is 60 for women, and 65 for men\n\nThe retirement age in Poland is 65 for men and 60 for women, following a law which came into effect in October 2017. This reversed a 2013 policy by a previous Polish government which set about gradually raising the retirement age to 67 for both men (by 2020) and women (by 2040).\n\nPoland\u2019s retirement age of 65 for men is shared by 11 other EU countries, including the UK.\n\nThe retirement age of 60 for women is the joint-lowest female retirement age in the EU, along with Austria.\n\nUnlike Poland, most other EU countries also plan to raise and equalise the retirement age for men and women in the coming decades.\n\nIt\u2019s correct that a full working week is officially set at 35 hours in France.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that every French worker religiously clocks off after seven hours each day though. In reality, working practices are quite flexible. Many employees agree in their contracts to work more than 35 hours per week\u2014but they will be compensated for working additional hours, for example through shorter weekly hours at other times, or additional holiday.\n\nEU data shows that, on average, full-time workers in France worked just over 40 hours a week (including overtime) in 2017. The EU average was 41.3 hours and the UK average was 42.6 hours.\n\nWorking hours can\u2019t tell us everything either. French workers tend to be more productive than their British counterparts.\n\n900,000 German industrial workers have secured a 28-hour working week for two years\n\nIn 2018, Germany\u2019s largest trade union won an agreement allowing its 900,000 members the option to work a 28-hour week for up to two years.\n\nMost work longer hours than this though\u2014full-time workers in Germany worked, on average, 41.2 hours per week in 2017 (including overtime).\n\nGerman employees are allowed to work up to 40 hours during a five-day working week (that doesn\u2019t mean all full-time contracts have to be set at 40 hours a week though). As with France, German employees can agree to work more than this, but must be compensated for it.\n\nIn Germany, compensation has to be in the form of additional time off. In addition to extra time off, workers can be paid for overtime\u2014but this is not legally required.\n\nGerman workers also tend to be more productive per hour than those in the UK.\n\nThe UK is one of the biggest contributors to the EU budget\n\nThe UK contributes roughly the third largest sum of money into the EU budget behind Germany and France, and a similar amount to Italy.\n\nIf you also take into account money that comes back to the UK from the EU, the UK is the second biggest \u2018net contributor\u2019, after Germany and just ahead of France.\n\nAgain, because all three countries pay in more than they get out, it\u2019s not accurate to suggest that the UK\u2019s EU budget contributions subsidise Germany or France.\n\nThe EU budget invests in transport and energy, but it isn\u2019t just for making existing networks cheaper for consumers\n\nThe final part of the post claims the EU budget subsidises utilities and cheap travel.\n\nPart of the EU budget is invested in transport, for the purpose of improving connection in Europe and making transport more climate-friendly, which is part of the EU\u2019s broader goals. The funding is not in place to simply make existing transport networks cheaper.\n\nFor example, the UK received \u20ac52 million of funding for \u201ctransport\u201d as part of the EU\u2019s \u201csmart and inclusive growth\u201d strategy in 2017. Germany received \u20ac386 million, France received \u20ac248 million, and Poland received \u20ac2.2 million.\n\nSome of the EU budget is also spent on utilities, in as much as it invests in energy projects\u2014for example in the form of projects for developing gas pipelines, gas storage and smart grids.\n\nThe Institute for Government told us that this is mostly seed funding to kick-start projects and attract private sector funding.\n\nThe UK received \u20ac14 million of funding for \u201cenergy\u201d as part of the EU\u2019s \u201csmart and inclusive growth\u201d strategy in 2017. Germany received \u20ac16 million, France received \u20ac7 million, and Poland received \u20ac1 million.\n\nThe European Investment Bank (EIB) also provides loans for these kinds of projects\u2014with the UK as one of the largest recipients.\n\nSince 2014, the EIB has invested \u20ac8.8 billion into the UK energy sector, and \u20ac4.1 billion into the UK transport sector. This investment is separate to funding from the EU budget.", "lang": "en"}
