Number 43 added $4 trillion by his lonesome, so that we now have over $9 trillion of debt that we are going to have to pay back \u2014 $30,000 for every man, woman and child. That\u2019s irresponsible. It\u2019s unpatriotic.\u201d\n\nYikes, the future president said such a debt increase was \u201cunpatriotic\u201d and \u201cirresponsible.\u201d But this is really not a very good use of numbers. Let\u2019s explain why.\n\nThe biggest problem with this factoid is that every president inherits a debt from the previous one, making it virtually certain that the pile of debt is going to grow. The numbers cited almost always involve gross debt, which includes intergovernmental loans such as bonds held by Social Security. So even when there was a budget surplus during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, the gross debt climbed because of the bonds issued to Social Security.\n\nAs Roosevelt battled the Great Depression and World War II, the debt soared from $23 billion in 1933 to $266 billion in 1945, or more than a 1,000 percent increase. Wilson, meanwhile, boosted the national debt from $3 billion in 1913 to $24 billion in 1921, for an increase of more than 700 percent. In fact, it was during Wilson\u2019s presidency\u2014and World War I\u2013that the nation debt limit was first established. (A year-by-year accounting can be found here.)\n\nAt current trends, Obama is on track to double the national debt, which means he would essentially match the performance of George W. Bush, whose handling of the debt he had once labeled \u201cunpatriotic\u201d and \u201cirresponsible.\u201d\n\n\u201cReagan\u2019s total debt was $2 trillion for 8 years. In 6 years, Obama has already run up $7 trillion,\u201d said Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier. \u201cThat is already more than three times as much as Reagan\u2019s total. Our concern is the overall size of the debt, and from that standpoint, the amount of the increase matters. The overall point is that our nation\u2019s debt continues to skyrocket and must be reigned in \u2013 which is why is it so disappointing that Congress this week did not use the vote on the debt ceiling to push for meaningful concessions to cut spending.\u201d\n\nRaw numbers, lacking context and not adjusted for inflation or the size of the economy, are inherently misleading. We are not singling out Cruz, as both parties have played fast and loose with these comparisons. Can there perhaps be a bipartisan pledge to drop this line of attack?", "lang": "en"}
