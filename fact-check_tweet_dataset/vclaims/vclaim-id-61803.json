During an Oct. 8, 2007, speech in Iowa, she complained that New York apple growers had failed to gain access to Canadian markets while Canadian growers were having no such problems exporting their products to the United States, and blamed the Bush administration for not vigorously enforcing trade agreements.\n\n\"I think it is time that we assess trade agreements every five years to make sure they're meeting their goals or make adjustments if they are not and we should start with doing that with NAFTA,\" Clinton said.\n\nThe line attributed to Clinton about NAFTA being a \"boon\" to the economy appears to be based on an issues rundown in the Sept. 11, 2006, edition of Newsday in which the Long Island newspaper, in its own words, stated that Clinton believed the trade agreement to be a boon to the economy. The paper also pointed out that Clinton voted against the Central American-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement in 2005 because of concerns that it would drive jobs overseas.\n\nSince announcing her candidacy, Clinton has, in fact, tried to distance herself from some of the free-trade policies her husband's administration pursued and repeatedly expressed concern and skepticism about the benefits of globalization.\n\nIn June 2007, she said NAFTA had some positive effects \"but unfortunately it had a lot of downside.\" And at a debate in December 2007, she announced her intention to review and reform NAFTA if she were elected.\n\nObama implies Clinton views NAFTA as an unqualified success, but more importantly, he attributes words to her that only appear in a newspaper summary of the issues. We judge his statement to be False.", "lang": "en"}
