While it is not at all uncommon for one party\u2019s workers to infiltrate another political party\u2019s rallies/meetings and wave their own flags to embarrass the other party, is that what happened? Well, let\u2019s look at the sequence of media reports. The first one was by ANI News at 3:18 p.m. which claimed that people waved BJP flags at Rahul Gandhi\u2019s road show in Haridwar and the tweet had a video attached to it.\n\nIf one looks at the sheer number of BJP flags and the audible chanting of \u201cModi-Modi\u201d towards the end of the video posted by ANI, the news report would seem true. But was it? Zee News also reported it in form of a text report at 5:45 p.m.\n\nHowever, at 6:28 pm the story started to fall apart. Supriya Bhardwaj from NewsX who was covering Rahul Gandhi\u2019s Uttarakhand visit replied to one Amaresh Ojha when she was questioned as to what were the BJP flags doing in Rahul\u2019s road show. She replied to Mr Ojha stating that it was a rally of BJP MP Hema Malini that Rahul\u2019s cavalcade was crossing.\n\nAnd then came across a video of the same event on social media but from a different vantage point which corroborated what Supriya Bhardwaj states in her tweet. In the youtube video below, you can see that the camera starts to swing at about the 15th second and for a brief few seconds, a make-shift gate is seen with Hema Malini\u2019s photo and \u201cShrimati Hema Malini ji\u201d written in Hindi on the gate along with her pictures on the side. The video and the screenshot can be seen below.\n\nSo, while the media reports would want you to believe that random people showed up at Rahul Gandhi\u2019s rally and started waving BJP flags at him, the truth is very far from that. Those who were waving the flags were actually the participants of Hema Malini\u2019s rally and could very likely be BJP workers. The important question is how did the ANI journalist while being perched on a vehicle miss this simple fact while having a clear view of Hema Malini\u2019s rally? Why wasn\u2019t this bit of information that the road show was passing by Hema Malini\u2019s rally conveyed to the audience? Innocent mistake? Well, it certainly doesn\u2019t look like it.", "lang": "en"}
