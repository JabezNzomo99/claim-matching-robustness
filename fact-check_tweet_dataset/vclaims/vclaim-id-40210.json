Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Photo of a 47-year-old Moinuddin who has been studying in JNU since 1989. Fact: The person in the photo is not \u2018Moinuddin\u2019, his name is \u2018Pankaj\u2019. He has not been studying in JNU since 1989. He is just 30 years old. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nResponding to the tweet which mentions similar information in the post, a user \u2018Pankaj Anarchio\u2019 tweeted that he is the person in the photo. He also mentioned in the tweet that he is a research scholar from JNU\u2019s Center of Social Medicine and Community Health. Also, from a video published by a news website called \u2018janjwar\u2019, it can be seen that his name is Pankaj.\n\n\n\nFrom his Facebook profile, it is learnt that he joined JNU in 2019. If he were a student in JNU since 1989, as mentioned in the post, his name would have been seen in the JNU\u2019s website under 2016-17 list of M.Phil and Ph.D. registered students in \u2018Center of Social Medicine and Community Health \u2013 CSMCH\u2019 section, but it was not found. \n\n\n\nTo summarize, the name of the person in the photo is not \u2018Moinuddin\u2019, his name is \u2018Pankaj\u2019. He joined JNU in 2019. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
