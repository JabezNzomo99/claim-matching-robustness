Ron DeSantis wants to start them even earlier.\n\nIn Florida, he wrote in the Sun Sentinel, \"children are required to take their first standardized test within 30 days of beginning kindergarten and Gov. DeSantis wants to extend that requirement to preschoolers.\"\n\nSanders called such a policy \"absurd\" and ineffective. Whether that\u2019s true is outside of the scope of this fact-check. Here, we wanted to know if Sanders correctly assessed the timing of Florida\u2019s earliest standardized test and whether DeSantis wants to expand it to preschoolers.\n\nAfter we contacted the Sanders campaign, his team tweaked the language in the online op-ed. The revised piece says, \"DeSantis wants to extend harsh accountability requirements to preschoolers.\" (The update is not disclosed on the Sun Sentinel website.)\n\nWhile we applaud the Sanders campaign for making its language more accurate, we still wanted to fact-check what was missing from the original statement.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Florida kindergarteners take a screening test at the beginning of the year. However, we could not find any evidence that the state is adding similar tests for preschoolers. The most we\u2019ve heard so far is an unspecific call for more accountability, presumably among pre-K providers.\n\nKindergarteners take assessment at the start of the year\n\nFlorida isn\u2019t unusual for giving tests to students in kindergarten. More than half the states have a kindergarten assessment, said W. Steven Barnett, who co-directs the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University.\n\nPublic school students take the Florida Kindergarten Readiness Screener within 30 days of entering kindergarten. The assessment test asks students to recognize numbers up to 20, distinguish numbers from letters, and match words that are the same, among other skills.\n\nThe information is meant to help teachers and parents, as well as the state. The state uses the results to calculate the kindergarten readiness rates for Florida\u2019s voluntary prekindergarten program, which provides free access to all of the state\u2019s 4-year-olds.\n\nIn May, results showed that 41% of children who participated in VPK were not ready for kindergarten. In response, DeSantis directed education commissioner Richard Corcoran to create an improvement plan.\n\nIn the same press release, Corcoran called for \"a real accountability measure for all our school readiness programs\" and said it was a rallying cry to improve early learning.\n\nDoes that mean adding tests for voluntary pre-k? We did not get a response by our deadline.\n\nSo far we have not seen any more details from the DeSantis administration.\n\nFor the record, Florida law already requires VPK students to take a test at the outset of the program and at the end. The assessments are designed to track progress for the students, classroom and preschool center.\n\nA new bill filed by state lawmakers would require VPK students to undergo a specified screening and progress-monitoring program. Since the session just started, we don\u2019t yet know how far proposal will go or whether DeSantis supports it. His office did not respond to our questions about that. An aide to a bill sponsor, Sen. Gayle Harrell, said that Harrell doesn\u2019t know if DeSantis supports her bill.\n\nSanders said, \"But in Florida children are required to take their first standardized test within 30 days of beginning kindergarten and Gov. DeSantis wants to extend that requirement to preschoolers.\"\n\nKindergarten students do take a standardized screening test during the first 30 days. We didn\u2019t find any evidence that DeSantis wants to extend such a test to preschoolers (and we\u2019ll note they are already tested).\n\nThe DeSantis administration called for an \"accountability measure for all our school readiness programs\" after a report showed 41% of VPK students were not prepared for kindergarten. But he has not been specific, and we haven\u2019t found evidence that it will include new testing for VPK students in the first 30 days.", "lang": "en"}
