The article adds, however, that anonymous sources had purportedly confirmed \u201cthat a league shutdown has been in the making for months and that they were simply looking for a good excuse to shut it all down.\u201d\n\nFurther down, the story says that players, \u201cled by Washington Generals All-Star Power Forward Art Tubolls, held a secret vote prior to the beginning of the season to suspend the league for any credible reason until President Donald Trump resigns from office or is voted out.\u201d\n\nArt Tubolls is not a real person. It is an anagram of Bustatroll, a popular humor site known for its satirical content ( twitter.com/arttubolls?lang=en ; bustatroll.org/ ).\n\nThe original article making this claim on social media stemmed from this website, and was first published on March 23, 2020. The story is clearly labelled as satire \u201cmeant to enrage taters everywhere.\u201d ( here )\n\nIdentical instances of this satirical news story republished on websites such as \u201cNovelguru\u201d and \u201cBloombergmag\u201d, and found on social media do not make this disclosure.\n\nNBA players did not vote to suspend their season until Trump resigned.\n\nOn March 11, 2020 the NBA said it was suspending the season until further notice after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for the coronavirus ( here ). Last week, after a 4-1/2 month pandemic-enforced break, 22 NBA teams restarted the season inside a bio-secure bubble in Orlando ( here, video here ).\n\nTrump has criticized NBA players for kneeling before games in protest against racial injustice. He told Fox News that he switches off games when he sees players kneel, describing it as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and \u201cnot acceptable\u201d. Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James this week defended the practice and said he had no qualms about losing Trump as a viewer ( here ).\n\nFalse. The NBA did not ask Trump to resign or \u201cwe will never play again.\u201d This claim stemmed from a satirical article.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
