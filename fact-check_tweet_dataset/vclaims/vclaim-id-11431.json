The video exposes how his campaign staff appear to be illegally using campaign resources to buy supplies and help transport Honduran aliens. Featured in this report are campaign staffers who work on Congressman O\u2019Rourke\u2019s US Senate campaign discussing how they use campaign resources to help Honduran aliens and transport them to airports and bus stations.\n\nThe story was picked up by other prominent conservative commentators and news outlets, including Breitbart and the web site of the Fox News host Sean Hannity.\n\nAs of 2 November, the most extensive footage published was a 24-minute video posted to YouTube by Project Veritas, which can be viewed below. Like many of the videos previously published by O\u2019Keefe and Project Veritas, the one published on 1 November was heavily edited, making the context of many conversation fragments and statements unclear:\n\nO\u2019Keefe has attracted criticism for editing and framing video footage in such a way as to unfairly harm the reputation of progressive organizations and politicians, and he has faced multiple lawsuits and even a criminal conviction for illegally entering the office of U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu in an attempt to tamper with her telephones.\n\nWe sent the O\u2019Rourke campaign a set of questions related to the footage. In response, Chris Evans, a spokesperson for the U.S. Representative for Texas\u2019 16th District, directed us to remarks he offered to the Texas Tribune, in which he acknowledged that some campaign staffers had \u2018taken it upon themselves\u2019 to donate around $300 worth of supplies to a local charity helping migrants:\n\nSome of the footage posted on 1 November also appeared to show campaign staff discussing the possibility of using campaign vehicles to give rides to migrants, but the video did not show anyone actually doing that or even talking about having taken that action. In response to our questions, the O\u2019Rourke campaign asserted that no staff had used campaign vehicles to give rides to any migrants.\n\nIn the video posted on 1 November, O\u2019Keefe said that \u201ccharity is not a bad thing\u201d but accused the O\u2019Rourke campaign staff of breaking the law in their efforts to donate supplies: \u201cWe support charity at Project Veritas Action, but you cannot break the law to do it \u2026\u201d\n\nRoughly speaking, it is prohibited for a political campaign to spend campaign money for what\u2019s known as \u201cpersonal use.\u201d For spending to be considered campaign-related, it must be for a purpose that arises only in the context of a campaign. As the FEC guidelines state: \u201cIf the expense would exist even in the absence of the candidacy or even if the officeholder were not in office, then the personal use ban applies.\u201d\n\nThe logic of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s argument was that when the O\u2019Rourke campaign staff bought food and supplies to help the migrants, they were spending campaign money on something that was not strictly campaign-related, and therefore they had violated the \u201cpersonal use\u201d rules.\n\nHowever, what O\u2019Keefe did not mention is that exceptions to those rules exist, one of which allows political campaigns to donate to charities (under certain conditions):\n\nThe footage published by O\u2019Keefe on 1 November did not constitute evidence of a member of the O\u2019Rourke campaign team\u2019s using campaign funds to give supplies directly to the migrants, as opposed to donating them to Annunciation House, a registered charity in El Paso.\n\nWe asked the O\u2019Rourke campaign whether any of their staff had given supplies purchased with campaign money directly to any migrants. A spokesperson firmly denied this, writing: \u201cAbsolutely not. The materials were dropped off to Annunciation House \u2026 at the donation site Annunciation House had set up.\u201d\n\nWe asked Project Veritas whether it had uncovered any evidence (not shown in their video) of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign staff providing supplies directly to the migrants (as opposed to the charity). A spokesperson for the organization did not directly answer that question but reiterated that they had found evidence of campaign staff discussing an intention to buy supplies for the migrants and to give them rides in a campaign vehicle.", "lang": "en"}
