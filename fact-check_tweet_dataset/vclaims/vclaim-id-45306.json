And that was the feeling Joe wanted to share, see? \u2026.The gurus would shake their heads. \u201cThat\u2019s not marching.\u201d And Joe would say, \u201cI know. Okay.\u201d But then, a week later, another crowd\u2026and Joe would do it again.\n\nThis claim is a more nuanced riff than some of the statements that got the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in trouble before. The biggest issue in the past is that Biden has overstated his activism. Here, he says \u201cI wasn\u2019t any great shakes.\u201d He has also sometimes conflated actions taken as a college student and suggested they took place when he was in high school.\n\n\u2014 In 1962-63, he participated in pickets of the last segregated movie theater in Wilmington. Richard \u201cMouse\u201d Smith, the former president of the Delaware NAACP who met Biden at the pool, in 2019 vouched that Biden was there: \u201cWe know Joe as the ally who was there beside us to protest the Rialto Theater\u2019s discriminatory policy to segregate moviegoers based on race.\u201d (Biden sometimes says the picketing took place in 1965. The 2019 book \u201cHistoric Theaters of Delaware\u201d says the theater was first picketed in November 1962 and began admitting black patrons in May 1963. Delaware outlawed segregation in public accommodations seven months later.)\n\nThe incident at the Charcoal Pit restaurant is the closest thing to \u201cdesegregating restaurants.\u201d Biden at times has suggested he organized the walk-out. But initially the black student involved, Frank Hutchins, in 1987 told the Philadelphia Inquirer that Biden and the other white students did not realize he was not served. \u201cThey weren\u2019t aware of what happened,\u201d Hutchins said. \u201cI was only 16 then. It was my problem and my battle for me to work out. They were oblivious to it until later.\u201d\n\nBut then a few days later Hutchins told a reporter from the Wilmington News Journal that his memory had been refreshed and Biden might have witnessed another racial incident. \u201cThere were a number of these kinds of incidents and it is clear to me Senator Biden could be referring to any one and be perfectly accurate,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the Philadelphia Inquirer article appears based on Biden\u2019s recollections. The Washington Examiner in 2019 interviewed several key participants in the campaign who were also at the University of Delaware and could not locate anyone who remembered Biden\u2019s participation. The campaign started in late 1961, so Biden would have been a freshman then, as he graduated from high school in the spring of that year.\n\nThe Route 40 effort, with the cooperation of the State Department, quickly won the cooperation of many restaurants, earning a letter of thanks in November from President Kennedy. Raymond Arsenault, a history professor at the University of South Florida and author of \u201cFreedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice,\u201d said about half of the restaurants along Route 40 desegregated in 1961, with most of the rest quickly following suit in 1962. Relatively few sit-ins were necessary in the end.\n\nArsenault told The Fact Checker it would have been unusual for someone as young as Biden to be involved in the Route 40 demonstrations. \u201cHe\u2019s a story-teller and he naturally embellishes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere may be a grain of truth but the specifics, he has walked it back a number of times.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefeating systemic racism and realizing this nation\u2019s promise for all its people has been a driving cause of Joe Biden\u2019s life,\" said Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates. \u201cHe is proud to have stood against the scourge of segregation and would use every single day in the White House to bring our country together and uphold the rights and dignity of every single American.\u201d\n\nAs far as we can determine, Biden participated in just one walk-out at one restaurant. He also picketed a segregated movie theater. He\u2019s gotten in trouble before for overstating his civil-right credentials, and this latest statement certainly does not compare to the hyperbolic claims he made during his first presidential run. But it\u2019s still worthy of at least Two Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
