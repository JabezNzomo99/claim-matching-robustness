Learning about donors to the Canadian charity would reveal whether any may have had business before the State Department when Clinton was secretary of State in President Obama\u2019s first term.\n\nThe federal privacy law is called the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, or PIPEDA. This law requires organizations to get permission from donors if they are releasing their information for a commercial purpose, which is defined as \u201cselling, bartering or leasing of donor, membership or other fundraising lists.\u201d (This is a key point that we will return to momentarily.)\n\nAccording to Valerie Lawton, spokeswoman for the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (the agency that oversees compliance with this law): \u201cIf a charity is not engaged in a commercial activity such as selling, bartering or leasing a donor list, then PIPEDA would not apply to the charity\u2019s activities \u2013 including whether it makes public a donor list. That being said, there may be other Canadian laws which don\u2019t fall under our jurisdiction that could apply to the publishing of donor lists.\u201d\n\nBritish Columbia\u2019s privacy law is stricter than the federal law, though substantially similar. It requires organizations to get donor permission when they collect, use or disclose their personal information. The province does not have a public database that shows which charities are subject to this law, and a spokeswoman for the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner for British Columbia could not immediately confirm whether CGEPartnership was subject to provincial law. This law does not apply to federally-regulated organizations already governed by PEPIDA.\n\nIt is not entirely clear which law applies to CGEPartnership. The organization did not clarify when we asked. Some experts said it would operate under provincial law because the federal one generally applies to corporations like airports and banks. Others also said it would make sense for CGEPartnership to be regulated by federal law, as it applies to data that cross provincial or national borders and the charity is federally registered.\n\nCGEPartnership\u2019s memo about donor lists says the charity and its directors are \u201cmindful of their obligations\u201d under the federal law. The charity has interpreted the release of donor names as \u201cbartering,\u201d and considers it a \u201cmatter of caution and good governance\u201d to take a \u201cwide view of the definition [of bartering], in terms of CGEPartnership\u2019s duty to keep donor information completely private without the consent of the donor or unless compelled by law.\u201d\n\nAdam Aptowitzer, Ottawa-based charity lawyer, said CGEPartnership is taking a \u201crather shaky\u201d and an \u201cextremely conservative view\u201d of the law: \u201cIt is difficult to see how releasing the list would be bartering, given that there seems to be no payment or consideration for the release of the list.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton Foundation referred us to CGEPartnership and offered no comment, though officials there were copied on emails. [Update: After this fact check published, CGEPartnership posted a Frequently Asked Questions page for the media and released a legal opinion dated April 29, 2015. The legal opinion, which re-affirmed points in the charity\u2019s earlier memo, is embedded below. The attorneys have now said the provincial law would apply, in addition to the prohibition against \u201cbartering\" charitable donor lists under the federal law.]\n\nHowever, the charity\u2019s own memo says it is operating under federal obligations and its fiduciary duty for its board of directors. The federal law does not explicitly ban charities from disclosing individual donor names without permission. In fact, it only applies to commercial use of personal information. The public release of donor names for a non-commercial purpose is not prohibited. The charity, however, interprets the release of donor records as \u201cbartering,\u201d which experts have questioned.\n\nThe charity\u2019s memo notes that under Canadian law, donors have the right to privacy, and that the board of directors has a fiduciary responsibility to use donors\u2019 personal information for its own charitable purposes. While that may be the case, Pally\u2019s statement implies that there is a blanket Canadian law that bans charities from disclosing donor information without permission. That is not exactly the case.", "lang": "en"}
