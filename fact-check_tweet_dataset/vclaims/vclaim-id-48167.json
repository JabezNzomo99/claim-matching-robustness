There is no record of Ravi Nayak working at the Ministry of Home Affairs.\n\nMultiple Facebook users have shared posts claiming India\u2019s Ministry of Home Affairs recently announced that only government agencies can post about the new coronavirus on social media. The Facebook posts attribute the announcement to Nayak, who allegedly works as the \u201cprincipal secretary\u201d in the Ministry of Home Affairs.\n\n\u201cAll honorable members of the group are informed that right now any post related to Corona virus has been declared a punishable offense by the Central Government, only a government agency can post on Corona,\u201d reads one such post. \u201cIn case of wrong post or message, action will be taken against the members of the entire group including the group administrator by registering a lawsuit under the IT Act, so keep in mind be safe!\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s Press Information Bureau debunked the message in a tweet on March 30.

However, the Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any individual with the name listed in the Facebook post in that directory, nor does there appear to be any \u201cprincipal secretary\u201d position. A source within the ministry told The Quint that \u201cthe name and the designation doesn\u2019t match anyone in the ministry.\u201d\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on April 14 that the nationwide coronavirus lockdown had been extended until May 3. The lockdown has been in place since March 25 in an effort to curb the spread of the new coronavirus, according to CNN.", "lang": "en"}
