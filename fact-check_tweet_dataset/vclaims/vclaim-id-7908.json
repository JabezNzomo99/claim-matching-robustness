As of January 9, the Kadyrov_95 account on Mylistory had 48,000 followers, while the Kadyrov_95eng had 5,349 followers.\n\nSeveral Russian and U.S. tech media specialist have tested Mylistory and given the app less-than-stellar ratings.\n\nRussian T-Journal said the app is \u201ca total copy of the old Instagram.\u201d\n\nThe Russian newspaper Vzglyad wrote a flattering review for Mylistory, saying it is \u201cbooming in App store well ahead of Periscope, Tumbler and other popular applications. Its popularity is \u201cnot propaganda,\u201d Vzglyad wrote, adding that many users have expressed gratitude to the app\u2019s developers to Kadyrov for supporting it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much Instagram with fewer features, right down to a rip-off of Instagram\u2019s old golden logo and font. It has basic functionality like the ability to post photos, comment and send direct messages, though there\u2019s no way to share content on the site externally, and the app lacks features like \u2018Stories,\u2019\u201d American Gizmodo.com wrote.\n\nPolygraph.info tested the Mylistory application, from the process of downloading it from the App store to creating an account and digging into the developer\u2019s IP address.\n\nMylistory is definitely not #18 in App store\u2019s top charts of free social networking apps. It is not even close to being in the top 50.\n\nThe Web site mylistory.com listed in the apps\u2019 page in App store as \u201cApp Support\u201d opens only from unsecured connections and leads to the page, which states that it is \u201cunder development.\u201d When attempting to open mylistory.com from secured connections, the page was blocked as a security risk.\n\nThe developer of Mylistory, according to its page in App store, is a Chechen man named Magomed Eskhanov. In the Russia\u2019s online database of registered businesses, he is listed asCEO of the Advertising firm \u201cMyli,\u201d at this address: 3/25 A. Kadyrov Ave, Grozny, Chechen Republic.\n\nAccording to the database, Eskhanov\u2019s agency is 100% funded by the LLC \u201cGrozny-Citi\u201d a company owned by one of Chechnya\u2019s most notorious businessmen -- Movsadi Alviev, a co-founder of the \u201cAkhmad Kadyrov Foundation,\u201d named after Ramzan\u2019s late father (who was the republic\u2019s ruler from October 2003 until his assassination in May 2004) and ranked as #5 on Transparency International\u2019s list of \u201c9 grand corruption cases.\u201d\n\nReportedly, the \u201cAkhmad Kadyrov Foundation\u201d is Ramzan\u2019s personal tool for appropriating and laundering of billions of rubles.\n\nBut the most interesting part of Mylistory\u2019s \u201cdeveloper Magomed Eskhanov\u201d story is the IP address of mylistory.com: a search of the database of RIPE, the Amsterdam-based Regional Internet Registry (RIR) for Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Central Asia, leads not to Chechnya, but to a whole network of \u201cdead ends\u201d \u2013 hidden IPs \u201clocated\u201d at different addresses in Moscow, including a 24-hour auto parts store and several P.O. Boxes.\n\nHere are just a few examples.\n\nPolygraph.info traced the \u201cunder construction\u201d website listed in App store for Mylistory to one Alexey Galaev, who might be a real person and a freelance developer.\n\nTo be continued in Part II, which will reveal who Mylistory wants new users to follow.", "lang": "en"}
