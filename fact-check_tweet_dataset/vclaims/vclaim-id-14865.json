[1]\n\nMore than 70 cars, including some electric vehicles, reached Melbourne on Thursday on the two-week journey up Australia's east coast. [2]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined the claim by convoy captain Mr Brown who calculated his car rally will produce greenhouse gasses equivalent to less than 30 seconds worth of a year\u2019s emissions at the future Carmichael mine. [1]\n\nAccording to Adani Australia the Carmichael mine will have a processing capacity of 10 million tonnes of thermal coal a year. This will produce around 240,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide (Co2). [3]\n\nAAP FactCheck contacted Mr Brown for the source and method of his calculation.\n\nMr Brown used a lower figure of 210,000 tonnes of Co2 emissions per day from coal extracted at the Carmichael mine. The figure of 210,000 was sourced from a 2014 report titled Climate Change - Emissions by environmental scientists Dr Chris Taylor and Professor Malte Meinshausen that was lodged in the Land Court of Queensland. [4]\n\nThe 210,000 tonnes figure was drawn from the report\u2019s calculation of 78,833,137 tonnes of annual average emissions. The true figure is 215,981 tonnes. [4]\n\nUsing Mr Brown\u2019s stated figure of 210,000 tonnes of emissions per day, coal extracted from the mine would emit 145.8 tonnes per minute as there are 1,440 minutes in a day. Mr Brown is using less than half a minute as his measure. That equates to slightly less than 73 tonnes of emissions for less than half a minute.\n\nBob Brown Foundation media manager Adam Burling said Mr Brown estimated a total of 455 tonnes of Co2 would be emitted by his convoy during the two-week journey from Hobart to Queensland.\n\nMr Burling said Mr Brown\u2019s calculation was \u201cballpark\u201d as the figure of 455 tonnes was based on 500 cars driving 5000 kilometres. As most in the convoy would be travelling part of the total distance and some not the full distance, Mr Burling said the figures and calculation were \u201chypothetical\u201d.\n\nHe also admitted the number of cars registered for the convoy was 800 and was not fixed.\n\nBased on Mr Brown's own figures the convoy would produce roughly the equivalent of three minutes of emissions from the proposed Adani mine, not 30 seconds worth.\n\nGiven the figures Mr Brown used to calculate the emissions from his convoy are estimates only and based on shifting numbers, and his Adani calculation is wrong, AAP FactCheck found his claims to be false.", "lang": "en"}
