The claim is false; the video is a compilation of two earlier events from other countries -- a rocket attack on the Israeli city of Ashkelon in 2018 and an explosion in the Chinese city of Tianjin in 2015.\n\nThe video was published in this Facebook post on January 8, 2020. It has been viewed more than 25,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the video in the misleading posts:\n\nThe video is a montage of two clips: the first 26-second clip shows specks of light exploding in the air; the second 23-second clip shows flames and massive plumes of smoke in an apparent explosion. The video ends with the text: \u201cPray for both country / no to world war!\u201d\n\nThe post\u2019s Tagalog-language caption translates to English as: \"After the dead Iranian military commander was buried, Iran has started attacking two Iraqi bases where US military is deployed. 80 american soldiers are dead according to Iranian State Tv.. / Fellow Filipinos don't wait for the situation to worsen, leave and go home to the Philippines! / #NoToWar #PrayForBothCountry / #USAVsIran / Follow this Page!\"\n\nThe same video was shared here with a similar claim in Sinhala-language.\n\nThe videos were shared after Iran fired retaliatory strikes towards two Iraqi military bases that house US troops on January 8, 2020, in response to the US killing of Iranian top military commander Qasem Soleimani in a droke strike on January 3, 2020, as reported by AFP here.\n\nThe US Department of State has since confirmed that there were no American casualties in the Iranian strikes on Iraqi bases.\n\nThe claim in the misleading posts is false. Reverse image search of keyframes extracted from the clip using the digital verification tool InVID found it was created from two separate clips of different incidents in Israel and China.\n\nThe first 26 seconds of the video in the misleading posts corresponded with a video published in this report by English-language Israeli newspaper The Times of Israel about bombings in Ashkelon, a coastal city near Gaza, on November 13, 2018.\n\nThe video has been embedded below.\n\nThe report reads in part: \u201cThe rocket attacks, which began with several large barrages on small towns near the Gaza border in the afternoon, have threatened to ratchet up tensions in the restive region, casting a shadow over intensive ceasefire efforts.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading post (L) and the video embedded in the 2018 report by The Times of Israel (R):\n\nAFP previously debunked misleading claims linking the same video to the Iranian missile attacks in Arabic and Spanish.\n\nThe second part of the video in the misleading posts was published in this report by UK newspaper The Guardian about an explosion in Tianjin, a port city in northeastern China, published on August 15, 2015.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the video in The Guardian report, credited to eyewitness Dan Van Duren:\n\nThe Guardian\u2019s caption reads: \u201cA video filmed by stunned eyewitness, Dan Van Duren, captures the moment successive huge blasts tore through an industrial area in the Chinese port city of Tianjin on Wednesday. The explosions took place where toxic chemicals and gas were stored, and killed at least 55 people, including firefighters. The blasts were so large they were seen by satellites in space / WARNING: this video contains explicit language\u201d.\n\nThe explicit language heard in The Guardian\u2019s video also matches the audio of the video in the misleading post.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison video in the misleading post (L) and the video embedded in the 2018 report by The Guardian (R):\n\nThe same incident was also reported by the BBC on its YouTube page here, with the headline: \u201cTianjin explosion video captures fear of eyewitnesses\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
