VERA Files Fact Check elaborates on six of these claims.\n\nRepublic Act 11199 or the Social Security Act of 2018, signed into law in February 2019, made SSS coverage mandatory for all land-based and sea-based OFWs.\n\nThis was challenged at the Supreme Court by some OFWs, calling its provisions \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d and \u201coppressive.\u201d Under the law, land-based OFWs, who previously made contributions voluntarily are now considered \u201cself-employed\u201d and shall shoulder the SSS payment of both the employer and the employee of up to P2,400 a month. Sea-based OFWs are considered employed by their manning agencies but will have to pay up to about P800.\n\nNewly hired land-based OFWs will also have to pay a month\u2019s worth of contributions first, while re-hires or returning OFWs need to pay three months\u2019 worth, before they are issued their Overseas Employment Certificate (OEC) that will allow them to leave the country.\n\nThe Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, which issues OECs, has said it has yet to start implementing the law, pending review of RA 11199\u2019s implementing rules and regulations.\n\nIn April, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) also announced an increase in premium contributions of OFWs, as an effect of the Universal Health Act signed by Duterte. But after overseas workers expressed opposition, the president directed PhilHealth to make premium contributions \u201cvoluntary\u201d for OFWs.\n\nThe media did not \u201chide\u201d nor skip reportage on the government\u2019s housing projects for displaced residents of Marawi City, which was devastated after a battle between state forces and the militant Maute group in 2017.\n\nThere were reports on temporary housing projects even before the war was declared over, as well as several news articles on the turnover of the first batch of transitional shelters.\n\nA simple keyword search online would also readily show stories by different news organizations on the government\u2019s Marawi restoration efforts, including housing, that go beyond 2017.\n\nThe circulating FB post actually paints an incomplete picture of Marawi\u2019s rehabilitation. Residents have complained of its \u201cslow\u201d progress since 2018, with some not allowed to return home over two years after the war ended. The Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council also raised eyebrows after it used rehabilitation funds to finance some Marawi residents\u2019 pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nThis number of drug users who have surrendered to the government is from a June 2017 Presidential Communications news release about Duterte\u2019s first year in office. In a report to the United Nations in March 2019, Foreign Affairs Sec. Teodoro \u201cTeddyboy\u201d Locsin updated this to over 1.4 million.\n\nHowever, of this figure, only 555,314 surrenderees have graduated from either police-initiated or community-center-managed \u201creformation programs\u201d from July 2016 to March 2020, according to data published June 23 by Real Numbers PH\u2014the government\u2019s own tally of war on drugs numbers.\n\nDuterte himself has used different figures when talking about the number of drug addicts in the country. In his speeches in his first three years in power, the figures he cited ranged from 1.5 million to three million drug addicts. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: How many drug addicts are there in PH? Let Duterte do the counting)\n\nHowever, starting 2019, Duterte raised the count to a minimum of three million and a maximum of eight million individuals who are addicted to the drug shabu. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: 3 years into drug war, Duterte again revises drug addict count)\n\nAside from these ever-changing figures, Duterte\u2019s war on drugs has also been criticized for the \u201cstaggering number of unlawful deaths and police killings in the context of the so-called war on drugs,\u201d according to a news release by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (UN OHCHR).\n\nReal Numbers PH data published on July 4 shows there were 5,722 individuals who died during police anti-drug police operations since July 2016. The administration\u2019s 2017 year-end report also cited over 16,000 \u201chomicides under investigation\u201d as one of its accomplishments in the fight against illegal drugs.\n\nIn March 2019, PNP Spokesperson Brig. Gen. Bernard Banac said there were \u201cat least 29,000\u201d deaths under investigation since the launch of the war on drugs, but clarified only about 3,000 were \u201cdrug-related.\u201d\n\nNon-government groups such as Human Rights Watch and the UN OHCHR have cited local groups as saying that the number of deaths in the drug war can go as high as 27,000.\n\nOn the rehabilitation of Ilog Pasig\n\nThe FB post wrongly gave the Duterte administration sole credit for cleaning up Pasig River, which was \u201cdeclared biologically dead\u201d in the 1990s.\n\nIt was the Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission (PRRC)\u2014established by former President Joseph Estrada in 1999 and abolished by Duterte in November last year\u2014 that spearheaded efforts to clean and restore the Pasig River across administrations.\n\nWhen Ilog Pasig won the 2018 Riverprize Award for the Asia region, given by Australia-based International River Foundation, the organization cited PRRC\u2019s works from 1999 to 2018 which \u201cresulted in significant water quality improvement, as well as the revitalisation and development\u201d of the river.\n\nHeavily involved in the rehabilitation of Pasig River was also ABS-CBN Lingkod Kapamilya Foundation\u2019s Kapit Bisig Para sa Ilog Pasig led by the late Gina Lopez, who became PRRC chief from 2010 to 2016 and had a 10-month stint as Duterte\u2019s Environment Secretary. The Asian Development Bank also provided a policy loan in 2000 for a development program for the river.\n\nOn the \u2018benefits\u2019 received by Filipinos from POGOs\n\nPOGOs\u2014which primarily employ Chinese workers and cater to players from the mainland\u2014are considered business process outsourcing companies, according to Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque in May.\n\nWith regard to tax duties, however, it has been proven a number of times this year that they are not paying the government their proper taxes.\n\nIn a Feb. 11 Senate hearing, Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Deputy Commissioner Sixto Dy Jr. said \u201ca hundred percent\u201d of foreign-based POGOs licensed under the Philippine laws \u201care not paying franchise tax.\u201d\n\nDy also said that legal POGOs failed to pay around P50 billion worth of taxes in 2019 -- including withholding income tax, franchise tax, and corporate taxes.\n\nJust a day after the Senate session, the BIR closed down Synchronization Anywhere For You, Inc., a licensed POGO, over a P114 million worth of unpaid taxes.\n\nMeanwhile, in a May 9 Inquirer.net report, BIR Commissioner Caesar R. Dulay was also quoted in saying that \u201calmost all\u201d of POGOs have yet to pay their respective mandatory taxes.\n\nAccording to social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, the list containing the misleading claims is carried in over a thousand FB posts by pages and public groups, the earliest of which was published with 23 claims\u2014not 26\u2014by a netizen on public FB group BILIRANONG TAGA BUKID!!!. These versions currently have over 324,000 interactions on FB.\n\nAmong the Duterte accomplishments that were true in the circulating posts is the extension of validity for passports, seamen\u2019s books and drivers\u2019 licenses, free tuition fees for public schools, pay rise for the military and police, giving recognition to the SAF 44, road widening projects, rehabilitation of tourist destinations, distributing Hacienda Luisita land, Boracay rehabilitation, and the establishment of a \u201cworld-class\u201d sports complex in New Clark City.\n\nOne of its most recent iterations was detected by FB making the rounds this July. It was published on July 4 by a netizen, and currently has over 130,000 interactions, 22,000 comments and more than 82,000 shares.\n\nPosts carrying the misleading list continued to be shared as the Duterte administration faced criticisms over its measures against the COVID-19 pandemic, with cases still increasing despite the country having one of the world\u2019s longest coronavirus lockdowns.\n\nThe government also recently drew flak over the passage of the controversial Anti-Terrorism Bill, as well as the House of Representatives\u2019 denial of ABS-CBN\u2019s legislative franchise.\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
