The connection was drawn because Ron Pelosi, at the time the loan was announced, was serving as an \u201cindependent director\u201d on the board of PCG Asset Management \u2014 a subsidiary of Pacific Corporate Group, which had invested in SolarReserve. (He had previously been executive director of PCG Asset Management until April 2009, before the loan application was filed.)\n\nPelosi, as well as Pacific Corporate Group and SolarReserve representatives, denied the claims when they first surfaced.\n\nChalking the assertions up to a \u201csmear\u201d attempt against his sister-in-law, Ron Pelosi provided email correspondence to FactCheck.org at the time showing he was only to receive $25,000 annually for his role on the board. \u201cThe loan the company received had nothing to do with me,\u201d he said in a statement, adding that he \u201cknew nothing regarding their proposed or actual transactions.\u201d\n\nWe are not the only ones that wrote about the unsubstantiated claims in 2011: Fortune, the San Francisco Chronicle and Snopes did, too.\n\nThe recent Neon Nettle story \u2014 which netted more than 40,000 Facebook interactions, according to CrowdTangle data \u2014 goes onto make other claims, including that the plant has \u201cfailed\u201d and that \u201cits average monthly production was expected to exceed 40,000 MWh, as of October 2018 it only exceeded half of that value during 8 months.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not true that the plant \u201cfailed.\u201d It has been in operation since 2015 and sells its energy to the electric provider NV Energy under a 25-year contract.\n\nThe plant was indeed projected to generate some 482,000 megawatt-hours annually \u2014 or about 40,000 megawatt-hours per month on average \u2014 which assumes the plant is operating at its full 110-megawatt capacity for about 12 hours every day. The most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show that the plant averaged 17,056 megawatt-hours per month for the first 11 months of 2018.\n\nLast year, company officials acknowledged that the plant\u2019s early years of operation were beset with issues such as defective pumps and construction errors, according to a January 2018 story by InsideClimate News, a nonprofit news organization that covers energy and environmental issues. Kevin Smith, SolarReserve\u2019s CEO at the time, told the news outlet that, while the plant had not yet reached its goal of generating almost 500,000 megawatt-hours of electricity annually, he was confident that the target would be met.\n\nEither way, though, the claim that Ron Pelosi \u201creceived $737m\u201d in \u201ctaxpayer money\u201d simply runs counter to the facts.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nDieterich, Robert. \u201c24-Hour Solar Energy: Molten Salt Makes It Possible, and Prices Are Falling Fast.\u201d InsideClimate News. 16 Jan 2018.\n\n\u201cEnergy Department Finalizes $737 Million Loan Guarantee to Tonopah Solar Energy for Nevada Project.\u201d Press release, U.S. Department of Energy. 28 Sep 2011.\n\n\u201cWhat is a Loan Guarantee?\u201d Loan Programs Office, U.S. Department of Energy.
