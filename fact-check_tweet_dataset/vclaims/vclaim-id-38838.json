Data from social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle also showed that the link was shared on Facebook from February 28 to March 2, 2020.\n\nThe article said charges against Aquino include usurpation of authority and violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. \u201cAquino\u2019s co-conspirators are former Philippine National Police (PNP) Director General Alan Purisima and Director Getulio Nape\u00f1as of the Special Action Force (SAF),\u201d the article added.\n\nThe link was shared 64 times in 40 different Facebook groups and pages. As of writing, these Facebook posts had 3,245 total interactions combined. Facebook\u2019s monitoring tool called Claim Check flagged the link for fact checkers to verify, and was reported by two users as false on the platform.\n\nThe facts: As of March 2020, when the article circulated on Facebook, Aquino had already been cleared of all Mamasapano charges. The information provided in the article is outdated and no longer accurate. (READ: TIMELINE: Mamasapano clash)\n\nIn August 2019, the Sandiganbayan 4th Division formally dropped graft and usurpation charges against Aquino. It acted upon the request of Ombudsman Samuel Martires, who defended this by saying that \u201cno president of the Philippines can be accused of usurpation.\u201d He also said that he would \u201centertain\u201d a new complaint for charges of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide, if filed.\n\nA month after, the Supreme Court (SC) denied a petition backed by Solicitor General Jose Calida that sought to charge Aquino with 44 counts of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide. This SC ruling in September 2019 essentially cleared Aquino of all Mamasapano-related charges.\n\nIn January 2020, the Sandiganbayan also cleared Purisima and Nape\u00f1as of usurpation and graft charges related to the Mamasapano clash. The anti-graft court said that there can be no case of graft because the generals did not receive anything in return.
