But no action has been taken on 45.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2017-02-24T08:00:48Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85348", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/02/24/for-all-of-the-motion-trump-is-falling-behind-on-his-100-day-promise-list/", "vclaim": "What is striking is that despite the drama of Trump\u2019s first month in office, he has actually made little or no progress on many of his promises. Only six promises are listed as \u201ckept,\u201d while 45 have seen no action. We also list seven as \u201claunched,\u201d one as \u201cstuck\u201d and one as \u201cbroken.\u201d\n\nThe White House now says he did not mean he would do all on his first day, only that he would \u201cpursue\u201d them over the next 100 days. The rest of his pledges were listed as \u201cbroader legislative measures\u201d that Trump would work on with Congress \u201cand fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my administration.\u201d\n\nMost of the promises that have been kept were easy to carry out, with action shortly after Trump took the oath of office. Trump announced that the United States was withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, the pan-Asian agreement that had been a signature effort of the previous administration. But Trump\u2019s announcement was largely symbolic because the trade deal was already dead in Congress.\n\nBut the regulation order might turn out to be the equivalent of President Obama\u2019s pledge to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Obama signed an executive order on his first day in office to close Guantanamo, but he could not accomplish the goal over his two terms because of political and legal obstacles. Trump, likewise, will find that any effort to scrap a regulation will require a laborious process \u2014 and be subject to litigation. Some experts believe the requirement is probably illegal. So it is quite possible that this \u201cpromise kept\u201d eventually will shift to \u201cstalled.\u201d\n\nMany of the promises regarded as launched also concern immigration. Trump said he would begin the removal of more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants, cancel the visas of people from countries that won\u2019t take back illegal immigrants, cancel federal funding to \u201csanctuary cities\u201d and fund the construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump has signed orders that to some extent fulfill these pledges, but the actual implementation and follow-through is open to question.\n\nIn fact, Trump, in some cases, already has lowered his standards. He had pledged to immediately cancel visas for people from countries that refuse to accept the return of criminal illegal immigrants. Instead, he signed an executive order on Jan. 25 that said: \u201cThe Secretary of State shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, ensure that diplomatic efforts and negotiations with foreign states include as a condition precedent the acceptance by those foreign states of their nationals who are subject to removal from the United States.\u201d That\u2019s a significant pullback.\n\nThe United States has only twice discontinued the granting of visas to countries that refuse to accept undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes \u2014 Guyana in 2001 and Gambia in 2016. Twenty-three countries have refused to accept criminal aliens, including China, which has rejected 1,900 criminals since 2008. So this will be an interesting test case of when campaign rhetoric meets diplomatic reality. Would Trump really damage relations with an economic superpower to fulfill a campaign pledge?\n\nTrump has promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act \u2014 he signed an executive order to that effect on Jan. 20 \u2014 but GOP lawmakers are struggling to reach a consensus on a replacement. Former House speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) flatly predicted on Thursday that it \u201cis not going to happen.\u201d He said \u201cmost of the framework\u201d of Obamacare would survive the legislative fight. If Boehner\u2019s prediction holds true, we would rate that as a broken promise by Trump.\n\nTrump already has broken one promise \u2014 imposing a five-year ban on White House and congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service. The executive order that Trump signed Jan. 28 regarding executive-branch officials made no reference to congressional officials. Moreover, the five-year ban applies only to lobbying one\u2019s former agency \u2014 not becoming a lobbyist. Trump actually weakened some of the language from similar bans under Obama and George W. Bush, and reduced the level of transparency.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s signature promises was to make Mexico pay for the border wall, which has been estimated to cost as much as $25 billion. Trump was supposed to meet with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto shortly after he took office, but Pe\u00f1a Nieto canceled the meeting after Trump tweeted: \u201cIf Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.\u201d\n\nThe two men later arranged a phone conversation. Since then, Trump has been silent on his promise that Mexico would fund the wall. Instead, he has emphasized how he would keep costs down. \u201cThe price is going to come down, just like it has on everything else I\u2019ve negotiated for the government,\u201d Trump asserted at a news conference on Feb. 16.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s promises appear utterly impractical, which could be why no action has been taken. He promised to impose a \u201ccomplete ban\u201d on foreign lobbyists raising money for U.S. elections. But it\u2019s already illegal for foreign nationals and foreign governments to contribute money to U.S. political campaigns. Trump also said he would \u201cend Common Core,\u201d but those educational standards were developed by governments and school superintendents and adopted at the state level. Obama encouraged states to adopt the standards through incentives, but those programs have ended.\n\nFinally, Trump promised to create 10 million jobs in his first term and grow the economy at a rate of 4 percent a year. The jobs promise may be in reach \u2014 five of the last 10 presidential terms resulted in at least 10 million jobs, including Obama\u2019s second term \u2014 but the economic-growth target will be a difficult promise to keep. The annual change in the gross domestic product has not topped 3 percent in 10 years \u2014 and last exceeded 4 percent in 2000.", "lang": "en"}
