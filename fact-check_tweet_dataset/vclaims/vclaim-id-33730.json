Based on the comments in the post, the suggestion is that this is controversial as it illustrates Mr Corbyn\u2019s close links with the Sinn F\u00e9in leadership.\n\nThis is a genuine photo of Mr Corbyn, Mr Adams and Mr McGuinness. The context (as can be seen in the uncropped version) is that it was taken during the funeral of Labour MP Tony Benn in 2014.\n\nPhotographs from the day show Mr Adams and other Sinn F\u00e9in members near other political figures who also attended the funeral. Figures from across the political spectrum attended, from former Conservative minister Lord Heseltine to former National Union of Mineworkers leader Arthur Scargill.\n\nTony Benn was a supporter of Irish unification and controversially invited Adams to speak at Westminster in 1993. (Mr Corbyn also met with Mr Adams during the Troubles.)\n\nAt the time of the funeral, Mr McGuinness was Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, and Mr Adams was the president of Sinn F\u00e9in and a member of the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.", "lang": "en"}
