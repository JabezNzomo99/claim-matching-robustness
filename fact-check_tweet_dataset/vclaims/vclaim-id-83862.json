But Zakari is not in charge of logistics for the vote.\n\nThe claim, shared by Nigerian opposition figures -- including Senator Ben Murray-Bruce and Reno Omokri, a former media aide to ex-president Goodluck Jonathan -- has been reposted more than 3,000 times.\n\nThe presidential vote has indeed been delayed until February 23 due to what Nigeria\u2019s Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) said were logistical difficulties. Zakari does work for the INEC, but not in a logistics role.\n\nThe widely shared posts include a false screenshot purporting to show that Zakari is the head of INEC\u2019s logistics committee.\n\nOmokri\u2019s version, which was shared more than 900 times, claims that Zakari was \u201cacting out President Buhari\u2019s script\u201d and \u201chas postponed an election he was going to lose, citing logistic reasons. Who is in charge of logistics? Amina Zakari.\u201d\n\nBut INEC had in fact announced on January 3 that retired air vice marshal Ahmed Tijjani Mu\u2019azu would be in charge of the ad hoc logistics committee organising the election, which was originally due on February 16.\n\nZakari was on the same date named head of the ad hoc collation committee, organising the counting of the votes. This led to complaints from the opposition, who claimed that Zakari could help rig the election as a relative of sitting president Buhari.\n\nBuhari\u2019s opponents have previously claimed that the two are blood relatives, but Zakari, her family, and the Nigerian presidency have said they are related through marriage only.\n\n\"An inter-marriage occurred in their extended families, so the imputation of blood relationship between the president and the electoral commissioner is a simple lie,\" Garba Shehu, special assistant to Buhari on media and publicity, said at the time of the row in January.\n\nZakari is not in charge of the logistics for this election, but she was previously chairwoman of INEC\u2019s logistics committee from January 2017 until October 2018.\n\nThe false screenshot appears in the same format as the committees listed on INEC\u2019s website, but the uneven formatting suggests it has been doctored.\n\nZakari\u2019s name does appear on a logistics committee list currently available on the INEC website, but a spokesman for the electoral commission said it was out of date. INEC spokesman Rotimi Oyekanmi said the commission upgraded its website about 10 days ago, and there were some issues with the transfer of data. He confirmed that Zakari is not on any logistics committee, stating that the website will be updated within the next 24 hours.", "lang": "en"}
