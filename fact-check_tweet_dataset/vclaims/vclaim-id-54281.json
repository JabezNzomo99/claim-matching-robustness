Protesters blocking the interstate reportedly allowed a woman to drive through, but blocked the driver pulling the horse trailer when he tried to follow, per the outlet.\n\nVideo from the incident shows the protester throwing the canister over the horse trailer, not into it, according to the Sapulpa Times. A family friend of the driver confirmed to Horse Network that no canister entered the trailer and that no horses were inside at the time.\n\nLocal ABC affiliate KTUL posted footage of the truck pulling the trailer accelerating through the crowd on YouTube. There does not appear to be any smoke coming from the trailer in that video. Two people were transported to the hospital with minor injuries from the incident, according to local NBC affiliate KJRH.\n\nSarah Stewart, an Oklahoma Highway Patrol spokeswoman, told the Daily Caller on July 21 that the agency didn\u2019t have an update on the investigation into the incident.", "lang": "en"}
