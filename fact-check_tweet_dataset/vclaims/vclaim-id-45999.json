According to ABC News, \u201cA 15-year-old boy in Odessa, Texas, was arrested and charged after he was caught on supermarket surveillance footage spitting into an Arizona tea bottle then putting it back on the shelf.\u201d The report added that the incident took place in the Albertsons supermarket.\n\nIndian media had also reported on the incident last year.\n\nAs per international reports, this unhygienic phenomenon started with a minor girl in Texas who licked a tub of ice-cream in a supermarket and put it back in the store freezer. Several copycats followed, per metro.co.uk.\n\nAn video of a teenager in Texas spitting in a tea bottle and putting it back on the supermarket shelf has been picked up by several users in light of the coronavirus outbreak. The incident, unarguably unhygienic, is not related to the pandemic.\n\nNote: The number of positive cases of the novel coronavirus in India exceeds 5,000 and more than 150 deaths have so far been reported. The government has imposed a complete restriction on movement apart from essential services to tackle the pandemic. Globally, more than 14 lakh confirmed cases and over 80,000 deaths have been reported. There is a sense of panic among citizens, causing them to fall for a variety of online misinformation \u2013 misleading images and videos rousing fear or medical misinformation promoting pseudoscience and invalid treatments.
