The Board issued a press release with the denial following social media posts that claimed that a hospital named 'Babri' will be built on the land instead of a mosque on the Supreme Court allotted land.\n\nThe posts also falsely claimed that Dr Kafeel Khan who is currently lodged in Mathura jail will be appointed the director of the said 'Babri Hospital'. The Board also denied this in its release.\n\nBOOM also reached out to MR Shamsad, one of the lawyers for the Muslim faction who said said that a trust created by the UP Sunni Waqf Board will be responsible for the construction of a mosque or any other facility they decide on the five-acre land.\n\nAlso Read:No, This is Not The Blueprint Of The 'Babri Hospital'\n\n\n\nThe viral claim when translated reads, \"Babri Hospital on Land given by Court. Sunni Wakf Board UP has taken decision on 5 acre land alloted by Supreme Court to construct Babari Hospital and Dr Kafeel Khan may be the Director of the Hospital.\"\n\nEarlier, BOOM also debunked a viral image that claimed to be the blueprint of this hospital, stating that it would be beneficial to all faiths, but was in fact a blueprint of a hospital based in the United States.\n\nBOOM found various Facebook and Twitter posts making these claims.\n\nOn November 9, 2019, the Supreme Court awarded the then disputed Ram Janmabhoomi site to the Hindu litigants in the case, thus paving the way for the construction of a Ram Temple. The Muslim faction was the Waqf Board, arguing for the restoration of a demolished Babri Masjid, were awarded 5 acres of land elsewhere in Ayodhya. The foundation stone for the temple was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 5.\n\nAlso Read:Ram Mandir Bhoomi Pujan: Legal Battle Timeline That Ended The Dispute\n\nDr. Kafeel Khan, meanwhile, has been denied bail on July 27. Prior to that, his lawyers told BOOM that rumours stating he had been released were false.\n\nThe Sunni Waqf Board on August 7, 2020 released a statement calling the posts fake and a malafide attempt to harm the board.\n\nThe release signed by SM Shoeb, the chief executive officer of the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board states that the Board has established a trust -- Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF) which will oversee the making of a mosque, a community kitchen, a library and a hospital on the land given to it by the Supreme Court.\n\n\"Today, a fake news (sic) is being circulated on different social media platforms that \"UP Sunni Central Waqf Board has taken decision to build a Babri Hospital and Kafeel Khan will be director of the Hospital\", this news is mischievous and malafide...\"\n\nThe full release can be viewed here.\n\nAlso Read:Images Of Unrelated Islamic Structures Viral As Babri Masjid\n\nSpeaking to BOOM, Shamsad said, \"Largely Masjid is a community matter and larger Muslim community has not welcomed the way this 5-acre land has been allocated. However, statutory Waqf Committee has accepted it and created a Trust for the purpose of constructing 'Mosque and other facilities for the benefit of general public.\"\n\nReports of the IICF being formed also do not talk about a 'Babri Hospital'. This report carries a quote from the IICF's Secretary Atthar Husain, and mentions the formulation of a mosque, a research centre and library, and a hospital at the land allotted to it in the Dhannipur village in Ayodhya. Another report also states that UP Chief Minister Yogi Adithyanath will be invited to lay the foundation for these public facilities, and does not mention a 'Babri Hospital'", "lang": "en"}
