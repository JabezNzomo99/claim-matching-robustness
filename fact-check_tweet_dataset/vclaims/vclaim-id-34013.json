From a half pant to a full pant with a fake cap and stars -translated)\u201d.\n\nA similar claim conveyed in a graphic, wherein the same two images are juxtaposed against each other, was circulating on WhatsApp. \u201cThe man spotted in police uniform without badge is actually RSS goon\u201d, read the text inscribed in the graphic.\n\nAlt News found that the claim that the man in the police dress is the same person who was seen in a picture with Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla, is simply put false. Alt News scourged through the public posts on Om Birla\u2019s Facebook account and found some more images where he was spotted with the same man.\n\nWe then contacted Mahendra Gautam who among many other individuals was one of the people tagged in the images posted by Birla. He informed us that the man in the said images is BJP MLA Ashok Dogra from Bundi assembly constituency in Rajasthan.\n\nThe comparison posted below clearly shows that the man in the RSS attire (in the viral image) and BJP MLA Ashok Dogra is the same person.\n\nAlt News found one more image of Dogra and Birla in RSS attire.\n\nA comparison of Dogra\u2019s image with an image of the Delhi cop shows that these are two different men.\n\nIn conclusion, a photograph of Rajasthan BJP MLA Ashok Dogra with Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla was falsely shared with the claim that Dogra was impersonating as a Delhi cop during recent protests against Citizenship Act. The same video and images were revived during the farmers\u2019 protest.", "lang": "en"}
