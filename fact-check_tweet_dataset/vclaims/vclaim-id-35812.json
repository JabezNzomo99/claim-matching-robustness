The claim is misleading; as of February 2020, 43,000 people are employed at the Chinese-controlled industrial complex cited in the social media posts, but only about 5,000 of them are from China and the remaining 38,000 are Indonesian citizens.\n\nThe screenshots appeared here in an image on Twitter on February 4, 2020. The post has been retweeted more than 840 times.\n\nThe image shows two media reports by two Indonesian media outlets; Tempo and Warta Ekonomi.\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe Indonesian-language tweet, translated to English, reads: \u201cBefore the coronavirus outbreak, in January 2019, there were around 3,000 Chinese workers. After the outbreak, in January 2020, it reached 40,000. An increase in the number of foreign workers in a year is around 37,000.\n\n\u201cEach month the average foreign worker coming is around 3,100. THAT\u2019S JUST IN MOROWALI..!!! Do you realise it or not..??\u201d\n\nThe Indonesian-language headline of the Tempo report reads: \u201cManpower Minister: Only 3,000 Chinese Workers in Morowali\u201d, while the Indonesian-language headline of the Warta Ekonomi report reads: \u201cTo Prevent Coronavirus, More Than 40 Thousand Chinese Workers Quarantined in Morowali\u201d.\n\n\u201cMorowali\u201d refers to PT Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park (IMIP), an industrial site located in Morowali regency, in Central Sulawesi province. It hosts nickel ore smelters and stainless steel production, and is majority-owned by China\u2019s Shanghai Decent Investment Group.\n\nSince its emergence in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, the novel coronavirus has killed at least 900 people and infected some 39,800 others in China alone, as reported here by AFP on February 10.\n\nThe same image also appeared on Facebook with a similar claim here, here, here and here, and has been shared more than 1,000 times.\n\nThe claim is misleading. The industrial park in Morowali employs 43,000 people \u2013 but only around 5,000 of them are Chinese citizens while the remaining 38,000 are Indonesian citizens.\n\nA keyword search on Google found this Warta Ekonomi report published on January 31, 2020. It has the same headline and photo as seen in the misleading post.\n\nBelow is the screenshot of Warta Ekonomi\u2019s report:\n\nThe report's first two paragraphs translate to English as: \u201cForeign media put a spotlight on thousands of workers from China who are being quarantined at a factory in Morowali to prevent the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus.\n\n\u201cAs we observe on Friday, January 31, 2020, French media France24 ran a story titled Thousands on Virus lockdown at China-backed Plant in Indonesia, which translated to Indonesian: Ribuan Orang Dikarantina dalam Pabrik China di Indonesia untuk Mencegah Penyebaran Virus.\u201d\n\nThe report cited by Warta Ekonomi is an AFP article that was republished by France 24.\n\nThe second and third paragraphs of the AFP article state the overall number of the workers and the number of foreign Chinese workers at the industrial park: \u201cPT Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park has sealed off its nickel mining hub on Sulawesi island and is barring any of its 43,000 staff from entering or leaving without written permission.\n\n\u201cThere are some 5,000 guest workers from mainland China at the sprawling site which hosts nickel ore smelters and stainless steel production.\u201d\n\nThe figures came from the company\u2019s spokesman, Denny Kurniawan. In a WhatsApp message to AFP on January 31, 2020, he wrote, \u201cThere are some 5,000 foreign workers from mainland China and 38,000 Indonesian workers\u201d at IMIP.\n\nAlthough the Warta Ekonomi headline states, \u201cMore Than 40,000 Chinese Workers Quarantined in Morowali\u201d, the fifth paragraph of its report quotes a paragraph from the AFP story that \u201cthere are some 5,000 guest workers from mainland China\u201d in Morowali.\n\nBelow is the screenshot comparison between Warta Ekonomi report in the misleading post (L) and the report on the website (R):\n\nAnother keyword search on Google found this Tempo published on January 26, 2019.\n\nIt has the same headline and photo seen in the screenshot in the misleading post.\n\nBelow is the screenshot of Tempo\u2019s report:\n\nThe report's first two paragraphs translate to English as: \u201cManpower Minister M. Hanif Dhakiri said the number of foreign workers from mainland China was only 10.7 percent from the total 28,000 workers in Morowali. Or about 3,000 people.\n\n\u201c\u2018For example in the Morowali Industrial Area. The Chinese investment there has so far provided 28,000 jobs. Of the 28,000 available jobs, three thousand people are Chinese workers and 25,000 are mostly Indonesian workers,\u2019 Hanif said in a press release in Jakarta, Friday, January 26, 2019.\u201d\n\nBelow is the screenshot comparison of the Tempo report in the misleading post (L) and the report on the website (R):\n\nHanif Dhakiri was Indonesian manpower minister from 2009 to 2014.\n\nHe issued a statement in January 2019 about the number of Chinese workers in the industrial park after a video went viral with a false claim that it shows \u201ctens of thousands of Chinese workers protesting in Morowali\u201d. The claim has been debunked by Tempo here.", "lang": "en"}
