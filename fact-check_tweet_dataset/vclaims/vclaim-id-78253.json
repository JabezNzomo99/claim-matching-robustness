He tweeted, \"Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.\" At a press conference in Pittsburgh with local reporters Thursday, Peduto repeated this claim: \"The people of Pittsburgh voted for Hillary Rodham Clinton, 80 percent.\"\n\nPeduto\u2019s spokesperson Timothy McNulty said Friday the mayor got the number \"off the top of his head\" and noted the numbers weren\u2019t that different.\n\nDuring an appearance on CNN late Thursday, Peduto qualified his earlier statement: \"The city of Pittsburgh voted for Hillary Clinton with nearly 80 percent of the vote. [Trump] may be talking about all of western Pennsylvania, but it\u2019s a far cry from being Pittsburgh.\" And while on \"Hardball with Chris Matthews\" on MSNBC, Peduto again stuck with the same claim: \"Actually in Pittsburgh, Hillary Clinton won with nearly 80 percent of the vote.\"\n\nDid Clinton win the city by that majority?\n\nAlmost. Allegheny County election records show that Clinton won 75 percent of the vote in the city of Pittsburgh, while she won 56 percent of the vote county-wide. We calculated Clinton\u2019s vote total using precinct-level data published by the county through the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center.\n\nTrump said he was elected to represent people from Pittsburgh, not Paris, when explaining why he decided to withdraw the U.S. from a global climate deal. Pittsburgh\u2019s mayor, Bill Peduto, responded by tweeting that Hillary Clinton received 80 percent of the vote in Pittsburgh. Clinton received 75 percent of the vote. That\u2019s pretty close; Clinton did win the city by an overwhelming number.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
