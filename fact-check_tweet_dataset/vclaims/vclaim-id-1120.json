Serena Williams is a famous African American tennis player. She\u2019s amazing. You should really look her up.\u201d\n\nBut the post is not connected to the U.S. tennis star at all \u2013 she just shares the same name as the Facebook user who uploaded it.\n\nThe screenshot of the original 232-word post on June 14 can be traced to another Facebook user called Serena Williams, who makes clear in her profile that she is a different individual ( here ). In the post, she tags another user, Gina Torres, who posted the same words on June 2.\n\nWilliams has since updated her profile picture from the one seen in the screenshot \u2013 although the image can still found on her page here .\n\nFalse. Tennis star Serena Williams was not the person who shared the post about divisions and intolerance.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
