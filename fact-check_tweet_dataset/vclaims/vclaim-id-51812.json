I never knew she is so much touched by Bhagvat Gita. Listen to her 3 minutes compassionate message.\n\nThe woman in the video is not New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern but former US Presidential nominee and US Congress Representative from Hawaii Tulsi Gabbard.\n\nGabbard has shared the video of the importance of Gita to her life on her official Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts.\n\nGabbard is the first Hindu member of the US Congress. She has served two tours of military duty in Iraq and Kuwait. She is also a member of the Hawaii Army National Guard.\n\nDuring Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 2014 visit to the USA, Gabbard had gifted him her copy of the Bhagavad Gita. In a Facebook post, Gabbard later said that the copy she gifted was the one she had taken on her army tour as well as used to take her Congressional oath of office.\n\nSocial media posts had previously shared a video of Ardern visited a Hindu temple with false claims that the visit was to show solidarity to Hindus after the Bhumi pujan of the proposed Ram temple in Ayodhya.\n\nBOOM has fact-checked the claims which can be read here.", "lang": "en"}
