But we traced the post to a \u2018news parody and satire\u2019 site.\n\nWe traced the story to an article published by Ihlaya News on November 9, 2019, with the headline, \u2018Hotel cleaner who stole sperm from a used condom won child support battle\u2019.\n\n\u2018Jane was 36 when she stole a used condom from a then 24-year-old tech millionaire\u2019s hotel garbage can,\u2019 the article claims.\n\n\u2018She inserted the semen inside her vagina and became pregnant with a baby boy who is now 4-years-old.\n\n\u2018During the child support hearing, Jane confessed that she never slept with the young millionaire and that she impregnated herself with his sperm while she was cleaning his room\u2019.\n\nThe article claims the man was ordered to pay the woman $2 million in child support.\n\nThe article has racked up over 200,000 interactions on Facebook, including over 35,000 shares, according to online social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle data.\n\nOn Facebook, the article was widely shared in various African countries, including Kenya, Namibia, Ghana, Nigeria and Zambia.\n\nThe article was also widely shared on Twitter by @BTBreakingTimes, a verified Nigerian account with more than 17,000 followers.\n\nHowever, we searched for Ihlaya News on Facebook and found a disclaimer warning that its content was \u2018news parody\u2019. Furthermore, the Afrikaans word \u2018Ihlaya\u2019 translates as \u2018joke\u2019 in English while the tag 'nuusparodie waarvan jy hou' as used on the website translates to 'news parody you like'.\n\nA reverse image search on Google traces the photo of the condom in the article to Getty Images.
