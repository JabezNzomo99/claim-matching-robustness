According to the caption, Gandhi had brought police with her to JNU and proceeded to beat up Yechury for protesting against the Emergency, before forcing an apology out of him. \u201cThis is called Iron Hand dealing with communists. Amit Shah looks saint in front of her,\u201d the caption further goes on to say. Pai\u2019s tweeted the photo and tagged Yechury, asking if it was true. The tweet, posted on 10 January, received 4.2K retweets and 8.7K likes. An archived version of his tweet can be viewed here.\n\nThe caption of the photo here too was the same and said that it showed Yechury as a student leader in JNU reading out the memorandum to Gandhi demanding her resignation as the Chancellor of the university. The photo in the interview of Yechury. Moreover, multiple articles on the Internet corroborate that Yechury as the JNUSU president did indeed manage to make Gandhi resign as the Chancellor of JNU. A copy by IANS also talks about the incident where the JNUSU forced Gandhi to hand in her resignation after the reading of the memorandum and some sloganeering. She quit her post the next day. The same anecdote is shared by Professor Chaman Lal, who was the author of the post on the website India Resists. Moreover, the CPI(M) website also confirms that Yechury was in fact elected as President of JNU Students' Union thrice during one year (1977-78), which also matches the date given by Hindustan Times in their photo caption. Therefore, it is clear that the photo shared by Pai bears a fake claim and has no basis in truth. It is being shared with this false context and claim in the backdrop of the violence at JNU and before that at Jamia, at a time when Amit Shah is being criticized for the police action as well inaction at times.", "lang": "en"}
