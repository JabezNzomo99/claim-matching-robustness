The headline reads: \"Prince Harry says Donald Trump is not welcome at his wedding: \u2018Trump is a serious threat to human rights.\u2019 \"\n\nHarry and Meghan became engaged earlier in November but announced their engagement on Nov. 27. Very few details have been released about the wedding, other than it will take place in Spring 2018.\n\nThere is no record of Prince Harry uninviting Trump, nor is it likely that he would. The royal family typically tries to shy away from drama. The royal family has put out two press releases regarding the engagement, and neither mention an invite list.\n\nThe Obamas were not invited to Prince William and Kate Middleton\u2019s wedding in 2011.\n\nThe other quote in the title, \"Trump is a serious threat to human rights,\" is from reporting done in an Us Weekly article. Us Weekly said a \"close source\" told them that Harry \"is not a fan\" of Trump and thinks he \"is a serious threat to human rights.\" But that source was anonymous and we don\u2019t find it credible.\n\nThe Nova article said that Markle called Trump \"misogynistic\" and joked about moving to Canada (where Suits is filmed) if he were elected. Markle did say that, on a panel she participated on for Comedy Central\u2019s Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore on May 4, 2016.\n\nIt seems unlikely that Trump will be invited to the royal wedding. But Harry never made a statement about it, nor did he say that Trump was a serious threat to human rights. Such a statement would have garnered worldwide headlines. We rate the claim that Harry said Trump was not welcome to the royal wedding as Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
