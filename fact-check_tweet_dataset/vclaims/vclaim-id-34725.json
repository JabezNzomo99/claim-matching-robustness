At the same time, let me remind you that no matter how valiantly the Poles fought, they could not resist the German army in 1939 ,\u201d he added. \u201cWith all due respect to Polish prowess, I would like to note that the Russian people are the victorious people. So it was, is and will always be.\u201d\n\nSolovyov\u2019s reading of history, however, is highly selective.\n\nIn referring to Poland\u2019s liberation from the Nazis, Solovyov omits the Molotov-Ribbentrop non-aggression pact that Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union signed on August 23, 1939.\n\nThat agreement included a secret protocol that divided Central and Eastern Europe into two spheres of influence. On September 17, 1939, less than three weeks after Nazi Germany invaded Poland on September 1, the Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east.\n\nWhile Russian citizens who have written about these events have faced criminal prosecution under a May 2014 law banning the dissemination of \u201cfalse information about the activity of the USSR during the years of World War Two,\u201d the Soviet invasion of Poland is an established historical fact.\n\nDuring the Warsaw uprising in the summer of 1944, the Soviet Union allegedly promised the Polish underground aid to liberate the Polish capital from Nazi occupation, but then halted combat operations after initial successes by Poland\u2019s Home Army, allowing the Germans to regroup.\n\nOthers, including American military historian David Glantz, have pointed to a major German counter-offensive against a Soviet bridgehead on the Vistula River south of Warsaw to explain the Red Army halt.\n\nThe Soviet government also refused to allow Allied forces to use Soviet air bases to airlift supplies to the Poles.\n\nThese events ultimately led to the defeat of the Warsaw uprising in October 1944, along with the destruction of the city and the deportation of its residents.\n\nThis laid the groundwork for the full Soviet occupation of Poland in the aftermath of the defeat of Nazi Germany the following year, which was further solidified by the 1946 Polish people's referendum and parliamentary elections of 1947, widely believed to have been rigged.\n\nThus, while the Soviet military drove Nazi forces out of Poland in 1945, Poland itself remained under Soviet military occupation until 1956, when a dedicated treaty fully regulating the Soviet military presence in Poland was signed.\n\nPolygraph.info therefore finds Solovyov\u2019s statement\u2019s on Poland\u2019s liberation from Nazi Germany to be misleading.", "lang": "en"}
