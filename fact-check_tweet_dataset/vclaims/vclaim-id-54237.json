Tweets linking to an account on the file sharing site Dropbox, which contains the letter and genuine Covid-19 death certificate guidance have since been deleted by that Twitter user.\n\nWe\u2019ve addressed some of the key claims in the letter below, as well as issues medical professionals have with the letter in general.\n\nHospital attendance is down in Surrey, but not by 95%\n\nThe letter\u2019s general claim that patient numbers were down 95% in the period March to June is incorrect, as is suggesting hospital attendance figures are \u201calmost impossible to get hold of\u201d. These figures are published on the NHS England website.\n\nIt\u2019s true that hospital attendance was down in hospitals in Surrey, as it was across the country, but the drop is far less than claimed. Comparing A&E attendance for April to June this year to the same period in 2019 across the five major hospital trusts that cover Surrey (the Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, the Royal Surrey County Hospital Trust, Ashford and St Peter\u2019s Trust, Epsom and St Helier Trust and Frimley Health Trust), attendances were down an average of 37%, with the highest attendance drop of 44% being seen in Epsom.\n\nOutpatient data for June 2020 wasn\u2019t available at time of writing. However, comparing data for April and May of this year to the same period in 2019, first outpatient attendances at the five trusts were down by 46%. While these figures show a reduction, this does not show the 95% drop claimed in the letter.\n\nThe letter also claims that \u201cIn my opinion, and that of many of my colleagues, there has been no Covid Pandemic, certainly not in the Surrey region\u201d. Figures from NHS England show that across the five trusts, there were over 1,100 deaths in hospitals of patients who had previously tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nThe letter has other credibility issues\n\nFull Fact asked Dr Julia Patterson of campaign group Every Doctor what she thought of the letter. She said that doctors in its forum had said that the letter doesn\u2019t feel or read like it was written by someone in the medical profession. Dr Patterson says that despite managing a forum of thousands of doctors, this is the first time she has seen these claims.\n\nOn the claim that \u201cThe trust has been running empty ambulances during lockdown\u201d, doctors in the Every Doctor forum pointed out that ambulances are operated by trusts separate to hospitals.\n\nThe letter\u2019s approach to describing a pandemic in local terms is not one that would be taken by a real medical professional according to Dr Patterson. Pandemics are countrywide or global.\n\nThe NHS told Reuters, in a statement supported by both the Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust and the South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust, that \u201cThe content and claims made within this social media post are not recognised by the local NHS\u201d.\n\nThe genuine death certificate guidance linked to in the Dropbox accompanying this letter does not mention anywhere that medical professionals should list Covid-19 as a cause of death, regardless of the actual cause, as the letter claims.", "lang": "en"}
