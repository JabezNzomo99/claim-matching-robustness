Kline School of Law. His report, published in the Law Library Journal, made the case that the \u201cad hoc\u201d process that led to the ACA is \u201can illustrative example of modern lawmaking, especially for major initiatives.\u201d\n\nIn a bit of legislative maneuvering, Reid offered his text as an amendment to a completely different House bill \u2014 the Service Members Home Ownership Tax Act of 2009. That\u2019s because this bill had been sitting on the Senate Calendar of Business, avoiding the need for Reid to obtain unanimous consent to bring it up. This bill was also already obsolete \u2014 the issue had been taken care of in another bill \u2014 and so it was an ideal vehicle to start debate on the Senate floor. Reid inserted the text into the shell of the old bill.\n\n\u201cDemocrats unhappy with the legislation\u2019s initial form were unwilling to block its path to consideration, but they threatened to filibuster if changes were not made. Reid had to have the support of each one to get to a vote. While Republicans had not dug in their heels to fight the motion to proceed, hoping to tarnish vulnerable Democrats by forcing them to vote in a way that could be characterized as a substantive vote for the health care bill, they would not be so accommodating with the next cloture motion, and they were united in their opposition.\u201d\n\nCannan says this activity suggests \u201ca vigorous effort to alter the bill\u2019s final form on the Senate floor. But this number is deceptive. In actuality, only a tiny fraction of these amendments has any significance\u201d to the bill\u2019s legislative history. Only a handful of amendments covered by a unanimous consent agreement (UCA) reached between the two sides had any relevance, he concluded. Meanwhile, \u201call of those amendments not covered by UCAs were ordered to lie on the table as soon as they were introduced and had no parliamentary standing at all.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because the real work was going on behind closed doors, back in Reid\u2019s office, where he negotiated significant changes with a group of moderate Democrats. Eventually, Republicans and Democrats would no longer agree to even keep debating the matter on the floor, and so the public spectacle ended on Dec. 16. The Senate turned to other matters, including passage of a Defense Department appropriations bill, while the private negotiations continued and the Senate remained in session.\n\nDuring the private talks, Reid agreed to remove a public option in the bill, as well as drop a plan to allow people between the ages of 55 and 65 to buy into Medicare. There was also a significant change in abortion coverage, which The Washington Post reported required hours of Schumer\u2019s and Reid\u2019s shuttling back and forth in Reid\u2019s offices between antiabortion Sen. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.) and key supporters of abortion rights, Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who never sat in the same room as Nelson. Some lawmakers, like the now-retired Nelson, cut special deals. Nelson negotiated enhanced Medicaid reimbursement for his state.\n\nOnce the deals were in hand, Reid on Dec. 19 revealed a manager\u2019s amendment revising the proposed bill, which was also scored by the CBO. He filed three successive cloture motions to end debate on the revised manager\u2019s amendment, on his original amendment and on the original House bill. He also filed three other amendments that had the effect of \u201cfilling the amendment tree\u201d \u2014 cutting off opportunities for the Republicans to alter the text.\n\nJust as McConnell appears to be determined to have a vote before the July 4 holiday so that lawmakers don\u2019t get nervous after confrontations with constituents, Reid pushed forward with a vote before Christmas. Republicans cried foul. \u201cI do not remember, in my 15 years in the Congress, both in the House and in the Senate, any major piece of legislation such as this being debated and ultimately brought to a final vote within such a short period of time,\u201d declared Saxby Chambliss, at the time a senator from Georgia.\n\nOver three successive days, the Senate took a series of votes, all of them split 60 to 39, to deal with Reid\u2019s various amendments. Washington was snowbound, and delaying tactics by Republicans meant votes took place as late as 1 a.m., forcing the 92-year-old, wheelchair-reliant Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) \u2014 who had missed 40 percent of the roll call votes that year \u2014 to make a late-night journey through the snow and ice. One Republican, Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), even offered a prayer to stall the vote. \u201cWhat the American people ought to pray is that somebody can\u2019t make the vote tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they ought to pray.\u201d (One housekeeping item: Renaming the Service Members Home Ownership Tax Act of 2009 to The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.)\n\nThe late David Broder, the fair-minded Washington Post columnist, was scathing in his criticism of the spectacle in a column headlined \u201cHealth Reform\u2019s Stench of Victory.\u201d Reid, he wrote, \u201creduced the negotiations to his own level of transactional morality. Incapable of summoning his colleagues to statesmanship, he made the deals look as crass and parochial as many of them were \u2014 encasing a historic achievement in a wrapping of payoff and patronage.\u201d\n\nBut recalling the second-longest Senate session obscures the fact that the floor debate was mostly for show, an exercise designed to allow the closed-door negotiations that shaped the final bill to take place. Once the deal was struck, Reid pushed the final draft forward with as much speed as possible. That\u2019s what McConnell is doing now, having skipped the preliminaries.", "lang": "en"}
