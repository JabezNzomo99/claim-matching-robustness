But today we are at Delhi\u2019s Jama Masjid and here Friday namaz is being offered as usual.\u201d The channel gave its viewers the impression that worshippers gathered at the mosque on Friday despite the lockdown imposed due to coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNews24 took down the video after it was pointed out that the broadcast was over a month old. It was first aired on March 13. In its response, the channel claimed that an \u201cold video was shared by mistake\u201d and that it can assure its users that this was \u201ctotally unintentional\u201d.\n\nHowever, several people downloaded the video and shared it on social media, believing that it is recent.\n\nThe channel claimed that it made a genuine mistake. But did it really?\n\n\u201cFool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me three times\u2026\u201d\n\nNews24 wasn\u2019t lying that the broadcast was first aired on March 13. However, it is difficult to believe that sharing the clip on April 17 was an inadvertent error when this was the third time that the same broadcast was uploaded after its initial airing.\n\nThe channel had also shared the broadcast on March 19 and on April 1. News24 conveniently misled its audience that worshippers unfazed by the coronavirus outbreak were gathering in large numbers at Delhi Jama Masjid, putting themselves and everybody else at risk.\n\nBelow is the broadcast in question.\n\nOn the initial date of upload \u2013 March 13 \u2013 coronavirus had not gained centre stage in mainstream media reports. In fact, the Union Ministry of Health had declared that it wasn\u2019t a health emergency. However, by March 19, when the channel reuploaded the broadcast for the first time, the Delhi government had banned all social, political and religious gatherings of more than 50 people. On April 1, when the video was reshared for the second time, the centre had announced a nationwide lockdown to tackle coronavirus. On April 17, as the channel uploaded it once again (and later took it down), the discourse around coronavirus had already taken an anti-Muslim shape after Nizamuddin Markaz was identified as a hotspot. News24\u2019s broadcast has a cumulative view count of over 6 million.", "lang": "en"}
