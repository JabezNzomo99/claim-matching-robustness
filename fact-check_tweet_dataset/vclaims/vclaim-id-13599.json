Remember the false claim that the Obamas had a \u201cHoliday tree\u201d instead of a Christmas tree?\n\nAnother hoax \u2014 purporting that the Nativity scene wasn\u2019t featured in White House decorations during the Obama administration \u2014 returned to Facebook in recent days, accruing tens of thousands of shares.\n\n\u201cMelania has brought back the Nativity scene to the White House. It was cast aside by the Obamas,\u201d a viral post reads, referring to first lady Melania Trump. \u201cWE THANK HER!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s false: The Obamas didn\u2019t remove the Nativity scene \u2014 as Snopes made clear in 2016 and as People magazine pointed out in 2017.\n\nWhile there was internal White House discussion during Obama\u2019s first year in office about inclusivity and whether to display the cr\u00e8che depicting Jesus\u2019 birth, it was ultimately placed in its usual location in the East Room that year. And quick internet searches show the Obamas continued to do so throughout his presidency.\n\nAn HGTV photo gallery of White House Christmas decorations in 2016, for example, shows the cr\u00e8che on display for the Obamas\u2019 last Christmas in office.\n\nAlso, a Trump administration announcement about this year\u2019s decorations noted the tradition of showcasing the cr\u00e8che is in its 51st year \u2014 which includes the eight years under Obama.\n\nThe cr\u00e8che \u2014 made of terra cotta and carved wood, and created in Naples, Italy, in the late 18th century \u2014 was given to the White House in 1967 by philanthropist and art collector Jane Engelhard. In 1978, Engelhard donated another 10 figures for the model and provided funds for a new tableau, first displayed in 1999.\n\nA similar Obama White House announcement about Christmas decor in 2015 also noted the cr\u00e8che is as an annual fixture in the East Room, calling it a \u201clong-standing holiday tradition.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201c2015 White House Holidays \u2013 A Timeless Tradition.\u201d Press release, White House, Office of the First Lady. 2 Dec 2015.", "lang": "en"}
