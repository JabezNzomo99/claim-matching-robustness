She was one of its researchers.\n\nThe study surveyed 292 Indian and 287 African women aged 18 to 70. The women were patients attending the general outpatient departments (excluding dermatological clinics) of two regional hospitals in the South African city of Durban. These were the RK Khan and Prince Mshiyeni Memorial hospitals, which the survey said served a large black African and Indian population.\n\n\u201cOf these 32.3% (131) had used skin\u2010lightening products (60% of Africans and 40% of Indians),\u201d the study found. Two thirds cited medical use, while the rest said they wanted to lighten their skin.\n\nIt added: \u201cMaking the broad assumption that our results broadly represent prevalence of use nationally, this would translate into considerably more than 4 million users among the African and Indian adult female population.\u201d\n\nWe asked Dlovo if the results of the study could represent skin bleaching use in all of South Africa.\n\nof skin bleaching globally published in 2019 in the\n\n.

But it didn\u2019t calculate a prevalence rate for South Africa.\n\n\u2018Difficult\u2019 to get South Africa\u2019s rate from study\n\nCalculating a rate for South Africa from the studies in this wider research was\n\n, the author of the meta-analysis and an associate professor at the\n\nThis is because \u201ctwo of the studies are old (1982, 1989) and the studies have methodical limitations such as design and sampling that limits their generalisability\u201d.\n\nelf-selection and 'patient samples' can exacerbate prevalence estimates,\u201d Sagoe said. \u201cThis is why it is important to distinguish between prevalence estimates for different sample types (such as the general population and patients).\u201d\n\nNo finding on how many women buy creams\n\noverall, the South African studies were good.

This is the pigment that gives skin its colour and helps protect it from the sun. \n\n\n\n While many substances go into them, Davids\u2019s paper the \u201cBig Four\u201d: mercury-containing compounds, hydroquinone and its derivatives, potent corticosteroids and retinoids. Skin lightening products containing mercury and hydroquinones the UK\u2019s National Health Service, many alternative skin-lightening products containing natural ingredients are available online and in shops without prescription. These are legal and unlikely to be harmful, but there's no guarantee they work.) \n\n\n\n Davids previously told Africa Check it was difficult to keep track of how much of the ingredients of interest were in skin lightening products in South Africa, whether legal or illegal. This is because the country\u2019s considers \u201cskin brighteners\u201d to be a cosmetic, not a drug. \n\n\n\n \u201cAs soon as you label something as a cosmetic it falls under the CTFA,\u201d Davids said. \n\n\n\n Products not always accessible for testing \n\n\n\n Products banned for their hydroquinone or mercury content were not \u201calways accessible for testing\u201d, he said.
