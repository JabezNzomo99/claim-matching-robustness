One is by sword. The other is by debt.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence Adams said or wrote the statement.\n\nOne of the founding fathers, Adams was a signer of the Declaration of Independence and later became the country\u2019s second president. He also drafted the Massachusetts Constitution. (RELATED: Did Thomas Jefferson Say, \u2018When The People Fear The Government, There Is Tyranny\u2019?)\n\nWhile Adams wrote and spoke on a variety of subjects during his lifetime, the Daily Caller found no evidence that he originated the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. A search of the Adams Family Papers, as well as another collection of his writings, yielded no results.\n\nSara Martin, the editor-in-chief of the Adams Papers at the Massachusetts Historical Society, told the Caller in an email, \u201cWhile the sentiment of this quotation is in keeping with John Adams, we have found no direct evidence that Adams ever wrote it.\u201d\n\nFurther adding to the dubiousness of the attribution, etymologist Barry Popik found that the quote has only appeared in print since 2002.", "lang": "en"}
