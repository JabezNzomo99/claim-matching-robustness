A site ostensibly named \"C. Chivalric\" hosted at pro-inside.website/fr/ published an article (archived here) titled \"L'acteur fran\u00e7ais Samy Naceri est mort aujourd'hui \u00e0 cause d'une maladie cardiaque. Il n'avait que 56 ans et \u00e9tait connu de tous apr\u00e8s son r\u00f4le dans le film TAXI.\" (Translation: \"French actor Samy Naceri died today due to heart disease. He was only 56 years old and was known to all after his role in the film TAXI.\"). It opened:\n\nOr, as Google Translate would say:\n\nToday at 12:33 pm, French actor Samy Nancer died, he suffered from heart disease for four years and recently the situation became critical. He died in the hospital, the doctors did everything to save him. The actor became famous after he played the role of a taxi driver in the movie TAXI.\n\nThe hoax spread quickly because the site was using a popup urging visitors to share the hoax on Facebook to be able to see the rest of the page:\n\nThis seems similar to the Mr. Bean death hoax we covered a while ago which used a similar tactic to spread itself. Although this time it seems the site is operated from Romania instead of the Philippines: if you vary the number after 'id=' in the URL of the article you get a surprising number of articles in Romanian. The domain name appears to have been registered anonymouslly via a Russian domain registrar only a week or so ago. The main page of the website currently seems to redirect to Google.\n\nMeanwhile the actor has already told his Twitter followers that the rumor is false:\n\nTranslation: \"Yes exactly a false rumour again I'm in great shape in Russia for the presentation of my next short film!\"\n\nSo if you encounter people on social media spreading this hoax as real, send them over here to learn the truth. Judging by the Trendolizer graph it seems the rumor got quite some traction on Facebook already.", "lang": "en"}
