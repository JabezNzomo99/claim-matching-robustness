In this particular case, the meme makes a dubious claim about PepsiCo production of Mountain Dew, a popular soft drink. (RELATED: Hoax Claims That Pepsi Products Are Infected With HIV)\n\n\u201cDue to the increased evidence of drinking our line of Mtn Dew (sic) products has been shown to adversely affect health over long periods of use, we have decided to discontinue production of these products,\u201d the post credits PepsiCo Chief Product Officer Niwrad Eiknarf with saying. \u201cProduction will cease as of June 31, 2020 and availability will be limited to stock on hand until it is deplenished.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Caller didn\u2019t find media reports of parent company PepsiCo cancelling the Mountain Dew product line. There isn\u2019t any mention of such action in PepsiCo\u2019s 2019 proxy statement or other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. PepsiCo hasn\u2019t published a press release announcing the move either.\n\nFurther adding to the post\u2019s dubiousness, PepsiCo details its executive officers on its corporate leadership page, and chief product officer is not one of the positions listed there. Eiknarf appears to be a fictional character.\n\nKristen Mueller, a spokeswoman for PepsiCo, told the Caller that the post was \u201cnot true whatsoever.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control recommends limiting consumption of soft drinks and other sugar-sweetened beverages. Frequent intake of these drinks can increase the risk of contracting a number of negative health conditions, including obesity, diabetes and tooth decay, according to the Harvard School of Public Health.", "lang": "en"}
