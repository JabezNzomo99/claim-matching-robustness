He expressed frustration that \u201cChina and India didn\u2019t have to take any steps with CO2 reductions until the year 2030,\u201d before asserting that the United States was a leader in reducing carbon emissions.\n\nRegular readers of The Fact Checker may remember we gave Pruitt Four Pinocchios for this talking point on China and India, yet he trotted it out again to deflect from his position on climate change. And this time he added to the claim, citing statistics on the United States\u2019 progress toward reducing emissions.\n\nIn 2015, CO2 emissions in the United States decreased 2.6 percent, following increases of 1.8 percent and 1.1 percent in 2013 and 2014, respectively, according to a 2016 report by the Netherlands Environment Assessment Agency. China and India, two of the largest carbon-dioxide emitters, in 2015 saw a 0.7 percent reduction and a 5.1 percent increase, respectively.\n\nIn other words, Pruitt is picking the data metric that puts his talking point in the best possible light, even if means he is not consistently using the same metric. But he obscures that fact by failing to clarify that he\u2019s shifting metrics.\n\nWhile the 2015 reductions put the United States ahead of China and India, the numbers aren\u2019t the best comparison. That\u2019s because China and India are much larger than the United States. Using a per capita measure helps to normalize the emissions numbers, based on population, to account for the vast size difference.\n\nChina and India both are home to more than 1.3 billion people. The U.S. population is only one-quarter of that \u2014 about 325 million. On a per capita basis, the United States produced 16.5 metric tons of CO2 in 2014, according to the World Bank. China produced 7.5 metric tons and India produced 1.7 metric tons.\n\nBy this measure, the United States produced more than double the emissions of China and eight times more than India. The United States has a long way to go to bring per capita emissions in line with China and India, yet Pruitt twists this metric to make it seem as if the United States is not such a big emitter of CO2.\n\nIn 2014, Texas was the largest emitter of CO2, releasing more than 600 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Wyoming, in contrast, emitted under 100 million metric tons. Yet even though Texas produced six times more CO2 than Wyoming, Wyoming is the highest per capita emitter. That\u2019s because Texas is home to 27 million people, while Wyoming has fewer than 600,000. Winters are also much colder in Wyoming than Texas, increasing the need for electricity and other fuel sources to keep warm through the cold months.\n\nAdditionally, some states saw significant reductions in carbon emissions while others experienced only a minimal decrease. The average obscures whether the country\u2019s biggest emitters saw a significant reduction in CO2 emissions, which is a more telling measure. For example, the District of Columbia produced 3.0 million metric tons of CO2 in 2014, the least of the District and the 50 states. From 2000-2014, the District\u2019s emissions decreased 30 percent, one of the largest declines. Meanwhile, Texas produced 641 million metric tons in 2014, the largest of the 50 states. From 2000-2014, Texas reduced its emissions by just 1.6 percent.\n\nUltimately, the data show Pruitt is overselling the reductions. We sought to clarify Pruitt\u2019s data points with the EPA, but officials did not provide much of an explanation. When asked if Pruitt misspoke and left out the word \u201cper capita\u201d during the Fox interview, an EPA spokesperson reiterated the fact that he was referring to per capita emissions.\n\nPruitt claims the United States is leading the way in reducing its carbon footprint, decreasing emissions by 18 percent from 2000-2014. But he is misrepresenting the data. The United States may have had the largest decrease in carbon emissions, but it is still one of the largest per capita emitters. And when it comes to overall carbon emissions reductions, Pruitt uses the average per capita decrease instead of the overall decrease, without actually making clear he\u2019s talking about per capita numbers.\n\nWe wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios, but settled on Three. Since Pruitt\u2019s staff refused to say he misspoke, using the per capita figure to tout an overall decrease appears to be a deliberate effort to mislead the public.", "lang": "en"}
