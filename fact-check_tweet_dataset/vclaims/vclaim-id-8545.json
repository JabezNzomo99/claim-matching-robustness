The ticket agent informed him he would have to pay 55 dollars to bring it on board. I stepped in and said you are going to charge this kid in the army 55 dollars to bring his army uniform on the plane? HER EXACT WORDS WERE WE DO NOT CATER TO THE MILITARY. My son replied when i fly in on American or Delta they do not charge me, in fact they ask me if they can hang it up for me and tell me thanks for your service and flying with us. I have called Spirit and trying talking with them it's like talking to a wall. I am fighting this as far as i can go, they have lost fares from everyone in my family and i am sure when this gets out they will lose a lot more from the military that travel their airlines. I hope people reading this will please share it on their face book pages, Thank You , John Hucul\n\nOn 21 October 2015, Facebook user John Hucul published the above-reproduced comment to a Facebook page called \u201cSpirit Airlines Sucks.\u201d According to Hucul\u2019s account, his son traveled with Spirit Airlines out of Detroit on 16 October 2015 for military leave. Hucul\u2019s (unnamed) serviceman son reportedly encountered an unexpected charge of $55 for a garment bag containing his dress attire and when the elder Hucul complained to the airline, a rep told him Spirit \u201c[does] not cater to the military.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cSpirit Airlines Sucks\u201d appeared to be a long-abandoned page created by a once-disgruntled flyer, tens of thousands of users found and shared Hucul\u2019s comment. A number of Facebook users subsequently took to the page to express disapproval with the airline\u2019s actions (as reported by Hucul) even though it was not officially affiliated with Spirit. We found no official Facebook page linked to Spirit Airlines on which the rumor had yet been officially addressed.\n\nHucul\u2019s comment wasn\u2019t the only social media complaint about Spirit Airlines, military personnel, and bags. Several tweets sent prior to the popular Facebook post referenced the purported policy (or lack thereof):\n\nA page on Spirit Airlines\u2019 web site verifies that the carrier does not offer military discounts (for standard fares):\n\nAn undated page on the carrier\u2019s web site confirmed that Spirit Air offered hundreds of free flights for \u201cwounded warriors and their families,\u201d adding:\n\nFor active duty military traveling on Spirit, we will provide two free checked bags and a free carry-on, in addition to the already free personal item. The military member should arrive early enough to have their bags checked at the counter, and present their military ID.\n\nWe contacted both Spirit Airlines and Hucul in an attempt to verify details of the claim and will update this page if we receive responses.", "lang": "en"}
