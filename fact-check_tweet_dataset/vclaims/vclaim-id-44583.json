Trump Facebook page did post such a video. The video features a troupe of Ghanian pallbearers who have gone viral for performing exuberant dance routines while carrying coffins at funerals.\n\nThe video posted to Trump\u2019s Facebook page shows Biden stating, \u201cIf you have a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t Black.\u201d It then shows the dancing pallbearers video with Biden\u2019s campaign logo superimposed on the coffin.\n\nBiden stirred controversy for making that remark during an interview with Charlamagne tha God on \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d radio show. He later apologized.\n\nBecause this video was posted to Trump\u2019s verified Facebook page, we rate the claim \u201cTrue.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
