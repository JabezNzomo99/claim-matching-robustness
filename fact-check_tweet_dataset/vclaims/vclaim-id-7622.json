That seems to be Trump\u2019s view. But it could also mean illegal immigration is declining, because border-crossers are being caught in greater numbers. Looked at another way, if the number of apprehensions went down, would that reflect fewer attempts to cross the border or U.S. officials failing to catch as many people as before?\n\n\u201cWhile DHS employs a number of concrete metrics to track border security operations, it is difficult to precisely quantify illegal flows because illegal border crossers actively seek to evade detection, and some flows are undetected,\u201d said the DHS report, which was issued partly in response to a Trump executive order on immigration. \u201cAs a result, any effort to quantify illegal flows or calculate an overall enforcement success rate must rely on one or more estimation techniques. Measurement is also difficult because of the diversity and complexity of the enforcement mission along the United States\u2019 2,000-mile land border with Mexico.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Trump noted the border numbers were lower under [chief of staff and former Homeland Security Secretary John] Kelly and wondered aloud why Nielsen could not perform as well, according to these officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private meeting. As illegal crossings are once more on the rise and Trump hears a cascade of criticism from conservative allies, Nielsen finds herself on the receiving end of the president\u2019s visceral anger about immigration, seeing the issue as the reason he won in 2016 and a key to his politicking ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nA 2011 study by the Rand Corp., commissioned by the Department of Homeland Security, explores this paradox. A lower number of apprehensions could mean border-crossers are staying away for fear of being caught, but it could also mean authorities are catching fewer and, therefore, that more are settling in the United States. The inverse of this is that \u201cincreases in border control effectiveness could well increase the number of apprehensions, without such increases signaling greater flow of illegal crossers,\u201d according to the Rand study, which recommended other ways to measure border agents\u2019 performance.\n\n\u201cApprehensions are insufficient as sole measures of effectiveness because they count activity or workload, not persons,\u201d Meissner testified in 2013. \u201cIn the past, the Border Patrol has cited both surges and reductions of apprehensions as evidence of deterrence. Apprehensions are a valid proxy for reduced flows and deterrence, particularly when they demonstrate a trend, as has occurred with the steep apprehension declines in recent years. However, they do not provide an estimate of the total size of the illegal flow. More sophisticated, valid measures for estimating actual flows across the border are long overdue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe number of border apprehensions is the best publicly available measure of the federal government\u2019s effectiveness in preventing unauthorized crossings, but it is only a partial snapshot of what CBP uses internally to measure its effectiveness and direct its enforcement strategies,\u201d Mittelstadt said. For example, she said, the agency also collects data on \u201c \u2018turnbacks\u2019 (people deterred from illicit entry because of the presence of the Border Patrol or other deterrence) and \u2018gotaways\u2019 (those who are counted making their way into the U.S.).\u201d", "lang": "en"}
