I don\u2019t know, I Close my Eyes when I masterbate (sic).\u201d It is dated May 6, 2014.\n\nTwitter displays 3,200 of a user\u2019s most recent tweets by way of scrolling ( here ). As of July 23 2020, the oldest tweet available to view on Cox\u2019s profile this way is from November 2014 ( here ).\n\nThe only tweet from May 6, 2014 that Reuters could find through Google and Twitter search was in reference to Cox\u2019s role in the television series Friends ( here ). A Twitter search of Cox\u2019s tweets and the word \u201cbaby\u201d does not bring up the tweet in the claims ( here ).\n\nThe tweet has spelling and punctuation errors. If the tweet were authentic, it would have gathered a lot of attention at the time, especially given the alleged number of likes and retweets shown in the tweet in the posts. No major news organizations reported on this. Google searches of the tweet only bring up social media posts with the screenshot and meme pages. Reuters could not find a version of this tweet, nor an archived link.\n\nAn archived version of Cox\u2019s Twitter page closest to May 2014 shows that her tweets around that time had significantly fewer retweets and likes than the tweet in the claim, further indicating it is fabricated ( here )\n\nThe tweet was most likely created on a tweet generator website, such as the one here , where people can enter information to imitate any user.\n\nFalse. There is no evidence to show this tweet ever existed.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our fact-checking work here .", "lang": "en"}
