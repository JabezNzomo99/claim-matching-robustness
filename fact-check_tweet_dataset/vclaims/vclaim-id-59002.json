{"title": "FALSE: Video of Filipino personalities supporting anti-terror law", "subtitle": "The video was altered. The original video directed by Chuck Gutierrez advocated to junk the anti-terrorism law.", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Jul 14, 2020 4:21 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-59002", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/video-filipino-personalities-supporting-anti-terror-law", "vclaim": "The caption also included the line, \"Mga kababayan, sa ngalan ng demokrasya, magkaisa tayo (Fellow countrymen, in the name of democracy, let us unite)!\" The post also used the hashtags #JunkTerrorism, #UnitedForDemocracy, and #SupportAntiTerrorLaw.\n\nOn July 5, Voyage Studios premiered the original video on YouTube, entitled, \"The Great Dictator Speech #JunkTerrorLaw #UnitedForDemocracy.\" Rody Vera translated the speech to Filipino, and Gutierrez directed and edited the video, which featured artists, politicians, and public figures from different sectors.\n\nVera's translation of the speech is in the YouTube caption. The speech does not make any remarks about terrorists, or any remarks in support of the Anti-Terrorism Law. Chaplin's original speech also did not include any mention of terrorists, but instead spoke out against dictators. The altered video replaced several statements to condemn terrorists and support the anti-terror law.\n\nOne altered line in the video was John Lloyd Cruz's opening, which was dubbed \"Kinalulungkot ko, pero ayoko maging terorista. Hindi 'yan ang gusto ko.\" (It saddens me, but I don't want to be a terrorist. This is not what I want.) In the original video, he said, \"diktador (dictator)\" instead of terorista.\n\nGascon actually said this quote in the original video: \"Labis tayong mag-isip, na halos nawala na ang ating damdamin (We think excessively to the point that we have almost lost our empathy).\"\n\nThe manipulated video also dubbed human rights lawyer Chel Diokno who was made to sound like he was saying, \"Higit sa katalinuhan, kagandahang-loob ang kailangan, support anti-terror law (More than intelligence, kindness is needed, support the anti-terror law).\"\n\nFinally, the dubbed video ended with all the personalities saying \"Suportahan natin ang anti-terror law (Let us support the anti-terror law).\" The original video ended with them saying, \"Magkaisa tayo (Let us unite)!\"", "lang": "en"}
