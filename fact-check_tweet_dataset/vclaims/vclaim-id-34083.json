The publication distributed the two editions to different markets to manipulate readers, it claims.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal printed the two versions with different headlines to meet delivery schedules and to reflect developing news, not to manipulate readers. The one on the left was published before President Donald Trump gave a campaign speech, while the one on the right was published after. The newspapers likely went to distinct geographical areas, as different editions get printed on a distance-based delivery schedule.\n\nThe Facebook post, which features two editions of the Wall Street Journal that appear to have the same story but opposing headlines, suggests that the publication distributed them to different markets to influence readers. Both newspapers have the same photograph of Trump, the then-Republican presidential candidate, shaking hands with then-Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto on their front-pages.\n\n\u201cTrump softens his tone,\u201d reads the headline of the newspaper on the left.\n\nThe other headline reads, \u201cTrump Talks Tough on Wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cSame paper. Same story. Same day. Different regions. Different message,\u201d reads the post\u2019s caption.\u201dStill think you\u2019re not being manipulated by media? Think again\u2026\u201d (RELATED: Was Tulsi Gabbard \u2018Labeled\u2019 A \u2018Right-Wing Extremist\u2019 By The New York Times?)\n\nColleen Schwartz, the vice president of communications at the Wall Street Journal, told the Daily Caller in an email that the images represent two different editions of the newspaper published at different times to meet distance-based delivery schedules. Both versions of the story appeared in print on Sept. 1, 2016.\n\n\u201cThere are different editions of the Journal printed at different times during the evening in order to meet delivery demands,\u201d Schwartz explained in an email. \u201cThis often means that the content is updated to reflect new reporting on news and events as they evolve. The different editions are distinguishable by the number of stars in the upper right corner (under the L in Journal).\u201d\n\nThe edition on the left has two stars, while the edition on the right has four stars. That means the newspaper on the left was printed earlier than the one on the right.\n\nNewspaper editions are printed and distributed to different areas based on how long it takes for the papers to get from the printing plants to their destinations, meaning editions going to areas farther away get printed earlier and those going to closer areas get printed later with more up-to-date news. The newspapers in the Facebook post show two different versions of the same story because the story was still developing after the earlier edition\u2019s print deadline, according to Schwartz.\n\nTrump traveled to Mexico City to meet with Nieto on Aug. 31, 2016, according to NPR. He gave a speech at a campaign rally stop in Phoenix later that same day. Both stories in the pictured editions covered these events to varying extents, as well as using the same Reuters picture.

The headlines represent the news at the time of the publication \u2013 before and after his speech,\u201d added Schwartz.\n\nSimilar claims about this photograph of the Wall Street Journal editions have been circulating online since 2016, according to Schwartz.", "lang": "en"}
