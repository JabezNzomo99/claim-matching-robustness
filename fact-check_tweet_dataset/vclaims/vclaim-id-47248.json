In the post, it is mentioned that these tweets were later on deleted by him for some unknown reason. Let\u2019s verify the authenticity of the tweets in the post.\n\nClaim: Screenshots of tweets made by actor Sushanth Singh Rajput before his suicide on 14 June 2020. Fact: The tweets in the screenshot weren\u2019t made by Sushanth Singh Rajput. Multiple inconsistencies in the format can be noticed in these tweets when compared with a standard tweet. So, the tweets in the screenshot are digitally created using a tool like \u2018Photoshop\u2019. Hence the claim made is FALSE.\n\nWhen the tweets in the screenshot are carefully observed, one can notice the following differences \u2013\n\u2022 The alignment of text and profile picture is not the same in all the tweets, and is not consistent with the format of a normal tweet.\n\u2022 The date and time stamp format in these tweets is also different from a normal tweet. \u2018am\u2019 and \u2018jun\u2019 we notice in the timestamp of these tweets should actually be \u2018AM\u2019 and \u2018Jun\u2019.\n\u2022 The tweets in the screenshot are not part of a thread but still have the same time (5:43) on them.\n\nSo, the tweets in the screenshot are fake and could have been digitally created using a tool like \u2018Photoshop\u2019. These fake tweets are being shared as the last tweets of actor Sushanth Singh Rajput before his death.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
