The claim is false; the image has been doctored from a sample of a US employment card to include a photo of Wong; the activist has confirmed he does not have a green card, and that both the Chinese and romanised versions of his name on the manipulated image are wrong.\n\nThe misleading post was published here on Facebook on December 8, 2019. It has been shared more than 600 times.\n\nThe image in the post shows a purported green card for Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong Chi-fung.\n\nA green card is officially called a Permanent Resident Card, which allows an individual to live and work permanently in the United States.\n\nThe text above Wong\u2019s image on the purported card states: \u201cEMPLOYMENT AUTHORIZATION CARD\u201d, \u201cZhi\u00b7Feng Huang\u201d.\n\nOn the right-hand side, the traditional Chinese characters in red translate to English as: \u201cWong Chi-fung's green card\".\n\nThe traditional Chinese-language caption above the purported green card translates to English as: \u201cIrrefutable evidence of Joshua Wong receiving money from the US government, messing up Hong Kong, and emigrating to the US!!!!!\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe same image was published with a similar claim here and here on Facebook and here on the Hong Kong Discuss Forum.\n\nThe claim is false; the image has been doctored to include a photo of Wong on a sample of an employment card published online by the US National Immigration Law Center (NILC).\n\nA keyword search on Google found this article, updated on July 15, 2015, on the website of the NILC, an American organisation aimed at \"defending and advancing the rights of immigrants with low income\".\n\nThe article, titled \"FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS, DACA and Your Workplace Rights\", has a designated section providing information on the employment authorisation document (EAD).\n\nUnder the \"What is an EAD, exactly?\" section, an image of an EAD card corresponds with the doctored card in the misleading posts.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the misleading Facebook image (L) and the sample card (R) published by the NILC, with corresponding parts highlighted in red by AFP:\n\nOn December 10, 2019, Joshua Wong posted this response on his verified Facebook page, denying the claim that he is a US green card holder.\n\nHe also pointed out a mistake with the last character of his Chinese name in the misleading post, and the fact that the romanised version of his name should spell \"Wong Chi Fung\", not \"Zhi Feng Huang\".\n\n\"Wong Chi-fung\" represents the romanised version of the activist's name in Cantonese, which is commonly spoken in Hong Kong.\n\nOn the other hand, \"Zhi Feng Huang\" is the Pinyin version of Wong's name. Pinyin is the romanisation system for Standard Chinese, or Mandarin, in mainland China.\n\nAnother keyword search on Google found the photo of Wong on the purported green card published here by Hong Kong newspaper Oriental Daily News on July 28, 2012.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading Facebook image (L) and the one published by Oriental Daily News (R):", "lang": "en"}
