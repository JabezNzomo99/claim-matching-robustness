Harris, Smollett Are Related", "subtitle": "", "author": "www.factcheck.org", "date": "2019-02-28T13:40:12+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-20173", "url": "https://www.factcheck.org/2019/02/no-evidence-sen-harris-smollett-are-related/", "vclaim": "Viral posts have erroneously claimed that Sen. Kamala Harris is the aunt of \u201cEmpire\u201d actor Jussie Smollett, who police have accused of faking a hate crime.\n\nThe evolving case of Jussie Smollett \u2014 who Chicago police say falsely reported to be a victim of a hate-crime attack \u2014 has prompted some prominent Democrats to revisit their earlier words of support for the \u201cEmpire\u201d actor.\n\nAmong them is Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who originally called the reported attack an \u201cattempted modern day lynching.\u201d She has since said the new developments in the Smollett case left her \u201csad, frustrated, and disappointed.\u201d\n\nSocial media conspiracy theories, however, have tried to further link the presidential contender with Smollett by erroneously claiming that she is his aunt.\n\nBefore she was married, Janet Smollett, Jussie\u2019s mother, had the same common last name as the senator, Harris, according to California birth information for Jussie Smollett. But that\u2019s not evidence they are sisters.\n\nKamala Harris, who kept her maiden name, has only one sister, Maya Harris, according to an obituary for their mother, Shyamala Harris, and multiple profiles documenting the senator\u2019s political rise.\n\nChicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told FactCheck.org in an email: \u201cWe have no information on Mr. Smollett being related to Senator Harris.\u201d\n\nLikewise, we could find no support for any familial connection between Jussie Smollett and Kamala Harris\u2019 husband, Douglas Emhoff.\n\nSome of the posts present the fictitious family allegation within another claim cast without evidence. \u201cIt\u2019s been reported Chicago police found on Jussie\u2019s phone records that, just before the \u2018attack\u2019, he was in contact with Booker and his Aunt, Kamala Harris,\u201d those posts say. \u201cBooker\u201d is an apparent reference to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, another Democratic candidate for president, who also initially issued a statement of support for Smollett.\n\nThe posts go on to claim the alleged false attack was \u201cOrchestrated from the TOP.\u201d\n\nWe could find no reporting that corroborates that account. Guglielmi told us that, \u201cgiven this case is now pending trial, I cannot comment on or confirm or deny any specific evidence we may or may not have.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nHarris, Kamala (@Kamala Harris). \u201c.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I\u2019m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.\u201d Twitter. 29 Jan 2019.\n\nHarris, Kamala (@Kamala Harris). \u201cLike most of you, I\u2019ve seen the reports about Jussie Smollett, and I\u2019m sad, frustrated, and disappointed.\u201d Twitter. 21 Feb 2019.", "lang": "en"}
