It does, though there are \u201cisolated incidents\u201d of \u201csome ballots not being postmarked,\u201d as a Postal Service official recently explained in a government report.\n\nWayne Thorley, Nevada\u2019s deputy secretary of state for elections, told us more than 450,000 ballots votes were cast via prepaid mail-in ballots during the primary election in June, and all of them included a postmark. In fact, more than 5,000 ballots were rejected statewide because they were postmarked after June 9 primary, he said.\n\nGidley made his remarks in an interview with CNN\u2019s Michael Smerconish on Aug. 8.\n\nGidley, Aug. 8: I mean, listen, here at the campaign, we are concerned about voter fraud in this election, in part because in so many states Democrats are now suing to allow votes to come in after Election Day. Nevada is a great example of that and so when you\u2019re talking about the potential for fraud, Nevada is going to be the poster child for it in this way. When they are going to send out 2 million ballots in the mail to their voters, they\u2019re also putting out envelopes that are prepaid with postage already on them. Now, the post office doesn\u2019t date those with a postmark because they\u2019re already prepaid. That means anyone could wake up on Wednesday morning, see that they don\u2019t like the results and then go drop their ballots in the mail. It won\u2019t receive a postal date stamp on it and so it has three days by Nevada law to actually get to the \u2014 to the location of the courthouse and then to be counted. That is the potential for massive fraud. Not to mention the fact if you mail it in before the date of the election and it is postmarked with a date, they still give you several days after that, seven days in fact, for it to count toward the candidate you want too. So the potential for the election to change days later in Nevada is very real and that\u2019s one of the things we\u2019re most concerned about.\n\nNevada is among several states that have changed state law to expand mail-in voting in response to the coronavirus pandemic. As they did in the primary, Nevada lawmakers passed legislation in early August to send mail-in ballots to all registered voters. And those ballots will come with return envelopes that include prepaid postage.\n\nAccording to Nevada law, in order to be counted, ballots must be postmarked on or before the day of the election and received by the elections clerk not later than seven days after the election. (Section 20.1b). Although most states require that absentee or mail-in ballots be received by the close of Election Day, Nevada is among the 18 states that allow ballots received in the days after the election to be counted, provided they are postmarked by Election Day, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nHowever, there is another provision in Nevada law that particularly concerns Trump campaign officials.\n\nAccording to the law, \u201cIf a mail ballot is received by mail not later than 5 p.m. on the third day following the election and the date of the postmark cannot be determined, the mail ballot shall be deemed to have been postmarked on or before the day of the election.\u201d (Sec. 20.2)\n\nIn other words, if the postmark is smudged or the date unreadable, the ballot would be counted even if it is received up to three days after the election. In addition, if the ballot had no discernible postmark at all, Thorley told us, it would also be counted if it is received up to three days after the election.\n\nThe Trump campaign filed a lawsuit against the Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske claiming a new election law, which passed along partisan lines, would \u201cundermine the November election\u2019s integrity.\u201d (Cegavske, a Republican, actually opposed the revised procedures, but the law was passed by the Democratic-controlled state Senate and Assembly, and the law was signed by Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak.) Among law\u2019s provisions challenged by the Trump campaign was the one that would allow ballots without postmarks to be counted if received within three days of the election.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the law \u201cmakes it likely that most mail ballots will lack a legible postmark showing when voters mailed them\u201d because the law \u201cinstructs county and city clerks to send mail ballots to voters along with \u2018a return envelope\u2019 that \u2018must include postage pre-paid by first-class mail.\u2019 \u2026 The U.S. Postal Service generally does not apply postmarks to postage prepaid envelopes.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit cites a postal service handbook document about postmarks which states, \u201cPostmarks are not required for mailings bearing a permit, meter, or precanceled stamp for postage, nor to pieces with an indicia applied by various postage evidencing systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo for the vast majority of mail ballots, election officials will not be able to rely on a postmark date to determine when voters cast them because most mail ballots will not have a postmark at all,\u201d the lawsuit states, \u201cInstead, the only objective indicator of whether voters have timely cast their mail ballots before Election Day will be whether elections officials received them on or before Election Day.\u201d\n\nIn counties where mail is delivered quickly, ballots sent on the \u201cWednesday or Thursday after Election Day will likely be received \u2026 before 5 p.m. on the Friday after election without bearing a postmark,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cUnder Section 20.2, those ballots must be counted. Section 20.2 thus effectively extends the congressionally established Election Day.\u201d\n\nBut the handbook cited in the lawsuit doesn\u2019t apply to postmarks for election mail, which is treated differently.\n\nIn fact, the Postal Service policy is to postmark all ballots. According to a July report from the USPS\u2019 Office of Inspector General, a postal service memo issued in 2018 \u201cstates that all ballots should be postmarked by machine or by hand.\u201d (See footnote 8 in the IG report.)\n\nThe IG report came in response to some issues that arose with the handling of absentee ballots in the Wisconsin primary election in April. Initially, election officials did not include 390 absentee ballots (out of nearly 1 million) in the official count, because the return envelopes lacked postmarks or the postmarks were illegible. According to the report, \u201cThe Postal Service worked with the election office after the election to help determine the validity of postmarks and was able to validate all but about 40 postmarks.\u201d\n\nIn response to the IG report, David E. Williams, CEO and executive VP of the USPS, and Salvatore N. Vacca, acting VP of the USPS\u2019 Great Lakes Area, wrote that while \u201cThe Postal Service\u2019s policy provides that all returned ballots must be postmarked,\u201d they acknowledged there are \u201cisolated incidents\u201d from \u201cbreakdowns or exceptions in the postmark process\u201d that \u201cmay lead to some ballots not being postmarked.\u201d (See Appendix A of IG report.)\n\nIn New York\u2019s April primary election, thousands of ballots did not get postmarks, despite USPS policy stating that they should, according to a federal judge who ruled there was evidence the ballots were mailed on time and should be counted.\n\nTurning its attention to the 2020 general election and a nationwide view, the Postal Service IG report acknowledged that, \u201cthere can be breakdowns or exceptions to this process which would prevent a ballot from receiving a postmark. For example, ballots may be double fed on a machine, machines applying postmarks may run out of ink, or ballots may be comingled with certain mail that is not processed on machinery that applies a postmark.\u201d\n\nAmong the IG\u2019s recommendations were that the postal service use Intelligent Mail Barcode on ballot envelopes to help track and verify the ballots.\n\nCharles Stewart III, a political science professor at MIT who specializes in elections, said that while a ballot that has a postage-paid indication and is marked as election mail should get a postmark, \u201cnot all postal workers know this rule, and therefore a lot of pre-paid postal mail doesn\u2019t get postmarked.\u201d\n\nStewart also advocates for use of intelligent barcodes that have the date the piece entered the mail stream. \u201cA few states explicitly acknowledge the intelligent bar code, but most don\u2019t, and so it\u2019s a bit of the wild west there,\u201d Stewart told us via email.\n\nComplicating the issue is that President Donald Trump \u2014 an outspoken critic of expanded mail-in voting \u2014 has said he opposes extra funding to allow the postal service to prepare for an expected surge in mail-in voting in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn an Aug. 13 interview, Trump said that he opposes a coronavirus pandemic relief bill crafted by the House Democrats because it includes funding the Postal Service and state election officials. Without the funding, Trump said, \u201cyou can\u2019t have universal mail-in voting because they\u2019re not equipped to have it.\u201d\n\nRegardless, Thorley, Nevada\u2019s deputy secretary of state for elections, told us via email that Gidley\u2019s claim is flawed as it relates to Nevada because ballots with prepaid postage do get postmarks. And, he said, the proof came in the primary election in June, when Nevada also sent out prepaid mail-in ballots to all registered voters.\n\n\u201cTwo months ago we had a statewide primary election in Nevada, and for that election we mailed all registered voters a ballot and a postage prepaid ballot return envelope,\u201d Thorley said. \u201cOver 450,000 people voted by mail at our June primary election, and all the ballots that were returned by mail using the postage prepaid ballot return envelope included a dated postmark from USPS. There were a handful of one-off issues where a ballot originally didn\u2019t include a dated postmark, but we were able to contact USPS and get those ballots postmarked prior to counting.\n\n\u201cIt is simply untrue to claim a Nevada voter can wait until the day after the election to cast their ballot and expect to have their ballot counted,\u201d he added. \u201cFor our primary election, 5,355 ballots were rejected because they were postmarked after June 9, so ballots are definitely being postmarked.\u201d\n\nThorley said Nevada election officials contacted national and local USPS representatives prior to the primary to \u201clet them know about the postmark requirement in our state law, and they said that is not a problem \u2026 Mail ballots in Nevada are definitely postmarked.\u201d\n\nThorley said, based on the law, election officials would count a ballot that bore no postmark if it were received within three days of the election.\n\n\u201cBut again that would be the rare exception,\u201d Thorley said. \u201cIf your plan is to wait until the day after the election to vote, then I can say with almost 100 percent certainty your ballot won\u2019t be counted.\u201d\n\nJessica A. Levinson, a professor who specializes in election law at Loyola Law School in California, agreed.\n\n\u201cTheoretically, a voter could vote the morning after Election Day, put it in the mail and pray for an ineligible postmark and quick delivery,\u201d Levinson told us via email. \u201cThis is not exactly a scenario ripe for fraud and abuse.\u201d\n\nIn short, there is a theoretical possibility that a small number of votes cast after Election Day could be counted \u2014 provided they were stamped with an unreadable postmark, or got no postmark at all, and were delivered quickly by the postal service.\n\nBut Gidley\u2019s warning about the \u201cpotential for massive fraud\u201d assumes that ballots with prepaid postage would not get a postmark. And in the primary election in Nevada in June, almost all of them did.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
