We have examined before her assertion about chief executives\u2019 pay, giving her One Pinocchio, and noted that it stems from a survey about chief executives at the top 350 U.S. firms in terms of sales. So when she refers to the \u201caverage American CEO,\u201d as she did on May 18, she gets into trouble because the average CEO makes a little more than $200,000 a year, compared with $15 million for the top-tier brass.\n\nWe initially started to examine the comment made on May 18. But since we don\u2019t play gotcha at The Fact Checker, we will look at her statement on May 19, since that\u2019s apparently how she was supposed to say it.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s define the terms under discussion. The marginal tax rate is what a person pays on each additional dollar that they earn. The effective tax rate is the percentage of income that a person pays in taxes, after deductions, exemptions and so forth. Since the tax system is progressive, the tax rates increase as income increases, so not every dollar is taxed at the marginal rate.\n\nThe Clinton campaign indicated that the former secretary of state is talking about marginal tax rates. Hedge fund managers are able to have much of their income taxed at the capital gains rate, rather than as ordinary income, through a tax provision known as carried interest. During his presidency, President Obama has boosted the long-term capital-gains rate for high earners (above $400,000) from 15 percent to 20 percent, plus added a 3.8 percent surcharge to bolster Medicare, so that\u2019s a rate of almost 24 percent. (The top income tax rate, by contrast, is 39.6 percent, so being taxed at the capital gains rate is still a savings. Gains from securities held less than a year are taxed as regular income but some hedge funds have found ways around that.)\n\nThe nurse\u2019s salary falls into the $37,451 to $90,751 range for single filers and the $50,201 to $129,600 range for head-of-household filers who will be taxed at a 25 percent tax rate in 2015. The truck driver\u2019s salary falls into the $37,451 to $90,751 range for single filers to be taxed at 25 percent.\n\nIn theory, for $2,450 of his pay, that truck driver (if single) paid a 25 percent income tax rate; before that, he paid 10 percent (on the first $9,225) and 15 percent (on the amount between $9,226 and $37,451). But let\u2019s not forget that this truck driver can take a personal exemption ($4,000) and a standard deduction ($6,300), which would drop his income back into the 15 percent tax bracket.\n\nWhen all is said and done, the truck driver would owe about $4,000 in federal income tax, for an effective tax rate of less than 10 percent. Even the nurse, with more of her salary subject to the 25 percent rate, would have an effective tax rate of less than 15 percent.\n\nBut the effective tax rate paid is a more logical way to compare the differing tax rates, given that capital gains rates are not progressive; every capital-gains dollar is taxed at the same rate. (After all, Clinton spoke about the rate that people paid.) Under that method, Clinton\u2019s claim becomes a stretch, even when adding in payroll taxes.", "lang": "en"}
