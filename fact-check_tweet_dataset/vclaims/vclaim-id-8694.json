Chuck Schumer have an affair with a 16-year-old girl? \n\n\n\nA: No. That claim was originally made up by a self-described satirical website, but has been circulating on right-wing social media accounts as though it happened.\n\n\n\nWhat started out as a joke has turned into ammunition for right-wing social media accounts to defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of committing sexual assault in the 1980s.\n\nThe transformation from parody to recrimination took place over the course of almost a year.\n\nHere\u2019s how it happened: In December 2017, America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, a site that describes its content as satire aimed at provoking conservatives, posted a made-up story claiming that Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer had impregnated a 16-year-old girl. The hoax story was related to allegations at the time that Roy Moore, the Republican who lost a special Senate election in Alabama, had pursued sexual relationships with underage girls when he was in his 30s.\n\nThe bogus Schumer story was then copied by other websites that presented it as if it were real and without a satire disclaimer.\n\nA conspiracy-theorist blogger and YouTube personality then took the story and embellished it in a post headlined: \u201cBREAKING: Chuck Schumer, Democrat Senate Minority Leader, Accused of Raping His Daughter\u2019s 16 Year Old Friend: Friend Then \u2018Committed Suicide\u2019\u201d\n\nThat post became the basis of a recent attack on Schumer by Lori Hendry, a popular Twitter personality who describes herself as an \u201cunapologetic conservative.\u201d Hendry, who has about 246,000 followers, shared the false story about Schumer in a tweet defending Kavanaugh.\n\nHendry\u2019s tweet was retweeted 15,000 times and liked 23,000 times. It then migrated to Facebook, where it was shared thousands of times as a meme.\n\nBut there are red flags that the story is not true.\n\nFor example, it claims that Schumer\u2019s daughter, \u201cLisa Schumer,\u201d exposed her father\u2019s past relationship with her childhood friend. But Schumer\u2019s two daughters are named Jessica and Alison.\n\nThe story \u2014 which is now 10 months old \u2014 also says that the revelation would be covered by Reuters and Breitbart, which never happened.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nKavanaugh, Brett. Letter to Sen. Charles Grassley and Sen. Dianne Feinstein. Senate Committee on the Judiciary. 24 Sep 2018.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: Chuck Schumer\u2019s Daughter Breaks Her Silence About Her Dad\u2019s Affair With A High School Cheerleader.\u201d Thelastlineofdefense.online. 8 Dec 2017.\n\nHendry, Lori. \u201cDear Chuck Schumer you were accused of raping your daughter\u2019s 16-year-old friend who then committed suicide. u categorically denied guilt. Judge Kavanaugh is accused of a much lesser accusation and emphatically denying it too so why do you gounscathed and he is being crucified?\u201d Twitter. 17 Sep 2018.", "lang": "en"}
