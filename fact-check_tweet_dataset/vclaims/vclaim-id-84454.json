He told the gathering that once when a Chief Minister told the group\u2019s founder Ramnath Goenka, \u201cAap ka reporter bahut achha kaam kar raha hai (Your reporter is doing good work)\u201d, Ramnath Goenka had sacked the reporter. Raj Kamal Jha stated that criticism from the Government was a badge of honour. What people witnessed on Twitter today as part of the launch of Arnab Goswami\u2019s Republic TV is the exact opposite of the Ramnath Goenka school of journalism.\n\nFrom BJP Union Minsiters, to BJP MPs, to BJP MLAs to BJP Spokersperson, to BJP supporters, everybody seemed overjoyed at the launch of Republic TV.\n\nThe unprecedented amount of love showered on Republic TV\u2019s launch by folks from BJP is not surprising though considering Rajya Sabha MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar who is NDA\u2019s vice-chairman in Kerala is a prominent investor.\n\nIt is to be seen whether Arnab Goswami exposes the politician-mafia nexus in BJP ruled statues just like he has in a non-BJP state like Bihar with his Lalu Prasad-Liquor don Shahabuddin story. Bihar has had a liquor ban for just about 2 years, Gujarat has had one for many decades and everybody knows what goes around here.\n\nFor a long time now, Arnab Goswami\u2019s journalism has looked like an extension of BJP\u2019s propaganda arm. Recently, after the Sukma attack, he tweeted four times targeting everyone except the Government.\n\nIn 2014, when a Naxal attack had happened in the same region, he had questioned the role of UPA\u2019s Home Ministers namely P Chidambaram, Shivraj Patil and Sushil Kumar Shinde.\n\nSince Arnab refused to question the ruling BJP Governments in Chhattisgarh and Delhi for the Sukma attack, he\u2019s probably seen as an ally and which is possibly why everybody in BJP\u2019s rank and cadre can\u2019t stop gushing about his new channel.", "lang": "en"}
