Manuel \u201cLito\u201d Lapid filed a bill seeking the automatic renewal of ABS-CBN\u2019s legislative franchise.\n\nIts headline, which reads \u201cBREAKING NEWS: LITO LAPID NAGHAIN NG BATAS AUTOMATIC RENEWAL NG ABS-CBN (Lito Lapid files bill on automatic renewal of ABS-CBN)?\u201d is clickbait.\n\nLapid\u2019s measure, Senate Bill 1522, proposes the granting of provisional licenses -- not automatic renewals -- to radio stations that have submitted valid franchise renewal applications to Congress. The proposed provisional license will only be valid for the duration of the Congress that hears the applications.\n\nYouTube channel OCTANET TV\u2019s misleading post surfaced about a week after the National Telecommunications Commission issued a cease and desist order against ABS-CBN, following the expiration of the network\u2019s 25-year broadcasting franchise.\n\nOCTANET TV\u2019s inaccurate post carried as its content a 13-minute clip from an hour-long May 12 video of a netizen who goes by the screen name Banat By. He briefly read from a May 12 Facebook post and report of radio station DWIZ 882 on Lapid\u2019s bill and then gave a commentary saying the senator \u201cwants to change the country\u2019s laws\u201d just to favor ABS-CBN.\n\nA breaking-news-style graphic flashed throughout the duration of the video. It accurately reads \u201cNaghain Sen. Lito Lapid ng panukalang batas bigyan ng provisional license and mga radio stations (Sen. Lito Lapid filed a bill to give provisional licenses to radio stations),\u201d which is different from the claim made in OCTANET TV\u2019s headline and thumbnail.\n\nThe misleading video, which has received over 4,100 interactions from public and private Facebook accounts, was uploaded two days after Lapid filed his bill on May 11.\n\nOCTANET TV was created in 2016 but it only began regularly uploading content in August 2019. The topics were largely about reviewers on police history but later shifted to current events beginning with the Fabunan Antiviral Injection on April 15.\n\nThe channel\u2019s misleading post bore in its caption a series of hashtags some of which have nothing to do with its report about Lapid, such as #GamotSaCovid, #Fabunan and #FrancisLeoMarcos.", "lang": "en"}
