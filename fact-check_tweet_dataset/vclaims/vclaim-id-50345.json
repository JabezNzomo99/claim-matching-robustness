The caption in Hindi reads that the world will come to an end on April 29.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe archived version of these posts can be seen here and here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found this to be a misleading claim. As per NASA, an asteroid, officially called 52768 (1998 OR2), is expected to fly past Earth on April 29, 2020, at a distance of approximately 4 million miles.\n\nThis viral claim with the same video has been posted by many Facebook users, which has created panic.\n\n\n\nAfter searching, we found that this news first appeared on Daily Express with the headline Asteroid warning: NASA tracks a 4KM asteroid approach - Could end civilisation if it hits. People on social media started believing that this asteroid will end civilisation. This piece of news has created quite a sensation and confusion among the readers.\n\nHowever, NASA is constantly monitoring the trajectory speed, and distance of this particular asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) along with others. NASA discovered this asteroid in 1998, and since then it is observing its every movement. Every data about this asteroid is available publicly on the website of the Centre for Near Earth Object Studies ( CNEOS).\n\nThe twitter account of CNEOS has tweeted that On April 29, asteroid 1998 OR2 will safely pass Earth by 3.9 million miles/6.2 million km. A @Daily_Express article implying there is a \"warning\" about this asteroid is false.\n\n\n\nThis asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) is also not mentioned in the list of Sentry Impact Risk Page of NASA which monitors the potential future Earth impact events.\n\nThis asteroid, with an estimated diameter of 1.8 km to 4.1 km, will fly past Earth from an estimated distance of 3.9 million miles at an estimated speed of around 20000 miles per hour. It means it will come no closer than about 16 times the distance between the Earth and Moon.", "lang": "en"}
