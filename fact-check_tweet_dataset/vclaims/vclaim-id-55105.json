The claim is false; Michael V. debunked the hoax in a television interview on July 22; the video in the misleading posts in fact shows a portion of a news report about the death of a different Filipino celebrity from pneumonia.\n\nThe eight-second video was published here on YouTube on July 21, 2020.\n\nIt has been viewed more than 24,000 times.\n\nIn the opening three seconds of the clip, a photo of comedian Michael V. appears alongside text announcing his death, followed by a news clip that abruptly trails and states: \u201cThe veteran character actor has died\u2026\u201d\n\nThe video was embedded in this online post, captioned: \"BREAKlNG NEWS: ACTOR 'Michael V.' or 'BlT0Y' has Died Just Earlier After Not Overcoming C0VlD19.\"\n\nThe video circulated online after the comedian, also known as \u201cBitoy,\u201d announced he had tested positive for COVID-19. He documented his experience in this YouTube video published on June 19, 2020.\n\nAn identical claim that the comedian died of COVID-19 was also shared in web posts here, here and here.\n\nAFP contacted the comedian\u2019s management team for comment on July 23. They referred us to this interview Michael V. gave to Filipino broadcaster GMA News on July 22, 2020, in which he debunked the death rumours.\n\nBelow is a translation of Michael V.\u2019s comments in Tagalog-language, from the video\u2019s two-minute nine-second mark:\n\n\u201cReporter voiceover: Bitoy's funny side returned, upon discussion of the post that spread yesterday that he had died. He said this was a bad joke, and spreading fake news does not help at all.\n\n\u201cMichael V: Many thanks to this interview. At least everyone can confirm (the death rumours are not true). Actually, what's annoying is some have been directly messaging me, asking me. I don't know if I should respond with a ghost emoji or what.\"\n\nThe clip used in the hoax posts actually show an unrelated news report; it corresponds to the one-second to four-second mark of this GMA News report about the death from pneumonia of veteran actor Domingo \"Menggie\" Cobarrubias in late March.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading posts (L) and the GMA News report (R):", "lang": "en"}
