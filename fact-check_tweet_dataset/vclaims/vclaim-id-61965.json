Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of a massive protest conducted by Muslim groups in West Bengal. Fact: Video in the post shows a massive protest by Muslims in Bangladesh. In 2017, Bangladesh right-wing party \u2018Islami Andolan Bangladesh\u2019 organized a protest against the Myanmar government for the atrocities on Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. It has nothing to do with West Bengal, India. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn observing the video carefully, we can see the flag of Bangladesh in the protest at 0.37 seconds in the video. By observing the placards held by the protesters carefully, we found out it is a protest against the atrocities on Rohingya Muslims. On the placards, we can see names of organizations like \u2018Islami Jubo Andolan\u2019 and \u2018Islami Shasantantra Chhatra Andolan\u2019 on it. We found that both these organizations belongs to Bangladesh.\n\nOn reverse image search, we found similar visuals in a video posted by a user named \u2018Spice Info Tube\u2019 on YouTube. He uploaded this video with the title \u2018Islami Andolon Bangladesh enclose Myanmar Embassy\u2019. When we searched for official sources using these keywords, we found a video posted by Bangladeshi national channel \u2018Channel i news\u2019 on YouTube on \u201813 September 2017\u2019. Though these visuals are not exactly similar to the video posted on social media, we found similar placards and flags held by the protesters in this video. In the video, it is mentioned as an incident related to a protest by Muslim groups near the Embassy of Myanmar in Dhaka, Bangladesh. They protested against the Government of Myanmar for atrocities against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.\n\nWe also found an article published by \u2018The New Indian Express\u2019 news website about this protest. In the article, it is mentioned that at least 15,000 supporters of \u2018Islami Andolon Bangladesh\u2019 party carried out a massive protest against the atrocities on Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, near the Embassy of Myanmar in Dhaka.\n\nTo sum it up, video of a massive protest conducted in Bangladesh is falsely portrayed as the protest in West Bengal.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
