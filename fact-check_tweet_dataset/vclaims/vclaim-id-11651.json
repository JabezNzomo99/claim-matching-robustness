The airline rejected this claim for a second time, while Coca Cola South Africa said they supply the company directly.\n\nThe post from December 6, 2018 has since garnered 2,431 likes and 2,129 retweets - one of the retweets is from former leader of South Africa's main opposition party and Western Cape Premier Helen Zille asking for the claim to be verified or dispelled.\n\nThe claim is also gaining traction on Facebook with multiple posts of the exact tweet.\n\nWhen the claim originally surfaced in 2017, the airline released a statement on December 28, 2017 rejecting it as \u2018baseless and misleading\u2019. SAA spokesman Tlali Tlali told AFP, \u201cit was false then and claims are false now\u201d.\n\nTlali said the claim implies collusion or mismanagement by SAA. \u201cEither way, the suggestion is in bad taste because there is no factual basis for this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe find it curious and we don\u2019t know if it is a campaign calculated to undermine the airline\u2019s efforts as it makes progress in implementing its turnaround strategy.\u201d\n\nMotshidisi Mokwena, Head of Reputation and Regulatory Affairs for Coca-Cola Beverages South Africa told AFP that there is no third party involvement in the procurement of bottled water, \u201cwe don\u2019t know where she (the person who first made the claim) got her information from\u2026 we supply SAA directly.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa's troubled flag carrier has been running at a loss for a decade. It lost 5.7 billion rand ($420 million) in 2017-18.\n\nTlali said the company would be consulting with their legal team.\n\n\u201cWe operate in a highly competitive environment where perception about the brand has an impact and influences consumer decision making...we are going to consider all legal options available to us and on the basis of proper legal advice, we will then decide on what the next steps are\u201d, he said.", "lang": "en"}
