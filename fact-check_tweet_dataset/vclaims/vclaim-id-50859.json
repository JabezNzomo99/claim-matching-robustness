Instead, it wants violent and sexual offenders to serve at least two thirds of their full terms.\u201d\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph claimed last weekend that the government plans to change the law to increase the sentences for criminals in England and Wales.\n\nThe paper claimed murderers of pre-school children will be subject to whole-life terms in prison for the first time. This isn\u2019t the whole picture: while the proposal would mean more cases of child murderers being subject to life in prison, it\u2019s already possible for this to happen in more limited cases.\n\nIt\u2019s also not correct to describe the policy of releasing prisoners (sentenced for any offence) at the halfway point of their sentence as coming from Labour, as it originated under a Conservative government.\n\nWhole-life sentences already exist in some cases when a child is murdered\n\nIt\u2019s already possible for murderers of children of any age to be given \u201cwhole-life\u201d orders in England and Wales, though there are qualifications on when it can be applied.\n\nA \u201cwhole-life-order\u201d is a sentence which means a prisoner can never be released from prison and cannot be considered for parole. It\u2019s a starting point for cases where the court decides the seriousness of an offence is \u201cexceptionally high\u201d and the offender was over 21 when they committed it.\n\nThe law gives guidance for the kinds of cases that would be included:\n\u2022 Murdering multiple people, involving some premeditation or planning, abduction, sexual or sadistic conduct\n\u2022 Murdering children if this involves abduction or sexual or sadistic motivation\n\u2022 Murdering a police officer in the course of his or her duty\n\u2022 Murdering for a political, religious, racial or ideological cause\n\u2022 Murder by an offender with a previous conviction for murder\n\nIt\u2019s possible that this government plan means broadening the law to include all cases involving children, similar to the most recent law change in 2015 when murdering police officers was explicitly added to the list of \u2018whole-life\u2019 starting points.\n\nRelease at the halfway stage of a sentence was introduced by a Conservative government\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph goes on to mention the government plans to scrap a Labour policy of prisoners being eligible for release at the halfway point of their sentences.\n\nBut as legal commentators have pointed out, this policy originated under a Conservative government.\n\nThe Criminal Justice Act 1991\u2014passed when John Major was Prime Minister\u2014introduced new arrangements in England and Wales where certain prisoners were released at the halfway point of their sentence (and remained on licence if their sentence was over a year). This was actually an increase from the previous norm where prisoners could be released after one-third of their sentence.\n\nThe Criminal Justice Act 2003\u2014passed under Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government\u2014continued that policy.", "lang": "en"}
