While still trying to come to terms with the double betrayal, the woman suffered further humiliation when she learned that her mother had actually fallen pregnant as a result of the affair,\u201d stated a report published by Daily Mail on August 12, 2015. There was confusion over exactly where the woman\u2019s alleged suicide took place, however, many reports have claimed that a local police report in Ghana has confirmed it.\n\nIn conclusion, a 2015 video of a Ghanian woman committing suicide is being shared with the claim that a person committed suicide after getting infected with the coronavirus. At the time of writing this article, the total number of COVID-19 positive cases crossed over 1 lakh in the United States of America, with close to 27,000 cases in New York itself. The death toll in New York City has climbed to 450.\n\nNote: The number of positive cases of the novel coronavirus in India exceeds 1,000. This has caused the government to impose a complete restriction on movement apart from essential services. Globally, more than 6.5 lakh confirmed cases and over 30,000 deaths have been reported.
