No, that's not true: several police departments and a Walmart spokesperson denied there is any substance to the story which seems to be entirely based on messages being forwarded online.\n\nSeveral viral messages are spreading like wildfire on social media, the most common one seems to be this one:\n\nWhatever you do this weekend do not go to Wal-Mart for nothing at all pass this on to family and friends. Got this info from a police officer that is a family member they arrested a man for gun threats and he told that he was not the only one and that his accomplices will be going to different Wal-Mart stores and shooting. Not a game this is real...\n\nAn example of that message can be seen in this post (archived here):\n\nHere is an example of what the most common message looks like:\n\nLead Stories contacted Walmart about the message and received following reply:\n\nWe also tried calling the number the text supposedly came from but an automated message from Verizon claimed the call could not go through yesterday and this morning it went to a full voicemail inbox and disconnected.\n\nSeveral variations of the message exist, some claiming they came from a \"SSgt Winston\" or from a niece who works at Walmart. Some messages also name specific towns, cities or Walmart locations. Police departments all over the country have put out statements online saying they are aware of the messages but that they don't seem to be based on any real threat:\n\nJacksonville Police say viral Walmart threat on Facebook is not credible A viral Facebook post concerning a possible threat of violence at Jacksonville Walmart stores turns out to be an apparent case of mistaken identity with the larger same-name city much further south. The Jacksonville Police Department says many people reached out on social media overnight regarding the possibility of an active shooter threat to local Walmart stores, telling everyone to stay away from the businesses this weekend.\n\nWhenever you see messages online about some threat or danger, always check Google, news reports or the site of your local police department first before blindly forwarding them: it will avoid a lot of panic and wasted police resources.", "lang": "en"}
