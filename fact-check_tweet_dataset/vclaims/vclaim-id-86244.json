Congress should oppose any effort to recognize homosexual\u2019s as a \"discreet and insular minority\" entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities. Congress should support the reauthorization of the Ryan White Care Act only after completion of an audit to ensure that federal dollars were no longer being given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus. Resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.\n\nAt one congressional hearing on reauthorization in 2000, Coburn\u2019s emphasis on prevention received some pushback from a key administrator. \u201cWhat we would like to see is the ability to expand the provisions of Ryan White to include those activities around prevention, testing and counseling that help tie and bring people into care, and hopefully help prevent some cases as well,\u201d said Claude Earl Fox of the Health Resources and Services Administration. \u201cBut the primary emphasis on the part of Ryan White has been care, and I think we want to make sure that the emphasis continues to be care primarily, in the four titles of Ryan White.\u201d\n\nThe final 2000 reauthorization bill included language about the responsibilities of people with HIV: \u201cIt is the duty of infected individuals to disclose their infected status to their sexual partners and their partners in the sharing of hypodermic needles; that provides advice to infected individuals on the manner in which such disclosures can be made; and that emphasizes that it is the continuing duty of the individuals to avoid any behaviors that will expose others to HIV.\u201d\n\n\u201cCDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] programs are reaching individuals and helping them change risky behaviors. Studies have shown that the availability of counseling and testing has a direct impact on the spread of this epidemic, particularly among young people,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThe CDC recently reported that 90 percent of young people changed their sexual behaviors after discovering they had HIV. When HIV is diagnosed, people do take action to protect themselves and others. Unfortunately, current resources do not allow counseling and testing programs to reach all those in need, and one-third of the HIV infections in this country still go undiagnosed.\u201d\n\nWe can find no evidence that Pence ever expressed support for conversion therapy. But neither can we find evidence that he has rejected it in his own words, as opposed to a spokesman. He has spoken at the Value Voters Summit, sponsored by the Family Research Council, which still advocates SOCE techniques and argues the APA study actually supports use of such practices. Micah Clark, who serves as executive director of the American Family Association of Indiana and opposes efforts to ban SOCE, stood behind Pence when he signed the RFRA.", "lang": "en"}
