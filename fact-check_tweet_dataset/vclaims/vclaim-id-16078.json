Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) attacked his Christian opponent with several false or misleading claims exuding anti-Muslim bias.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-10-01T07:00:23.357Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-16078", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/01/indicted-congressman-falsely-ties-opponent-terrorism/", "vclaim": "\u201cHe changed his name from Ammar Yasser Najjar to Ammar Campa-Najjar so he sounds Hispanic. ... So his signs could actually say Joseph Campa or, or something. That is how hard, by the way, that the radical Muslims are trying to infiltrate the U.S. government. You had more Islamists run for office this year at the federal level than ever before in U.S. history.\u201d\n\nNever mind that Campa-Najjar is a Christian born and raised in San Diego. Never mind that his grandfather died years before he was born. Never mind that his father wasn\u2019t around much and that Campa-Najjar was raised by his mother and her Mexican American family. Never mind that Campa-Najjar obtained a security clearance for his past work in the Obama White House and the Labor Department. The Hunter ad ignores those biographical details and paints Campa-Najjar as a threat reared by terrorists.\n\nHunter\u2019s 30-second ad is not subtle, claiming right off the bat that Campa-Najjar changed his name to \u201chide his family\u2019s ties to terrorism.\u201d The narrator says Campa-Najjar\u2019s grandfather masterminded the 1972 massacre at the Munich Olympics, in which a Palestinian terrorist group called Black September killed 11 members of the Israeli team and a German police officer. Next, the ad claims that Campa-Najjar\u2019s father once said the Israeli victims \u201cdeserved to die.\u201d Then it says the Muslim Brotherhood supports Campa-Najjar and calls him \u201ca risk we can\u2019t ignore.\u201d\n\nCampa-Najjar, who is Palestinian Mexican American, worked at the White House under President Barack Obama beginning in 2013, reviewing the 10 letters Obama would read daily. He later worked at the Labor Department until 2017. Campa-Najjar had a security clearance for those jobs, which required him to pass an FBI background check. (Hunter, a Marine veteran who appears in uniform at the end of the ad, would not be eligible for a security clearance because of his indictment; House Speaker Paul D. Ryan has stripped him of committee assignments.)\n\nCampa-Najjar was born Ammar Yasser Najjar. He said he changed his last name to Campa-Najjar in honor of his mother\u2019s family, the Campas, who helped raise him. The name change happened years before this House race in California. For example, \u201cAmmar Campa-Najjar\u201d appears on a January 2016 certificate marking his selection as a \u201cSchedule C\u201d appointee at the Labor Department, according to documents Campa-Najjar\u2019s campaign sent. Campa-Najjar, who was estranged from his father for a time while he was growing up, later dropped Yasser as his middle name and replaced it with Joseph.\n\nThe claim that Campa-Najjar changed his name to \u201chide his family\u2019s ties to terrorism\u201d falls flat. \u201cNajjar\u201d is still there in his last name, just as \u201cAmmar\u201d remains his given name. The timing of these changes, well before this campaign began, for us dispel the notion that Campa-Najjar is trying to hide his family\u2019s past from voters.\n\nOn April 10, 1973, when Yasser Najjar was 11 years old, elite Israeli army troops led by Mossad secret police agents broke down his door and killed his father before his eyes in their Beirut apartment. He said he watched his mother gunned down, too, because \"she got in the way. She tried to protect my father.\" Yasser Najjar, now 34, is a mid-level manager in the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation. Najjar is proud of his father and refuses to accept that killing athletes was more repugnant than the violence of Israeli occupation over the years. But he believes in the unfolding peace with Israel, and he cannot contemplate a return to the old ways. \u201cHe was a different generation,\u201d Najjar said, speaking of his father. \u201cWe will never measure up to him and people like him. But the nature of the struggle has changed dramatically. Today it\u2019s a worse struggle: coexistence. It\u2019s like a wife that you don\u2019t love, but you have to stay married. The Palestinian and Israeli people will inevitably work it out, to both their benefits.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become so pervasive and prevalent, and it\u2019s reached the point of absurdity, when a non-Muslim is on the receiving end of Islamophobia,\u201d Campa-Najjar said. In a statement sent by his campaign, Campa-Najjar\u2019s pastor, Mike Meeks of EastLake Church, said: \u201cI have known Ammar since he was 16 when he became part of our youth ministry. Before he left for college he grew up serving our janitorial staff, worship team, and youth ministry where he even gave Sunday Youth group sermons. When he served in federal government, we talked regularly about life and the faith challenges of following Jesus in today\u2019s world.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
