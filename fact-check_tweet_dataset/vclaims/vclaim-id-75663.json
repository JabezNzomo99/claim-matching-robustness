Modi called upon fellow Indians to participate in this \u2018Mahayagna\u2019 against the menaces of corruption \u2013 black money, fake notes and terrorism.\n\nWith time the narrative around demonetisation has developed to include digitisation and formalization of economy into its goals.\n\nOne year on BOOM looks at what has demonetisation done in terms of achieving the 3 original goals of - 1) Eradicating black money 2) Removing counterfeit currency 3) Curbing terror funding\n\n1) BLACK MONEY \u2013 No official estimate on black money that entered banking system through deposits post demonetisation. However, government reminds that all deposits are not legitimate and Rs 2.89 lakh crore is under scanner.\n\nAs of June 30, 2017, 99% of demonetized currency notes (Rs 500 and Rs 100) have returned to the RBI. The estimated value of currency in circulation in these notes was at Rs 15.44 lakh crore on November 8, 2016 of which Rs 15.28 lakh crore have returned to the banking system as of June 30, 2017. Rs. 16,000 crore that did not return to the RBI is only 1% of the value of demonetized currency.\n\nThere is no official estimate on the black money that was extinguished or which got legitimized by depositing in banks post demonetisation. RBI informed a parliamentary panel in September 2017 that there was \u2018no information\u2019 in this regard.\n\nHowever, deposits in 13.33 lakh accounts amounting to Rs 2.89 lakh crore is under income tax investigations as part of the 'Operation Clean Money' launched in January 2017.\n\nApart from these deposits, 1100 searches and surveys during the 2 months of the demonetisation drive \u2013 mid November 2016 to January 10, 2017 - has led to the detection of Rs. 5400 crore unaccounted income and seizure of valuables worth Rs. 610 crore. Of the seized valuables, Rs. 513 crore was in cash and Rs 110 crore in new currency notes.\n\nUpdated data shows that between November 2016 and May 2017, undisclosed income of Rs. 17526 crore has been detected and Rs. 1003 crore has been seized.\n\nDespite the hype around demonetisation, the government maintains that detection of black money is an on-going process and demonetisation is only one such measure. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said in August, 'the fact that money got deposited in banks doesn\u2019t make it legitimate money'.\n\n2) TERROR FUNDING \u2013 Data does not suggest a clear decline in terror activities.\n\nThe government claims that there is a positive impact on terrorism post demonetisation. The Ministry of Home Affairs in a Lok Sabha question said,\n\nThough month wise data on terror incidents is not available, data on fatalities due to terror violence in J& K and areas of Left Wing Extremism (LWE) show that terrorism is not on the decline. In the absence of government data, data from South Asian Terrorism Portal - a website on terrorism in South Asia- has been used.\n\nA comparison of fatalities 1 year post demonetisation and 1 year prior to demonetisation shows \u2013\n\u2022 99% jump in deaths of security force personnel to 217\n\u2022 91% jump in deaths of terrorist to 557\n\nAlong with terror incidents, the government also claimed that stone pelting incidents have dropped since demonetisation.\n\nData show that 1067 incidents of stone pelting was recorded in Jammu & Kashmir between November 2016 and August 2017. And, the transient dip observed between November 2016 to January 2017 cannot be attributed invariably to demonetisation as stone pelting was already at a steady decline since August 2016, even before demonetisation was announced.\n\nLok Sabha data shows that stone pelting incidents saw a sudden surge in July 2016. This was during the unrest in Jammu & Kashmir after the death of Burhan Wani, a militant leader, in July 2016.\n\nMore recent data accessed by Factchecker.in on stone pelting incidents in Jammu & Kashmir from J&K Police Department is as follows:\n\nNote: The difference between data accessed by Factchecker and of Lok Sabha could be because the former is of Jammu and Kashmir and the latter of Kashmir Valley only.\n\nPost the death of militant leader Burhan Wani by Indian security forces, stone pelting was already at a steady decline from 1132 (July 16) to 818 (Aug 16) to 593 (Sept 16) to 201 (Oct 16) before it reached 102 (Nov 16) and 68 (Dec 16) post demonetisation. Stone pelting further saw an increase in April 2017 to 218.\n\nThus, data does not show a clear decline in stone pelting. Nor does it suggest a clear link between decrease in stone pelting (between Nov 16 to Jan 17) to demonetisation.\n\n3) COUNTERFEIT CURRENCY \u2013 837 pieces of fake currency notes of new Rs 2000 and Rs 500 were found. The notes were of low quality, claims the government.\n\nAs of new Indian currency notes, 638 pieces of Rs 2000 and 199 pieces of Rs 500 have been found since its release in November 2016 to March 2017, according to RBI\u2019s annual report. This amounts to a face value of Rs 13.75 lakhs.\n\nUpdated data accessed from Lok Sabha questions show that 9254 FICNs of new Rs 2000 have been seized from bordering states of the country between Nov 9, 2016 to August 7, 2017. This amounts to a face value of Rs 18.5 lakhs.\n\nMinistry of Finance has stated in Lok Sabha in July 2017 that all the counterfeit currencies seized were of low quality suggesting that it has become more difficult to print counterfeit notes.\n\nHowever, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence in the recent months have found 'high quality' fake notes of the new denominations with a face value of Rs 35 lakh. Eight out of seventeen security features have been compromised in these notes as reported by Indian Express.\n\nFake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) of demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1000 are as follows", "lang": "en"}
