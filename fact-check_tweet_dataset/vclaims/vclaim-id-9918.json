To make its case, it compared Nigeria\u2019s health spend to that of South Africa.\n\n\u201cIt has been reported that South Africa spends about seven times more per head on healthcare than Nigeria does,\u201d ThisDay\u2019s\n\nN340.5 billion for health in 2018, or about 3.9% of the total budget, the paper said - \u201cmagically\u201d hoping it will be \u201cenough to cater for the myriads of healthcare challenges bedeviling the nation, including mal\n\nnutrition, incessant outbreaks of diseases, cancers, typhoid fever, malaria [and] primary healthcare concerns, just to mention a few. (\n\nDoes the claim about health spending in two of Africa\u2019s largest economies get a clean bill of health? We consulted professionals in the field.\n\nThe article\u2019s writer told Africa Check the claim was informed by online research and he provided\n\nPublished five years ago, the article attributed the statistic to a \u201cBusinessDay research report\u201d. But Africa Check could trace it neither the South African or Nigerian business-focused publications that go by this title.\n\nWe then turned to the\n\n(WHO) which provides statistics stretching back to 2000. Its latest data is for 2015, the\n\n\u201cBecause South Africa and Nigeria use different currencies, you need to adjust [them] to a common currency. US$ or PPP would be appropriate,\u201d Dieleman said.\n\nin the cost of living. The World Bank-coordinated\n\nDieleman further pointed out that as the newspaper\u2019s claim did not distinguish between government and private health spending, so it would be useful to look at both.\n\nThe WHO lists Nigeria\u2019s government and private health spend per person in 2015 at US$97. In the same year, South Africa\u2019s was US$471, or about five times more.\n\n2010 and 2011 when it was seven times more. Before that, the lowest difference was five times in 2008 and the highest in 2000, at 15 times.\n\nWhen adjusted for the cost of living, Nigeria\u2019s per capita spend on healthcare was PPP$215 in 2015, while South Africa\u2019s was PPP$1,086 - also five times more.\n\nWhere Nigeria really falls short is in government funding of healthcare. When\n\npublic funds for healthcare in 2015 is considered, South Africa spent approximately 16 times more per person than Nigeria. (\n\n\u201cBecause of the formal sector tax base and a government priority on health (note increased funding for AIDS treatment), South Africa does put more funds into health care available to the general population in comparison to the level of spending in Nigeria,\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps the most telling difference is the proportion of health expenditures made out of pocket, without insurance or public funding. Nigeria clearly loses by this measure.\u201d\n\nThe WHO data shows that 70.3% of health expenses in Nigeria\n\n, whereas for South Africa the figure is 7.7%.\n\n\u201cConsidering the level of poverty in the country, it means that many Nigerians don\u2019t have access to quality healthcare,\u201d Lekan Ewenla, a health economics expert who is on the council of the\n\nThe president of the\n\n, Dr Mike Ogirima, blamed poor health funding by government for the emigration of Nigerian doctors. He is a professor of orthopaedic and trauma surgery at the\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have sufficient equipment to work with; my working environment is poor and my patients can\u2019t afford many treatment options offered to them,\u201d he said.\n\nConclusion: Nigeria spends five times less per person on healthcare than SA\n\nTo highlight what it said was the Nigerian government\u2019s low investment in healthcare, a national newspaper claimed that South Africa spends seven times more on its people.\n\nData from the World Health Organisation show that while this was accurate in 2010 and 2011, the difference has since narrowed. South Africa spent five times more per capita than Nigeria in 2015, according to the most recent data available.\n\nNigerians are particularly worse off in two aspects: government spending on health (16 times less than South Africa) and out-of-pocket spending (70.3% of health expenses versus 7.7%).", "lang": "en"}
