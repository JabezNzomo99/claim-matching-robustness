Obama was referring to whether an employer should dictate whether employees\u2019 insurance covers contraceptives. Romney sidestepped the issue about insurance coverage and said he opposes a different concept \u2014 whether employers can tell someone whether they can have contraceptive care.\n\n \n\n For this fact-check, we\u2019re asking whether Romney has suggested that \"employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.\"\n\n \n\n The Blunt amendment\n\n \n\n Obama\u2019s support for his claim centers on something called the Blunt amendment.\n\n \n\n Early this year, congressional Republicans made a big push to roll back a provision by Health and Human Services under Obama\u2019s health care law that requires most employers to provide birth control coverage without any out-of-pocket costs, with a limited exception for certain religious institutions.\n\n \n\n In the Senate, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., sponsored an amendment that would exempt employers from providing any service that went against their \"beliefs or moral convictions.\" At the time, the issue put the Obama administration on the defensive and the president himself appeared at the White House briefing room to explain a work-around for religious affiliated hospitals, universities and the like.\n\n \n\n A few weeks later, with a vote on the Blunt amendment pending, Romney was asked where he stood. He told a Boston radio interviewer \"Of course I support the Blunt amendment.\"\n\n \n\n CNSnews.com, a conservative news service, put the question directly to the Romney campaign.\n\n \n\n \"Will Mitt Romney, on day one, rescind this mandate in its entirety \u2014 as the Catholic Church has urged the current administration to do \u2014 so that individuals, employers and insurers who have a \u2018moral or religious objection to contraception or sterilization\u2019 will not be forced to violate the tenets of their own faith or act against their consciences?\"\n\n \n\n Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams responded: \"Yes. Gov. Romney would rescind the mandate in its entirety.\"\n\n \n\n In April, Romney reiterated his opposition to the rule at a meeting of the National Rifle Association. He said, \"As president, I will abolish it.\"\n\n \n\n So the Obama campaign argues if Romney supports an employer\u2019s ability to decline to provide a service that goes against \"beliefs or moral convictions,\" that means he supports employers making \"the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.\"\n\n \n\n Romney\u2019s response\n\n \n\n We asked the Romney campaign to explain his objection to Obama\u2019s claim. Here's a statement from spokeswoman Andrea Saul:\n\nThe statement acknowledges that Romney opposes a nationwide mandate for contraception coverage. In the absence of a federal mandate, that would sometimes leave the decision to employers whether to offer coverage for birth control.\n\n \n\n (Before Obamacare, some 27 states already required such coverage, though we\u2019re not sure how many had religious exceptions.)\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n Obama said Romney \"suggested\" that \"employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.\"\n\n \n\n Romney says he doesn\u2019t believe bureaucrats or employers should make the call whether a woman can use contraceptives. But his support for the Blunt amendment endorses the approach that employers should be able to make the decision about whether contraception is covered by employees\u2019 insurance. We rate Obama\u2019s claim True.", "lang": "en"}
