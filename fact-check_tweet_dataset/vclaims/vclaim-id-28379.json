Why would India want these types as citizens? Hindus build. Islamists destroy. Keep going Modi. Hooray for #CAB2019\".

When translated, it read, \"No matter how much taxes you pay with your blood and sweat for the betterment of the country, these people won't need a second to ruin it. Who are these people?\"\n\n\n\nThis established that the footage was at least 4 months old and unrelated to the resent wave of anti-CAA protests.\n\nWe looked for further results in the reverse image search and came across an even older video from January 2017 on YouTube, that spoke of a bus accident in Surat, Gujarat, which injured a pedestrian.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Gujarati caption, the bus accident had caused a huge uproar, following which a mob pelted stone at the BSRT bus.\n\nThe clip shared by Hopkins is a shortened version of the longer clip found on YouTube. The extended version shows another youth along with the man wearing a skullcap vandalise the bus.\n\nAlso Read: Is This Jamia Millia Islamia's 'Fake' Female Protester?", "lang": "en"}
