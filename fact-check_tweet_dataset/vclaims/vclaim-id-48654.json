The numbers do not reflect the primary\u2019s actual vote totals.\n\nIllinois held its Democratic presidential primary on March 17, amid multiple states postponing their own primaries over concerns about the new coronavirus. (RELATED: Did Bernie Sanders Tweet, \u2018My Object In Life Is To Dethrone God And Destroy Capitalism\u2019?)\n\nOn March 16, the day before the state\u2019s primary, a short clip from a local broadcast news station aired during \u201cThe Price is Right.\u201d That clip, which came from WCIA-TV, included a graphic showing former Vice President Joe Biden beating out Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, with the candidates winning 50 and 45 percent of votes respectively.\n\nPeople quickly reacted to the graphic on social media: @bethanyjameswin, who tweeted a Facebook video, called it \u201c#ElectionFraud,\u201d while a Facebook user remarked, \u201cIn other news, the Illinois primary is tomorrow and they decided to post election results a FULL DAY EARLY \u2026 #VoterSuppression.\u201d\n\nThe local station, WCIA-TV, did not broadcast \u201cpre-rigged election results,\u201d as social media users claimed. What viewers saw on their televisions was actually a mock-up graphic that the station accidentally broadcasted during their rehearsals for the next day\u2019s Democratic primary coverage.\n\nBroadcast news stations often do run-throughs to test graphics and technology. WCIA-TV explained in a statement that the graphic only aired for about a minute and its vote totals \u201care only test numbers and were zeroed out following the rehearsal.\u201d\n\nIn actuality, Biden won roughly 59 percent of the vote, while Sanders won about 36 percent, according to CNN.\n\n\u201cThis was an error, and in no way reflects the results of Tuesday night\u2019s Illinois Primary Election,\u201d the station\u2019s statement concluded. \u201cManagement apologizes for any confusion or inconvenience.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
