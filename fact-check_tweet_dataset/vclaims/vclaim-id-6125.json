At least two newspapers in Georgia, Asaval-Dasavali and Tbilisi24, republished this claim as a fact.\n\n \n\n The op-ed, headlined \u201cU.S. Ambassador forced Prime Minister to refuse Russia\u2019s assistance and in exchange gave [him] 500 cheap boots,\u201d argued that the U.S. Embassy did not react to the Georgian forest fires in a timely manner, and that the assistance the United States provided to Georgia was negligible. \u201cWe [Georgia] had to refuse assistance we requested from the Russian Federation because of the U.S. Ambassador\u2019s extreme irritation [at this request],\" the op-ed stated. It further claimed that U.S. Ambassador Ian Kelly offered assistance to Georgia only after his \u201cdirective was implemented and Georgia withdrew its request to Russia\u201d and that, even then, the U.S. Embassy only gave Georgia 500 pairs of boots after the fires were extinguished. \n\n \n\n Polygraph.info learned that Khidirbegishvili\u2019s claim is false and had the effect of spreading false information about U.S. involvement in dealing with the August fires and U.S. assistance to the Georgian authorities.\n\n \n\n The fires started on August 20 and lasted for over a week, destroying 200 hectares of forest in the Borjomi region. At least four countries \u2013 Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus and Turkey \u2013 provided Georgia with assistance, including firefighting equipment, helicopters and emergency response teams.\n\n \n\n Reports that Georgia had asked Russia for assistance sparked controversy and political finger-pointing after a Georgian government spokesperson denied making such a request, while the Russian government asserted that such a request had been made. On August 22, Prime Minister Kvirikashvili said Russia had offered assistance. Three days later, with little progress in putting out the fires, Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry stated that despite that fact that Russian rescue teams were in heavy demand, Moscow \u201cimmediately responded to Tbilisi\u2019s request for help\u201d and designated an Il-76 aircraft to be used in Georgia. However, the ministry claimed that the Georgian side then refused to accept the assistance, stating that the fires had been localized and such assistance was no longer \u201cneeded.\u201d\n\n \n\n Regardless of whether Tbilisi requested assistance or Moscow offered it, Khidirbegishvili\u2019s claim that U.S. Ambassador Ian Kelly \u201cforced\u201d Prime Minister Kvirikashvili to reject help from Russia is untrue.\n\n \n\n The press and information attach\u00e9 at the U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi, Kristin Roberts, told Polygraph.info via email that \u201cthe Ambassador never asked the Prime Minister to reject offers of assistance from Russia. He spoke with the PM on August 21, when the PM briefed him on the situation in Borjomi and asked if the United States could offer assistance.\u201d\n\n \n\n Contrary to Khidirbegishvili\u2019s claim, the American response to the Borjomi fires was immediate and comprehensive. The deputy chairman of Georgia\u2019s State Security and Crisis Management Council, Levan Girsiashvili, told Polygraph.info in an email that the U.S. Embassy was in communication with the Crisis Management Council from the very beginning. \u201cThe Deputy Chief of Mission of the U.S. Embassy in Georgia contacted us and offered assistance, such as providing teams of firefighters and aircraft,\u201d he wrote. However, such U.S. assistance was not utilized \u201cdue to the time constraints we had.\u201d\n\n \n\n Khidirbegishvili\u2019s op-ed claimed the U.S. Embassy gave Georgia \u201c500 cheap boots\u201d in exchange for refusing Russian help. This statement is also false. The 500 pairs of boots were donated by the U.S. government at the specific request of Georgia\u2019s Emergency Management Agency.\n\n\u201cThese boots were specially designed in Georgia by a former member of the Georgian special forces, and they are based on combat specifications,\u201d the U.S. Embassy\u2019s Roberts told Polygraph.info. \u201cThe boots are leather with a rubber sole heat resistant up to 300 degrees Celsius and include a Kevlar insole, which protects the feet from penetration of sharp debris (such as glass and nails).\u201d\n\n \n\n According to Girsiashvili of Georgia\u2019s State Security and Crisis Management Council, Georgian authorities are still receiving assistance from the U.S. government to help mitigate the effects of the Borjomi fire. \u201cThis includes a special team of American experts, who will consult and advise Georgian entities involved in managing disasters,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe team would also help the Georgian side to develop a course of action for managing fires and investigating fire incidents.\u201d\n\n \n\n The U.S. Embassy confirmed that a U.S. Forest Service team traveled to Georgia in September to conduct a Burnt Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) assessment. The mission of this team is to survey and implement a plan to control erosion, prevent land and mudslides, and create an environment conducive to regrowth of the forest.\n\n \n\n According to the U.S. Embassy, the U.S. government has long provided Georgia with technical and educational assistance in the field of fire management. For example, the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency donated $127,000 worth of firefighting equipment to Georgia\u2019s Emergency Management Agency in June 2017. This equipment included generators, tents, firefighting tools, fireman's gloves, helmets, trousers and coats. In addition, in 2015, the U.S. government held a workshop for government agencies to learn from best practices in fire management and disaster response.", "lang": "en"}
