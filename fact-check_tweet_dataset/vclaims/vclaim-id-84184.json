The claim is false; the photo has circulated online since at least 2011 in articles mostly about cheating in school.\n\nThe photo was shared here in a Facebook post on April 23, 2019. It shows a male student in a classroom with his left jacket sleeve extended onto the desk in front of him -- while he uses his left arm to text on his mobile phone under the desk.\n\nThe misleading post\u2019s caption says: \u201cCHEATING. CHEATING. This is another evidence of cheating committed by KPU. Just see the hand ah ah ah!!! The commission is cheating everywhere.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post does not explain how the KPU could be cheating in this manner.\n\nThe claim was posted online April 23, six days after Indonesians voted in general elections. Here is an AFP report on the vote.\n\nA Google reverse image search results found the photo has circulated online for years prior to Indonesia\u2019s 2019 election and has been used to illustrate reports on cheating at school examinations.\n\nFor example, the photo was published here on December 30, 2011, in a report headlined: \u201cCheating in school & college days\u201d\n\nIt has been used dozens of times since in a similar context. Indonesian news outlet IDN Times published the image in this March 15, 2017, with an article headlined: \u201c17 hilarious things you must have done during high school.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo as seen in the IDN Times article:", "lang": "en"}
