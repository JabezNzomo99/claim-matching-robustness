There is plenty of evidence that disproves it, which the paper did not cover.\n\nVitally, there is no evidence that 5G has anything to do with Covid-19, or is harmful to humans. Covid-19 is caused by a virus that invades cells and takes over their machinery to replicate. It has nothing to do with radio waves, which are what 5G is (and what 4G and 3G were before it).\n\nThe link in the Facebook post is to a version of the paper that was published on PubMed, which is a database of science journal abstracts. If you follow the link, you can see that the paper has now been retracted. In the notice of retraction it says: \u201cThis article has been retracted at the request of the Editor. After a thorough investigation the Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article as it showed evidence of substantial manipulation of the peer review.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve written more about this paper and what happened when it was retracted here.", "lang": "en"}
