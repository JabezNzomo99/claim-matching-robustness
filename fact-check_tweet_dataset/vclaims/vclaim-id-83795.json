Social media posts repeating claims that the leader of Africa's most populous nation is an imposter called \"Jubril\" have been shared and viewed over 500,000 times. But there is no evidence to back up the claim and the government has not commented.\n\nThe earliest mention of the claim found by AFP was in a video posted by Twitter user @sam_ezeh, re-posted on September 3, 2017. The video has been shared more than 5,000 times on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\u201cThe man you are looking at in the television is not Buhari\u2026 His name is Jubril, he\u2019s from Sudan. After extensive surgery they brought him back,\u201d he says.\n\nIn separate broadcasts on his station, Radio Biafra, Kanu has repeated the claim and called the lookalike \u201cJubril Al-Sudani\u201d.\n\nOn each occasion, Kanu gave no evidence for the claim.\n\nThe rumour appears to have been fuelled further by a real-life event in May this year, when a Nigerian diplomat -- Habibu Almu -- was found dead in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum.\n\nA spokesman for Nigeria\u2019s foreign ministry, Tope Adeleye Elias-Fatile, said in a statement on May 14 2018 that Almu had been \u201cstabbed to death\u201d and that a Sudanese woman of Nigerian origin had been arrested.\n\nSudanese police said the killing did not appear to be politically motivated but the death has fuelled claims online of a link to the apparent cover-up of Buhari\u2019s \u201cdeath\u201d and \u201cJubril\u201d.\n\nNumerous press releases and statements by IPOB have repeated the comments made by Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nEthnically prejudiced comments concerning Buhari -- a northern ethnic Fulani Muslim -- are commonly made by IPOB members and supporters on social media.\n\nPro-Biafran protests increased after Kanu was arrested in October 2015 and charged with treason.\n\nThat has increased tensions in southeast Nigeria and military operations in the region, nearly half a century after a previous unilateral declaration of an independent Republic of Biafra sparked a 30-month civil war that left more than one million dead.\n\nOn a Twitter account opened on October 29 2018, called @mazinnamdikanu and purporting to represent Kanu, several posts have questioned Buhari\u2019s identity, claiming to show evidence that it has changed.\n\nIn one post from November 25, 2018, two images show Buhari writing. One image appears to show him using his right hand and his left hand in the other. Buhari is known to be right handed. The post was shared more than 1,500 times.\n\nA reverse search of the images posted on the account indicate that the image showing him using his left hand was reversed. Other posts have also claimed to show convincing evidence that Buhari's identity has changed.\n\nIn comments responding to many posts where the claim is made, many users seem to disbelieve the \u201clookalike\u201d claims but many others are persuaded. The claims are used by many who are critical of Buhari.\n\nSince mid-2016, Buhari has made numerous trips to London for treatment for an undisclosed illness, attracting criticism within Nigeria and doubts about his fitness for office.\n\nThe claims about his identity originating in September 2017 came a month after Buhari\u2019s return from another lengthy medical trip to the British capital.\n\nChanges in his appearance following medical treatment have sometimes been discernable. He has at one point appeared to be thinner. A lack of information about his medical status and differences in his physical condition have helped fuel claims about his identity.\n\nSince September 2017, social media posts, shared tens of thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter, have repeated the claims about \u201cJubril from Sudan\u201d. Several videos have been viewed on Facebook Twitter and YouTube more than 500,000 times.\n\nOther iterations describe Buhari as \u201cJibrin from Sudan\u201d, \"Jubrin\" and \"Jubril Aminu\". Some assert Buhari has been cloned.\n\nOne video even speculates on how a dead Buhari could have been operated on to transfer his appearance to \u201cJubril from Sudan\u201d and shows a scene from the 1997 film \u201cFace/Off\u201d, where the faces of the two main characters are swapped.\n\nIn a Twitter post on April 5, 2018, staunch Buhari critic Femi Fani Kayode, a former government special advisor and minister under president Olusegun Obasanjo, repeated the claim.\n\nA repeat of the claim on his Facebook page was shared more than 400 times.\n\nHe claimed a satanic ritual performed on Buhari\u2019s dead body had resurrected him through the spirit of \u201cJubril from Sudan\u201d.\n\nReno Omokri, a former aide to president Goodluck Jonathan, has also questioned Buhari\u2019s identity. On September 29,2017, he posted three pictures of Buhari on Twitter and speculated on the differences in the images.\n\nThe images containing different filters and with varying degrees of sharpness. In one, Buhari is not wearing glasses, as he usually does. But there are no distinct differences in Buhari\u2019s physical attributes.\n\nThe post was retweeted more than 300 times.\n\nSimilar photos purporting to show the difference between a recent version of Buhari and the original president have also been widely shared online.", "lang": "en"}
