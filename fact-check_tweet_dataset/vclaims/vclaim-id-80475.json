The Friends of Indian Society International (FISI) and Indian Ladies UK (ILU) were among the groups that welcomed the prime minister.\n\nOn the other hand, protests and demonstrations were held by students, activists, pro-Khalistan protesters from the Sikh Federation UK and independent-Kashmir separatists. Protests over alleged rapes in Kathua and Unnao also followed the prime minister to London. These protests were held by groups such as South Asia Solidarity and Caste Watch UK.\n\nSome of the protests at Parliament Square turned violent on Wednesday, April 18 after the tricolour was torn down from one of the official flagpoles set up for all 53 Commonwealth countries. The Indian flag was replaced and Britain apologised to India over the incident.\n\nSeveral netizens including actor Prakash Raj shared old protests photos.
