He received $1.9 million in funding from a \u201cShark Tank\u201d investor, it claims.\n\nThere\u2019s no record of a boy inventing such a device or appearing on \u201cShark Tank.\u201d The video uses footage of a young boy who went on \u201cShark Tank\u201d to pitch his lemonade stand business to investors.\n\nThe viral video, captioned \u201c11-Yr-Old Orphan Creates Device To Give The World Free Wifi,\u201d tells the story of a young orphan who allegedly received a $1.9 million investment in his free Wi-Fi invention after appearing on \u201cShark Tank.\u201d It has more than 251,000 views on Facebook.\n\n\u201cAn 11-yr-old orphan just murdered the trillion dollar WiFi industry,\u201d claims the video. \u201cIn the most viewed episode in the show\u2019s history, the billionaires were fighting each other to invest in the boy.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Daily Caller found no record of an 11-year-old orphan named Johnny ever seeking an investment from the sharks on ABC\u2019s hit entrepreneurship reality show. If a child had \u201cmurdered the trillion dollar WiFi industry\u201d with such a device as the video claims, it would have been picked up by the media, yet no news outlets have reported on it.\n\nThe boy shown in the video is actually young entrepreneur Jack Bonneau. He appeared on a November 2016 episode of \u201cShark Tank\u201d with his father to present his lemonade stand business. Chris Sacca, founder of venture capital firm Lowercase Capital, ultimately offered Bonneau a $50,000 loan, which Bonneau accepted.\n\nThe video also takes footage from Bonneau\u2019s other media appearances, including a TEDx talk, and from other episodes of \u201cShark Tank.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
