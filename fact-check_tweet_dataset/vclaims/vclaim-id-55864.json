Despite a year of protests by Hong Kong residents, the law reportedly gives mainland China the ability to prosecute national security infractions in the city. Critics say it will mean the end of free speech in Hong Kong.\n\nBeijing has been adamant that the new law would protect human rights and freedom in Hong Kong and targets only \u201csome terrorist groups.\u201d\n\nWith the law\u2019s adoption expected in coming weeks, China\u2019s Communist Party-led government has tried to reinforce this idea. The business community is in full support of its actions, China has insisted.\n\nAn editorial in the state-run tabloid Global Times stated:\n\n\"Hong Kong's business tycoons have expressed their support of the national security legislation with a much firmer stance than they held during last year's violent protests. They have seen the Chinese central government's determination, and believe the country has sufficient ability to stabilize the situation in Hong Kong through the law. And they know that this is the foundation of Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability.\"\n\nWhile certain businesses \u2013 notably the British banks HSBC and Standard Chartered \u2013 have supported Beijing\u2019s bill, this is not the consensus view in Hong Kong\u2019s business community. There is considerable alarm.\n\nIn early June, the American Chamber of Commerce Abroad informally surveyed its Hong Kong members about the proposed law. Of the 180 that responded, 60% said the security law would likely harm their operations. About 8 in 10 expressed some degree of concern for the proposal.\n\nThe survey was taken before additional details of the proposed law were unveiled last weekend. The chamber, known by the shorthand AmCham, noted in its report on the survey that concerns were \u201cspeculative.\u201d\n\nHSBC\u2019s support of the law came after hostile comments in Chinese media. For example, former Hong Kong chief executive Leung Chun-ying wrote in a Facebook post that \u201c[n]either China nor Hong Kong owes HSBC anything \u2026 HSBC\u2019s businesses in China can be replaced overnight by banks from China and from other countries.\u201d Leung is a defender of the proposed law.\n\n\u201cThese companies are getting squeezed, and you can see it,\u201d Richard McGregor, an analyst with the Lowy Institute, an Australian foreign-policy think tank, said in an interview with CNBC.\n\nOther businesses that support the law have pointed out that most economies have national security laws in place, according to a report released by the Hong Kong-APEC Trade Policy Group. (APEC, which stands for Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation, is an organization including the United States, Russia, Australia, China and other Asian countries formed to reduce trade barriers.)\n\nThe same should have been true for Hong Kong, but its legislature has not been able to draft a national security law in the decades since the British handed control of Hong Kong over to China in 1997, with pledges that self-governance would extend 50 years.\n\nAs such, Hong Kong operates according to a \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d policy under a constitution called the \u201cBasic Law.\u201d China and supporters like Leung claim the new security law will plug a \u201cloophole\u201d in the Basic Law, which they say requires Hong Kong to outlaw treason and foreign political interference.\n\nBeijing\u2019s move to enact the proposed security law follows massive protests over a now-abandoned extradition bill, which would have allowed China to detain and prosecute Hong Kong residents\u2019 cases in mainland courts.\n\n\u201cThe argument here is not whether we should have a security law, but what the exact content of it is and how it is implemented,\u201d he said.\n\nThe respondents in AmCham\u2019s survey also identified independence of the judiciary and \u201chow the freedom of speech will be protected\u201d as important issues in the proposed law. About 65 percent cited \u201cambiguity in the scope and enforcement of the law\u201d as their top concern.\n\nAt the same time, 70 percent of the businesses that responded said they had no plans to relocate \u2013 depending on how the law is ultimately drafted.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Chief Executive Carrie Lam has expressed full support for the proposed law, telling China\u2019s state-run Xinhua News Agency it would \u201conly target an extremely small minority of people.\u201d\n\nThe Hong Kong Bar Association has questioned the legality of the proposed law. Citing such concerns, the United States has threatened to revoke Hong Kong\u2019s special economic status, which confers access to U.S. markets. The G7 group of industrialized countries, which includes the U.S. and U.K., has called on China to reconsider the proposed law.\n\n\u201cBeijing\u2019s power is stabbing right into Hong Kong\u2019s judicial and administrative organs like a sword,\u201d Alvin Yeung, a lawyer and member of Hong Kong\u2019s legislative council, told VOA last week.", "lang": "en"}
