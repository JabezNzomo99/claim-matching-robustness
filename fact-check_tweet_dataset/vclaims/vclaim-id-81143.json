They will accept anything \u2013 forcible blood or organ donation \u2013 for the \"greater good.\" We can genetically modify children and sterilize them \u2013 for the \"greater good.\" Control sheep minds and you control the herd. Vaccine makers stand to make billions, and many of you in this room today are investors. It\u2019s a big win-win! We thin out the herd and the herd pays us for providing extermination services. Now, what\u2019s for lunch, huh?\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nLet\u2019s cut to the chase: This is misinformation. There is no evidence that Kissinger ever said or wrote this.\n\nWe found other versions of the quote also include the time and place Kissinger supposedly gave the address \u2014 \"to the World Health Organization Council on Eugenics Feb 25, 2009.\"\n\nBut when we contacted Christian Lindmeier, a spokesperson for the World Health Organization, he told us that not only are there no records in WHO\u2019s archives of the speech, but a \"World Health Organization Council on Eugenics\" does not exist.\n\n\"We have no records of any such speech,\" Lindmeier wrote PolitiFact in an email. \"Please also note that there is no such \u2018Council\u2019 as claimed in the statement, respectively a related meme.\"\n\nWe also search Kissinger\u2019s website, which lists many of his speeches and interviews, and could not find any portion of the quote.\n\nKissinger did give a speech to the 45th Munich Security Conference on Feb. 6, 2009, but the discussion did not cover vaccinations.\n\nThis fake quote is Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
