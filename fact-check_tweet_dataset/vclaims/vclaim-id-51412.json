The videos appear to be filmed by laughing onlookers, many of whom are cheering on the children, and have been widely circulated. However, they do not really show the egging of a police officer.\n\nThere are some clues as to where the videos are set. One Facebook account gives the location as \u2018Gravesend estate\u2019, and estate agents\u2019 signs visible in the background are for the Kent-based Wards estate agents. Although no road signs are visible, at the end of the video a man can be heard shouting: \u201cDon\u2019t come down Dickens again\u201d. This is a reference to Dickens Road, in Gravesend, although a check of Google Street View shows the actual location of the video is on the adjacent Shamrock Road.\n\nThis suggests that, if the videos showed a real assault, it would be a Kent police matter. We contacted Kent police to ask if it was real, and a spokesperson confirmed there had been \u201cno such incidents\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe video is understood not to be genuine.\u201d\n\nAlthough it is not clear who made the videos, one of the Facebook accounts which shared them belongs to Trollstation, which is a further suggestion that the videos are not real. On its YouTube account, Trollstation says its specialises in \u201cbizarre and often surreal pranks\u201d and describes its content as \u201cintentionally provocative and controversial with the aim to get reactions from the general public in the name of comedic satire and entertainment.\u201d\n\nWe got in touch to ask Trollstation if they made the video, but have not heard back at the time of publishing.", "lang": "en"}
