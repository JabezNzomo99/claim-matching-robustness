Qassem Soleimani in early 2020 before the military operation took place.\n\nOne controversy that followed the killing of Iran Gen. Qassem Soleimani (variant spellings of the name may appear in reporting by other news organizations) by a U.S. drone strike on Jan. 2, 2020, dealt with who knew, or didn\u2019t know, about the military\u2019s plan before the attack. U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for instance, said that she was not informed of President Donald Trump\u2019s intention to launch a drone strike, and that the attack was carried out without an \u201cauthorization for use of military force\u201d from Congress.\n\nOn social media, a screenshot of a tweet supposedly sent by Trump\u2019s son Eric was widely shared, along with the claim that he knew about the attack before it took place:\n\nThis is a genuine tweet from Eric Trump\u2019s account. However, nothing indicates this message was about the United States\u2019 plan to kill Soleimani.\n\nA few days before the general was killed, a U.S. embassy in Iraq was at the center of a violent demonstration. According to the BBC, crowds surrounded the embassy, smashed windows, overturned vehicles, and set fires to various buildings. On Dec. 31, 2019, the day Eric Trump posted the tweet, marines were deployed to secure the U.S. embassy.\n\nConservative pundit and conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec posted a video of the marines\u2019 arrival with the caption: \u201cBREAKING: US Marines arriving to Baghdad embassy.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s not entirely clear in the above-displayed screenshot, the Eric Trump tweet was posted in response to Posobiec\u2019s video. Jane Lytvynenko, a reporter with Buzzfeed, shared a screenshot that displayed the full tweet:\n\nAn archived version of this tweet also shows that Eric Trump\u2019s account was commenting on Posobiec\u2019s video of marines arriving at the U.S. embassy.\n\nIn sum, the above-displayed tweet does not show that Eric Trump knew about a military attack in the days before it happened. Rather, it shows his account commenting on a military operation that was already underway. The tweet that America was \u201cbout to open a big ol\u2019 can of whoop ass\u201d was in reference to the marines who were arriving at the U.S. embassy in Iraq on Dec. 31, 2019. Nothing indicates that this tweet was referencing a drone strike that would occur two days later.", "lang": "en"}
