A spokesperson maintained that it was a way of restoring tradition and \u201ca major sign of transparency.\u201d\n\nCooper made the statement during a monologue at the end of his show where he noted that many of President Donald Trump\u2019s appointees have resigned, often amid controversy, including Zinke, former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt and former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.\n\nZinke, a former Navy SEAL, served as interior secretary from March 2017 to January 2019, and according to reporting by The Washington Post, the claim is true \u2013 during his tenure, Zinke instructed staff to raise a personal flag when he entered Interior Department headquarters and take it down when he left.\n\nWaPo described the flag as a \u201cblue banner emblazoned with the agency\u2019s bison seal flanked by seven white stars representing the Interior bureaus.\u201d When Zinke was away, the process was repeated with a different flag for then-Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt.\n\nFor part of the 20th century, it was fashionable for civilian heads of government to have personal flags, but the practice really has its roots in military tradition. High-ranking military officials will, on occasion, fly a personal flag that displays their rank above a military installation to mark their presence, but the flag is not raised or lowered every time the official enters or leaves the site, a Pentagon spokesperson told The Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nA spokesperson for Zinke told WaPo that the practice was implemented for his agency as a way of \u201crestoring honor and tradition to the department.\u201d Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reportedly flew a personal flag in front of his department\u2019s headquarters, but it remained up whether he was in the building or not.\n\nAs Cooper alluded to, the U.K.\u2019s royal standard flag is flown when Queen Elizabeth II is in residence at one of the royal palaces.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
