Video Featuring Army Personnel In Altercation With Police Is Not Recent!", "subtitle": "", "author": "dubawa.org", "date": "2019-08-26T15:08:58+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-25592", "url": "https://dubawa.org/false-video-featuring-army-personnel-in-altercation-with-police-is-not-recent/", "vclaim": "CLAIM: An alleged \u201crecent\u201d video showcases an altercation between an army official and a policeman.\n\nFALSE: The exact origin of this video cannot be categorically stated although extensive search indicates this video originated sometime in 2018. However, what is certain is that it definitely did not originate in 2019.\n\nA recent viral video showcasing an altercation between army officials and policemen has been trending on various social media platforms. Professor Chidi Odinkalu is perhaps one of the most prominent influencers to share this. His tweet garnered over 42K views, 901 retweets and 842 likes at the time this fact check was conducted.\n\nThe video featured a police officer with a torn uniform in a serious brawl with an army official. Several parties from both sides tried to intervene either by separating the fight or providing backup. Another police officer was shown shooting into the air apparently in a bid to separate the fighting people but still of no avail.\n\nAccording to some people in the comment section, the video alludes to a 2014 incident which was resolved.\n\nThis post comes at a time when tensions are high between both parties and the timing is not a coincidence. The killing of three policemen in Taraba state is brought to mind. The policemen were apparently transporting a kidnap kingpin into custody when they were killed by soldiers. This is perhaps the foundation for the unrest between the two forces; as the soldiers were accused of killing policemen and setting free a known criminal. However, the kidnap kingpin was re-arrested some days ago by the police.\n\nWhile it may be difficult to accurately ascertain the authenticity of videos, determining the date of posting is feasible and very useful.\n\nAn extensive search on YouTube and the internet, revealed the 9 May, 2018 as the initial date of posting. It was posted by Omojesu Mark and titled \u201cArmy and police clash in Lagos.\u201d\n\nHotspot Nigerian forum, a fellow YouTube channel posted this as well the following day. It had the title: \u201cNigerian police vs Nigerian soldiers engage in serious brutal fight at Ijora 7up, Lagos.\u201d Several other iterations have ensued since.\n\nThe video definitely did not originate in 2019. It is essentially disinformation intended to spread fear amidst growing concerns of unrest between the two parties; and as such, should be disregarded!\n\nThis fact-check was done by a Dubawa Fact-checking Fellow in collaboration with The Nation, the second-most-read newspaper in Nigeria according to a 2011 report by The Advertisers\u2019 Association of Nigeria.
