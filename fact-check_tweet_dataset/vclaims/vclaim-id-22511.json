Last year our contribution was \u00a39 billion.\n\nWhile it\u2019s technically correct that the UK\u2019s net contribution exceeded the net contributions of 26 other EU countries put together, that figure is meaningless because many countries are net beneficiaries.\n\nLooking at the net contributors, the UK\u2019s contribution made up about 18% of all positive contributions to the EU budget.\n\nHow much has the UK given to the EU?\n\nBetween 2000 and 2017 the UK gave the EU around \u00a3122 billion more than it received in return, once you factor in inflation. If you don\u2019t factor in inflation it amounts to around \u00a3109 billion over the 17 years.\n\nThis is calculated by looking at the money the UK pays into the EU budget, including the rebate or discount that we get on that payment, and subtracting the money that comes back to the UK public sector again from the EU.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t include money that the EU pays directly to the UK private sector.\n\nIf you factor that in, Britain\u2019s given the EU \u00a365 billion in 2017 prices. Some of the money the UK contributes to the EU budget also goes towards our spending targets, for example on overseas aid.\n\nWe\u2019ve written more about the UK\u2019s EU membership fee here and looked at what will happen after Brexit here.\n\nIt\u2019s incorrect that the UK gives the EU a net contribution of \u00a312 billion a year. Last year it was \u00a39 billion (not counting any money going from the EU to the UK private sector).\n\nThe highest the net contribution has ever been was around \u00a311 billion which was in 2013 and 2015, once you account for inflation.\n\nAs part of the Brexit negotiations the EU and Britain have agreed that Britain will pay a \u201cdivorce bill\u201d to cover the UK\u2019s contributions to the EU budget up to 2020 and outstanding commitments and liabilities.\n\nThe bill is estimated to be \u00a335-39 billion, although the final value may change. You can read more about the divorce bill here.\n\nHow does the UK\u2019s contribution compare to other countries?\n\nIt\u2019s technically correct that the UK makes a bigger net contribution to the EU than all other countries (except Germany) put together, but that statistic doesn\u2019t actually mean very much.\n\nCountries in the EU can be either net contributors or net beneficiaries. Richer countries are typically contributors and poorer countries are typically beneficiaries. If you add up all the money EU countries contribute, and money they receive (including money that goes to the private sector), you break even.\n\nAdding up the contributions of all the other countries means including net beneficiaries, which subtract from rather than adding to the combined total. Because of that, it\u2019s true to say for any net contributor that they \u2018contribute more than the other countries combined\u2019. It\u2019s as true for Ireland (net contribution\u2014\u20ac173m) as it is for the UK or Germany.\n\nOr to put it another way: it\u2019s true the UK contributes more than the next 26 countries combined, but it\u2019s also true that it contributes less than the next two countries (France and Italy) combined.\n\nTo work out how important the UK is to the EU budget, you need to look only at the countries that give more to the budget than they receive back.\n\nIn 2017, 11 of the 28 countries in the EU made a net contribution to the budget. The UK was the second biggest contributor giving \u20ac5 billion, or 18% of all EU net contributions. Germany contributed \u20ac11 billion (36%) and the other contributors gave \u20ac14 billion (46%).", "lang": "en"}
