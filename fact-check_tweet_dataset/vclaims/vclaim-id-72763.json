(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nPolitiFact has already fact-checked a claim that the Ku Klux Klan was formed by the Democratic Party (that\u2019s false, and you can read why here). But did Klansmen crowd the 1924 convention? Well, there was a gathering of the KKK across the Hudson River on the 10th day of the political convention that year \u2014 but this photo that's making the rounds on social media is not from that event.\n\nHere's what we know.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention was held at Madison Square Garden in New York in 1924. Back then, according to the New York Times, the KKK was \"the most powerful bloc in the Democratic Party.\"\n\nIt was the longest convention in American history, the paper reported in the March 15, 2016, story, replete with fistfights, roosters and the defeat of a resolution some delegates proposed that would have condemned the KKK.\n\nThe convention is often referred to as the \"Klanbake,\" according to Politico. During the convention, 20,000 klansmen attended a rally across the river in New Jersey. But the photo pictured in the Facebook post isn\u2019t from that rally, or from the convention. According to the Wisconsin Historical Society, Arthur Vinje, a photographer for the Wisconsin State Journal, took it in Madison, Wisconsin, on Dec. 2, 1924. Klansmen were parading down King Street to Schroeder Funeral Home for the funeral of a police officer, Herbert Dreger.\n\nThough the 1924 Democratic National convention did come to be known as the klanbake, the photograph the Facebook post alleges was taken there is actually a picture from several states away as Klansmen walked to a funeral service.", "lang": "en"}
