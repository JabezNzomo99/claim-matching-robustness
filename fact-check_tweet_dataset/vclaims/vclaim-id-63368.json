The title of the video read, \u2018Cyclone Fani\u2019s violence in Puri. The wind speed is 180 km per hour.\u2019. (Translated from Odiya) With that information, we ran another Reverse Image Search along with the keywords, \u2018Cyclone\u2019 and \u2018Fani\u2019 and found an article by The Press Trust of India on The Times of India website dated May 3, 2019, featuring a photo of cyclone Fani. The caption read, \u2018A strong wind blows trees and an electric pole during Cyclone Fani in Bhubaneswar, Odisha | Reuters\u2019 On comparing the photo in the article and a screengrab of the video, it became clear that both are identical. Hence, the above information proves that the video being circulated shows cyclone Fani in Bhubaneshwar last year, and is not at all connected to the recent Cyclone Amphan that hit West Bengal in 2020.
