However, relaxations have been granted to non-containment areas, which have been allowed to re-open in three phases. \n\n\n\nThe breaking news ticker reads, \"After June 15, 2020, a complete lockdown could be imposed again hinted the Home Ministry, Train and air travel will be stopped. After the increase of COVID-19 cases, a decision was taken.\"\n\n\n\nBOOM received the viral graphic on its WhatsApp helpline number (7700906111) inquiring about it.\n\nClick here to view an archive.\n\nWe ran a search on Google with the keywords, 'Zee News', 'June 15', and 'lockdown', and did not find any news reports on a complete lockdown to be implemented by the government nor did we find any Zee News report on this.\n\nWe found a statement put out by Zee News stating that the viral graphic had not been broadcasted by the channel and that it was photoshopped. The channel put out an article on Facebook which called the viral graphic fake.\n\n\"Zee News has not shown any such news on its channel nor has run any such breaking news. This photo of the TV screen being spread in the name of Zee News is completely fake and photoshopped,\" stated the channel in the article.\n\nAdditionally, we compared the 'breaking news' template used by Zee News and found that the viral graphic whose background is maroon does not match the red background and white text used by the channel.\n\n\n\nIndia has reported 276583 positive COVID-19 cases and 7745 deaths while writing this article.
