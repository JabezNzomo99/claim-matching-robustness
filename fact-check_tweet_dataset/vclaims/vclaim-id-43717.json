No, that's not true: the story was made up by a website that invents \"news\" about bizarre crimes and weird sex acts (for entertainment purposes) but it is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on September 18, 2018 titled \"Man with rare medical condition ejaculates for first time at age 79 after successful surgery\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nAmsterdam | A 79-year-old Dutchman has seen his life dramatically changed after a successful operation has allowed him to ejaculate for the first time in his life. Thomas Holt, 79, was born with a particular medical condition called male orgasmic disorder which made it impossible for him to achieve orgasm despite lengthy sexual contact or while participating in sexual intercourse. Holt was first admitted at VU University Medical Center last week after his family doctor became concerned about the enormous size of his testicles, fearing he had developed a malignant tumor.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe picture used to illustrate the story is not Thomas Holt at all, it is just a freeze frame from a stock video titled \"Happy Old Man Smiling\":\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories. The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: 400-pound Woman Did NOT Sue NC Zoo After Escaped Hippo Tried To Rape Her During Hurricane Florence\n\u2022 Fake News: Former Russian Spy Did NOT Claim He Killed \"The Real Donald Trump\" in 2006\n\u2022 Fake News: Saudi Man NOT Sentenced To Death, Did NOT Masturbate To Drawing Of Prophet Muhammad\n\u2022 Fake News: Hairdresser NOT Arrested For Making Voodoo Dolls From Customers' Hair\n\u2022 Fake News: San Diego Zoo Rhino Did NOT Have 96-hour-long Erection After Teenagers Feed It Viagra", "lang": "en"}
