Proponents of so-called \u201cbathroom bills\u201d, legislating that transgender people must use the restroom of the sex assigned to them at birth, have spuriously argued that transgender women\u2019s use of women\u2019s restrooms puts children in danger of sexual abuse.\n\nThe story was typically titled something like \u201cTransgender Wyoming woman convicted of sexually assaulting 10-year-old girl in bathroom,\u201d and it was repeated by Daily Caller, Daily Wire, Red Flag News, Silence is Consent, Fox News, and Louder With Crowder. The latter site claimed that the alleged assault was a direct consequence of bills allowing transgender people to use the bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity:\n\nThere\u2019s a special place in fiery pits of hell for people who molest children. There\u2019s also a special place for those who make provisions for such molesting (see Minnesota Schools to \u2018Segregate\u2019 Students Uncomfortable with Trans Bathrooms. and PRIORITIES: Berkeley to Charge Millions in Student Fees for\u2026 Transgender Bathrooms). Remember when we told you passing bathroom bills to allow trannies in the stalls next to your daughters, nieces, and grandchildren would lead to terrible things? Uh huh. Well, this tranny raped a 10-year-old girl in a bathroom. A girls\u2019 bathroom.\n\nThe post doesn\u2019t cite any specific bills \u2014 likely because when people refer to \u201cbathroom bills,\u201d they generally mean bills proposed (usually by Republicans) that prevent transgender people from using the restroom that corresponds to their gender. These laws have been considered by the legislature in 14 states in 2017, including Wyoming.\n\nRegardless, the October 2017 case bears little relation to the imagined scenario that opponents of transgender rights say is a risk \u2014 that of a \u201cman dressed as a woman\u201d abusing little girls in public bathrooms.\n\nThe person found guilty of this crime, Michelle (referred to as \u201cMiguel\u201d in local news reports) Martinez, was not a stranger in a public restroom but rather a family friend who allegedly raped the 10-year-old victim in a bathroom in the victim\u2019s home.\n\nAs to Martinez\u2019s gender identity, the Billings Gazette reported of the case that:\n\nAside from that brief mention, local news coverage consistently referred to the perpetrator as \u201cMiguel Martinez.\u201d We contacted Martinez\u2019s lawyer Dylan Rosalez (the case was transferred from Hucke to Rosalez, local reporter Shane Sanderson told us), who confirmed that Martinez identifies as a woman and goes by Michelle.\n\nMartinez was also accused of beating her boyfriend with a metal broomstick in 2014.\n\nMartinez pleaded not guilty and denies raping the girl.\n\nWhile Martinez is transgender and was convicted of raping a child, the case does not document that transgender persons are any more likely to sexually abuse minors than any other segment of the population. The idea that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people are child abusers or pedophiles has long been used to foment prejudice, although those who push this idea have often been hard-pressed to provide any proof for that claim.\n\nThe sad fact is children are far more likely to be abused or raped by someone that they know than by a stranger. The Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network estimates that in 93 percent of sexual abuse cases reported to law enforcement, the victim knows their abuser.", "lang": "en"}
