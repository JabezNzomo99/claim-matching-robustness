Why do you want to visit Kashmir and trouble us. Please go back.!\u201d\n\nA video of a passenger inside a plane speaking to Rahul Gandhi has been shared widely on social media platforms with the above claim which says that the people of Kashmir are asking Gandhi to \u2018go back\u2019 as \u2018Modi is doing good\u2019 for them. It may be noted that the backdrop of the narrative is the recent move by the Central government to abrogate key provisions of Article 370. It may be noted that the video is recent, but has been shared with a false narrative.\n\nThe above post, by an individual user, has been shared more than 150 times. The video has been posted by several individual users with identical text.\n\nThe duration of the video clip is 29 seconds. In the video, the woman seen in the frame can be heard saying to Mr. Gandhi in Hindi, \u201cYoung children are unable to step out of their homes. My brother is a heart patient. For ten days, he could not visit the doctor. We are facing many problems.\u201d (translated). The video has also been posted on Twitter.\n\nWhile this video is recent, it has been floated with a false narrative. The woman is not asking Rahul Gandhi to \u2018go back\u2019 but is narrating the plight of Kashmiris due to the ongoing lockdown.\n\nThrough a simple Google search using specific key words, Alt News found severalnews reports. The video was taken on the flight from Srinagar to New Delhi when Rahul Gandhi, along with other leaders of the opposition, was turned back from Srinagar by the administration after the latter had sought to visit the state following the recent developments.\n\nThe same video was tweeted by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on August 25 with the words, \u201cHow long is this going to continue? This is one out of millions of people who are being silenced and crushed in the name of \u201cNationalism\u201d.\n\nIt may be noted that in the video, the woman can be heard saying, \u201cOur children have not been able to move out of their houses. My brother is a heart patient. He could not see the doctor for 10 days. We are in trouble.\u201d (translated). It is evident that she is essentially narrating the plight of Kashmiris after the Union government\u2019s dramatic move on Article 370. There is no reference to PM Modi anywhere in the video clip, and Rahul Gandhi is not asked to \u201cgo back\u201d. The narrative with which the video has been shared on social media is misleading and false.", "lang": "en"}
