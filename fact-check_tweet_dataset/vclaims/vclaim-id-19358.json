Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.\u201d\n\nThis quote was actually penned by 2020 presidential candidate and author Marianne Williamson in her debut book.\n\nMandela served as South Africa\u2019s first black president from 1994 to 1999 and helped bring an end to apartheid in the country. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for his efforts.\n\nThough the Facebook post attributes the quote to Mandela, there is no record of him saying it. The expression appears nowhere in the Nelson Mandela Foundation archive. (RELATED: Did Nelson Mandela Say, \u2018Fools Multiply When Wise Men Are Silent\u2019?)\n\nFurthermore, the Nelson Mandela Foundation published a statement in 2007, clarifying that the quote actually comes from Williamson, a Democratic presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cThis quote,\u201d reads the statement, \u201cand especially Williamson\u2019s closing words \u2018As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others,\u2019 is often incorrectly credited to Mr. Mandela.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Mandela Foundation, the expression \u2014 and the paragraph in which it appears \u2014 is sometimes thought to come from Mandela\u2019s 1994 inaugural address, yet it does not appear in any of the three public addresses he gave at the time.\n\nWilliamson addressed the misattribution on her website as well, writing, \u201cAs honored as I would be had President Mandela quoted my words, indeed he did not. I have no idea where that story came from, but I am gratified that the paragraph has come to mean so much to so many people.\u201d\n\nThe quote comes from her debut book \u201cA Return to Love.\u201d The book, in which Williamson shares her reflections on love and the 1976 book \u201cA Course in Miracles,\u201d was published in 1992 and spent 39 weeks on The New York Times best-seller list.", "lang": "en"}
