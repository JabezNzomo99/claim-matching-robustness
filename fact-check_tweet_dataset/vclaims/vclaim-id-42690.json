The Sunni Waqf Board is to be given a five acre plot in Ayodhya, outside the disputed 2.77 acres, to build a mosque, the Supreme Court ruled.\n\nNetizens came down heavily on Mondal claiming she was misusing her new found fame.\n\nMondal rose to fame after a video of her singing on Ranaghat railway station of West Bengal was viral on the internet. Mondal, who was homeless, received accolades for her gifted voice. Music composer Himesh Reshammiya took notice of her talent and sang a duet with Mondal, \u201cTeri Meri Kahaani,\u201d .\n\nThe tweets read, \u201cBreaking news, Ranu Mondal has asked for a plot in Ayodhya church. Wasn\u2019t she better off in the station?\u201d\n\nThe same viral fake message was tweeted by Anuj Bajpai, an active BJP member. Click here to view the archive of the same.\n\nBajpai later clarified stating that he had sourced the news from a \u201clocal news channel and is not sure about the authenticity.\u201d\n\nThe same message was retweeted by Madhu Kishwar, who has earlier been called out by BOOM for peddling misinformation.\n\nThe same message is viral on Facebook.\n\nThe news headlined as, \"Ranu Mandal Demands Land for Church Too in the Disputed Ayodhya Land\" was first published on the satire website fauxy.com.\n\nAn excerpt of the fictional article reads, \"Of both the parties \u2013 Hindus and Muslims \u2013 some welcomed the verdict and some are not satisfied. While all this, another major community of India i.e. Christians, felt left out. Therefore, some Christian organisations came together and requested the new prominent figure among Christians, Ranu Mondal, to speak on their behalf. Ranu Mondal decided to file a claim demanding some land in Ayodhya to be dedicated for Christians as well so that they can build a grand Church. She said that this will be a display of true secularism of India if Supreme Court allots some land to Christians. I will also request Sidhhu ji to come forward and demand some land for Gurudwara.\"\n\nThe website also has a disclaimer, which states, \"The Fauxy is a Satire Web Portal. The content of this website is a work of fiction. Readers are advised not to confuse the articles of The Fauxy as genuine and true.\"", "lang": "en"}
