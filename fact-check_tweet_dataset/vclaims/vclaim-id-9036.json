Instead, they are offered hours as and when the employer needs them. In general the employer doesn\u2019t have to offer any hours, and the employee doesn\u2019t have to accept the work offered.\n\nZero hours contracts are controversial in the UK. It\u2019s fair to say that in many other European countries, such contracts are unknown, heavily regulated or banned (either deliberately or in practice).\n\nThe list of countries given by Mr Corbyn in his 16 June speech is almost exactly the same as that given in a 2014 blog post on a law firm\u2019s website, and this is where Labour referred us when we enquired about the source.\n\nThe party said that in addition to the countries listed there, the \u201cNetherlands and others have since banned them\u201d.\n\nThe blog post doesn\u2019t contain any references, and the firm hasn\u2019t responded to our request for more information.\n\nBut we also asked employment law experts from around Europe, and consulted some academic studies. Here\u2019s what they said. This table hides considerable complexity. It\u2019s hard to work out what the exact equivalent to a zero hours contract is in different countries.\n\n\u2018On call\u2019 work, for instance, might describe a similar situation\u2014as in Italy. But it might also be more like doctors being on call on top of regular hours, as researchers from the University of Limerick point out.\n\nThey also identify several other reasons why the exercise is fraught with \u201csignificant difficulty\u201d and highlight the need for \u201ca more comprehensive comparative review\u201d.\n\nThat means that putting labels on different forms of employment is tricky.\n\nIn Germany, for instance, Professor Bernd Waas writes that \u201cemployers and employees may agree that the employee performs work according to the actual needs of the business\u201d, but \u201cif the employer calls the employee for less than three consecutive hours, the employee can claim pay for three hours of work\u201d.\n\nIn our table, we\u2019ve followed the University of Limerick study in classifying this as similar to a zero hours situation, but arguably the restrictions mean that it\u2019s not really like the situation in the UK.\n\nIn some cases, zero hours contacts are used so rarely that the government hasn\u2019t needed to take action.\n\nProfessor Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez Cardo of the University of Oviedo told us that in Spain, such contracts aren\u2019t expressly prohibited because employers don\u2019t consider using them in the first place.\n\nBut overall, it\u2019s clear that Mr Corbyn has a point that bans or restrictions on zero hours employment are widespread in continental Europe.\n\nIs the UK the \u201codd one out\u201d? Not as such.\n\nBut only in Scandinavia and former British colonies (Ireland, Malta, Cyprus) are zero hours contracts a standard feature of the employment landscape.", "lang": "en"}
