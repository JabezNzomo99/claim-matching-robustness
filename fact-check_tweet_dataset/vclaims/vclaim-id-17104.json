The term \u2018peaceful community\u2019 is used derisively to refer to the Muslim community. The slogan \u201cJaago Hindu Jaago\u201d in the claim suggests that the victims were members of the Hindu community.\n\nThe above video, posted by an individual user, has been viewed more than 1.2 million times since it was posted on June 24. The share count is massive for an individual post- over 34,000 and counting. Another post featuring the same video and message has been shared over 7500 times. It was also posted by ShankhNaad, but later deleted.
