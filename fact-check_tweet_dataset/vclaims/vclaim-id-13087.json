The BrexitCentral tweet was based on a prediction in an opinion piece from the Telegraph that was published in 2014.\n\nAt the moment, 19 of the 28 EU members are part of the \u2018Euro area\u2019. Two countries\u2014the UK and Denmark\u2014have \u201copt-outs\u201d meaning they don\u2019t have to join the Euro at any time.\n\nAll other EU member states are supposed to join the Euro eventually, but this doesn\u2019t override the UK or Denmark\u2019s opt out, and there is currently no time limit on reaching that goal.\n\nThe seven EU member states that do not currently use the Euro, and do not have an opt-out, are expected to join the Euro only when they meet certain conditions of economic stability.\n\nThese criteria include: inflation (the way prices change over time) and long-term interest rates in that country must be within a certain distance of the three \u201cbest performing\u201d countries in the EU, public finances must be \u201csound and sustainable\u201d, and exchange rates must be stable. Again, currently there is no time limit set on this process.\n\nThis claim is similar to one we\u2019ve factchecked before (as part of a viral post on the Lisbon Treaty) which claimed that all EU members must adopt the Euro by 2020, or within two years of joining the EU. For the same reasons this claim is also incorrect.", "lang": "en"}
