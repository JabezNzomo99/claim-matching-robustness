Modi ji, what\u2019s in your heart? Jai Shri Ram.)\u201d \u2013 is the caption used to share an image of PM Modi with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Zayed where the latter is seen wearing saffron-coloured thawb and keffiyeh with Hindu inscriptions. Among those who circulated the image was BJP Kisan Morcha member Atul Kushwaha.\n\nThe same photograph has also been shared on Facebook.\n\nIt is viral on both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nOne glance at the image is sufficient to debunk that it is poorly photoshopped. Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently visited Abu Dhabi where he met with the Crown Prince to discuss ways to boost trade and cultural ties between the two countries. The PM was also conferred \u2018Order of Zayed\u2019, the UAE\u2019s highest civilian award, on his visit. The photograph in question was taken during his trip and was tweeted by Mohammed Bin Zayed himself on August 25.\n\nIn the original image, his clothes are white. PMO India had also tweeted images of the visit.\n\nA poorly photoshopped image was attempted to be passed off on social media as Abu Dhabi Crown Prince adorning saffron robes.", "lang": "en"}
