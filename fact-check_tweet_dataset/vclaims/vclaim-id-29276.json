The declaration would allow the president to access federal funding for construction of border fencing without congressional approval. The Senate is set to vote on the resolution on March 14.\n\nWith the Republicans holding a majority in the Senate, Trump has implored his party to stick together to defeat the resolution, and he accused a united Democratic Party of thwarting the public will. On Twitter, Trump called the vote \u201can 80% positive issue\u201d in his favor.\n\nTwo days later, Trump again tweeted the claim that Democrats planned to vote unanimously in favor of the resolution to block his emergency declaration, despite it being a \u201c20% issue\u201d for them.\n\nThe White House did not respond to our inquiries seeking clarification of the president\u2019s tweets. But in an interview with NPR in late January, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley used similar language to describe a Harvard-Harris poll that he said showed, \u201cIt\u2019s an 80-percent issue, people want to close down the borders.\u201d\n\nActually, the monthly Harvard-Harris poll he was referring to posed this question: \u201cDo you think we should have basically open borders or do you think we need secure borders?\u201d To that question, 79 percent responded \u201csecure borders,\u201d including 68 percent of Democrats, while 21 percent said, \u201cbasically open borders.\u201d\n\nAs we have written, despite the president\u2019s frequent claims that Democrats in Congress support open borders, none has advocated such a position. There has been disagreement between the two parties about how best to achieve border security. Trump repeatedly has said more border fencing is necessary to secure the southern border. Democrats have largely agreed on the need for some border security, but have described the president\u2019s plan for more border fencing as wasteful and inefficient.\n\nTwo other questions in the Harvard-Harris poll, and in other surveys, show the public holds a more nuanced position than the presidents\u2019 tweets suggest.\n\nOne question in the poll asked, \u201cDo you think current border security is adequate or inadequate?\u201d To that, 61 percent responded \u201cinadequate,\u201d while 39 percent said \u201cadequate.\u201d Another question asked, \u201cDo you support or oppose building a combination of physical and electronic barriers across the U.S.-Mexico border?\u201d Among respondents, 54 percent supported that approach; 46 percent said they opposed it.\n\nOther polls show consistent opposition to the president\u2019s call for more border fencing.\n\nA Pew Research Center survey in January found that a majority of Americans (58 percent) opposed \u201csubstantially expanding the wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.\u201d A Harvard CAPS/Harris poll released in December found that 56 percent of registered voters surveyed did not support the president\u2019s proposal to construct a wall along the southern border.\n\nA Quinnipiac poll in late January similarly found that a majority of voters, by a margin of 55 percent to 41 percent, opposed building a wall along the border with Mexico. By a margin of 61 percent to 33 percent, respondents said they support a bill that funds new border security measures but does not fund a wall along the Mexican border, the Quinnipiac poll found.\n\nMore directly on the question of the president\u2019s emergency declaration, a majority of those surveyed \u2014 by a margin of 66 percent to 31 percent \u2014 said they disapproved of invoking a national emergency to fund a wall along the border, the poll found.\n\n\u201cVoters buy in on better border security. But that wall\u2026Bad idea,\u201d Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in a press release. \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t build it,\u2019 voters say, \u2018and it wouldn\u2019t work anyway.'\u201d\n\nOther polls have found the same thing on the question of the president\u2019s emergency declaration.\n\nA Politico/Morning Consult poll in early March found that 52 percent of registered voters opposed the president\u2019s declaration, while 38 percent supported it. Among Democrats, the opposition to the emergency declaration was even more strident. Just 10 percent of Democrats in the poll said they supported the president\u2019s emergency declaration, while 83 percent opposed it.\n\nIn other words, the Senate will not be voting on a resolution that is opposed by 80 percent of the American public. Polls show a majority of Americans actually do not support the president\u2019s emergency declaration.\n\nEven if the Senate passes the resolution, though, Trump has vowed to veto it. It is unlikely there are enough supporters of the resolution in Congress to be able to overturn the president\u2019s veto.", "lang": "en"}
