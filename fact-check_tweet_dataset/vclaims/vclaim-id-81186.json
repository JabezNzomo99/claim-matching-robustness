In another incident, a pharmacist died after he drank a chemical preparation, which he thought would cure coronavirus. That\u2019s how fatal a forwarded WhatsApp message or a post on social media can be! According to a study published in The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, at least 800 people have died globally and over 5,800 people have been hospitalised due to unproven, unscientific claims of COVID cures and prevention. COVID-19 Vaccine Being Developed in India to \u2018Enter\u2019 Phase 3 Trial\n\nThe study, which was conducted between 31 December 2019 to 5 April 2020, also mentions that about 60 people developed complete blindness after consuming methanol, believing it was a cure for the novel coronavirus. It must be noted that, as per the citation provided in the study, most of the data comes out of the mass poisoning which happened in Iran. And one of the studies that the paper quotes has suggested that it is unclear whether Iranians drank \u201cunadulterated alcohol\u201d for recreational purposes or because they thought it would treat COVID. Doctors say that these messages create a false sense of security and can be dangerous. Speaking to The Quint, Dr Sumit Ray, Head of Department, Critical Care Medicine at Holy Family Hospital said that these messages may or may not harm an individual but they can prompt a person to not follow the measures which will actually protect them. \u201cSocial media messages about protecting yourself from coronavirus have ranged from stupid, to the hilarious to the downright dangerous. Though these may or may not harm you, but the fact is that they can give you a false sense of security and make you not do the things which can actually protect you from the infection.\u201d\n\nWHO ARE THE PEOPLE SHARING THESE MESSAGES? These claims are not restricted to a few thousand users on social media. In case of the coronavirus, they have been amplified by leaders in positions of power across the world.\n\u2022 US President Donald Trump said injecting people with disinfectants or exposure to sunlight could cure COVID-19\n\u2022 BJP Assam MLA Suman Haripriya said cow urine was a possible cure\n\u2022 And the pseudo doctors on WhatsApp suggested ways to self-diagnose COVID All of these are unfounded claims that are not based on any scientific evidence. BJP MLA Suman Haripriya had suggested that cow urine was a possible cure for the coronavirus. Misinformation fuelled by rumours has also led to violence against health workers. Remember the viral video from Indore, that showed people attacking healthcare workers with stones? Healthcare workers were attacked in Indore\u2019s Taatpatti Bakhal in April. Reportedly, that also happened because of messages that started doing the rounds on WhatsApp, claiming that health workers were injecting people with the virus. Dr Trupti, who was part of the team that was attacked, says these unverified messages contributed to the violence.\n\n\u201cWe were screening in that area for about three to four days. And everything was going smoothly. We had gone there for a positive patient\u2019s contact tracing. We called him and said that we are here, but he didn\u2019t come, his mother did. I was talking to her, when we heard people say \u2018maaro maaro\u2019 and there was a mob and people started throwing stones and were abusing us.\u201d \u201cNext day, when we went there, we found out that it was because of wrong messages on WhatsApp. They got the message that doctors will come and inject you with the coronavirus, after which they will take you to a quarantine facility and kill you. This is how they were misguided that\u2019s why they were so aggressive,\u201d she added. This is one of the many incidents of mob violence in India due to misleading and fake forwards. So, to fight this virus, fight misinformation. Follow your doctor's advice if you fall sick and not the advice you receive on WhatsApp. Verify every bit of information that you receive about the virus. Exercise caution and be safe.
