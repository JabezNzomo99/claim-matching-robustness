The latter portion of the video shows the same man thrash a third boy.\n\nBOOM has chosen not to include the video as it involves violence involving minors.\n\nThe shocking clip is being shared with an audio message in Malayalam where the narrator claims that the horrific incident took place in Punjab, India. The message claims the children were kidnapped and were beaten as they tried to escape.\n\nBelow is the audio clip in Malayalam which is being shared over WhatsApp.\n\nAn article by Gulf Today shows the incident took place in a village in Okara district of Punjab province, Pakistan in October this year.\n\nThe suspect identified as Yaqoob was arrested by Okara Police after the video of the assault went viral.\n\nGulf Today described the suspect as a 'close relative' of the family.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why Yaqoob, tortured the three children although news reports suggest they were beaten for insisting on seeing their mother. The incident was also reported by AryNews TV.\n\nOkara Police had even posted about the same on October 19, 2019, on their Facebook page.\n\nUsman Buzdar, Chief Minister of Punjab (Pakistan) also met with the children and posted a photo to his Facebook page.", "lang": "en"}
