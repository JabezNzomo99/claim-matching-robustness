Tobin is an ardent and outspoken abortion opponent.\n\nHe voiced his opposition recently in the Jan. 22, 2015 edition of The Rhode Island Catholic newspaper in a column entitled \" The \u2018Throwaway Culture\u2019 Has Arrived at Our Doorstep .\" In it, he faulted Planned Parenthood as a \"destructive, immoral\" organization that should not be supported by federal tax dollars.\n\nHe cited figures to support his position, including that \"... Abortions account for 94 percent of the services provided for pregnant women by Planned Parenthood.\"\n\nIn the column, Bishop Tobin identified the source of the information as the Susan B. Anthony List, a Washington, D.C.-based organization whose mission is to help elect anti-abortion candidates and pursue policies that will reduce and ultimately end abortion.\n\nWe reached out to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence, which Bishop Tobin leads, to see whether the bishop had additional information to back up his statement.\n\nCarolyn E. Cronin, director of communications for the diocese, referred us to a fact sheet put out by the Susan B. Anthony List -- which included the 94-percent figure -- as well as statistics from another anti-abortion organization, Life Issues Institute Inc.\n\nMallory E. Quigley, a spokeswoman for the Susan B. Anthony List, referred us to numbers taken from page 18 of .\n\n\"There are 3 options/responses to pregnancy for Planned Parenthood,\" Quigley said in an email.\n\nQuigley said the sum of those three numbers -- 348,217 -- represents \"total pregnancy services.\" She said the total number of abortions -- 327,653 -- is 94 percent of that total.\n\nWhen we contacted Planned Parenthood of Southern New England, which encompasses Rhode Island, Susan Yolen, the vice president for public policy and advocacy, faulted that calculation -- and Bishop Tobin\u2019s conclusion -- as misleading.\n\nPlanned Parenthood health centers do not compile the pregnancy status of all their female patients, she said. Nor do they tally the number of pregnant women staff refers to outside obstetricians or other health-care providers, she said.\n\nIn other words, the number of women receiving \"pregnancy services\" is not simply the sum of those getting abortions or receiving adoption or prenatal services.\n\nOther figures on page 18 of Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual report show that the agency conducted 1.1 million pregnancy tests and another 3.7 million tests for sexually transmitted diseases (for both men and women). Presumably, there were pregnant women in each of those groups who aren\u2019t represented in the Susan B. Anthony lists\u2019 tally.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that the number cited by the Susan B. Anthony List for \"total pregnancy services\" does not appear in the Planned Parenthood report.\n\nEric Ferrero, vice president for communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, also rebutted Tobin\u2019s numbers.\n\n\"This meaningless and false claim is part of a campaign to spread misinformation by a group whose sole purpose is to end access to abortion in America,\" Ferrero wrote in an email.\n\n\"One in five women in America relies on Planned Parenthood at some point in her life for the full range of reproductive health care,\" he said. \"In 2013, Planned Parenthood health centers provided more than 2 million birth control appointments, 1 million pregnancy tests, and 900,000 cancer screenings.\"\n\nIn addition, the agency informed us that in 2013, only 9 of Planned Parenthood\u2019s 64 affiliates provided prenatal services at 45 health centers nationwide. Additionally, 14 health centers provided childbirth classes.\n\nIn other words, the 18,684 cited by the Susan B. Anthony List as receiving \"prenatal referrals\" reflect only the numbers from those 45 health centers.\n\nWe asked the Susan B. Anthony List about Planned Parenthood\u2019s response.\n\n\"The fact that Planned Parenthood refers pregnant women to ob-gyns and other health care centers just underscores our point that they don\u2019t actually provide care for pregnant women and their babies,\" Quigley said. \"They could track that number if they chose, just like they track adoption referrals. Perhaps they will someday.\"\n\nQuigley is right that Planned Parenthood could track the number of pregnant patients it sees, if it chose. Planned Parenthood told us that its records would not indicate a patient\u2019s pregnancy status unless it was specified as the reason for the visit.\n\nAlso worth considering is that Planned Parenthood\u2019s numbers are self-reported, as PolitiFact affiliates have noted in previous fact-checks on similar claims.\n\nWithout knowing how many pregnant women Planned Parenthood sees at all its clinics, it is impossible to calculate what percentage abortions make up of the overall services to expectant mothers.\n\nBut that\u2019s what exactly what the Susan B. Anthony List did, reaching a flawed conclusion.\n\nBishop Thomas Tobin said that \"... Abortions account for 94 percent of the services provided for pregnant women by Planned Parenthood.\"\n\nHe cited as his source the Susan B. Anthony List, which arrived at that percentage using numbers that don\u2019t represent all services provided to pregnant women by Planned Parenthood.\n\nBecause Planned Parenthood says it doesn\u2019t track that number, we don\u2019t know what percentage of pregnant women seen by the agency receive abortions. But neither does the Susan B. Anthony -- nor Bishop Tobin.", "lang": "en"}
