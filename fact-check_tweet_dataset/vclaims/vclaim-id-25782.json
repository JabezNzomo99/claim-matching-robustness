From a Twitter handle Ultimate Dangerous (@KING_OF_TROLL_) the video was shared on October 3 at 6:11 pm and has since received 200 retweets.\n\nBJP supporter Shubharastha also retweeted the video with the caption \u2013 \u201cLooks like Hitlers\u2019 pledge! Bloody Fascists! Anti Democracy Emergency Fame Fascists! Die Congress!\u201d Her tweet was liked over 800 times and was retweeted nearly 500 times.\n\nThe video has been shared by individual users on Facebook as well. It shows a group of youth taking a pledge saying \u2013 \u201cI will not vote for Bharatiya Janata Party in the elections. I will also not provide any support to any worker of the Bharatiya Janata Party. I pledge that I will make at least three people take this oath. I will also spread awareness about the corruption and injustice of the Bharatiya Janata Party to the people of my village and my district.\u201d\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nAlt News found that the video did not pertain to a recent event and was being shared with a false narrative. Furthermore, its first few seconds were clipped. In the original video, which was reported by several media outlets, the youth can be heard saying, \u201cTill online examinations are not closed, I will not vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party\u2026\u201d\n\nThe identical video viral on social media does not include the \u2018online examination\u2019 part to veil the fact that these were students protesting for a cause. The incident took place on January 26, 2018, Republic Day, in Vijaylaxmi Industrial Training Institute, Itarsi ahead of Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly Elections. The students were protesting online examinations, demanding that they are scrapped. The Times of India, Outlook, India Today,NDTV, News18, Dainik Jagran, Firstpost, Punjab Kesari and The Wirewere among the many media outlets that had reported the incident. None of these reports mentions the Congress\u2019 involvement in the incident.\n\nA subsequent article published by Dainik Bhaskarin February reported that the college was sent a notice for removal of accreditation by the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. The reason cited by the government was that the institute\u2019s facilities were not at par with the necessary parameters. The Dainik Bhaskar report further mentioned that the decision to derecognise the college was taken after a complaint was filed by BJP state spokesperson Rahul Kothari.\n\nThe video of an unrelated, old incident was clipped to facilitate the creation of a false narrative. With multiple state elections approaching there will be a spike in such motivated propaganda, as it has been observed in the past. Social media users are advised to always be alert.", "lang": "en"}
