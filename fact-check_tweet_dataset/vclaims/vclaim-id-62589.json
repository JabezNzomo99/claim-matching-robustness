Mr Sgarbi argues that 25,000 people have not died from Covid-19 in Italy. Instead, he says, \u201cthe data from the Higher Institute of Health say that 96.3% died of other diseases.\u201d The video has itself been viewed many times elsewhere.\n\nMr Sgarbi and the Facebook post are both incorrect. They refer to figures in a report from the Higher Institute of Health which was published on 20 April, four days before his speech.\n\nBut this report does not describe the proportion of Covid-19 deaths which were caused by the new coronavirus. Nor is it a recount of Italy\u2019s Covid-19 death toll, as the Facebook post claims.\n\nIt is a regular summary of the latest data about the 21,551 people (at the time) who had died after testing positive for the new coronavirus.\n\nThe report lists some of the pre-existing conditions, or \u201ccomorbidities\u201d, from which deceased Covid-19 patients also suffered. It says that \u201c3.7% of the sample presented with no comorbidities\u201d.\n\nThis means that 96.3% of the people who had died in Italy after testing positive for the new coronavirus had also suffered from at least one condition. It does not mean that the virus did not cause their death.\n\nThe day before Mr Sgarbi\u2019s speech, the President of the Italian National Institute of Statistics, Gian Carlo Blangiardo, wrote that, \u201cthe number of deaths in Italy has dramatically increased, with unprecedented peaks in some territorial areas of the country\u201d. Mr Blangiardo cites research estimating that the number of deaths in March 2020 was 49% higher than in March 2019.", "lang": "en"}
