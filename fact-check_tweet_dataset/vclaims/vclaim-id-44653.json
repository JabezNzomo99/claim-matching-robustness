The article was originally published on a satire website.\n\nThe internet is replete with misinformation about politicians, with this particular post alleging Trump made many \u201cMuslamic laws\u201d illegal. (RELATED: \u2018Down With The USA\u2019 \u2013 Meme Purportedly Shows Anti-American Protesters In Michigan)\n\nThe post links to an article, which put up the headline \u201cPresident Trump Re-Signs 1952 Law Making Muslamic Law Illegal Again,\u201d that was published on the website USA News earlier this month. It claims Trump recently \u201cre-signed Senator McCarthy\u2019s landmark law making any kind of Muslamic law illegal in the United States.\u201d\n\nThat appears to be a reference to the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act. Also known as the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, the law \u201cupheld the national origins quota system established by the Immigration Act of 1924,\u201d according to the Office of the Historian at the State Department. Some social media users have also falsely claimed the act banned Muslims from coming to America or running for public office, but the words \u201cIslam\u201d and \u201cMuslim\u201d never appear in the act\u2019s text.\n\nHad Trump re-signed legislation to make \u201cMuslamic law\u201d illegal, it would have been picked up by major news outlets, yet none have reported on it, and there is no record of such a law in the Library of Congress.\n\nThe article appears to have copied nearly word-for-word from an article on Bustatroll.org, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d Yet, while Bustatroll\u2019s article clearly disclaims the satirical nature of its content, the USA News article does not, portraying it as real.", "lang": "en"}
