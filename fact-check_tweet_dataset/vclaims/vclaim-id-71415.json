There is no evidence that the entire Italian Parliament supports such a move.\n\nThe website Live 24 published the article with the headline \u201cItalian Parliament Calls For The Arrest Of Bill Gates\u201d on May 15. Yet, while the headline suggested the entire Italian legislative branch called for his arrest, the actual article only mentions one member of parliament suggesting such a move.\n\n\u201cSara Cunial who is a member of the Italian Parliament has delivered a controversial speed (sic) where she is calling for the arrest of Bill Gates,\u201d reads the opening line. (RELATED: \u2018Our Only Hope Remains Up In The Sky\u2019 \u2013 Did Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte Say This Quote About Coronavirus?)\n\nItalian politician Sara Cunial did suggest Gates should face charges for alleged \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d during a conspiracy theory-filled speech at Parliament in early May, according to multiple media reports. In closing, she said, \u201cDear President Conte, next time you receive a phone call from the \u2018philanthropist\u2019 Bill Gates, forward it directly to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity,\u201d according to a translation.\n\nBut there is no evidence that her position was endorsed by the rest of the Italian Parliament, as suggested by the headline. In the video of Cunial\u2019s speech, other members of parliament can be heard interrupting with what seem to be verbal objections.\n\nCunial belongs to Italy\u2019s Five Star Movement, a political party that, per The New York Times, has opposed vaccines. In 2018, she was briefly suspended from the party after likening vaccines to \u201cfree genocide\u201d in a Facebook post, according to the International Business Times.\n\nIn recent months, Gates has become the subject of multiple conspiracy theories, including debunked claims about him \u201ccreating COVID-19 in order to profit from a vaccine, or of Gates being a member of a plot to cull humanity and/or implement a global surveillance system,\u201d The Verge reported.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
