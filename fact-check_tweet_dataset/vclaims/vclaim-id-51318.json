{"title": "Is This Lev Parnas at a Family Birthday Party with Donald Trump?", "subtitle": "While this photo is nearly 30 years old, the claim that it shows the business associate of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani has only been around since January 2020.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2020-01-20T10:13:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-51318", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lev-parnas-eric-trump-birthday/", "vclaim": "On Jan. 16, 2020, Lev Parnas, the American businessman who allegedly worked with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s attorney Rudy Giuliani to pressure the Ukraine to investigate the president\u2019s political rivals, appeared on \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show\u201d to tell his version of events that led to the president\u2019s impeachment. While Trump would later say \u201cI don\u2019t know who this man is,\u201d the photographic record appears to tell a different story.\n\nAs Parnas\u2019 name moved from obscurity to infamy, photographs showing Parnas with various members of the Trump family, the Trump administration, and the president himself started to circulate on social media. While most of these images are genuine, some social media users attempted to strengthen the connection between Trump and Parnas by sharing a photograph that allegedly showed Parnas and Trump at a family birthday party when their children were young:\n\nThe claim that the man in this photograph is Lev Parnas is not based on any credible information. This claim is based solely on the notion that the man in the photograph bears a passing resemblance to Parnas. However, Parnas\u2019 name was not attached to this picture until close to three decades after it was taken. And from what we can tell, Parnas is too young to be the man pictured here.\n\nThis photograph was not taken at a party for \u201cLev\u2019s kid.\u201d It was actually taken in 1990 at a birthday party for Trump\u2019s son, Eric, who had just turned 6. The picture first received media attention in 2017 with the release of the book \u201cRaising Trump\u201d by Ivana Trump, the president\u2019s first wife.\n\nABC News published this photograph in an article about the book with the caption: \u201cIvana Trump shares a family photo from Eric Trump\u2019s sixth birthday party at the Plaza Hotel in New York City in 1990.\u201d\n\nParnas was born in 1972 and would have been approximately 18 when this photograph was taken. The man in this photograph, however, appears to be much older than a teenager. By comparison, Donald Trump, who was born in 1946, was approximately 44 when this photograph was taken.\n\nSome social media users have pointed to a report in the New Yorker to bolster the claim that Parnas is indeed the man in this photograph. While the The New Yorker reported that Parnas started selling Trump Organization co-ops for Kings Highway Realty when he was 16, there\u2019s no indication that Parnas had a familiar relationship with the Trump family at that time. In fact, Parnas said that while he bumped into Trump occasionally at events in New York over the years, he didn\u2019t get to know the president until the 2016 presidential campaign (emphasis ours):\n\nParnas soon became a regular at Trump\u2019s rallies and other gatherings. \u201cI started donating. We started to help raise money,\u201d he said. Gradually, Parnas said that he got to know other Trump donors, including Tommy Hicks, Jr., a private-equity investor in Texas who is close to Donald Trump, Jr. (Hicks has since become the co-chair of the Republican National Committee.)\u201cWe became one big family,\u201d Parnas said. \u201cYou got to understand, he didn\u2019t have a real campaign, a traditional campaign. It was make-it-up, you know. Like him or not, you understand what it is. It was more, like, you know, we\u2019d bump into each other constantly because it was all the same people, there were not that many of us.\u201d Parnas told me that he \u201cbumped into\u201d Trump \u201cplenty of times\u201d at events in New York over the years, but that they didn\u2019t get to know each other until the 2016 campaign. (Trump recently distanced himself from Parnas and [businessman Igor] Fruman, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know those gentlemen. Now, it\u2019s possible I have a picture with them, because I have a picture with everybody.\u201d)\n\nIn sum, the claim that the above-displayed picture shows Parnas with the Trumps at a family birthday party in the 1990s is not supported by evidence. This claim is based solely on the notion that the pictured man and Parnas bear a passing resemblance to one another. However, Parnas was only 18 at the time this photograph was taken (while the pictured man looks much older), his name wasn\u2019t attached to this image until it became a political weapon 30 years later, and Parnas himself said that he didn\u2019t get to know Trump until 2015.", "lang": "en"}
