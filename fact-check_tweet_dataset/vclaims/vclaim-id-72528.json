One is new home sales, the measure of newly constructed houses as measured by the Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Commerce. The other is existing home sales, which is compiled by the National Association of Realtors. The two are tracked by separate entities because new home sales involve measuring other economic indicators, as well, like construction jobs and materials.\n\nThe numbers the White House provided were measured like this: They took the average of the last six months of available data (ending November 2014, in this case) and compared it to the lowest point in sales for both kinds of sales. Those low points were in different months for each type of sale (February 2011 for new home sales and July 2010 for existing home sales).\n\nThe census data an Obama spokesperson provided matched , but existing home sales data are a little trickier. The National Association of Realtors splits that into two groups, single-family homes and condos or co-ops. The White House supplied single-family home numbers only, but NAR spokesperson Adam DeSanctis said the best measure is to combine both, because that gives a better overall picture, so we looked at it that way, too.\n\nBecause we don\u2019t want to make your head spin from all these digits, we\u2019ll chart it out for you:\n\nFor reference, this is approaching a return to more normal transaction numbers, because sales were grossly inflated during the housing bubble. Sales of new homes reached a peak of almost 1.4 million in July 2005, while existing home sales topped out at 7.26 million in September 2005, before the bubble finally burst around 2008.\n\nObama said \"nearly 50 percent,\" so he could be talking about simply existing home sales, but the White House supplied us with both. We can\u2019t simply average out the two different percentages because they cover different time periods, but both have recovered considerably. Beyond an upswing in sales, reports from show foreclosure filings (things like default notices, bank repossessions and scheduled auctions) in 2014 were down more than 60 percent from their 2010 high of 2.87 million, back to pre-recession levels.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the housing market is necessarily robust, either. Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies said in its latest that new single-family housing starts are still depressed, and existing home inventories are constrained. Households that pay an excessive portion of their incomes to live in their property , as well.\n\nIn any case, the approximation of the rebound in the national market is accurate, although one expert told us it still doesn\u2019t paint the clearest picture of the economic recovery.\n\n\"While encouraging, national numbers mask the uneven nature of the housing recovery,\" said Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University. \"In many towns and neighborhoods the legacy of the crisis is strong, and these areas continue to struggle with weak demand, underwater homeowners and high levels of vacancy and abandonment.\"\n\nDebbie Goldstein, executive vice president at consumer protection group the Center for Responsible Lending, credits the Obama administration for pushing several policy positions that helped prospective homebuyers secure loans, and helped delinquent homeowners refinance. She said the that started in 2009 saved many homeowners from defaulting on their mortgages. She also said more recent underwriting rules will help lenders and buyers avoid some problems that led to the housing crisis.\n\nBut she also said Washington could have done more, such as reducing principal for underwater homeowners, helping more first-time homebuyers get into the market and improve lending access to minorities. Plus, Congress could always roll back the underwriting rules and change everything.\n\nObama said, \"Today, home sales are up nearly 50 percent from where they were in the worst of the crisis.\"\n\nThat number matches census data for new home sales, although the White House said they also based the claim on existing home sales, which have increased by about 60 percent over the lowest point during the recession. The national numbers are largely accurate, although Obama\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t provide details about pockets of the market still experiencing trouble, nor does it address whether the recovery would have happened regardless of his policies -- although experts say those policies were a factor in the recovery.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
