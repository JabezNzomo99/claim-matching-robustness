Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweet that governors should keep businesses closed in an effort to hinder Donald Trump's reelection effort? No, that's not true: This is a fake tweet. It does not appear in the archives of Ocasio-Cortez tweets or the archive deleted tweets. The New York congresswoman never posted it.\n\nThe claim appeared in post (archived here) shared on June 22, 2020. The fabricated tweet was purportedly from May 20, 2020. It reads:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nOcasio-Cortez does not currently have any tweets from May 20, 2020, that resemble the one above. There is also no evidence that Ocasio-Cortez tweeted this statement and later deleted it, according to ProPublica's project, Politiwoops, that archives public officials' deleted tweets.\n\nThe tweet also features the number of likes and retweets at the bottom of the image that are out of step with Twitter's usual formatting. Here they are as they appear in the fake tweet:\n\nAccording to Twitter's usual formatting, the numbers should read: 25K Retweets 17.4K Likes.\n\nBy all indications, this is a fabricated tweet.", "lang": "en"}
