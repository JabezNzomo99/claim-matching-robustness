This claim is false.\n\nExamples can be seen here and here . One post reads: \u201cThe Bluegill fish is one of the most dangerous fish in North America. The bluegill is related to the deadly piranna [sic] which is responsible for 20,000 deaths per year. When the blugill [sic] are feeding in a school, they can completely dismantle a human body in less then 15 minutes. Bluegills are responsible for over 500 deaths in the United States every summer. Ohio fish news 1987.\u201d\n\nThe post has multiple spelling mistakes and Reuters could not find any publication with the name \u201cOhio fish news\u201d.\n\nThe U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service explains on its website that the bluegill is \u201cone of the most popular sport \ufb01sh in the U.S.\u201d The fish like to live in quiet streams and small to medium bodies of water.

They use their smaller teeth to \u201cnibble\u201d at food and long gill rakers (comblike structures in the gills) to capture and filter smaller free\u2010floating food out of water ( here ).\n\nReuters could not find any reports of a death caused by a bluegill attack, besides a report of a man who died as a result of choking after trying to swallow the whole fish at once ( here ).\n\nEating the fish is not dangerous either, see here . There are many recipes and videos online about how to prepare and cook the bluegill ( here , here ).\n\nThis mistaken connection to the piranha has been addressed by dedicated fishing sites ( here , here ) and other fact-checkers ( here , here ).\n\nFalse.
