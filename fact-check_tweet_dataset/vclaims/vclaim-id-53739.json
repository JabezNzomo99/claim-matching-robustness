Greene, an MSP for the West of Scotland, claimed that Scottish independence would cost each person \u00a32,000.\n\nFerret Fact Service looked at this claim and found it to be Unsupported.\n\nGreene\u2019s claim was one of many saying the GERS report showed a \u00a32,000 dividend for Scots. It was repeated in the Daily Mail, Daily Express, Telegraph and Times newspaper coverage of the release.\n\nBut what is the \u201cunion dividend\u201d, and how is it calculated?\n\nThe latest GERS figures showed \u00a315.1bn more was spent on public services than was raised in taxes in 2019-20.\n\nThe figure commonly cited for the \u201cunion dividend\u201d this year was \u00a31,941 per person. This is the combined value of higher public spending for Scotland and lower revenue from Scotland compared to the UK.\n\nThere was an average of \u00a314,829 in spending per person in Scotland, while the UK average is \u00a313,196. This means that \u00a31,633 more is spent on public services per person in Scotland.\n\nIn terms of revenue raised, including a geographical share of North Sea revenue, Scotland sits at \u00a312,058 per person, while the UK\u2019s revenue is \u00a312,367, which is rounded to \u00a3308 difference. Added together this equals \u00a31941.\n\nThis is often described as a \u201cfiscal transfer\u201c, when more money than is raised in an area is spent there by the public sector as a whole.\n\nIt means that revenue generated is not tied to the area it was created. In the UK, many areas have a net fiscal deficit. Only London, the South East and East of England had a net fiscal surplus in 2019.\n\nA number of reasons have been suggested for why Scotland\u2019s spending per head is higher than the UK. These include the cost of providing public services to remote areas with lower population density, and historical issues with poverty and health leave Scotland in greater need.\n\nThe Scottish Government has also cited costs for services which are provided by the public sector in Scotland, but not in England, such as household water and sewerage services.\n\nSome of the spending referred to in GERS is \u2018non-identifiable\u2019, which means it is spent by the UK as whole and not necessarily in Scotland. This includes a proportion of defence spending and debt interest payments.\n\nAny figure for the fiscal transfer between the UK and Scotland is unofficial, and civil servants have warned that this is because it is impossible to provide one without making assumptions about the purpose of borrowing and spending undertaken by the UK Government as a whole.\n\nJamie Greene\u2019s claim that this figure equates to an amount people would be worse off if Scotland became independent is misleading.\n\n\u00a31941 per person only refers to the difference in current spending per head. It does not tell us what Scotland\u2019s financial position would be after independence. GERS is a snapshot of the current position within the existing constitutional arrangements.\n\nGreene\u2019s claim also states that \u201cevery man, woman and child\u201d would be \u00a32,000 worse off each year after independence, which is not supported by the GERS figures. The revenue and spending is Scotland-wide, and divided by the size of Scotland\u2019s population in order to get a per person average. It does not account for the individual circumstances of different people in Scotland.\n\nIt\u2019s not possible to predict how much money a notionally independent Scotland might be able to spend in the future, and how this might compare with the amount spent per person in the rest of the UK at that time.\n\nThe GERS figures do not show that if Scotland were to become independent, each person in Scotland would become \u00a32,000 worse off. The figure only refers to the current difference between revenue and spending in Scotland compared to the UK.\n\nFerret Fact Service (FFS) is a non-partisan fact checker, and a signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network fact-checkers\u2019 code of principles.
