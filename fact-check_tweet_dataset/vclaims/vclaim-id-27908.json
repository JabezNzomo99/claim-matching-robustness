Accomplishing some of the goals in the Green New Deal undoubtedly would affect the industries and services she mentioned, but it\u2019s inaccurate to say the Green New Deal would \u201coutlaw\u201d them. The plan calls for \u201cmeeting 100 percent of the power demand\u201d with clean, renewable and zero-emission energy sources. It should be noted that some key provisions in the Green New Deal call only for \u201ctechnologically feasible\u201d changes.\n\nThe FAQ called for \u201chigh-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary.\u201d Another sentence read, \u201cWe set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren\u2019t sure that we\u2019ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero.\u201d (Emphasis ours.)\n\nContrast this line of attack from Cheney with these critical comments about the Green New Deal from acting Environmental Protection Agency administrator Andrew Wheeler. \u201cI\u2019ve read the resolution that they put out. I\u2019ve also read the fact sheet that they later disavowed. I\u2019d say probably the rollout was not really ready for prime time,\u201d he told ABC News. \u201cBut, I am concerned that they really don\u2019t seem to value a stable electricity source, grid reliability and for human health and the environment here at the agency, I have to be very concerned about that because it\u2019s the electricity system that supplies our drinking water system that runs it.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
