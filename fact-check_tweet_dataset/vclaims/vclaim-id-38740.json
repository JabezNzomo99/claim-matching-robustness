Though the fish tank solvent has the same active ingredient as the anti-malaria drug chloroquine, they are formulated differently and not the same.\n\nBanner Health, an Arizona-based health care company, announced Monday that a husband and wife were hospitalized after consuming a solvent containing chloroquine phosphate that they thought would protect them from the new coronavirus. The husband died shortly after arriving at the hospital.\n\nThe story was picked up by numerous media outlets, including The Hill, which originally tweeted its article out with the caption, \u201cMan dies after taking malaria medication touted by Trump as possible cure for coronavirus.\u201d However, the tweet from The Hill was quickly deleted, likely because it was factually inaccurate.\n\nThe Arizona couple ingested a parasite treatment containing a non-medical form of chloroquine that they had previously used to treat their koi fish. The wife of the deceased man told NBC News that they mixed a small amount of the additive with liquid and drank it after hearing President Donald Trump mention that the anti-malaria drug chloroquine may be effective in combating COVID-19.\n\n\u201cI just saw it sitting on the back shelf and said, \u2018Hey, isn\u2019t that that stuff they\u2019re talking about on TV?'\u201d his wife recounted, per NBC News.

Dr. Daniel Brooks, Banner Poison and Drug Information Center medical director, noted in a statement from Banner Health that while the additive used to fight aquarium parasites has the same active ingredient as the drug chloroquine, it is formulated differently.\n\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn also confirmed on Twitter that the two substances aren\u2019t the same.\n\n\u201cThe chloroquine phosphate used for treating aquarium fish is not the same as the FDA-approved chloroquine being studied as a possible treatment for #COVID19,\u201d Hahn tweeted. \u201cDo not take any form of chloroquine unless prescribed to you by a health care provider & obtained from legitimate sources.\u201d\n\nThe anti-malaria drug is prescription-only and tightly regulated by the FDA, which is currently conducting clinical trials to see if it can combat the disease caused by the new coronavirus.

He referred to the medication in a press conference last week as a \u201ccommon malaria drug\u201d that had shown \u201cencouraging early results\u201d when tested for treating patients with COVID-19. But Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said there is only anecdotal evidence so far that it would be effective.\n\nThe Hill did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
