And he claimed that workers are \u201cworking harder today,\u201d when in fact the average work week is nearly one hour shorter than it was 18 years ago.\n\nTrump made his multiple misrepresentations Sept. 12 during a phone-in interview on \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d\n\nTrump said blue-collar workers \u201chaven\u2019t been taken care of properly by this country,\u201d and then continued:\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed in the past \u2014 wrongly \u2014 that wages are down compared with 18 years ago, when in fact real, inflation-adjusted wages have increased substantially during that period.\n\nWages for rank-and-file, nonsupervisory workers (the very \u201cblue collar\u201d workers Trump was referring to) have risen even more since we first debunked this bit of bogus Trumponomics back in June.\n\nThe most recent figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that average, weekly real wages in July were 11 percent higher than they were in the same month 18 years earlier. They have risen 2.1 percent in the last year, and 4.5 percent in the last two years.\n\nSo Trump\u2019s claim that \u201con average\u201d wages are down is still wrong, no matter how often he repeats it. They are going up nicely, and are well above what they were 18 years ago.\n\nTrump was also off base when he said people are \u201cworking harder.\u201d There\u2019s no metric we know of that measures the difficulty of work or worker effort over time, but statisticians do measure the average number of hours worked. And those nonsupervisory workers are putting in fewer hours today than 18 years ago.\n\nThe average work week in August was 33.6 hours, down by 0.9 hour (54 minutes) from the same month in 1998. That\u2019s a 2.6 percent shorter work week, on average.\n\nTrump\u2019s vague statement that \u201cin many cases\u201d people are working two jobs is true enough; there were just over 7.2 million people working two or more jobs in August, according to the most recent figures from the BLS household survey. But that has little or nothing to do with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Great Recession, which officially began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009, wiped out more than 8 million jobs. Since then, the number of multiple jobholders has gone up \u2014 but much more slowly than the rise in the number of all jobholders. Only 4.8 percent of all workers held down two or more jobs in August, compared with 5.2 percent the month Obama first took office, and 5.1 percent in March 2010 when he signed Obamacare into law.\n\nAnd the percentage in August was exactly the same as it was in December 2013, the month before the new law\u2019s insurance exchanges took effect, and individuals were required to obtain coverage or pay a tax penalty.\n\nSo we can detect no relationship between the Affordable Care Act and the likelihood of workers holding two or more jobs. Actually, the trend has been away from multiple job-holding for some time.\n\nBLS figures on multiple jobholders go back to 1994. The percentage peaked at 6.6 percent of all jobholders in November 1996. Thus, today\u2019s workers are actually 27 percent less likely to be working two or more jobs than the workers of 20 years ago.", "lang": "en"}
