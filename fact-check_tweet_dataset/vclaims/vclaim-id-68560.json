The meme purports to draw from Trump\u2019s book The Art of the Deal.\n\n\"You tell people a lie three times, they will believe anything,\" it says. \"You tell people what they want to hear, play to their fantasies, and then you close the deal.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe looked through The Art of the Deal. Those words never appear. The word \"believe\" occurs 38 times.\n\nBut the part about lying isn\u2019t there.\n\nOn the other hand, when it comes to promotion, Trump did write in the book that he plays to people\u2019s fantasies.\n\n\"People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do,\" he wrote. \"That\u2019s why a little hyperbole never hurts. People want to believe something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole. It\u2019s an innocent form of exaggeration \u2014 and a very effective form of promotion.\"\n\nThree decades before he became president, Trump also described how he played the press. The media, he said, is always hungry for a story, and \"the more sensational, the better.\"\n\n\"If you are a little different, or a little outrageous, or if you do things that are bold or controversial, the press is going to write about you,\" Trump said.\n\nSo the book is still relevant today, but not in the way the meme says.\n\nThe meme comes from New Century Times, a left-leaning news aggregation site that we\u2019ve rated False before. The fact-checking site Snopes called out this meme in May 2016, but obviously, the point needs to be repeated.", "lang": "en"}
