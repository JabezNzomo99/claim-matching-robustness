Crime is affected by many factors, and New York\u2019s decline in crime mirrored the decline in many other major cities at the time. Moreover, crime was declining for four years before Giuliani took office, and it continued to decline for 14 years after he left. (Check out this graphic by our colleague Philip Bump.)\n\nThe 76 percent and 84 percent decreases are cherry-picked data from 1994, when Giuliani took office, and 2014, when stop-and-frisk ended. Giuliani left office in 2002, and a new police commissioner was appointed under Giuliani\u2019s successor, Michael Bloomberg.\n\nSo Trump is crediting 12 years of New York crime rates to city leadership that took office after Giuliani. Specifically under Giuliani, the homicide rate and violent crime rate each declined about 18 percentage points less than Trump said in his speech. This is quite ridiculous; it\u2019s the equivalent of saying the tax cuts under President George W. Bush resulted in the job growth under President Obama.\n\nLet\u2019s keep in mind that crime, overall, has been declining for many years. A new report by the Brennan Center for Justice showed that despite recent upticks in crime (specifically the increased murder rate in Chicago), overall crime rate in 2016 is projected to remain flat.\n\nThe Fact Checker Recidivism Watch tracks politicians who repeat claims that we have previously found to be incorrect or false.
