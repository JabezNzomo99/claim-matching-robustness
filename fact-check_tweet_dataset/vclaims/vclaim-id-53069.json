It often has a \u2018lock\u2019 symbol to indicate the security status.\n\n\u201cHTTPS uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses,\u201d Cloudflare, a UK IT firm stated.\n\n\u201cAs a result, HTTPS is far more secure than HTTP. A Website that uses HTTP has http:// in its URL, while a website that uses HTTPS has https://.\u201d\n\nAs of Tuesday noon (June 30), both portals, the N-Power website and the N-Power application portal are secured and running. The original domain is also secured based on the above analysis.\n\nSpeaking with The ICIR, Akindayo Akindolani, Managing Partner, McAnderson Institute of Technology, said once a website is visited and the lock sign is missing, it implies the website is not secured.\n\nHe said there are times when website domains are renewed and the SSL are left out; this, he noted, could make the website vulnerable to cyber attacks.\n\nHe disclosed further that aside from the lock, users might find it difficult to determine the security of a website has been compromised except it is checked from the backend through the login details. This move, he said, would enable the user to verify the login data and recent activities on the website.\n\n\u201cOnce a website is hacked, the original contents could be changed. Aside from the lock sign, if you log in to the backend and check the login history details, you can find some discrepancies.\u201d\n\nBut this is not the case with N-Power portal, The ICIR has confirmed.\n\nRemi Afon, the President of Cyber Security Experts Association of Nigeria (CSEAN) who also shared similar opinion with Akindolani, however, stressed that ascertaining the safety of a website would also include checking for pop-ups, malware and unusual links on the comment sections.\n\n\u201cThe padlock signs only show that information sent to the website is encrypted,\u201d Afon said, adding that \u201cmost hacked websites are not easily detected by mere visiting them except they are defaced.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Public Affairs, Anjuri Ngelale in a tweet post has debunked the claim that the website is compromised.\n\nGarba Shehu, spokesperson to the President Buhari also affirmed Ngelale\u2019s clarification by retweeting his message which earlier debunked the false claim.\n\nThe ICIR also reached out to Halima Oyelade, Special Assistant on Media to the FMHDS Minister. She also debunked the claim.\n\n\u201cThank you for reaching out. No, it is not true,\u201d she replied The ICIR\u2018s enquiry via a text message\n\nSimilarly, Mr Zam @DaBullIt, the Twitter user had also admitted to having spread the fake news and apologised for misleading the public.\n\nBased on all available information, the claim above is MISLEADING and FALSE.", "lang": "en"}
