Kirsten Gillibrand has not proposed giving Social Security benefits to \u201cillegal aliens,\u201d as a popular meme claims. She wants to overhaul the immigration system to give individuals in the U.S. illegally a way to become citizens and collect benefits after paying into Social Security.\n\n\n\nAt a campaign stop in Davenport, Iowa on March 19, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, one of 23 people who have announced they are seeking the Democratic nomination for president, answered a question on immigration.\n\nA woman in the crowd asked: \u201cWould you please talk a little about immigration \u2014 what you\u2019ve done, what you see \u2014 both broadly, the DREAMers, the people detained at for-profit prisons, separated children, and the asylum seekers?\u201d\n\nGillibrand took about five minutes for her answer and, halfway through her remarks (at the 19:43 mark of the Facebook live video), she said: \u201cSo, what will I do? I have a lot of ideas. First: we need comprehensive immigration reform. If you are in this country now, you must have the right to pay into Social Security, to pay your taxes, to pay into the local school system, and to have a pathway to citizenship. That must happen.\u201d\n\nShortly after she made that statement, it was spun by conservative pundits. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, for example, characterized it this way during an appearance on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show: \u201cIf a person comes here illegally\u2026 let\u2019s not only give them grandma\u2019s Social Security, let\u2019s toss in a car.\u201d He went on, \u201cI hope Kirsten Gillibrand has to go out and talk to people in their 70s, who can barely afford food, and tell them that they\u2019re going to not get their Social Security raised because we\u2019re going to be giving it to people who broke into this country illegally.\u201d\n\nThat interpretation of Gillibrand\u2019s statement was then cemented in a meme that\u2019s been circulating on Facebook and says: \u201cSen. Kirsten Gillibrand says that she wants to give Social Security benefits to illegal aliens.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not what Gillibrand said. She called for \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform\u201d and said that people in the U.S. illegally \u201cmust have the right to pay into Social Security\u201d and pay their taxes.\n\nIn fact, many immigrants who are in the country illegally already pay taxes and pay into Social Security, although they don\u2019t have access to the benefits. According to the IRS, taxpayers who didn\u2019t have Social Security numbers \u2014 and instead filed with an Individual Taxpayer Identification number \u2014 paid $23.6 billion in federal taxes in 2015. Some also file taxes using either an illegitimate or a fraudulent Social Security number. According to a 2013 report from the Social Security Administration, 2.5 million immigrants in the country illegally paid taxes using a false Social Security number in 2010. That year, immigrants in the country illegally contributed a net total of $12 billion to the Social Security program, the report says.\n\nGillibrand\u2019s campaign spokeswoman, Meredith Kelly, clarified the candidate\u2019s statement for us through email.\n\n\u201cSenator Gillibrand simply made a factual statement: undocumented immigrants already do pay into Social Security and income taxes, but get none of the benefits that they would as citizens,\u201d Kelly wrote. \u201cUnder her plan for comprehensive immigration reform, they would have a pathway to earn their citizenship and those benefits that they already pay into. This is deliberate misinformation that has already been debunked.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
