A photograph of a protester holding a placard that says, \u201cHindu Hoon Ch***** Nahi\u201d was shared by several people hinting that the man is a Muslim posing as Hindu during the agitation.\n\nTwitter handle (@TheBiongHead) juxtaposed the man\u2019s photograph with a screenshot of a Twitter profile of one Syed Mohd Yasir and wrote, \u201cany similarity in face?\u201d\n\nTwitter user Syed Mohd Yasir was among those who had tweeted the image of the man with the placard.\n\nAnother publically image of the man clearly shows his face.\n\nA comparison of their facial features makes it evident that the man with the placard is not Yasir. Their face-cut is different and so is the shape of their noses.\n\nOther publically images of Yasir also show the distinction in facial features.\n\nMoreover, Yasir had tweeted that he is not the man holding the placard.\n\nThus, an image of a man holding a placard that says \u201cHindu Hoon Ch***** Nahi\u201d is viral with a false claim suggesting that he is Syed Mohd Yasir.", "lang": "en"}
