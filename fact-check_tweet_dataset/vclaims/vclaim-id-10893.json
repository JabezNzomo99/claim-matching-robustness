Commenting on the decision, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, who was previously Russia\u2019s sports minister, told Russia\u2019s Interfax news agency: \u201cIt has nothing to do with the national team\u2019s participation [in the 2018 Winter Olympics].\u201d\n\nThat same day, the Russian sports agency R-Sport quoted an unnamed International Olympic Committee (IOC) source as saying that the IOC is expected to decide in December whether or not to allow Russian athletes to participate in the games in Pyeongchang next February. The source said the IOC was taking into consideration WADA\u2019s decision on RUSADA and \u201cwill consider all the circumstances, including measures to ensure equal conditions for all athletes.\u201d\n\nBack in December 2016, the IOC published on its website a statement by its board of directors saying that once the doping allegations against Russia, including alleged manipulations in the WADA-accredited anti-doping laboratory at the Olympic Winter Games Sochi 2014, were investigated by IOC inquiry and disciplinary commissions, \u201cthe IOC Executive Board will take all the appropriate measures and sanctions in the context of the Olympic Games, such as disqualification of athletes from competition at the Olympic Games, and the exclusion of implicated officials, entourage or government officials from the Olympic Games.\u201d\n\nThe IOC created the Inquiry Commission and the Disciplinary Commission In July 2016, after Richard McLaren, who was contracted by WADA to investigate alleged doping in Russian sports, published his report. The Inquiry Commission, chaired by IOC Member Denis Oswald, was tasked with investigating individual cases of alleged doping by Russian athletes. The Disciplinary Commission, chaired by the former President of Switzerland, Samuel Schmid, was tasked with determining whether the alleged doping by Russian athletes was systemic. In late October 2017, Oswald said in a statement that the decisions on specific athletes will be made in late November. Schmidt announced in late October that his committee\u2019s investigation would conclude in a couple of weeks.\n\nIn a speech in Prague on November 2 to the annual gathering of the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC), IOC President Thomas Bach expressed confidence that all the necessary decisions concerning the Russian athletes would be made in December. At the same time, he said that public calls for sanctions before the end of the investigation were \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\nOn November 17 the IOC clarified that the decision will be announced on the evening of December 5.\n\nIn 2016, WADA recommended to the IOC that it disqualify Russia from participating in that year\u2019s Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. However, at that time IOC decided to let the international federations for individual sports to make their own decisions. As a result, Russian athletes in track-and-field, weightlifting, as well as some in swimming, rowing and cycling did not participate. Only 270 athletes out of the 387 applications submitted by Russia were allowed to compete in those Olympics. In the Olympics\u2019 modern history, there have been cases of a country\u2019s entire national team being disqualified from competing, but not because of doping allegations.\n\nIn addition, disqualified athletes were able to compete under a different flag. For example, in the fall of 2015, the IOC suspended the Kuwait Olympic Committee \u201cto protect the Olympic Movement in Kuwait from undue government interference.\u201d As a result, athletes from Kuwait competed in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro under the Olympic flag.\n\nEarlier, in late 2012, the IOC suspended the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) for violations of the Olympic Charter, including interference by the Indian government. As a result, three Indian athletes competed under the IOC flag in the 2014 Olympics in Sochi. However, India remedied the alleged violations within a few days after the start of the Sochi games, the IOA\u2019s suspension was lifted \u201cIt is the first time in Olympic history that a suspension of an NOC has been lifted during an Olympic Games,\u201d an IOC press release noted. The Indian athletes finished the games under their national flag.\n\nIn 2000, the IOC suspended the national team of Afghanistan after its new Taliban government banned women from participating in sports.\n\nIn 1992 the IOC, following UN recommendations, suspended Yugoslavia from competing in summer Olympics in Barcelona after the United Nations deemed Yugoslavia as the aggressor in the Balkans conflict and imposed sanctions on it. As a result, only half of the team was allowed participate only in standalone events and only under the IOC flag.\n\nThe South African National Olympic Committee was suspended from Olympic competitions from 1964 to 1991 for its policy of apartheid. In 1972, Rhodesia was suspended for its policies of racial discrimination. It returned to the Olympics eight years later, following the end of white minority rule and under a different name, Zimbabwe.\n\nIn 1948, following the end of the Second World War, Germany and Japan were suspended from participating in Olympics in London.\n\nSimilarly, in 1920, the countries that had lost in the First World War \u2013 Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary and Turkey - were suspended from the Olympic Games in Antwerp.\n\nThe entire Russian Paralympic team was suspended from the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro after WADA\u2019s anti-doping investigation. Last August, Russian athletes were allowed to participate in the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) World Championships in London, but only as \u201cneutrals\u201d \u2013 meaning they were not allowed to represent their country of origin.", "lang": "en"}
