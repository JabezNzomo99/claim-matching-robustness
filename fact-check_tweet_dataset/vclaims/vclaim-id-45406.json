De Leon also denied saying the statement.\n\nIn an email to Rappler, ABS-CBN Head of Corporate Communications Kane Choa said: \u201cWe did not produce the art card. It did not come from ABS-CBN News.\u201d\n\nDe Leon posted an Instagram story on his official account, too, that said the quote card being attributed to him is not true. A fan page of De Leon was able to get a screenshot of his Instagram story before it disappeared. (Instagram stories automatically disappear after 24 hours)\n\nRappler also reached out to an account that publicly posted the graphic the earliest to ask for its source, but we received no response.\n\nThis is not the first time De Leon became a target of disinformation. On June 2, Rappler debunked similar quote cards attributed to De Leon, which contained false statements about Duterte and the ABS-CBN shutdown. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
