Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Image of dead bodies of Coronavirus victims in Italy. Fact: The image shows coffins containing the dead bodies of Lampedusa shipwreck victims. In 2013, a boat packed with around 500 African migrants caught fire and sank around half a mile from the Italian island Lampedusa leading to the death of more than 300 people. So, the claim isFALSE.\n\nWhen the image is subjected to reverse image search technique, it was found in an article of \u2018The Guardian\u2019. The image had the following description with it- \u2018EU delegates, including Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, pay tribute before rows of coffins containing the bodies of Lampedusa shipwreck victims\u2019. As per the article, in October 2013, a boat packed with around 500 African migrants caught fire and sank around half a mile from the Italian island Lampedusa leading to the death of more than 300 people. So, the image is 6 years old and has nothing to do with the recent Coronavirus outbreak in Italy.\n\nItaly is facing a severe crisis due to COVID-19. The country has till now recorded about 75,000 COVID-19 cases and more than 7,500 deaths.\n\nTo conclude, old images from 2013 are being falsely shared as \u2018Dead bodies of Coronavirus victims in Italy\u2019.\n\nTo conclude, \u2018Mustard Oil\u2019 has many health benefits but using it will not prevent a person from getting infected with Coronavirus. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
