Here\u2019s a fact check of some of his claims. \u201cAs we stand here today, all 50 states and territories across this country are opening up safely and responsibly.\u201d False. While most states are continuing with their reopening plans, several have paused or reversed course this week as the number of new cases nationally surged to new highs and the virus spread at worrisome rates in a number of places. On Friday, Texas ordered its bars and rafting and tubing businesses to close, limited restaurants with dine-in service to 50 percent of indoor capacity, and generally required gatherings of at least 100 people to seek approval. Florida has also banned drinking at bars, while Maine postponed reopening indoor bar service.\n\nLouisiana extended its Phase 2 of reopening for an additional 28 days, maintaining occupancy limits and social-distancing requirements for most businesses and houses of worship. North Carolina and Nevada also extended Phase 2, while New Mexico delayed entering it. Idaho announced this week that it would remain in Stage 4, the last phase of its reopening plan, for at least another two weeks. False. This claim, while true in earlier months, is now outdated. Cases are now rising in the United States. While the seven-day average of new cases had declined and held steady from late April to May, the number began to climb in recent weeks. The United States reported 36,975 new cases on Wednesday and 41,113 new cases on Thursday \u2014 setting daily records both days. Flattening the curve generally \u201crefers to avoiding a collapse in the health care system, which we were able to do in March and April,\u201d said Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein, a professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is a new surge in cases and more than just cases, it\u2019s serious illnesses.\u201d Dr. Sharfstein pointed to the announcement this week by the Texas Medical Center in Houston that all of its beds in its intensive care unit were occupied as a sign that \u201cwe\u2019re in a very bad situation here in June.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the midst of all of that, I think it always bears saying that because of the great work of our health care workers and because of American manufacturing, no American who required a ventilator has ever been denied a ventilator in the United States.\u201d\n\u2022 Covid coverage by the U.S. national media is an outlier, a study finds.\n\u2022 Japan is pressing ahead with a \u2018cursed\u2019 Olympics, in spite of a host of challenges.\n\u2022 Some Covid-19 patients say they\u2019re left with ringing ears. True. The New York Times was unable to find any news reports about any patients who were unable to be treated with a ventilator. As of late April, representatives of 30 states told PolitiFact that they were not aware of any cases. A spokesman with the American Health Association said Friday that Mr. Pence\u2019s claim was accurate \u201cto the best of our knowledge.\u201d \u201cAs we reported early on, 34 states across the country though are experiencing a measure of stability that is a credit to all of the people of those states, and when we speak about stability, we are talking about not necessarily states where there are no new cases, but these would be states where there are either no new cases and no rising percentage or no combination of those two things.\u201d This is exaggerated. Data compiled by The New York Times shows that, as of Friday, the number of new cases is rising in 29 states and Guam, while it is steady in 11 and decreasing in 10 states as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. \u201cWe want the American people to understand it\u2019s almost inarguable that more testing is generating more cases. To one extent or another, the volume of new cases coming in is a reflection of a great success in expanding testing across the country.\u201d False. Ramped up testing alone does not account for the uptick in cases. Rather, the virus\u2019s spread is generating more cases. \u201cSeveral communities are seeing increased cases driven by multiple factors, including increased testing, outbreaks and evidence of community transmission,\u201d Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, testified to Congress this week.\n\nIf the rise in cases was solely attributable to more testing, the rate of positive test results would decrease or at least hold steady. But while the number of daily tests performed has steadily increased from under 100,000 in March to 460,000 to 640,000 this week, the positive rate had fallen from 10 to 20 percent in early March to about 4 percent in early June before climbing back up to 5 to 7 percent this week. Increased testing in other countries has not produced the uptick in the positivity rate seen in the United States. Russia, for example, has ramped up its testing to about 300,000 a day in recent weeks from about 200,000 in May. But its positive rate has continued to hover at around 3 to 5 percent. In states with the most severe outbreaks, that trend is starker still. Positive rates in Texas and Florida have increased to 10 to 20 percent this week from rates that were generally below 10 percent in May \u2014 a reality the Republican governors of both states have acknowledged. \u201cClearly you\u2019re seeing this, this is real,\u201d Gov. Rick DeSantis of Florida said during a news conference on Tuesday. \u201cNow they are testing more than they were for sure, but they\u2019re also testing positive at a higher rate than they were before. And so that would tell you there\u2019s probably been an escalation and transmission over the last seven to 10 days.\u201d Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas acknowledged the same point. \u201cIf you look at the growth or even the decline in the number of people who were testing positive as well as the positivity rate all the way through the early part of May, Texas was moving in a very productive position,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cThen around the time of Memorial Day, there was an increase, and that increase has maintained for several weeks now, necessitating that next steps be taken.\u201d \u201cFatalities are declining all across the country.\u201d This is misleading. While official death counts are most likely underreported, Mr. Pence is right that nationwide, deaths are continuing to decrease, though fatalities are rising or holding steady in several states such as Arizona, California, Florida, North Carolina and Texas. Moreover, public health experts have urged caution that this will continue to be the case. Asked whether still declining fatalities were because of younger, healthier people contracting the disease, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, told Congress this week that it was \u201ctoo early to make that kind of link.\u201d \u201cDeaths always lag considerably behind cases,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might remember that at the time that New York was in their worst situation where the deaths were going up and yet the cases were starting to go down, the deaths only came down multiple weeks later.\u201d Curious about the accuracy of a claim?
