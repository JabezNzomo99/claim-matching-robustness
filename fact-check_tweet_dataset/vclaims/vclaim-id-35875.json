The image, however, has been doctored, and the original tongue-in-cheek message on the poster was unrelated to China.\n\nThe image shows a man standing on a street corner holding up a cardboard poster that reads: \u201cChina Stop eating everything that moves.\u201d\n\nIt appeared in this January 29 Facebook post where it has been shared at least 19,500 times.\n\nA reverse image search of the picture reveals pages of similar photos, as well as a related link for the search term \u201cguy with sign meme\u201d. Clicking on this link opened up a January 28 Forbes article describing how the Instagram account \u201cDude With Sign\u201d came about.\n\nThe \u201cdude\u201d in question is Seth Phillips, who is known for standing on street corners holding up posters with lighthearted messages \u201cprotesting\u201d against innocuous issues.\n\nHis first post proclaimed: \u201cSTOP \u2018REPLYING ALL\u2019 TO COMPANY WIDE EMAILS\u201d. Another one pleaded: \u201cStop wearing T-shirts of Bands You Don\u2019t Listen To.\u201d\n\nSince the first post in October 2019, his account already boasts 4,8 million followers.\n\nA common feature of his posters is that they are all handwritten, unlike the one that takes aim at China; the font on the doctored poster is clearly computer-generated.\n\nThe original image was posted on November 24, 2019, and the poster reads: \"Stop Using Group Pics for your Dating Profile.\"\n\nThe reverse image search also revealed multiple platforms where the image has been used as a meme template -- a few examples appear below.\n\nAFP reported on Monday that the death toll from the novel coronavirus surged past 900 in mainland China, overtaking global fatalities in the 2002-03 SARS epidemic.\n\nAt least 39,800 people in China have now been infected by the virus, believed to have emerged late last year in Hubei's capital Wuhan, with experts linking its likely origin to the trade in wild animals.", "lang": "en"}
