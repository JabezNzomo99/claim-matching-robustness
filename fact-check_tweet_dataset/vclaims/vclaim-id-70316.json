The claim is false and the video had circulated online weeks before Haq was killed and buried.\n\nThe November 4 Facebook post shares the video with a caption that says: \u201cHorrific voices coming out of Maulana Samiul Haq grave... video by ARY news show. Forgive us O Allah, this condition was because of the curse of the oppressed Afghans. Afghans living on both sides of the border are requested to share\u201d.\n\nThe video has been viewed more than 1.2 million times since it was posted on November 4.\n\nMaulana Samiul Haq, also known as the \u2018Father of the Taliban\u2019, was murdered on November 2, 2018 at his house near the capital Islamabad and buried a day later in the northwestern Pakistani town of Akora Khattak.\n\nBut the video footage of a rocky pit with audio of groaning noises had been widely shared online before Haq was killed and buried.\n\nThe footage was posted on Twitter on October 15 with a caption in Arabic saying: \u201cThey were digging for gold when a voice emerged. God knows that it might be a spirit\u201d.\n\nIt was also posted to Facebook on October 21 and shared on YouTube on October 25, where the caption claimed the footage was from Iran.\n\nThe viral video has been made to look like breaking news from ARY, a private Pakistani news television channel.\n\nBut ARY's logo is always animated on their actual broadcasts, switching repeatedly from English to Urdu text, as can be seen on this report on their official YouTube channel.\n\nThe ARY logo on the viral Facebook video is static.\n\n\"This is 100 percent fake. It's not our news report,\" Sabir Shakir, Islamabad Bureau Chief for ARY news told AFP.", "lang": "en"}
