No, that's not true: that news was made up by a satirical website which had a story marked as fake by Rappler yesterday.\n\nAn article was published by The Adobo Chronicles on April 14, 2018 titled \"MARK ZUCKERBERG RESCINDS PARTNERSHIP WITH RAPPLER AS A FACT-CHECKER\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, California (The Adobo Chronicles, San Francisco Bureau) - For CEO Maria Ressa, being designated as a fact-checker of news on social media by no less than Facebook, is quite a feather on Rappler's cap. But Ressa's pride and prejudice is about to abruptly end. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told The Adobo Chronicles that he was rescinding Facebook's partnership with Rappler.\n\nIt is indeed true that Facebook announced a partnership with Rappler and Verafiles to combat fake news and misinformation on Facebook in the Philippines:\n\nBut the part about Facebook already ending the partnership is not true. Earlier this week Rappler debunked a hoax story from the Adobo Chronicles that said Rappler CEO Maria Ressa had been elected president of the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines (FOCAP):\n\nApparently The Adobo Chronicles had been writing several satirical articles about Rappler and the Facebook partnership and their most recent article indicated the were unhappy being marked as \"fake\" while they had a satire disclaimer present on the site. However people who just saw their posts on social media would not have seen such disclaimer and they would also not see the special formatting the site uses to distinguish fact from fiction. The Adobo Chronicles is a satire website from the Philippines with an about page that explains the site's format:\n\nThe fake claims were indeed not in italics. But it makes sense for Rappler to debunk them anyway, I suspect they will probably have the same reasons we do for debunking satire.\n\nThe Adobo Chronicles also claims this:\n\nThe Adobo Chronicles is a registered trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office | Registration # 4711386. And THAT is a fact!\n\nWe at Lead Stories verified that part and it is indeed true even though it was not written in italics:\n\nBut you probably shouldn't believe anything from them that is not in italics otherwise.", "lang": "en"}
