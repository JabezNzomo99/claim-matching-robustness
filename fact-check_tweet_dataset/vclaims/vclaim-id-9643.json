I saw this on Facebook this morning.\n\nThe number of people collecting benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly called food stamps, has been declining since fiscal year 2014.\n\nConsistent with that trend, average monthly enrollment decreased by about 2 million from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017.\n\nThat decrease happened only partly on President Donald Trump\u2019s watch.\n\nTrump took office on Jan. 20, 2017, while the 2017 fiscal year ran from Oct. 1, 2016, to Sept. 30, 2017. So, about four months \u2014 a third of that fiscal year \u2014 were during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nBut some pundits have attributed the entire drop in enrollment last fiscal year to Trump\u2019s policies after the Department of Agriculture released data for the last fiscal year on March 9.\n\nOn \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on March 17, Rachel Campos-Duffy said: \u201cTwo million Americans are off of food stamps. This is, like, the opposite of what happened in the Obama administration, where we saw that number grow. In one year, it\u2019s coming down.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that the number of people enrolled in SNAP initially increased during the Obama administration \u2014 reaching a peak average monthly enrollment of 47.6 million in fiscal year 2013. That rise was a consequence of the deep recession that began in 2007, according to a 2012 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nHowever, as the economy recovered and poverty and unemployment rates decreased, so did SNAP enrollment, according to the USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service. Enrollment was down to 42.7 million in January 2017, when Obama left office.\n\nThat decline has continued under Trump.\n\nEnrollment went down by 1.35 million from January 2017, when Trump took office, to December 2017, according to the most recent monthly figures from the USDA, which administers SNAP. By comparison, enrollment declined by 1.88 million over the same time period in 2016 when Obama was president, from 44,852,347 in January 2016 to 42,969,079 in December 2016.\n\nBut Campos-Duffy\u2019s statement was turned into a meme that has been circulating on Facebook, and other websites published stories making similar claims. For example, the Gateway Pundit posted a story with the headline: \u201cTWO MILLION Leave Food Stamp Rolls in Trump\u2019s First Year \u2014 Saving Country $3 Billion Annually.\u201d\n\nSome Facebook users flagged the story as potentially false, and others emailed to ask us if the meme is accurate. Both are misleading.\n\nThere are two things wrong with the claim: It credits Trump with the entire decrease in fiscal year 2017, even though he wasn\u2019t in office for a third of the fiscal year, and it ignores a years-long trend in the reduction of food stamp recipients. If anything, the rate of the decrease in people receiving food stamps has slowed under Trump.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture. \u201cA Short History of SNAP.\u201d 28 Nov 2017.\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture. \u201cSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Participation and Costs.\u201d 9 Mar 2018.", "lang": "en"}
