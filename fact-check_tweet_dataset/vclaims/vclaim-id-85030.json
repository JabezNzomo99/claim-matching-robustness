This time the fake news is timed with Prime Minister Modi\u2019s trip to the UAE. On the day PM Modi landed in Abu Dhabi, Times Now tweeted, \u201cWhen the Abu Dhabi Crown Prince was invited on stage to share his views, he began the speech with \u2018Jai Siya Ram\u2019, sending the crowd into a frenzy.\u201d In a frenzy the tweet has been shared over 1300 times by those who took it at face value.\n\nTimes Now story went on to say, \u201cAs Abu Dhabi gears to welcome PM Modi today, a video of its Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan is being re-circulated on the social media.\u201d It circulated the video without verifying whether or not the person at the Ram Katha programme led by Morari Bapu is Abu Dhabi Crown Prince.\n\nThe video clearly addressed the person as Sheikh Sultan but that did not alert Times Now to cross check before posting it. The channel had extensively covered the visit of Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to India and his meeting with PM Modi during the latter\u2019s visit to Abu Dhabi. The person in the video is clearly not the Crown Prince. The picture below shows the comparison between the Crown Prince with PM Modi on the left and the man in the video who Times Now claims to be the Crown Prince on the right.\n\nThe channel didn\u2019t pause to think whether it was plausible for Abu Dhabi Crown Prince and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Force to be opening a Ram Katha of Morari Bapu.\n\nThe person in the video is Sultan Sooud Al Qassemi, a United Arab Emirates-based columnist and commentator on Arab affairs. You can read his full profile here.\n\nAlert Twitter users immediately pointed out the error to Times Now. Instead of retracting the tweet, the Channel tweeted it once again after a gap of eight hours.\n\nThe story has now also been shared by other media houses without any independent verification.\n\nThe Times Now story has been shared multiple times on social media by those who unwittingly believed it to be true.\n\nPredictably some are seeing it as a feather in PM Modi\u2019s cap.\n\nThis is not the first time that Times Now has been called out for circulating fake news. In this specific instance, without even a basic fact-check, Times Now has contributed to making a video viral which is being shared in an incorrect context. As United Arab Emirates gears up to welcome the Indian Prime Minister, it is unfortunate to see sections of Indian media spread unverified stories about PM Modi\u2019s host, Shaikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Abu Dhabi Crown Prince", "lang": "en"}
