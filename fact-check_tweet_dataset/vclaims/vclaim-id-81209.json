The video, however, is from 2017 when an Islamic organisation in Bangladesh led a rally to the Myanmar embassy to protest the atrocities against Rohingya Muslims. The video was shared by Fatah with the claim, \u201cThis is not Karachi, Kashmir or Kerala. No, this chant of \u201cIslam Zindabad\u201d is being raised in Kolkata, capital city of #MamataBanerjee-ruled #WestBengal!\u201d The video had garnered over 1,46,000 views and 6,000 retweets at the time of writing this article.

A reverse image search of the key frames of the video led us to YouTube channel, \u2018Spicy Infotube\u2019 that had uploaded the video on 13 September 2017 with the caption, \u201cIslami Andolon Bangladesh enclose myanmar Embassy (sic).\u201d A keyword search led us to a news report by an online news outlet, Banglanews24, \u201cRally of Islamic movement in protest of Rohingya persecution,\u201d also dated 13 September 2017. It stated that an Islamist political organisation, Islami Andolan Bangladesh (IAB), led a rally to the Myanmar embassy to protest the torture and killing of Rohingya Muslims. The rally was stopped at the Shanti Nagar Junction in Dhaka. We also found a video of the march on the YouTube channel of Islami Shasontantra Chhatra Andolan (ISCA), the student outfit of IAB. IAB had also announced the rally on their Facebook page, asking people to \"Surround Myanmar Embassy in Dhaka on 13 September.\" Further, visual clues from the video prove that the it is from Bangladesh and not India. The flag of Bangladesh with the green background a red dot in the middle can be seen in a still-shot of the video. The police officers can also be seen wearing the uniform that is similar to the police uniform in Bangladesh. Evidently, the protest from Bangladesh has been falsely shared as a rally in Kolkata, West Bengal. MP Govt\u2019s Old Ad Against Wearing Masks Revived Out of Context", "lang": "en"}
