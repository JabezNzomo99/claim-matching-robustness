Most published at least one article on their websites. CBS News, MSNBC, and PBS did not cover the case at all.\n\nFamily members discovered the medically-preserved remains of more than 2,200 fetuses on the property of deceased Illinois abortion doctor Ulrich \u201cGeorge\u201d Klopfer in early September, according to a Will County press release. Additional remains, likely also from the time period of 2000 to 2002, were recovered Oct. 10, reports the Daily Caller.\n\nThis image, which has been shared more than 1,100 times, alleges that CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, NPR and PBS did not \u201cdedicate a single minute\u201d to cover the case. \u201cThis is one of the sickest things I\u2019ve EVER heard,\u201d reads part of the screen-grabbed tweet. \u201cSo why did the media suppress it?\u201d\n\nNational coverage has been sparse as the case unfolds, but it\u2019s inaccurate to say that mainstream media outlets haven\u2019t reported on it at all. Several mentioned in the Facebook post discussed the case in broadcasts, and most ran digital stories on their websites.\n\nNPR ran a three-minute, 48-second segment on its flagship radio news program \u201cAll Things Considered.\u201d It also included the case in its live summaries of breaking news headlines that typically run at the top and bottom of each hour on at least four days, according to NPR spokeswoman Isabel Lara.\n\nCNN\u2019s Ana Cabrera discussed the case during a Sept. 14 broadcast, and local reporter Will Jones did a segment for ABC News Live. These two latter instances were less than one minute.\n\nThe Daily Caller found no video footage from NBC News, MSNBC, CBS News or PBS on Grabien, a video clip editing service. (RELATED: Have There Been 60 Million Abortions Since Roe V. Wade?)\n\nNBC, CBS and PBS affiliate stations, however, did cover the story, with broadcast segments and online articles. CBS 2 interviewed an Indiana woman who had abortions performed by Klopfer, for example.\n\nMost of the mainstream media outlets mentioned in the Facebook post \u2013 NBC News, CNN, NPR and ABC News \u2013 published at least one article. CNN posted four original stories, the highest number of all the outlets, excluding wire stories. (ABC News put up at least 10 articles, but they all seem to be from The Associated Press.)\n\nSearches of PBS, CBS News and MSNBC\u2018s websites turned up no stories on the preserved fetal remains discovered on Klopfer\u2019s property.\n\nABC News, CBS News, MSNBC, NBC News and PBS have not responded to the Caller\u2019s requests for comment.", "lang": "en"}
