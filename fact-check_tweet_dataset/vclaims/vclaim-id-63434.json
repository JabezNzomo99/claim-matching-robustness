Twitter user Rezwan posted the image with the message, \u201cCyclone #Amphan ripped off road carpeting in rural Bangladesh. Is it the power of the winds or poor construction to blame?\u201d\n\nAnother user NH Pranto tweeted the same image without mentioning any country. On May 23, Facebook page Shantipur posted the image with the Bengali message, \u201c\u098f\u0987 \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09a5\u09ae \u09a6\u09c7\u0996\u09b2\u09be\u09ae \u099d\u09a1\u09bc\u09c7 \u09b0\u09be\u09b8\u09cd\u09a4\u09be \u0989\u09dc\u09bf\u09df\u09c7 \u09a8\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09c7 \u099a\u09b2\u09c7 \u0997\u09c7\u099b\u09c7..\u201d. The post has been shared more than 2,500 times.\n\nAlt News has also received fact-check requests on its mobile application.\n\nWith the help of Google reverse image search, Alt News found that the image was posted by Malaysia-centric Facebook pages (1, 2) in December 2019.\n\nThe image on the left \u2013 image shared as of damaged roads in Bangladesh \u2013 has been juxtaposed with the image on the right \u2013 image shared by Malaysian pages in December 2019 \u2013 in the comparison posted below.\n\nWhile we are unable to establish the context and the origin of the image, it is evident that it is unrelated to the recent Cyclone Amphan in Bangladesh as it was first shared on social media by Malaysia-centric Facebook pages.", "lang": "en"}
