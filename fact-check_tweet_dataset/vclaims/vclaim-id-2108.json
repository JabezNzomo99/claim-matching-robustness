This was a key provision in the August 2014 Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act \u2014 a bipartisan response to the scandal that erupted over veterans\u2019 delayed access to medical care at VA facilities across the country.\n\nThe Choice program is especially important in the debate over veterans\u2019 access to medical care, because it was designed to give flexibility to those who face the greatest obstacles. Congress created the program so that veterans would no longer face the same type of wait-time problems that surfaced in 2014. (Controversy over those problems led to the resignation of former VA secretary Eric Shinseki.)\n\nYet even after Congress appropriated the money, veterans groups found their members still faced administrative, technological and logistical challenges that delayed their access to care through the Choice program. VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General found that veterans faced several barriers to getting medical care throughout the first 11 months of the program.\n\nSince 2015, VA and Congress made many changes to the program, which dramatically increased the number of veterans using Choice. In fiscal 2015, there were 380,000 authorizations for Choice care. In fiscal 2016, there were more than 2 million authorizations \u2014 quadrupling the number of authorizations in one year, Trump\u2019s VA Secretary David Shulkin testified to Congress in March.\n\nIn his testimony in March, then again on May 3 and 11, Shulkin said VA is on track to increase the number of Choice authorizations even more than fiscal 2016. In the first quarter of 2017, there were about 750,000 Choice authorizations \u2014 a 35 percent increase over the same period in 2016. Shulkin added that so far in 2017, VA has seen 18,000 more Choice authorized appointments per business day than in fiscal year 2016.\n\nThe 42 percent he uses refers to VA\u2019s community-based care programs in general. According to VA, the Choice program comprises a quarter of all of VA\u2019s community-care programs, which allow veterans to receive health care outside of VA medical clinics when the services are not readily available. The White House and VA clarified the difference between the two figures.\n\nSome lawmakers and even some top VA officials use the term \u201cChoice\u201d to refer to all of the community-care options that veterans have. Trump did the same thing in the quotes above, by referring to the 42 percent increase. There\u2019s a difference, but there\u2019s a move to consolidate all community programs into one program. In a recent congressional hearing, Shulkin called for a \u201cnew, redesigned, consolidated community-care program.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to distinguish between the different community-care programs because they all function differently and have difference purposes,\u201d said Carlos Fuentes, director of national legislative service for the Veterans of Foreign Wars. \u201cThat said, the VFW, Congress and VA all agree that these disparate programs must be consolidated to ensure consistency throughout the VA health-care system and to eliminate confusion among VA staff, private sector providers and veterans as to when and how veterans can receive care from private sector providers.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump refers to the recent increase in authorizations, they are a result of policy changes that took place before he took office. Still, Trump has taken steps to make sure more veterans get timely access to care. On April 19, Trump signed into law the Veterans Choice Program Improvement Act, allowing Congress to expand the program and fix many of the significant complaints that veterans had with the Choice program.\n\nTrump gets into technically problematic territory by citing a 42 percent figure that applies to all community-care programs for veterans, while citing one specific (\u201cChoice\u201d) program, which has seen a 35 percent increase. Politicians have often conflated the two, and there is an effort to consolidate all programs into one label to eliminate this confusion.\n\nWe prefer the president use more precise language, either by specifying that the 42 percent increase applies to all community care including Choice, or using the 35 percent specifically for the Choice program. (Shulkin, in his testimonies to Congress, used the latter description and used it accurately. But that\u2019s not surprising, given that he was the undersecretary for health at VA while this program took effect.)\n\nWhile this technical difference means Trump\u2019s statements do not qualify for a Geppetto Checkmark, he is close enough to being right that we won\u2019t issue any Pinocchios. It\u2019s also worth noting that he signed into law a bill that aims to increase Choice authorizations beyond 35 percent.", "lang": "en"}
