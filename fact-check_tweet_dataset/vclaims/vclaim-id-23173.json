The article is headlined \"Iceland Is Offering Money To Foreigners For Marrying Their Women - Here's Why\".\n\nIndia Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this to be a hoax.\n\nThe post by 'Funk You' has been shared by more than 330 people till the time of filing this story. Most people posted comments such as \"Details of flights please\", \"On my way\" and so on. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nAnother Facebook page 'Ghanta Sarcasm' also uploaded the same article with the same caption- 'Heaven is Calling'. This post too, has been shared by a few people and commented upon similarly. The archived version of this post can be seen here.\n\nIn the comments section, however, some people pointed out that social media users should read the full article in 'Tales cart' before commenting. AFWA found that the write-up actually debunks the claim that Iceland is paying immigrants to marry its women.\n\nThere are multiple websites that say this hoax has been on the Internet since 2016. In that year itself, this claim was debunked by an Icelandic website. The Iceland monitor stated last year that the country's foreign ministry has denied paying immigrants to marry its women.", "lang": "en"}
