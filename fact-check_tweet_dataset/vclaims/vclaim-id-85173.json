The GTD produced more than 100 incidents.\n\nBut, for San Bernardino, the perpetrator group is listed as \u201cunaffiliated individuals.\u201d The same label is applied to the Boston bombings and Fort Hood shootings, as well as other attacks. That\u2019s because these attackers were inspired from overseas, but no evidence of any direct link to a foreign terror group ever has been found.\n\nIn fact, during the course of Obama\u2019s presidency, only one attack in the United States is linked to a foreign terrorism organization by the database: The 2009 Christmas Day attack. Here\u2019s the GTD summary:\n\n12/25/2009: On Friday morning, in Detroit, Michigan, United States, as the plane was approaching the destination, a would-be suicide bomber, identified as Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a 23-year-old Nigerian national, on board of Northwest Flight 253 from Amsterdam, Netherlands detonated a device that was attached to his body while on the plane. The bomb was a six inch packet of high explosives containing pentaerythritol, Triacetone Triperoxide, other materials and a syringe. The explosives were sewn into his underwear. The assailant was wounded and damage was done to the aircraft. A passenger who tried to put the explosion out was also injured. 290 people in total were on board. No other injuries or casualties were reported. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility.\n\nThe GTD lists the attack as \u201cunsuccessful.\u201d A video apparently released by the group in 2014 strongly suggested AQAP was closely involved in the attack. The video shows a short clip of Abdulmutallab, the bomber, together with both the group\u2019s leader, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, and American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki (who was later killed in a U.S. drone strike).\n\nNed Price, spokesman for the White House national security council, said the incident actually proves Obama\u2019s point: \u201cThe key is \u2018successful,\u2019 which this planned attack was not. And you\u2019re right, the President was clear that it wasn\u2019t for lack of trying.\u201d\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump and his staff might take note of how carefully the Obama team crafted this sentence. Nothing was left to chance. By focusing on a \u201cforeign terrorist organization,\u201d the president leaves out home-grown terrorists who might have been inspired by terror groups overseas. And by using the word \u201csuccessfully,\u201d the president manages to avoid having to acknowledge the one documented case that is clearly linked to a terror group.\n\nThe president\u2019s overall speech was more nuanced than suggested by the Twitter snippet released by the White House. But we are not sure whether such word-smithing is worth it. Seen in isolation, it will certainly raise questions from Americans who certainly have been frightened by many high-profile terrorist incidents that took place in the United States under Obama\u2019s watch.", "lang": "en"}
