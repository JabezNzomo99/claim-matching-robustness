But we remember our article about Kloppenburg\u2019s prejudging claim. It was published just two days before the forum was held.\n\n \n\n This was our conclusion:\n\n \n\n \"The statements cited by Kloppenburg indicate Prosser is politically conservative, has views similar to (Gov. Scott Walker) and GOP leaders in the Legislature, and that his re-election would maintain a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. The fact that Prosser disavowed one statement, about his being a \u2018complement\u2019 to Walker and other GOP leaders, indicates he had concern about signaling how he might rule on cases.\n\n \n\n \"But Kloppenburg didn\u2019t accuse Prosser of giving signals. She said he had \u2018prejudged matters that are likely to come before the court.\u2019 Yet she could provide no examples.\n\n \n\n \"We rate Kloppenburg\u2019s claim Barely True.\"\n\n \n\n We asked Kloppenburg\u2019s campaign spokeswoman, Melissa Mulliken, why Kloppenburg said we rated her claim True.\n\n \n\n \"There\u2019s True and there\u2019s False,\" Mulliken said. \"You rated it True.\"\n\n \n\n Actually, there aren\u2019t two, but rather six possible ratings on the Truth-O-Meter.\n\n \n\n Barely True, which is what we concluded about Kloppenburg\u2019s prejudging claim, is a statement that \"contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\"\n\n \n\n That\u2019s a long way from True, which means a statement \"is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\"\n\n \n\n At the opposite end of the meter from True is Pants on Fire, for a statement that is ridiculously false.\n\n \n\n And Pants on Fire is what Kloppenburg gets for her claim about our earlier ruling.", "lang": "en"}
