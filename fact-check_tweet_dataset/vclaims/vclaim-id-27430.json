At the time of the call, the administration was withholding congressionally appropriated security assistance funding to Ukraine.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, and Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, the ranking minority member of the committee, highlighted certain events in their opening statements and their questioning:\n\u2022 Nunes said the Obama administration had provided \u201cblankets\u201d to Ukraine, not lethal aid. It\u2019s true that administration didn\u2019t provide lethal weapons, as the Trump administration has. But the Obama administration did provide nonlethal military aid, including training, vehicles and radar equipment.\n\u2022 Nunes said the original whistleblower \u201cwas acknowledged to have a bias against President Trump.\u201d The intelligence community inspector general said the whistleblower did have \u201can arguable political bias,\u201d but that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint \u201cappears credible.\u201d\n\u2022 Nunes said the Democrats at a prior hearing gave \u201ca purely fictitious rendition of the president\u2019s phone call\u201d with Zelensky. He\u2019s referring to Schiff, who at the hearing indicated that he was not giving an exact reading of the president\u2019s call, but rather \u201cthe essence\u201d of the president\u2019s intentions in \u201cnot so many words.\u201d\n\u2022 Schiff said the White House took the \u201cextraordinary step\u201d to move a memo of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky to a \u201chighly classified server.\u201d It\u2019s true that it was placed in a more secure location with restricted access, but a National Security Council staffer said it was not unusual for such calls to be placed in such a system.\n\u2022 None Nunes said Democrats want to impeach Trump based on the summary of a \u201cpleasant\u201d call between Trump and Zelensky. But there\u2019s more to the impeachment inquiry than just the phone call.\n\u2022 Nunes said Democratic committee staffers \u201chad direct discussions with the whistleblower\u201d prior to a complaint being filed. The whistleblower contacted the committee and was advised by staff to contact the intelligence community inspector general. But whistleblowers \u201c typically reach out\u201d to such committees for advice, a government report has said.\n\nObama Provided More than \u2018Blankets\u2019 to Ukraine\n\nIn his opening statement, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes dismissed the aid provided to Ukraine by the Obama administration as merely \u201cblankets.\u201d While it\u2019s true that the Obama administration did not provide lethal weaponry to Ukraine, it did provide hundreds of millions of dollars worth of nonlethal military and security aid, such as military training, communications equipment, vehicles, night-vision goggles and counter-mortar radar to detect incoming artillery fire.\n\nNunes\u2019 comment came as he took aim at \u201cthe politicized bureaucracy,\u201d the \u201cexecutive branch employees [who] are charged with implementing the policy set by our president.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite all their dissatisfaction with President Trump\u2019s Ukraine policy,\u201d Nunes said, \u201cthe president approved the supply of weapons to Ukraine, unlike the previous administration, which provided blankets as defense against invading Russians.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that in 2014, Obama balked at providing Ukraine lethal military aid, despite a plea to the U.S. Congress for such assistance by Ukraine\u2019s then-President Petro Poroshenko.\n\n\u201cBlankets and night vision goggles are important, but one cannot win a war with a blanket,\u201d Poroshenko said then.\n\nBut there was more to the aid than that. According to a Congressional Research Service report in January 2017 \u2014 at the end of the Obama presidency \u2014 the U.S. had committed more than $1.3 billion in foreign assistance to Ukraine since armed hostilities with Russia arose in late 2013. That included more than $600 million since 2014 in security aid, including training, equipment and advisers, the report stated.\n\nIn March 2016 testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the assistant secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, Victoria Nuland, detailed some of the security aid to Ukraine.\n\nNunes is correct that Trump was the first to provide lethal weaponry to Ukraine. In March 2018, the Trump administration approved the sale of $47 million worth of Javelin antitank missiles and launch units.\n\nIn his closed door testimony before Congress (a transcript of which was later released), William Taylor, the charge d\u2019affaires ad interim at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, called that a \u201csubstantial improvement\u201d in aid to Ukraine. Taylor said the \u201cserious\u201d weapons would help deter Russians \u201cfrom trying to grab more territory.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was also a very strong political message that said that the Americans are willing to provide more than blankets,\u201d Taylor said. (See pages 155-156.)\n\nAsked about his \u201cblankets\u201d comment to describe aid provided during the Obama administration, Taylor said it was \u201cjust kind of the more derogatory version of it, but it was nonlethal weapons. So there was communications equipment, there were vehicles, there were maybe some rations, there were blankets, there were night-vision goggles. So it was a significant package, but it stopped short of weapons.\u201d\n\nNunes also said that the original whistleblower \u201cwas acknowledged to have a bias against President Trump.\u201d The inspector general of the intelligence community wrote that the whistleblower had \u201can arguable political bias \u2026 in favor of a rival political candidate,\u201d but the IG still concluded, based on his preliminary review, that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint \u201cappears credible.\u201d\n\nWe should note that despite some public speculation, the identity of the whistleblower has not formally been revealed. In his complaint, the whistleblower describes himself only as a \u201cnon-White House official\u201d who learned about Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president \u201cin the course of official interagency business\u201d from \u201c[m]ultiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call.\u201d The New York Times said the whistleblower is a CIA officer who was detailed to the National Security Council, though the Times did not identify the official by name.\n\n\n\nIn an Aug. 26 letter, Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community, noted that his preliminary review found some indication that the whistleblower had \u201can arguable political bias.\u201d\n\nCNN, citing unnamed sources familiar with the investigation, reported that the inspector general\u2019s conclusion was based on the whistleblower being a registered Democrat. Three sources who were privy to Atkinson\u2019s private House testimony told the Washington Examiner the whistleblower also had some sort of prior working relationship with one of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nOn Oct. 9, the whistleblower\u2019s attorneys, Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid, released a statement addressing the alleged bias. According to the attorneys, the whistleblower \u201chas never worked for or advised a political candidate, campaign, or party.\u201d They noted that the whistleblower \u201chas spent their entire government career in apolitical, civil servant positions in the Executive Branch\u201d and that \u201cin these positions our client has come into contact with presidential candidates from both parties in their roles as elected officials \u2013 not as candidates.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinally,\u201d they wrote, \u201cthe whistleblower is not the story. To date, virtually every substantive allegation has been confirmed by other sources. For that reason the identity of the whistleblower is irrelevant.\u201d\n\nAs for Nunes\u2019 statement that the whistleblower\u2019s attorney \u201ctouted a \u2018coup\u2019 against the president and called for his impeachment just weeks after his election,\u201d that refers to a tweet that Zaid sent in response to Trump firing acting Attorney General Sally Yates for refusing to defend Trump\u2019s proposed travel ban.\n\nAsked about the tweet, Zaid told Law & Crime: \u201cIn the time since that tweet was posted, which was referring to lawyers serving as the force of good to prevent this president from doing harm to our democracy, I\u2019ve probably represented more Republicans, including White House officials, than Democrats. This is nothing more than the continuing partisan deflection to desperately avoid discussing the substance of my client\u2019s whistleblower complaint.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018Fictitious Rendition\u2019 of the Phone Call\n\nNunes also referred to an episode in late September in which Schiff gave his own dramatic, and embellished, interpretation of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nNunes is talking about Schiff\u2019s opening remarks prior to the Sept. 26 testimony of Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.\n\nSchiff gave his interpretation of Trump\u2019s phone conversation with the Ukrainian president, saying this was \u201cthe essence of what the president communicates\u201d in his call with Zelensky \u201cin not so many words.\u201d Schiff later said in the hearing that the summary he gave \u201cwas meant to be at least part in parody.\u201d\n\nAs we have written before, Schiff did make up some parts of the conversation, claiming, for example, that Trump told Zelensky, \u201cyou better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent.\u201d The president never asked Zelensky to \u201cmake up dirt\u201d on Biden, according to the White House memo on the July 25 phone call. Trump asked Zelensky to investigate, not provide false information.\n\nBut not all of Schiff\u2019s retelling was \u201cpurely fictitious,\u201d as Nunes said.\n\nFor instance, Schiff claimed that Trump told Zelensky, \u201cWe\u2019ve been very good to your country, very good. No other country has done as much as we have. But you know what? I don\u2019t see much reciprocity here. I hear what you want. I have a favor I want from you though.\u201d That is similar to what Trump told Zelensky, according to the White House-released memo.\n\nIn his opening statement, Schiff said the White House took the \u201cextraordinary step\u201d to move a memo of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky to a \u201chighly classified server.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter the call, multiple individuals were concerned enough to report it to the National Security Council\u2019s top lawyer,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThe White House would then take the extraordinary step of moving the call record to a highly classified server exclusively reserved for the most sensitive intelligence matters.\u201d\n\nBut Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a staffer on the White House\u2019s National Security Council, testified on Oct. 29 that it was \u201cnot entirely unusual\u201d for that to happen in the Trump administration.\n\nIn his closed-door testimony, Vindman \u2014 who was on the phone call \u2014 confirmed that the call memo went into a \u201cmore secure system.\u201d He said, \u201cAs opposed to going into the standard communications system, it went into a different type, a different, more secure system.\u201d\n\nHe was later asked what it meant for the memo to be placed in the more restricted system.\n\nLater he was asked if \u201cany other call transcripts or [meeting] summaries that were placed into the more restricted system?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mentioned that, you know, this is not entirely unusual,\u201d Vindman said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen regularly, I think most of these types of things \u2026 occur in the normal channels, but I am aware of other communications that have been \u2014 yeah \u2014 so, without going into the specific incidents, I guess, there are other classified materials.\u201d\n\nVindman said it may have been justified to put the call memo in a more restricted system, because an information leak could damage U.S.-Ukraine relations.\n\nIt may be that the Trump administration handles such call memos differently than other administrations. Kelly Magsamen, a former National Security Council staff member under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that moving the call memo to the more restricted system was \u201cabnormal and suspicious.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch special protections are typically reserved for material of the gravest sensitivity: detailed information about covert operations, for example, where exposure can get people killed,\u201d she wrote.\n\nNunes said Democrats want to impeach Trump based on the summary of a \u201cpleasant\u201d call between Trump and Zelensky. But there\u2019s more to the impeachment inquiry than just the phone call.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is gathering evidence on what actions Trump and his aides took before and after the call, including whether the president withheld aid to Ukraine in an effort to pressure Ukrainian to publicly declare that it would investigate the Bidens and alleged Ukraine interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\n\n\nNunes started off his questioning with a statement: \u201cThe call summary for which the Democrats want to impeach president Trump is dramatically different from their nefarious depiction of it. What it actually shows is a pleasant exchange between two leaders who discuss mutual cooperation over a range of issues. The Democrats claim this call demonstrates extortion, bribery, and a host of other monstrous crimes being committed against President Zelensky.\u201d\n\nThis mirror\u2019s President Trump\u2019s \u201cperfect call\u201d defense, and his repeated insistence that his innocence would be apparent if people just \u201cREAD THE TRANSCRIPT!\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll let readers decide whether anything that was in the call summary released by the White House amounts to extortion or bribery.\n\nIn the July 25 call, Trump told Zelensky, \u201cI will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. \u2026 The United States has been very \u00b7very good to Ukraine. I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nZelensky then thanked Trump for its assistance, and particularly for the impending sale of Javelin missiles.\n\nTrump then said, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike. \u2026 The server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d CrowdStrike is the cybersecurity firm hired by the Democratic National Committee after its computer network was hacked by Russian intelligence officers. And Trump is making an apparent reference to the debunked conspiracy theory that Ukrainians, not Russians, hacked the DNC servers.\n\nShortly thereafter, Trump asked Zelensky to meet with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr.\n\n\u201cThe other thing,\u201d Trump continued, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve written, Trump has distorted the facts when he has claimed that Joe Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold \u201cbillions of dollars to Ukraine\u201d unless it removed the prosecutor general who \u201cwas prosecuting\u201d Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, and Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company on whose board Hunter Biden had served. There\u2019s no evidence Hunter Biden was ever being investigated or prosecuted.\n\nAnd, despite Nunes\u2019 claim that Democrats want to impeach Trump based solely on the call summary, the House Democrats\u2019 inquiry casts a much wider net than that.\n\nGovernment officials who have testified in the House impeachment probe have said that they believe pressure was exerted both before and after the phone call to get Zelensky to make a public statement that he was opening an investigation into Burisma and the Bidens. That pressure, they said, included the withholding of U.S. security aid, and the dangling of a White House visit for Zelensky. To read more about that, read out story, \u201cWhat We\u2019ve Learned From Impeachment Inquiry.\u201c\n\nNunes also questioned the motives of the whistleblower and the Democratic impeachment inquiry because of contact that the anonymous whistleblower had with the House intelligence committee prior to filing the Aug. 12 complaint alleging misconduct by Trump.\n\nThe New York Times broke the story on Oct. 2 that Schiff previously knew about \u201cthe outlines\u201d of the whistleblower\u2019s concerns. The whistleblower had contacted an intelligence committee aide after passing along concerns to the CIA\u2019s top lawyer and being \u201c[c]oncerned about how that initial avenue for airing his allegations through the C.I.A. was unfolding,\u201d the Times reported.\n\nBut when Schiff was asked about the complaint in a Sept. 17 MSNBC interview, he said, \u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower.\u201d\n\nA Democratic committee official previously told us Schiff \u201ccould have been more clear\u201d but was \u201creferring to the Committee officially interviewing the whistleblower, and himself personally.\u201d It was clearly known, however, that the committee hadn\u2019t officially interviewed the whistleblower at that time.\n\nPatrick Boland, a spokesman for Schiff and the House intelligence committee, told us in a statement that it is not unusual for whistleblowers to contact the intelligence committee.\n\n\u201cLike other whistleblowers have done before and since under Republican and Democratic-controlled Committees, the whistleblower contacted the Committee for guidance on how to report possible wrongdoing within the jurisdiction of the Intelligence Community. This is a regular occurrence, given the Committee\u2019s unique oversight role and responsibilities,\u201d he said. \u201cConsistent with the Committee\u2019s longstanding procedures, Committee staff appropriately advised the whistleblower to contact an Inspector General and to seek legal counsel.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s support for the statement that it\u2019s \u201ca regular occurrence\u201d for whistleblowers to contact congressional committees. A May 2019 Government Accountability Office report said \u201cwhistleblowers who contact the Congress typically reach out to oversight committees, the offices of their own representatives or senators, or authorizing committees.\u201d\n\nLater in the Nov.13 hearing, Republican Rep. Jim Jordan went further than Nunes, claiming that Schiff knows the identity of the whistleblower.\n\n\u201cOf the 435 members in Congress, you are the only member who knows who that individual is, and your staff is the only staff of any member of Congress who\u2019s had a chance to talk to that individual,\u201d Jordan said to Schiff.\n\nThere is no evidence of that, and Schiff denies it.\n\n\u201cAs the gentleman knows, that\u2019s a false statement,\u201d Schiff responded. \u201cI do not know the identity of the whistleblower and I am determined to make sure that identity is protected.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
