The claim is false; it is a longstanding HIV hoax which references non-existent sources; experts say that while the virus can be spread via used needles, the risk of being infected in this manner is \"extremely low\".\n\nThis post was shared to a Facebook group with more than 17,000 members on June 5, 2017.\n\nThe lengthy caption of the post states in part: \u201cFROM Arvind Khamitkar, I.A.S, Director of Medical & Research Div, Chennai\n\n\u201cA few weeks ago, in a movie theatre, a person felt something poking from her seat. When she got up to see what it was, she found a needle sticking out of the seat with a note attached saying \u2018You have just been infected by HIV\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe Disease Control Center (in Paris) reports many similar events in many other cities recently. All tested needles were HIV Positive. The Center also reports that needles have been found in cash dispensers at public banking machines.\n\n\u201cRecently, one doctor has narrated a somewhat similar instance that happened to one of his patients at the Priya Cinema in Delhi. A young girl, engaged and about to be married in a couple of months, was pricked while the movie was going on. The tag with the needle had the message \u2018Welcome to the World of HIV family\u2019.\n\n\u201cThough the doctors told her family that it takes about 6 months before the virus grows strong enough to start damaging the system and a healthy victim could survive about 5-6 years, the girl died in 4 months\u201d.\n\nHIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, attacks the body\u2019s immune system, and if untreated, can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\nWHO\u2019s 2018 data indicates nearly 38 million people worldwide were living with HIV.\n\nThe text post has been shared among India-based social media users, such as here, here and here on Facebook and here, here and here on Twitter.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe claim is false; it is one of the decades-old HIV hoaxes that have been localised in social media posts, emails and websites across the globe.\n\nThe misleading post has been circulating online for at least 13 years, for example in this April 2006 post on India Forums.\n\nThe forum had some 900,000 registered members in 2017.\n\nThe hoax plays on real-world events in South Asia, for example in 2018, a fake doctor infected dozens of people with HIV in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, and in 2011, Indian activist Anna Hazare was threatened with HIV needles, according to Reuters and The Times of India.\n\nIn neighbouring Pakistan, hundreds of people, most of them children, in a southern province were tested HIV positive after a contaminated syringe was used on them, AFP reported in 2019.\n\nHIV transmission myths aren\u2019t confined to the India-Pakistan region. AFP Fact Check has previously debunked HIV-related disinformation from different parts of the world.\n\nFor example, here is an AFP fact-check debunking claims about HIV-contaminated bananas, and here is another AFP fact-check about HIV-infected Cadbury\u2019s products.\n\nClaims similar to the misleading post, with slight alterations to the name of the medical personnel who wrote the \u201cletter\u201d, the country and the public space where the \u201cinfection\u201d took place, have also been previously debunked by fact-checkers from India to America, such as here and here by India\u2019s India Today and Navbharat Times, here and here by US\u2019 Politifact and Snopes, and here by Australia\u2019s Hoax-Slayer.\n\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a federal agency, HIV can indeed be passed on from a person with HIV to another via a used needle, on the condition that the needle contains certain types of body fluids that can transmit the virus.\n\nThe CDC states on its website: \u201cOnly certain body fluid -- blood, semen (cum), pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk -- from a person with HIV can transmit HIV. Most commonly, people get or transmit HIV through sexual behaviors and needle or syringe use.\u201d\n\nThe virus is relatively fragile, according to the University of California, Santa Barbara:\n\n\u201cHIV is a fragile virus and will not survive outside the body long enough for transmission from the air, in water or other surfaces. There is no chance of transmitting HIV through sexual activities that do not involve direct contact of semen, vaginal secretions, or blood with mucous membranes.\u201d\n\nThe CDC and a paper entitled \u201cNeedle stick injuries in the community\u201d published in the medical journal Paediatrics & Child Health listed certain conditions that determine the likelihood of HIV transmission by contaminated needles:\n\n\u201cHIV can live in a used needle up to 42 days depending on temperature and other factors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe size of the needle, the depth of penetration and whether blood was injected are also important considerations. In most reported instances involving transmission of HIV, the needle stick injury occurred within seconds or minutes after the needle was withdrawn from the source patient.\u201d\n\nDespite the relatively low possibility of HIV transmission, used needles found in public space remains a cause of concern for many. However, the CDC and the paper say the statistics of people infected with HIV due to needlestick injuries or by discarded, used needles in public places are very low:\n\n\u201cScientists estimate that the risk of HIV infection from being stuck with a needle used on a person with HIV is less than 1%.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe risk of acquisition of HIV from a hollow-bore needle with blood from a known HIV seropositive source is between 0.2% and 0.5%, based on prospective studies of occupational needlestick injuries. The risk is increased with higher viral inoculum, which is related to the amount of blood introduced and the concentration of virus in that blood.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s Department of Health has also addressed the issue:\n\n\u201cTo date, there are no published reports of HIV, hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection being acquired by a member of the public after injury from a discarded used needle in the community in Australia. If you do tread on a needle and syringe, don't panic, the risk of infection is extremely low.\u201d\n\nThe misleading post is purportedly written by an Arvind Khamitkar, who is described as the I.A.S. Director of Medical & Research Div in Chennai, the capital of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.\n\nIAS in India stands for the Indian Administrative Service, an administrative department that serves the government of India as well as the individual states.\n\nA search on IAS\u2019s portal shows no record of any Arvind Khamitkar on its officer database.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the search:\n\nIAS officer Dev Choudhary told AFP via Facebook Messenger on November 13, 2019, \u201cThere is no IAS officer with the name Arvind Khamitkar. It seems fake.\u201d\n\nIndian newspaper Navbharat Times debunked in a similar claim in 2018 and stated in its report: \u201cThere is no institute named \u2018Medical and Research Division\u2019 in Tamil Nadu. The second most shocking thing is that there is no IAS officer named Arvind Khamitkar in Tamil Nadu. That is, the source of the news is fake.\u201d\n\nThe false claim also references a Paris-based \u201cDisease Control Center\u201d concerning similar cases of HIV infections that stemmed from needles left in public places.\n\nThe Disease Control Center translates to French as centre de contr\u00f4le des maladies.\n\nAFP conducted a keyword search on the website of Sant\u00e9 publique France, the nation\u2019s public health agency under the Ministry of Health.\n\nThe search on \u201ccentre de contr\u00f4le des maladies\u201d, confined to the region of \u00cele-de-France, where Paris is located, yielded only one result, about incidents of food poisoning at a Paris hospital in 2001.\n\nAFP ran another keyword search on Google including all of the following words: \u201cSant\u00e9 publique France\u201d and \u201ccentre de contr\u00f4le des maladies\".\n\nNone of the top results mentioned any such centre in Paris, but pointed towards the Sweden-based Centre europ\u00e9en de pr\u00e9vention et de contr\u00f4le des maladies, or European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and the US-based CDC.\n\nThe ECDC is an European Union agency established to \u201cidentify, assess and communicate current and emerging threats to human health posed by infectious diseases,\u201d according to its website.\n\nIt is located near Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nThe CDC is the US\u2019 national public health institute under the Department of Health and Human Services aimed to \u201cprotect America from health, safety and security threats, both foreign and in the US.\u201d\n\nIt is based in Atlanta, Georgia.", "lang": "en"}
