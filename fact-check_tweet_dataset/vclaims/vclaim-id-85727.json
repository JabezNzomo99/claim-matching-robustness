But first some disclosure: We on The Fact Checker team all have immigrant roots, like many Americans, so here\u2019s our story.\n\nGlenn Kessler\u2019s parents emigrated from the Netherlands, arriving by ship in New York on March 1, 1954, according to Ellis Island records. They were married at the time and came from Dutch families who can trace their ancestors to the 1300s. His father had been recruited by Procter & Gamble to work as a chemical engineer. However, none of their siblings came after them, with the exception of a sister whose husband worked for the United Nations and the World Bank for a few years before they returned to Holland. Kessler has 27 cousins, but only one lives in the United States (and is married to a Russian native).\n\nSalvador Rizzo\u2019s father is from Mexico, descended from European immigrants. He worked in Mexico even after marrying Rizzo\u2019s American mother and remained a Mexican citizen, visiting his wife and children on weekends on the U.S. side of the border. Three of his father\u2019s sisters and some cousins did immigrate and live in South Texas with their families. His mother\u2019s side of the family is descended from Texas pioneers, settlers who were in the state before 1886. They came from Spain sometime between 1762 and 1809 and settled in Texas before it became a U.S. state in 1845.\n\nMeg Kelly\u2019s German grandmother initially came over on a visitor\u2019s visa to see her sister in the late 1930s. She had been studying in Turkey and was set to return to Germany when her parents, who later went into hiding because they feared being arrested, told her not to come back and instead to visit her sister, who had married an American. Once her visitor\u2019s visa expired, Kelly\u2019s grandmother went to Cuba, and then her sister sponsored her to come to the United States. Their brother also became a U.S. citizen. Kelly\u2019s grandfather was a journalist who had been jailed in Germany after writing negatively about Hitler and is believed to have been given refugee status in the United States the late 1930s. He met Kelly\u2019s grandmother in the States, where they married.\n\nAccording to fiscal year 2016 figures, every year, about 700,000 people arrived in the United States under family-sponsored visas \u2014 adult children, minor children, parents and spouses of U.S. citizens. The District has a population of 681,000, so the number of immigrants arriving per year is just a little bit larger, as the chart said.\n\nInterestingly, the chart says these individuals have been \u201cresettled.\u201d That\u2019s generally not how immigration is described, but apparently the White House wants to make a distinction between people admitted to the country on a temporary basis and those on a path to U.S. citizenship.\n\nThe U.S. population is 325 million, so family-sponsored immigration amounts to 1/500th of that amount. Washington, after all, is only the 21st largest U.S. city \u2014 and the waiting list for family-sponsored visas is nearly 4 million, about the population size of Los Angeles, the second-largest city. Some people spend years, even more than a decade, waiting for a family-sponsored visa.", "lang": "en"}
