Or, at least, that\u2019s what a recycled image recently posted on Facebook would have you believe.\n\nThe image looks like a news story with this headline: \"Popeyes manager arrested for allegedly dipping chicken in cocaine based flour to increase business sales.\" And, given the recent craze over the chain\u2019s new chicken sandwich, one might actually believe the headline.\n\nBut it\u2019s fake, Popeyes Nation. This Aug. 23 post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThat\u2019s because if you search for the headline you\u2019ll find it on channel22news.com, which describes itself as \"a prank website that is intended for fun.\"\n\nCropped out of the image that appeared on Facebook are the words \"you\u2019ve been pranked!\" with three laughing-while-crying emojis, and an image of a clown with the words \"you got owned\" stamped on its hat.\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
