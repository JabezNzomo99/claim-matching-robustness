Some also accurately raised questions about unfinished testing and lack of data on the vaccine\u2019s efficacy.\n\nAs Polygraph.info noted in an earlier fact check, concerns that the vaccine had not yet begun Phase 3 testing were echoed by Russian scientists and media. Phase 3 testing typically takes months and involves thousands of patients who are randomly picked to receive either the trial vaccine or a placebo.\n\nFor example, several Russian pharmaceutical companies asked the country\u2019s Ministry of Health to postpone the vaccine\u2019s approval until more testing could be done.\n\nEven TASS reported there was \u201cno consensus of opinion about Sputnik V vaccine\u2019s readiness for mass use.\u201d The Russian state news agency cited Svetlana Zavidova, executive director of the Association of Organizations for Clinical Tests, who expressed doubts that sufficient testing had been conducted.\n\n\"Regrettably, the history of vaccine development knows episodes, quite high-profile ones, when a poorly-tested vaccine was used to cause serious immunobiological reactions provoking a disease, \" Zavidova told TASS.\n\n\"I hope it is not the case with this vaccine. But it is a factor of danger. There is a factor of efficiency, which was not seriously studied for this vaccine. It is impossible to prove the vaccine efficiency on 38 patients in principle,\" she said.\n\nThe patients Zavidova refers to are participants in an early test, when 38 out of 76 volunteers reportedly developed antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus after receiving the vaccine. Results of these early trials have not yet been published.\n\nTASS also quoted Tatiana Kusaiko, a member of the Federation Council (the upper house of Russia\u2019s parliament) and holder of the title \u201cHonored Doctor,\u201d saying she believed the vaccine had been sufficiently tested and that she would take it herself.\n\nThe TASS article shows that concerns about the lack of testing were not limited to Western \u201cmainstream media\u201d and do not amount to \u201crejection\u201d due to \u201csour grapes.\u201d\n\nRussia officially registered the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine on Aug. 11. That same day, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed one of his two adult daughters (he did not specify which) had received it.\n\nThe vaccine was developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, and was reportedly based on previous work with vaccines used to treat the Ebola virus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has so far not listed Sputnik V among COVID-19 vaccinations currently in advanced human trials, stating that there still isn\u2019t enough information available. WHO is reportedly working with the Russians to learn more.\n\nPhase 3 testing for the Russian vaccine was scheduled to begin on Aug. 12. Because of their size and duration, Phase 3 trials can uncover important side effects that are not apparent in more limited early human vaccine trials.", "lang": "en"}
