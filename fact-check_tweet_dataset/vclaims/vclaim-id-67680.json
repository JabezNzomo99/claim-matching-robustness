Dan Dodd of Hebron. And Dodd most assuredly did vote for Strickland's plan to push back the final year of a planned income tax cut -- what the anti-tax group and Republicans across Ohio say amounts to a tax hike.\n\n \n\n However, it's a little stretch to say he was beaten \"soundly,\" as Dodd lost by about 3.8 percent in his run against Republican Bill Hayes. Libertarian candidate Chad Ricketts polled a surprising 10 percent in the race to finish third. Dodd trailed Hayes by about 1,500 votes in a race with more than 42,000 votes cast.\n\n \n\n What the Americans for Tax Reform doesn't tell you is that the anti-tax pledge was no guarantee of success in Ohio legislative races. In fact, more than 60 percent of the Ohio legislative candidates who took the pledge lost their races. To be fair, many were third-party candidates or Republicans running in overwhelmingly Democratic districts.\n\n \n\n To sum up: Americans for Tax Reform claimed the only incumbent to break the group's no-new taxes pledge was defeated \"soundly\" on Nov. 2. And while it's true that Hebron Democratic Rep. Dan Dodd was the only one to break the pledge, he lost by less than 4 percentage points. We find that to be less than \"soundly.\"\n\n \n\n As a result, we rate this claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
