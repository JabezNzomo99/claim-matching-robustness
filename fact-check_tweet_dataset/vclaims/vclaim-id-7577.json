They want to close the road to eat on the roads\u201d. This message has been shared on social media along with a video that shows rioters attacking cars on a street. It has been claimed that the incident occurred in Birmingham, U.K when members of the Muslim community resorted to vandalism as they wanted to \u2018eat on the roads\u2019, in a reference to the practice of breaking fast during Ramadan. The video is circulating on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.\n\nRenuka Jain, whom PM Modi follows on Twitter, has also shared this video with a similar context. Once again, the manner in which this video and the message has been shared suggests that it may be circulating on WhatsApp, as a large number of individual users have uploaded it on their Facebook timelines with identical or similar text.\n\nThe video has also been uploaded on YouTube with the words \u201c\u0930\u092e\u091c\u093e\u0928 \u092e\u093e\u0939 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0932\u0902\u0926\u0928 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0932\u093f\u092e\u094b \u0915\u093e \u0939\u0902\u0917\u093e\u092e\u093e\u201d (Violence by Muslims in London during month of Ramzan- translated).\n\nWhen and where did the incident occur?\n\nAlt News broke up the video into individual frames with InVid software for videos, and reverse searched the image via Google. A video demonstration of the fact-check can be seen below. We found that the incident in question occurred not in Birmingham, U.K but in Basel, Switzerland. Also, it has nothing to do with Islam or Muslims.\n\nThe vandalism on display is in relation to a football match between Basel and Lucerne football clubs, and the violence took place on May 19 at Birsstrasse, Basel. According to reports, about 90 persons were involved in rioting and the police has arrested two people. Two people were injured in the clashes that took place. The incident was reportedextensively by the media in Switzerland.\n\nThis video is viral not only in India but has also been shared in other parts of the world. In each case, the video has been mischievously placed out of context, blaming some community or the other for this aggression.\n\nThis video has been shared by a YouTube channel RedeBrasil.NET with the claim that this vandalism took place in Brazil.\n\nYet another version projects this incidents as the handiwork of Pakistanis in Birmingham, U.K\n\nMessages and posts that seek to create a rift among religious communities and reinforce prejudices are commonplace on social media. Old videos and photographs are often shared with provocative and inflammatory messages. Thus, it is not surprising that in the Indian context, this video of vandalism related to football is passed off as rioting by Muslims.", "lang": "en"}
