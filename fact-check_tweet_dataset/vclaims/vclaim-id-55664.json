Johnson, who announced his retirement from the NBA in 1991 after testing positive for HIV, can be seen receiving medical treatment related to the virus in the documentary.\n\nSocial media users have shared the still image falsely claiming that it depicts Johnson donating blood since at least 2013, despite several news outlets debunking the notion. This particular post bears the watermark \u201c#CFTTN,\u201d referencing the Facebook page College Football Trash Talk Nation. That Facebook page disclaims \u201call posts are satire and meant to make you laugh\u201d on its \u201cAbout\u201d page.

People who \u201chave AIDS or have ever had a positive HIV test\u201d are ineligible for donating blood and blood products, according to the American Red Cross website.\n\nAt press time, the U.S. has reported 467,184 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and 16,736 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center map.", "lang": "en"}
