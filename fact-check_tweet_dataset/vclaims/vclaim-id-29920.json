The photograph suggests that protesters at Delhi\u2019s Shaheen Bagh are agitating against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) for money.\n\nOn January 18, Facebook user Megha Agarwal posted a collage of two images with the hashtag #\u0936\u093e\u0939\u0940\u0928_\u092c\u093e\u0917_\u0915\u0940_\u092c\u093f\u0915\u093e\u090a_\u0914\u0930\u0924\u0947 (#Shaheen_Bagh_Ki_Bikau_Auratey). The second photo in the collage shows a newspaper article written in Hindi whose headline reads \u2018Reaching Shaheen Bagh for 500 rupees and biryani [Translated from 500 \u0930\u0941\u092a\u090f \u0935 \u092c\u093f\u0930\u092f\u093e\u0928\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u092a\u0939\u0902\u091a \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0936\u093e\u0939\u0940\u0928 \u092c\u093e\u0917]\u2019\n\nAlt News did a reverse image search of the viral image on Google and found a January 16 article by The Statesman with the original photograph. According to the report, the picture was clicked by Money Sharma/ AFP (Agence France-Presse). Here, the banner reads, \u2018Take back CAA Take back NCR [Translated from CAA \u0935\u093e\u092a\u0938 \u0932\u094b NRC \u0935\u093e\u092a\u0938 \u0932\u094b]\u2019. The image is available on Getty Images as well. The stock photo agency also credits it to Money Sharma. According to Getty Images, the photograph was shot on January 7, 2020.\n\nThe collage below shows that the viral image (left) has been morphed.\n\nA keyword search for the newspaper report shared by Megha Agarwal revealed that it was published by Punjab Kesari on January 17.\n\nThe report essentially describes the video uploaded by Malviya which alleged that protesters at Shaheen Bagh joined the sit-in for monetary gains. The article however is misleading as the title poses an allegation as a fact. It may be reiterated that protesters have denied accepting cash and have filed a defamation suit against Amit Malviya.\n\nAn anti-CAA and NRC poster was therefore morphed with words which suggest that protesters at Shaheen Bagh are gathering between 7 pm to 12 pm for a \u2018fixed rate\u2019 of Rs 500.", "lang": "en"}
