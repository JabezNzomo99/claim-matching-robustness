Wala kaming project hanggang ngayon,' says President Rodrigo Duterte even if at least P52-billion worth of infrastructure projects are nearing implementation in his hometown", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Jan 30, 2019 6:08 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-12246", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/duterte-falsely-claims-no-projects-for-davao-city-under-watch", "vclaim": "Take for example the P19.8-billion Davao City Coastal Road project whose implementation began in 2017, the second year of the Duterte administration. It is envisioned to connect the city's Times Beach to Sta Ana Pier.\n\nA description of the project on the DPWH website says this road will start from the Davao-Digos section of the Pan Philippine Highway in Toril, Davao City, and will end in the Davao-Agusan National Highway in Panabo City.\n\nThe upgrading of the decades-old Sasa Port, Mindanao's major port, is set to begin in 2019 as well. The first phase of this modernization would cost around P6 billion, according to the National Economic and Development Authority.\n\nThey don't include other major projects envisioned for Davao City such as the Davao Public Transportation System, for which the Asian Development Bank has promised to provide a P3.6-billion loan. The project, which features a \"high priority bus system,\" still needs NEDA approval.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with these projects as they are intended to benefit Davaoe\u00f1os and Mindanao as a whole. But it was inaccurate of the President to claim the city has no major projects to look forward to. \u2013 Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
