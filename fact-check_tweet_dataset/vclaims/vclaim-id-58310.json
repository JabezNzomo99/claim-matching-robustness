It has been shared more than 8,800 times.\n\nThe post's Burmese-language caption translates to English as: \"People who say they are not afraid of Corona in Myanmar, look at Ecuador's situation.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nAs of May 7, 2020, Ecuador had recorded at least 31,881 cases of COVID-19 and at least 1,569 deaths, according to World Health Organization (WHO) data.\n\nThe country has become one of Latin America's coronavirus epicenters.
