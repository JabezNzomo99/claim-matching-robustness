On its face, this claim doesn\u2019t make much sense: People in the country illegally, by definition, are not given the basic rights that people here legally \u2014 veterans or civilians \u2014 have.\n\n1. \u201cSanctuary\u201d laws restricting state and local governments from alerting federal authorities about people who may be in the country illegally. The campaign pointed to cases where people were convicted of crimes such as DUI in sanctuary jurisdictions and released without immigration consequences. \u201cBut members of the military who receive DUIs are subject to punishment from their commanding officers and court martial,\u201d the campaign said.\n\nWhat this argument overlooks is that there are federal, state, local and private efforts to help veterans navigate the criminal justice system \u2014 especially for those with mental illnesses relating to their service. There are many resources to help veterans receive the benefits to which they\u2019re entitled, even if they are incarcerated.\n\n2. The cost of illegal immigration to federal, state and local governments. The campaign cited costs for housing illegal immigrants in prisons in fiscal year 2014 at $1.87 billion. This comes from a study by Jay Bates, a researcher who analyzed state spending on incarceration and the cost of a federal reimbursement program for states and local governments incarcerating inmates of illegal or unknown immigration status. The campaign also cited the fiscal 2016 Health and Human Services budgeted amount of $950 million \u201cjust to process and care for illegal alien minors.\u201d\n\nAgain, it\u2019s unclear how these two compare. One is about granting emergency reentry into the United States for a narrow group of foreigners, and the other is about veterans accessing medical care. There are legitimate delays for veterans waiting for medical care, as uncovered in the 2014 wait-time manipulation scandal at the Phoenix VA that turned out to be a systemic problem. More than two years later, VA continues to report delays in veterans accessing medical care. But these are not apples-to-apples comparisons of wait times.\n\nEven though the majority of unauthorized people can\u2019t collect the benefits, they paid about $12 billion into the cash flow of the Social Security program in 2010, according to the Social Security actuary. (Some undocumented immigrants could theoretically collect benefits \u2014 illegally \u2014 if they\u2019ve overstayed their visas or falsely obtained a Social Security number.) That means the U.S. government gets far more than it pays out when it comes to unauthorized immigrants.\n\nWhen asked last week whether undocumented people who want to serve in the military should be allowed stay in the country legally (a provision of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program), Trump said: \u201cI think that when you serve in the armed forces, that\u2019s a very special situation, and I could see myself working that out, absolutely.\u201d\n\nTrump often says veterans \u201cin many cases\u201d are being treated \u201cworse\u201d than illegal immigrants. To an extent, whether one group of people is treated \u201cworse\u201d than another is a matter of opinion. But it\u2019s clear that the \u201cmany cases\u201d that his campaign cites are apples-to-oranges comparisons that don\u2019t make much sense. And more broadly, people who are in the United States illegally aren\u2019t granted the same rights as people here legally \u2014 both civilians and veterans. This is an absurd comparison, and Trump needs to drop it.", "lang": "en"}
