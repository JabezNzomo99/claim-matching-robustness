The letter warned that if the man visited or called Johnson\u2019s office (written communication was OK), staff would call U.S. Capitol Police.\n\nCitizen Action of Wisconsin had cited the letter in claiming that \"people who come to\" their dissent actions \"get a \u2018cease and desist\u2019 letter\" from Johnson's office. We rated the group\u2019s claim False. The man was involved in some Citizen Action activities involving Johnson. But the letter was based on his personal contact with Johnson\u2019s office, not any Citizen Action activities.\n\nTom Cahill, an editor for Resistance Report, told us that since the man \"had called his senator's office 83 times, it seems as if his goal is for Johnson to hold a public town hall so his senator can answer his questions directly.\"\n\nBut that is complete speculation.\n\nThe letter also went to a single person. It was not a general response to \"citizens\" who may request a town hall meeting, as the article claimed.\n\nResistance Report says Johnson \"threatens citizens with arrest if they continue asking for a town hall.\"\n\nA letter by Johnson\u2019s office that was cited by the group warned a man that if he did not stop calling and visiting Johnson\u2019s office, the Capitol Police would be called. The letter had nothing to do with town hall meetings.\n\nWe rate the statement Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
