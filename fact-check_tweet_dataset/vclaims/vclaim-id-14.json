Moderates\u201d \u2013 in reference to the Nevada primary that took place on February 22, 2020 \u2013 is being widely shared on social media. A tweet here by Rob Delaney (@robdelaney) had 60,4000 likes and 6,500 retweets as of February 24, 2020, and the claim was reposted on Facebook (example here and here ).\n\nThe image in this claim was made by the Twitter user @KarlMarxJunior in response to a tweet by Krystal Ball twitter.com/krystalball that asked, \u201cPlease reply with the most amusing, ironic, interesting, outrageous moments from cable news coverage of Nevada today. Especially Msnbc. May use for a radar or other coverage Monday. #risers\u201d. @KarlMarxJunior confirmed to Reuters that his creation was taken out of context, mostly after Rob Delaney\u2019s tweet went viral, saying, \u201cTo be honest, I had no idea the graphic would go viral without the context! I was just hoping Krystal Ball would show it on her show\u201d. \u201cAs far as I know, people started mistaking my graphic for the real thing once Rob Delaney reposted it instead of retweeting\u201d, he added. Replies to Delaney\u2019s tweet suggest that many users believed the image was a screenshot of a genuine TV news graphic, with comments such as \u201cI love how they have Warren as a moderate. Don\u2019t they keep trying to tell us she\u2019s progressive ? Lol\u201d (example here)\n\nA Sanders supporter, the user told Reuters he was reacting to how mainstream media portrayed Bernie Sanders\u2019 win in Nevada and more broadly. (Link to the Reuters story here ) The user explained that he was frustrated at media coverage of Sanders\u2019 results in the primaries, in particular this widely-shared graphic (visible here , here and here ) that compares Sanders\u2019 ballot percentage against a grouping of other candidates.\n\nReuters reported the final numbers for the Democratic presidential hopefuls in Nevada were 47% of the county convention delegates for Sanders, Biden was a distant second to Sanders with 19%, but ahead of former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, in third place with 15%. Senator Elizabeth Warren trailed in fourth with more than 10% in Nevada, while Senator Amy Klobuchar and activist billionaire Tom Steyer were well back at around 4%. Therefore, the photograph\u2019s numbers \u2013 46.8% for Sanders and 45.3% for Biden, Warren and Buttigieg combined \u2013 do add up.\n\nIt is worth noting Elizabeth Warren is widely not considered to be a \u201cmoderate\u201d Democrat (as referenced in the Reuters story here ), but rather \u201cprogressive\u201d and left leaning like Sanders (Link to the story here ). Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar are more widely considered to be the leading \u201cmoderates\u201d in the race.\n\nTherefore, while the final polling numbers attributed to Sanders, Biden, Warren and Buttigieg in the @KarlMarzJunior graphic are accurate, the image was created as a satirical criticism to coverage of Bernie Sanders by a social media user in response to a call to action from Krystal Ball. As Rob Delaney\u2019s viral tweet did not state the image was satire, other social media users appear to have understood it to be a genuine piece of news coverage.\n\nPartly false: While these numbers are accurate post-Nevada caucus, this image was created by a social media user as criticism of news coverage of Sanders and has been shared as an authentic news visual grab", "lang": "en"}
