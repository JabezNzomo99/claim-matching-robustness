The site features a line-item roster of tax-exempt items, along with a calculation of how much revenue each would generate if taxed at 1 percent. Textbooks, school meals and heating fuel are all there. And yes, so is the driving equipment for amputees. \n\n \n\n When we contacted the Chafee campaign to ask about the claim, they didn\u2019t flinch. Eliminating all sales-tax exemptions is a way to balance the budget and erase Rhode Island\u2019s massive deficit, said campaign manager John R. Pagliarini. \n\n \n\n OK, but kids and amputees?\n\n \n\n \"Rather than get into a situation where we\u2019re judging one priority over another, we\u2019re saying why don\u2019t we apply it uniformly so it\u2019s equitable, so we\u2019re not pitting one interest or one item against another,\" Pagliarini explained. \n\n \n\n The Democratic Governors Association slammed Chafee\u2019s proposal. \"The idea of taxing the men and women who have served our country and had an amputation in the course of their service? I couldn\u2019t find a single person that thinks that\u2019s a good idea,\" said spokeswoman Emily DeRose. \n\n \n\n But Pagliarini called it \"very candid\" of the former senator to recognize that the state\u2019s budget problems demand dramatic solutions and said Chafee would undoubtedly revisit the exemptions issue once the state is \"back on solid footing.\"\n\nHe bristled however at the suggestion that Chafee doesn\u2019t care about veteran\u2019s service.\n\n\"To say that he doesn\u2019t appreciate the contributions of men in uniform is not fair. His father was a decorated war veteran,\" Pagliarini said. (Chafee\u2019s father, the late Sen. John Chafee, served with the Marines in World War II and the Korean War.) \n\n \n\n Chafee\u2019s views on veterans aside, the Democratic Governors Association is correct about whom and what the gubernatorial candidate has proposed taxing. We find its claim True, though we suggest they make better use of spell check next time around.\n\nUPDATE: After this item was published, we learned that the driving equipment for amputee veterans would be paid for by the federal government for those injured in the line of duty. In such instances, the veterans are not taxed. However, because the Chafee campaign acknowledges that he would tax all items on a list of exemptions, it does not change the assertion that the former senator would tax the driving equipment. Therefore, the ruling stands.", "lang": "en"}
