Two of the images show what look like rows of burned out cars. A third shows several people standing in front of a ruined building. Two more reveal debris, orange cones and smoke at an intersection.\n\n\"All of downtown Portland looks like this!\" reads a July 29 Facebook post about recent protests in Portland, Ore. \"Ask yourself why you haven\u2019t seen this.\"\n\nThe answer, it seems, is because these photos are not recent pictures of Portland. This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nOne of the photos of cars is from August 2019, when a fire in Portland destroyed a townhouse, a gym and dozens of vehicles.\n\nThe second car photo, taken by AP photographer Julio Cortez, is from May 30 and shows a parking lot filled with scorched vehicles in Minneapolis \"after a night of fires and looting\" after the death of George Floyd, according to the caption.\n\nThe third photo shows the aftermath of a natural gas explosion near a construction site in Portland in October 2016. The fourth and fifth photos are also from after that explosion.\n\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
