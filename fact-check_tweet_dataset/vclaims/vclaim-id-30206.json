His legal skills and his advocacy will serve the president well. Trey\u2019s command of the law is well known and his service on Capitol Hill will be a great asset as a member of our team.\u201d\n\nWe sent a request for comment about Gowdy\u2019s hiring to Sekulow\u2019s advocacy law firm, American Center for Law and Justice but had received no response at the time of publication.\n\nSekulow\u2019s statement came shortly after Fox News reported that Gowdy had been terminated from his position as a contributor with the network. Gowdy held his position at Fox News up until the news broke that he would join Trump\u2019s outside legal team.\n\nJust one day after the news broke, President Trump told reporters that because of \u201clobbying rules,\u201d Gowdy would be unable to start representing him until sometime in January 2020:\n\nWhen January 2020 rolled around, however, Gowdy announced that he would not be joining Trump\u2019s legal team after all. McClatchy reported on Jan. 2 that Gowdy\u2019s announcement ended months of Washington \u201cspeculation and intrigue\u201d:\n\nAmid confusion late last year regarding his status on President Donald Trump\u2019s legal team, former Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy said Thursday he has no plans to formally assist the White House in its effort to defend the president in the Senate\u2019s upcoming impeachment trial. \u201cThe president has good lawyers and more importantly good facts,\u201d Gowdy said in an email to McClatchy. \u201cHe does not need another lawyer added to his team. He needs the trial to begin and end.\u201d\n\nGowdy, a former federal prosecutor, was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2010 but did not seek reelection in 2018. The Republican House majority flipped in the 2018 midterm election, and in October 2019 the Democratic majority began spearheading an impeachment inquiry into whistleblower accusations that President Trump attempted to coerce Ukraine into digging up damaging information on a political rival by threatening to withhold crucial U.S. military aid to that country.", "lang": "en"}
