This legend, which has recently resurfaced in Canada, also claims that using windshield wipers will further decrease visibility. This is false: AFP found only one report in Canada of such a tactic being used, and several online videos show that windshield wipers easily remove egg and restore visibility.\n\nAn \u201cofficial msg from police\u201d circulating on social media warns online users of a tactic devised by criminals: \u201cIf you are driving at night and eggs are thrown at your windscreen, do not stop to check the car, do not operate the wiper and do not spray any water, because eggs mixed with water become milky and block your vision up to 92.5%, and you are then forced to stop beside the road and become a victim of these criminals.\u201d\n\nIn Canada, the warning has been shared thousands of times in Manitoba and Ontario since October 2019. As fact-checking website Snopes reported, the urban legend began to be shared on social media at least ten years ago, and has circulated throughout the English-speaking world, including the US, the UK, Australia and South Africa.\n\nAFP Fact Check was not able to identify the origin of the urban legend, which some fact-checking websites say began as an email chain, though the use of the word \u201cwindscreen\u201d for windshield suggests it was created outside of North America.\n\nA search for similar incidents in Canada shows one which took place in 2015 in Regina, the capital of the province of Saskatchewan. A woman\u2019s car was egged as she was driving at night, and when she stopped on the side of the road, several individuals attempted to enter her car, but failed, and the woman drove away.\n\nAFP contacted the Regina Police, who said that nobody was caught in relation with this incident.\n\nLes Parker, a spokesperson for the Regina Police, deplored that \u201call the visibility on Facebook may inspire someone to commit the act,\u201d even though he says that the 2015 incident was the only one of this nature he\u2019s seen.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anything like that happening,\u201d Julie Courchaine, media relations officer for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police D-Division, which polices the province of Manitoba, told AFP, despite the post being shared more than 8,000 times from a Facebook user in the province.\n\nWhile nothing suggests the eggs-on-windshield tactic is a common tactic used by gangs, it is also false that eggs will entirely obscure a windshield. A Google and Google Scholar search reveals no study confirming that eggs on a windshield impair visibility up to 92.5 percent.\n\nSeveral online users have filmed tests on their windshields in order to disprove the idea. One is Sergeant Harry Tangye of the Devon and Cornwall Police, who shows that using wipers to rid a windshield of egg works fine, including when spraying water on the egg.\n\nTales of new tactics used by criminals are commonplace on social media, but often leave out the time or place where the crime is occurring, making them easy to share but often unreliable.\n\nOver the summer, AFP Fact Check debunked a similar false warning about human trafficking at Canada\u2019s Wonderland.", "lang": "en"}
