Several users have alleged that the man in the video is from the Muslim community.\n\nTwitter account @AshishJaggi_1posted the viral video and wrote, \u201cI can hear Naara-E-Takbeer A. Muzlim milk seller doing what they have been taught to as per the book. This exclusive weird video must reach the masses who still believe in Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb & Bhai-Chaara. Just see the filth which many of us are eating/drinking around us.\u201d This tweet was retweeted over 1000 times. It is noteworthy that background sounds of azan, Islamic call to prayer, can be heard in the video.\n\nSeveral Facebook users posted the viral video including Hanif Patel who wrote, \u201cJogeshwari tabela, 100 % pure milk for Mumbaikar..\u201d This caption was devoid of the Muslim angle.\n\nCoreena Suares of Hyderabad-based NewsMeter in a reply to one of the tweets said, \u201cFYI Dabeerpura Police have booked a case against the Owner Ghouse and the worker Raju. Whilst Ghouse has been arrested, the worker Raju who can be seen in the video is absconding.\u201c\n\nUsing this as a clue, a keyword search took Alt News to a video report by The Times of India. The channel stated, \u201cIn the video worker of the Jahangeer Dairy, located at Gol Khabar in Darulshifa, could be seen milking a buffalo at the farm\u2026Hyderabad police registered a case and launched a manhunt to nab him.\u201d This debunks the first claim that the incident took place in Mumbai.\n\nThe report further said, \u201c..the complainant alleged that the worker, Raju, drank some milk from a mug and then mixed remaining milk in the mug with rest of the milk. Not only that he was also spotted mixing dirty water used for buffaloes in the milk.\u201d Thus the dairy farmer caught in the act was Raju.\n\nAlt News spoke with N Satyanaraya, SHO of Dabeerpura station, who confirmed, \u201cThe man in the viral video is not from the minority community.\u201d Additionally, we also spoke with the investigating officer, sub-inspector Sravan Kumar. \u201cThis incident took place at Jahangir milk farm, Gol Khabar. The man in the video is Raju. He is not from the minority community. Raju is absconding as of now,\u201d he said.\n\nAs per inputs from Suares and Kumar, the owner of the farm is from the minority community and has been charged under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), Section 272 (Adulteration of food or drink intended for sale) and Section 273 (Sale of noxious food or drink).\n\nThis video was earlier fact-checked by NewsMeter. As per their report, \u201cThe complaint was registered by Azmath Jeffery of public grievance association. Post the complaint, the farm was sealed.\u201d\n\nThus the social media claim that the incident took place in Mumbai is false. The incident took place in Gol Khabar area of Hyderabad. As per multiple officers at Dabeerpura station, the man adulterating milk is not from the minority community.", "lang": "en"}
