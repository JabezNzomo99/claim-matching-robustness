Don't believe it.", "author": "verafiles.org", "date": "Apr 23, 2020, 2:28 AM", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-45887", "url": "https://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-check-netizens-misrepresent-heart-evangelist", "vclaim": "Shortly after Heart Evangelista announced she is giving away electronic tablets to help students with online classes, netizens pretending to be affiliated with the actress duped readers into joining bogus raffles.\n\nThe spurious posts, uploaded June 7 and 8, bore several elements that raise red flags on the legitimacy of the posts.\n\nFirst, they were published by at least two different Facebook netizens both named \u201cJess\u201d and described themselves as \u201cvolunteer staff\u201d of Evangelista.\n\nOne account appears to have been newly created; the first public post was published only on May 28, although this person claims to be a \u201cstaff assistant\u201d of the actress since \u201cJune 8, 2019.\u201d The other account has almost 8,000 followers and has several posts about supposedly giving away free iPhones.\n\nSecond, both posts instructed those interested to \u201cwin\u201d tablets to register via links shown in the posts, and to leave as many comments as possible for a \u201chigher chance of winning.\u201d The link in the June 7 post leads to a game of online shopping website Lazada called Share Pocket, which encourages users to invite friends to install the Lazada mobile application.\n\nThe June 8 post, on the other hand, asks netizens to join the FB group LOYALTY FLEX to \u201cautomatically\u201d list their names in the faux raffle. Upon review, the group appears to host similar bogus giveaways.\n\nEvangelista has not posted any such raffle-style mechanics for her giveaway. Her tweet on June 4 said netizens only need to send her a direct message on Instagram if they are interested in getting a tablet from her.\n\nEvangelista asks the same from netizens with ailments who need financial support, as shown in these tweets.\n\nBoth of the sham raffles seemed to have taken off from a now-deleted post of an impostor FB account of game show host Willie Revillame. The impostor also claimed to be volunteer-staff \u201cJess.\u201d The link in its post, however, redirects to an online streaming site that scams people into giving their bank account details.\n\nVERA Files reached out to Evangelista to confirm if a certain \u201cJess\u201d is part of her staff but she has not responded as of this writing.\n\nThe pseudo raffles circulated online after the actress announced on her social media accounts that she will be giving away 550 tablets to students from the proceeds of the sale of her artwork.\n\nThe fraud posts have garnered 181,000 interactions and have been reposted for 366 times, according to social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle.\n\nVERA has recently flagged a hoax raffle that uses celebrities like Revillame and Sen. Manny Pacquiao for the fake giveaways. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: FAKE Pacquiao, Revillame giveaways bait netizens again)", "lang": "en"}
