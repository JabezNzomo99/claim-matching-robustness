Largely because of innovation and technology, hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, because there\u2019s been a conversion to natural gas in the generation of electricity.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, interview on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d April 2, 2017\n\nDuring this interview, Pruitt mentioned four times that carbon emissions in the United States are back down to pre-1994 levels. He used this factoid to deflect repeated questions by host Chris Wallace on the health implications of carbon dioxide emissions and how Pruitt intends to reduce carbon emissions without the Obama-era Clean Power Plan. Environmentalists and climate-change skeptics alike criticized Pruitt\u2019s performance on the show, saying he failed to answer questions from Wallace.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency did not respond to our requests for comment, but data from the agency and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) confirm that total carbon dioxide emissions in 2015 were down to pre-1994 levels. Carbon emissions gradually increased after 1994 and peaked in 2007, and they have been declining since.\n\nSo what happened since 2007? The EIA attributes reduction in coal emissions to the switch from coal-powered plants to more efficient natural-gas-powered plants, and the growth in renewable energy (especially wind and solar). From 2005 to 2015, fossil-fuel electricity generation declined by about 6 percent and noncarbon electricity generation grew by 20 percent. As Pruitt says, hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling are newer methods of extracting natural gas that have contributed to reduced carbon emissions.\n\nEnvironmental groups say the growth in energy efficiency also played a role, by flattening the demand for electricity generation. The Obama administration had issued energy-efficiency standards and regulations for appliances to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy production. From 2005 to 2015, electricity generation grew by just 1 percent and carbon emissions fell by 21 percent, according to the EIA.\n\nWhat is \u201cburning coal in a clean fashion\u201d? \u201cClean coal\u201d is a term that Trump and coal industry representatives often use to describe carbon capture and storage, a technique to capture carbon emissions from power plants, transport it through pipelines and inject it deep into the ground to make oil wells more productive.\n\nWhile this technology is thought to be an important step toward reducing carbon emissions, experts say it isn\u2019t being used enough by factories to have made a difference on current coal emission levels. There aren\u2019t many new coal factories being built anymore, and the first large-scale \u201cclean coal\u201d facility was declared operational in January in Texas. So it\u2019s unlikely that this technology contributed to reductions in carbon emissions down to pre-1994 levels. Another coal plant in Mississippi using carbon-capture technology was expected to open the same month, but it was delayed.\n\nThe Texas and Mississippi plants mark the arrival of the technology \u201cthat has been heralded as essential to the future of coal burning in particular (though it has many other applications), but has struggled despite considerable subsidies from the U.S. Department of Energy,\u201d The Post reported.\n\nPruitt repeatedly cited reduced carbon emission levels and new technology for \u201cburning coal in a clean fashion\u201d to deflect Wallace\u2019s questions about the health implications of eliminating coal regulations. He probably was referring to technology to capture carbon emissions before they\u2019re released into the air, transport them through pipes, and then inject them deep underground into oil wells. Such technology has been developing for many years but has lagged and remains expensive. The first coal-fired power plant to employ this on a large scale became operational in January, so Pruitt is giving way too much credit to the use of this technology.\n\nIf Pruitt only attributed lower emission levels to \u201cclean coal,\u201d this claim would earn Three or Four Pinocchios. But in the course of the four times that he repeated this point in the \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d interview, he also named a legitimate factor that helped reduce carbon emissions: the increase in natural gas production. Natural gas has been growing at the expense of coal, so he\u2019s correct to point that out.\n\nThe other major contributor is the growth in renewable energy (especially wind and solar), which Pruitt did not mention. And environmental groups also attribute flattened demand for energy thanks to energy-efficient appliances, products and buildings. In all, Pruitt earns Two Pinocchios for this muddled talking point.", "lang": "en"}
