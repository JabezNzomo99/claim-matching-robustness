No, that's not true: An image of the \"book about divorce\" being shared widely on social media is a photo-shopped hoax. The real cover of the 1985 book shows a flower pot in the window, not a man with a towel around his neck watching as the estranged husband says goodbye to his family.\n\nThe hoax image originated in a post (archived here) published on June 20, 2019 under the title \"Wait a minute.\" The book cover read:\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nThis is a closer view of the fake cover art:\n\nAn even closer view of the purported new daddy:\n\nThe actual cover art as drawn by illustrator Deborah Borgo and seen on the book's Amazon page:\n\nThe book tells the story about the daddy moving out during a divorce, not a step-daddy also moving in, according to the Amazon description:\n\nWe will not spoil the ending for those who have not read it, although we will say the guy in the window does not win in the end.", "lang": "en"}
