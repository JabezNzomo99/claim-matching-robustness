Khivraj Motors is a car dealer based out of Chennai.\n\nFurthermore, a song from the movie \u2018Slumdog Millionaire\u2019 is playing in the background of the video. In the movie, the character played by actor Dev Patel is named Jamal Malik. The background sound includes the part from the movie where actor Anil Kapoor says \u201cMumbai ka chaiwala, Jamal Mailk! (Mumbai\u2019s tea seller, Jamal Mallik)\u201d. Most people on social media have fallen for this background narration and claimed that the boy in the video is actually a tea-seller from Mumbai, Jamal Malik.\n\nA keyword search on YouTube led to the same video uploaded on April 12, 2014. The boy who is skating has been identified as Henry. The visuals from the viral video can be seen here from 1 minute 42 seconds onwards. The channel also uploaded a longer video of Henry\u2019s stunts on skates.\n\nUpon further search, we found out more information about Henry\u2019s stunts and a record on the \u201cIndia Book of Records\u201d website. Henry performed this stunt at Chennai\u2019s Savita Engineering College on April 10, 2014. As per the website, Henry completed the stunt by passing below 45 Renault Nissan cars covering a distance of 102 meters in 27.4 seconds.\n\nHenry\u2019s name appears in the \u2018Longest Distance Covered in Limbo\u2019 category on the website of Record Holders Republic. Additionally, Asia Book of Records also mentions Henry\u2019s stunt.\n\nTherefore, Chennai boy Henry performing stunts on skates has been misidentified as \u201cJamal Mallik from Mumbai\u201d who is a fictional character from the movie \u2018Slumdog Millionaire\u2019.", "lang": "en"}
