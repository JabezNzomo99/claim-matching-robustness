The former secretary of state did speak at a minority journalists convention in August, but that does not account for her dedicated press corps, so we rated Trump\u2019s claim Mostly True. (After our fact-check appeared, Hillary Clinton did hold one, and arguably several, events that would qualify as press conferences.)\n\nBut we were curious -- has Clinton failed to address immigration when asked about it?\n\nWe did not hear back from Trump\u2019s press office, but we found several instances in which Clinton answered questions about how she would handle immigration as commander in chief.\n\nClinton spokesman Josh Schwerin provided us with multiple examples, the most recent being a Q&A during the minority journalists convention.\n\nClinton\u2019s first question at the event, according to Time Magazine\u2019s transcript, was about immigration.\n\nLori Montenegro, National Correspondent for Telemundo, asked Clinton to \"walk us through\" the steps of how she planned to achieve her well-known promise of proposing an immigration bill in her first 100 days as president.\n\n\"How will you get immigration reform, something that President Obama was not able to do,\" Montenegro asked, \"so that Latinos can believe that something is going to happen, that their vote, again, is not being taken for granted considering that the House, at least the House, will remain under Republican control?\"\n\nClinton\u2019s answer was, essentially, that she hoped the Democrats retake the Senate and force the House to vote on a bipartisan bill.\n\n\"I want this to be a clear, high priority for my administration. We will be prepared to introduce legislation as quickly as we can do so,\" Clinton said. \"I am hoping that the outcome of the election, which I am working hard to ensure a victory, will send a clear message to our Republican friends that it\u2019s time for them to quit standing in the way of immigration reform.\"\n\nThat example alone is enough to disprove Trump\u2019s claim. But we found more examples of Clinton explaining her immigration position in interviews and debates.\n\nDuring a March Democratic primary debate in Miami with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos repeatedly asked Clinton whether she would deport certain types of undocumented immigrants. From the transcript:\n\nRamos: \"So you will stop those deportations.\"\n\nRamos: \"... and those who don't have a criminal record.\"\n\nClinton: \"Of the people, the undocumented people living in our country, I do not want to see them deported. I want to see them on a path to citizenship. That is exactly what I will do.\"\n\nClinton also sat down with Vox editor Ezra Klein in June. He asked her several questions on immigration, including whether more documented immigrants would help America\u2019s economy.\n\n\"I think we have to look at all of these issues -- comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship would deal with a lot of these concerns, not just the 11 million people here: how we would regularize them, what kind of steps they\u2019d have to go through,\" Clinton said. \"Because I believe they do have to meet certain standards if they\u2019re going to be on a path to citizenship.\"\n\nClinton also took some media questions when she visited the Jackson Diner, an Indian buffet in the immigrant-heavy Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens, N.Y., on April 4, 2016. A transcript can be found here.\n\nAnd, there are several examples dating back to last year, including a October 2015 interview with Telemundo in which Clinton told Mar\u00eda Celeste Arrar\u00e1s about a 100-day timeline to review immigration.\n\n\"I want to see comprehensive immigration reform. And I'm going to do everything I can as soon as I get into office to push on that,\" Clinton said.\n\nWe have written about Clinton\u2019s immigration plan previously. It calls for encouraging immigrants to become citizens, changing detention policies and using legislation to create a path to citizenship for the undocumented population.\n\nTrump said Clinton has \"not answered a single question\" about her immigration plan.\n\nWe quickly found several instances of Clinton answering multiple questions about her immigration plan. Trump\u2019s claim is ridiculous and unfounded.\n\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
