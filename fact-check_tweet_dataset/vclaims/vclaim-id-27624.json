In the end, it did happen\u201d- translated).\n\nThe \u2018promo\u2019 of the broadcast has the words, \u201c\u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u091a\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930\u092f\u093e\u0928 2 \u0915\u0940 \u0905\u0938\u092b\u0932\u0924\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0915\u093e\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u095b\u093f\u092e\u094d\u092e\u0947\u0926\u093e\u0930?\u201d (Is Congress responsible for the failure of Chandrayaan-2?\u201d- translated).\n\nThe above tweet is by Preeti Chobey who has quote-tweeted another user Piyush Mishra who appears to have originally tweeted the image. Chobey is a member of the Samajwadi Party (SP). Her tweet has been retweeted over 200 times so far.\n\nThe graphic of the ABP News promo featuring Rubika Liyaquat and the Chandrayaan-2 mission is fake. If one looks at it closely, the word Memerao is inscribed on it, suggesting that this could be a meme.\n\nAlt News did not find a single such graphic either broadcast or tweeted by ABP News. Moreover, Ms. Liyaquat herself took to Twitter, quote-tweeting Ms. Chobey\u2019s tweet to rubbish the image, saying, \u201cEdited picture \u092a\u0930 \u091c\u092c verified account \u092b\u093c\u094c\u0930\u0928 \u0915\u0942\u0926\u0928\u0947 \u0932\u0917\u0947 \u0924\u094b \u0938\u092e\u091d \u091c\u093e\u090f\u0901 \u0926\u093f\u092e\u093e\u0917\u093c \u091b\u0941\u091f\u094d\u091f\u0940 \u092a\u0930 \u0939\u0948\u201d (\u201cWhen a verified account starts jumping on an edited picture, it means the brain is on holiday\u201d- translation).\n\nFurthermore, the font used in the infographic does not match with the font colour and size used by ABP News.\n\nABP News is a favourite among misinformation purveyors, who often use the channel\u2019s name, logo and broadcast format to circulate fake quotes or fake news. In 2018, a fake screenshot of a ABP News broadcast was viral, showing Rahul Gandhi had suggested a massive loan to help Pakistan. In another instance, a bizarre statement was falsely attributed to UP CM Yogi Adityanath via a morphed screenshot of a broadcast. However, in this case, it appears that a meme was construed as real and shared on social media.", "lang": "en"}
