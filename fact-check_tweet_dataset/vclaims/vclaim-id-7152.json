Nor is there any evidence that Dimitrios Pagourtzis said he hoped to \u201cend gun violence\u201d by carrying out another mass shooting.\n\nYet those false claims circulated online in recent days after a self-described satirical website carried a May 18 story stating as much. The story was then picked up elsewhere, including on viralitythings.us, which did not label it as satire. Facebook users rightly flagged the report as potentially false.\n\nThe article originated on Daily World Update, a website that routinely labels its work as satire. But its posts are often republished and treated as fact.\n\nThe piece is filled with absurd statements that might betray its dubiousness \u2014 for those who read beyond the headline.\n\nFor instance, it refers to a \u201cTexas Rangers Inner-City Cooperative that pairs wealthy white folks with impoverished black and Latino kids to make them some extra money mowing lawns and doing some gardening.\u201d There is no evidence of such a cooperative, and certainly not one associated with the actor Chuck Norris (known for his role in Walker, Texas Ranger), as the story says.\n\nAuthorities have said Pagourtzis confessed to the shooting, but have not determined a motive for the attack.\n\nFalse news often percolates amid national tragedies, as affirmed by the misinformation shared after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: Santa Fe Killer Confesses His Love For Obama.\u201d Daily World Update. 18 May 2018.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: Santa Fe Killer Confesses His Love For Obama.\u201d Viralitythings.us. 19 May 2018.\n\nHorwitz, Jeff, and Juan A.
