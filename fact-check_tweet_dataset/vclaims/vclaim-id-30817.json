Corona is an anagram for Racoon.\"\n\nA screenshot of a Facebook post about the coronavirus and a fictional lab from the \"Resident Evil\" video game. We rate this claim False.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWithout getting too far into the details of \"Resident Evil,\" it\u2019s clear that the post is inaccurate, as other fact-checkers have noted.\n\nIn fact, the post gives itself away. Beneath the logo for the biological research lab identified in the image is the company\u2019s real name, Shang Hai Ruilan Bao Hu San Biotech Limited.\n\nThe company does have a blue-and-white logo that closely resembles the red-and-white logo from the fictional lab in \"Resident Evil.\" But according to the company\u2019s website, the lab is based in Shanghai, which is more than 500 miles by car away from Wuhan, per Google Maps.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there\u2019s no evidence that the novel 2019 coronavirus was created in a lab. We\u2019ve debunked a number of claims \u2014 like the Facebook post in question \u2014 that suggested the new virus was artificially made in Wuhan or elsewhere.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the new coronavirus is a \"beta coronavirus\" similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS. All three viruses are believed to have their origins in bats.", "lang": "en"}
