Scott Walker.\n\n\"I think this is one of the biggest and most under-commented on -- including in conservative media -- stories this year,\" Limbaugh said on his show on March 19, 2014, according to a on his website.\n\n\"This is simply huge, what Governor Walker has done, no matter how you look at this.\"\n\nThe nation's radio talk show host continued by making a claim about how Democratic-leaning Wisconsin is and how low unemployment is under the Republican governor.\n\nWisconsin, Limbaugh said, is \"one of the bluest of blue states. One of the bluest of the blue universities. One of the headquarter states for malcontent state unions. One of the headquarter states for malcontent Democrat Party union activism. They did everything they could not just to destroy Walker's political career; they tried to destroy his reputation and his political life. They attempted to recall him a couple of times. The Democrats in the Senate walked out.\n\n\"He persevered. He overcame. He dominated, and he won. And in the bluest of blue states, unemployment is around 3.5 percent.\"\n\nLeaving aside Limbaugh\u2019s reference to a couple of recalls (Walker in the one recall attempt, in 2012, made against him), many Wisconsinites likely regard their state as being roughly as much red (Republican) as it is blue (Democratic).\n\nAnd they, along with Limbaugh\u2019s millions of other listeners, might be surprised that unemployment has gotten so low.\n\nThe Washington Post the widespread use of red and blue to the late \"Meet the Press\" host Tim Russert and an appearance he made on \"The Today Show\" about a week before George W. Bush\u2019s victory over Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election. Russert and host Matt Lauer discussed a map that had a red-and-blue color scheme. Up to then, there had been no consensus and some media identified Democratic states as red and Republican states as blue.\n\nHow states vote for president, in the most recent election or the last several presidential contests, has become a common way to identify states as blue or red.\n\nViewed narrowly, Wisconsin is blue, for the Democratic nominee in each of the last seven presidential contests. Over the , only two Republicans, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, have won Wisconsin. (Nixon won in 1960, 1968 and 1972, and Reagan won in 1980 and 1984).\n\nLimbaugh spokeswoman Rachel Nelson said Limbaugh based the blue-state part of his claim on the fact that Wisconsin hadn\u2019t voted for the GOP presidential nominee since \u201884.\n\nBut calling Wisconsin \"one of the bluest\" states suggests it\u2019s an automatic in the Democratic column, when in fact it has often been a presidential battleground. Four months before the 2012 election, for example, Politico listed Wisconsin as one of ; days before the vote, the New York Times listed Wisconsin as one of just .\n\nAnd on other measures, Wisconsin isn\u2019t clearly blue at all.\n\nIn terms of control of state government, Wisconsin\u2019s hue is red, with Walker as governor and the GOP in control of both houses of the Legislature. Accordingly, The Post in December 2013 colored Wisconsin red in how states are aligning completely with one party -- three-quarters of them are now controlled by either Republicans or Democrats.\n\nIt\u2019s worth nothing, however, that things can change quickly in Wisconsin. Just prior to the , which put Walker and his fellow Republicans in power, Wisconsin state government was blue, with a Democrat as governor (Jim Doyle didn\u2019t seek re-election) and Democrats controlling the Legislature.\n\nMeanwhile, Wisconsin looks purple -- as in a mix of blue and red -- when it comes to federal representatives and party preferences.\n\nIn the U.S. Senate, conservative Republican Ron Johnson and liberal Democrat Tammy Baldwin are about as as any state's senators. Wisconsin\u2019s House is closely split, with five Republicans and three Democrats.\n\nAs for party preferences, a yearlong annual released in January 2014 identified 17 states as blue, meaning their residents were solidly or leaning Democratic; and 14 as red, as in solidly or leaning Republican. That left 19 states, including Wisconsin, rated as competitive.\n\nIn sum, Wisconsin doesn\u2019t measure up as one the bluest states.\n\nUnemployment down, but not that low\n\nOn the 3.5 percent unemployment part of his claim, Limbaugh misspoke, his spokeswoman said. She noted Limbaugh had also referenced the Dakotas during that part of his show.\n\nTwo weeks before Limbaugh made his statement, we evaluated a claim by Democrat Mary Burke, Walker's challenger in the November 2014 gubernatorial election. We gave her a for claiming that unemployment under Walker is up.\n\nAlthough Walker is to meet his campaign promise of creating 250,000 jobs by January 2015, unemployment has dropped from 7.7 percent when he took office in January 2011 to near 6 percent. It was in January 2014.\n\nWisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate last hit 3.5 percent in November 2000, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nLimbaugh said Wisconsin is \"one of the bluest\" states, but under Walker its unemployment rate \"is around 3.5%.\"\n\nAlthough Wisconsin has voted for the Democratic nominee in the last seven presidential contests, as a frequent battleground state, it is far from being an automatic in the Democratic column. At the state level, meanwhile, Wisconsin is currently Republican red but was recently Democratic blue, and by other measures it is somewhere between the two.\n\nAs for unemployment under Walker, it has dropped to near 6 percent, but nowhere near 3.5 percent.", "lang": "en"}
