The timeline shows that before she became secretary, the State Department made clear that certain email records should be retained and that official communication systems were preferred. During Clinton\u2019s term as secretary, regulations were tightened concerning the preservation of email records, and concerns were raised about the use of personal email accounts for official business. But the legal requirement to immediately preserve emails from nongovernment email accounts was not made mandatory until nearly two years after she stepped down.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s claim that \u2018everything I did [on emails] was permitted\u2019\n\nClinton\u2019s claims about receiving or sending \u2018classified material\u2019 on her private email system\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s claim that \u2018everyone\u2019 knew \u2018I was using a personal email\u2019\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s claim that 90 percent of her emails were \u2018in the system\u2019\n\nNov. 9, 2015: During congressional hearings, Clinton claimed that 90 to 95 percent of her emails were in the State Department system. She even wrongly suggested this calculation had been made by the State Department, when actually it was calculated by her staff. While not all of the emails she submitted to the State Department had been released at that point, what had been made available so far suggests that a substantial majority are to and from at least one \u201cstate.gov\u201d email address. It is not an unreasonable assumption that these emails are contained somewhere within the bowels of the State Department. But we gave Clinton Three Pinocchios because she cannot make a definitive statement and certainly cannot attribute that to the State Department.\n\nHow did \u2018top secret\u2019 emails end up on Hillary Clinton\u2019s server?\n\nWhy the Clinton email scandal and the Petraeus leak are not really alike\n\nFeb. 24, 2016: Many Republicans have argued that the Hillary Clinton case is worse than that of Gen. David Petraeus, the former CIA director who pleaded guilty last year to mishandling classified information he gave to Paula Broadwell, his mistress and biographer. But there clearly are fundamental differences between the two cases that make it an illogical comparison, based on what we know of the Clinton case so far. At the most basic level, there is dispute over whether Clinton\u2019s emails contained \u201cclassified\u201d information. An array of experts we consulted all told us that as long as the dispute exists, it will be difficult to bring the same charge of mishandling classified information to which Petraeus pleaded guilty. The broad-brushed comparison lacks context and thus earned Three Pinocchios.\n\nRevisiting Clinton\u2019s claim she used personal email out of \u2018convenience\u2019\n\nBut new information now casts doubt on her excuse that she simply wanted to carry one device instead of two. At least twice in her tenure, she was open to carrying two devices or having two separate email accounts \u2014 especially when her use of personal email led to communications breakdowns with her staff. Moreover, the State Department\u2019s inspector general said Clinton never cleared her use of her private email on a private server even though she had an obligation to do so \u2014 and that the department would not have approved it had she asked. She earned Three Pinocchios.\n\nThe only person who regularly used emails is a singular predecessor, Colin Powell. Powell did use his personal account on the job, and by his own admission no longer has access to the account he used then. So while Clinton did turn over more email records than he, she was the only one uniquely in position to do so upon the State Department\u2019s request. Further, Clinton was the only secretary of state to conduct her official business solely with a personal private server.\n\nClinton\u2019s claim that the FBI director said her email answers were \u2018truthful\u2019\n\nJuly 31, 2016: During an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Clinton suggested that FBI director James Comey said her comments to the American public about her email set-up were truthful. Clinton was cherry-picking statements by Comey to preserve her narrative about the unusual setup of a private email server. This allowed her to skate past the more disturbing findings of the FBI investigation. While Comey did say there was no evidence she lied to the FBI, that is not the same as saying she told the truth to the American public \u2014 which was the point of the interviewer\u2019s question. Comey has repeatedly not taken a stand on her public statements.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim of \u2018collusion\u2019 by the FBI and State to make Hillary Clinton \u2018look less guilty\u2019\n\nOct. 19, 2016: Trump rushed out a video statement to supporters claiming that there was \u201ccollusion\u201d between the State Department, FBI and the Justice Department \u201cto make Hillary Clinton look less guilty\u201d after news reports that an FBI official spoke of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d between the FBI and State regarding the classification status of one of Clinton\u2019s emails. But it turned out that \u201cquid pro quo\u201d was a secondhand description of a conversation \u2014 and both people who engaged in the conversation insisted there was no collusion. Moreover, there is no evidence that anything happened as a result of the conversation. The FBI did not back down from its contention that the email in question should be labeled as classified. Trump earned Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
