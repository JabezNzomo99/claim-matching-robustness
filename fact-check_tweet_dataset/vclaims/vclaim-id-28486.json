Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nFact: The video was taken at Red Fort (New Delhi) in January-2014. Delhi Police has suspended 3 policemen after Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has posted the same video on their Facebook account in 2014. So, the video is not related to Jamia University or the recent anti-CAA protests. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, the same video was found to be in circulation since 2014. \u2018News 18\u2019 has posted the same video in January-2014 with the following description: \u2018Delhi: 3 policemen suspended for beating civilian\u2019.\n\nIn the \u2018NDTV\u2019 article, it can be read that the Police claimed that the man in the video was a pickpocket. The same video posted by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on their official Facebook account in January-2014 can be watched here. The video is not related to Jamia University or the recent anti-CAA protests.\n\nTo sum it up, 2014 video is being falsely shared as \u2018Delhi Police thrashing a student at Jamia University\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
