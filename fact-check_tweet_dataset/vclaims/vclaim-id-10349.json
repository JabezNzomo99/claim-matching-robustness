Williams, the author of the book \u201cCounter Jihad. The American Military Experience in Afghanistan Iraq and Syria\u201d told Polygraph.info the \u201cclaims that 71 of US French and British missiles were intercepted are in the realm of fantasy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot even the advanced Israeli Iron Dome anti-missile system or U.S. Patriot anti-missile systems could achieve such a success rate,\u201d Williams said.\n\nThe expert argues that if Russia\u2019s claims were true, there would have been \u201cdeaths on the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomahawks are massive missiles. If 71 were intercepted there would have been many cases of shrapnel and lethal debris falling on civilian inhabited areas and footage of Tomahawk debris and wreckage. There have not been,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the hours after the attack, videos and photos emerged allegedly showing evidence of interceptions and supporting Russia\u2019s claims. However, the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab) detailed that the instances it found were \u201cin fact recycled from other conflicts.\u201d\n\nThe DFRLab points out that its work verifying the location of the airstrikes did not provide independent information on possible interceptions.\n\nBrian Williams said, the evident destruction at the targeted chemical and command facilities in Homs and Damascus \u201cspeaks volumes\u201d to the ability of the Americans, French and British to achieve their goals via shooting over 100 missiles, said Williams, some of which would have been \u201credundant systems\u201d (i.e. calculated to hit the target if other missiles missed it or were intercepted).\n\nThe U.S. military\u2019s claims that the Syrian air defenses \u201chad no material effect\u201d on the attack\u2019s objectives appears to be accurate based on the devastation clearly visible in the footage on Syrian TV, Williams said. The evidence leaves, perhaps, only the question of whether Syrian air defenses succeeded in disrupting a few missiles.\n\nOn to the other claims in Gen. Rudskoy\u2019s comments:\n\n--The strikes targeted and hit \u201cmilitary and civilian objects\u201d;\n\n--The \u201cannounced\u201d participation of France has not been \"detected\";\n\n--The strikes were under fake pretense after \u201cimaginary\u201d chemical attack;\n\n-- The goal of the operation was to prevent the Organization for Prohibition of Chemical weapons experts in Syria from discovering that there was no chemical attack;\n\nAccording to the Pentagon, the coordinated attack targeted with precision three Syrian chemical weapons facilities, and, contrary to Rudskoy\u2019s claim, U.S. defense officials say a major part of the planning was specifically designed with the goal to avoiding civilian casualties.\n\nApart from the Russian media, none of the international observers reported any civilian objects targeted by the U.S.-led strikes. The United Nations Security Council, gathered upon Russia\u2019s request, voted against Russia-proposed resolution condemning the airstrikes.\n\nThe British Ambassador to the U.N. Karen Pierce said, the action was \u201climited\u201d and avoided civilian casualties.\n\nRegarding the claim of France's \"undetected\" participation in the strikes \u2013 the Kremlin\u2019s own Russia Today showed a raw footage of the French air forces taking off for Syria.\n\nThe French presidential office released a raw footage of the nation\u2019s Security Council, led by Emmanuel Macron after he ordered an attack on Syrian chemical weapon facilities.\n\n\u201cThe operation against the chemical capabilities of the Syrian regime\u2026 has achieved its objectives,\u201d the French president said after the attack, praising \u201cthe excellent co-ordination of our forces with those of our British and American allies.\u201d\n\nIn the week before the coordinated strike, Macron announced France has proof the Syrian government used chemical weapons against civilians.\n\nApart from the French and the U.S. governments, Rudskoy\u2019s claim regarding the \u201cimaginary\u201d use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime in Douma, is challenged by multiple independent reports, including the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n\u201cAn estimated 500 patients presented to health facilities exhibiting signs and symptoms consistent with exposure to toxic chemicals,\u201d the WHO statement says.\n\nPolygraph.info previously debunked similar statements claiming that the chemical attack was staged.\n\nAs to the final point, that the strikes were conducted to prevent investigators from supporting Russia\u2019s claim of no chemical attack, the location of the targets debunks that claim.\n\nThe strikes targeted three specific places and those did not include Douma where the chemical attack took place, and so the claim that the coalition\u2019s attack would prevent the experts of the Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) from conducting an objective investigation does not withstand scrutiny.", "lang": "en"}
