On an annual basis, GDP growth has not been higher than 2.9 percent since President Donald Trump took office.\n\nConway made her claim during a CNN interview in which she talked about what she considered to be some of the Trump administration\u2019s economic successes.\n\nThe White House did not respond to an email we sent about Conway\u2019s claim.\n\nSince Trump has been president, there has been just one quarter when the economy grew at an annualized rate of over 4 percent \u2014 the second quarter of 2018, at 4.2 percent.\n\nMost recently, real GDP increased at an annualized rate of 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis is scheduled to release its \u201cadvance\u201d estimate for growth during the first quarter of 2019 on April 26. But, as of April 8, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s GDPNow model was projecting growth of 2.3 percent for that quarter.\n\nThere also has not been a single year when growth was 4 percent or more for the full 12 months, as Trump promised as a presidential candidate. GDP growth was 2.9 percent higher in 2018 than it was in 2017, and it was 2.2 percent higher in 2017 than it was in 2016.\n\nEven the president has acknowledged that annual growth has not reached 4 percent, which he blamed on officials at the Federal Reserve Bank.\n\n\u201cThe world is slowing, but we\u2019re not slowing, and frankly if we didn\u2019t have somebody that would raise interest rates and do quantitative tightening, we would\u2019ve been at over 4 instead of at 3.1,\u201d Trump said in a Fox Business interview that aired March 22.\n\nBut his claim of 3.1 percent annual growth is also spin, as we\u2019ve written before.\n\nConway is right about the unemployment rate. As of March, the rate was 3.8 percent \u2014 down from 4.7 percent when Trump took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "lang": "en"}
