Shaurya Chakra is the third highest peacetime gallantry award in the nation.\n\nThe claim read: \u201cGunjan Saxena is the first of the two women from the IAF to enter a war zone, flying Cheetah helicopters in the Kargil War, 1999. Apart from evacuating the wounded soldiers, this Shaurya Chakra awardee was responsible for mapping enemy positions and transporting supplies to the troops under Operation Vijay. Watch the video & know more about the real Kargil Girl.\u201d\n\nMore such posts can be seen here and here.\n\nALSO READ: Video of 2011 Tsunami that hit Japan falsely shared\u2026\n\nNewsMobile fact checked the above claims and found out that Gunjan Saxena did not receive Shaurya Chakra.\n\nWe Googled \u2018Gunjan Saxena, Shaurya Chakra\u2019 and came across an article by The Hindu from August 2020, which features an interview with Saxena. Towards the end of the interview, the Hindu ran a correction saying that Saxena is not a recipient of the award.\n\nUpon further research, we found an NDTV article from August 2020, penned by Gunjan Saxena herself, clarifying some of the misinformation that spread after the release of the biopic.\n\nShe wrote: Neither I nor the filmmakers ever claimed I was a \u201cShaurya Chakra\u201d awardee. After Kargil, I received the \u201cShaurya Veer\u201d award from a civilian organisation in Uttar Pradesh. A certain section of the internet news possibly turned \u201cVeer\u201d into \u201cChakra\u201d. This has been clarified many times during my media interactions for the movie\u2019s promotions. Is it fair to blame me for this?\n\nHence, it is clear that Gunjan Saxena is a Shaurya Veer awardee but not a Shaurya Chakra awardee.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
