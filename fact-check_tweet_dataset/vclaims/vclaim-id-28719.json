Prior to his guilty pleas, Manafort was found guilty on eight counts of financial crimes in a trial in federal court in Virginia.\n\nOn March 7, Manafort was sentenced to 47 months in prison -- just short of four years -- for the Virginia convictions. The former campaign chief will face sentencing later in other guilty pleas.\n\nLong-time Manafort associate and Trump campaign official Rick Gates pleaded guilty to lying to investigators.\n\nAnother Manafort associate, alleged former GRU operative Konstantin Kilimnik was charged with witness tampering, conspiracy and obstruction of justice. In an improperly redacted court filing, defense lawyers for Manafort accidentally revealed that Mueller had accused Manafort of discussing a \"Ukraine peace plan\" with Kilimnik \"on more than one occasion.\"\n\nFormer Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with former Russian ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak.\n\nFormer Trump foreign policy aide George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to making materially false statements to the FBI regarding conversations with an allegedly Kremlin-linked Maltese professor who claimed to have \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton.\n\nAmid reports that Mueller\u2019s investigation might be coming to an end, various scenarios are still possible, including the possibility that his final report will not be made public.\n\nWhatever the outcome, the Mueller investigation\u2019s efforts to determine the nature of the Kremlin\u2019s influence campaign, as demonstrated by the number of Mueller indictments, suggests the probe has been efficacious.\n\nPolygraph.info therefore finds Peskov\u2019s comment to be false.", "lang": "en"}
