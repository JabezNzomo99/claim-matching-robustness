The Chinese side also suffered an unconfirmed number of fatalities.\n\nFacebook page \u201cI love my kashmir\u201d shared the viral video on June 20 with the caption: \u201cviral video from Ladakh Galwan valley Indian Army Thrashed by Chinese Army on LAC #KASHMIR\u201d.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is old and unrelated. The soldiers seen in the video belong to Border Security Force (BSF) and they were injured in a bus accident in Meghalaya last year.\n\nThe 1-minute-41-second video shows some soldiers lying on the ground, crying in pain. A voice of a person speaking in Hindi can also be heard. This person is trying to comfort the soldiers saying, \u201cYou are a soldier, you shouldn\u2019t panic\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, everything will be all right\u201d and \u201cThe ambulance is on its way. You will be fine\u201d.\n\nTill the filing of this story, the video was viewed almost 2 lakh times and shared over 4,000 times. The archived version can be seen here (http://archive.is/zCONX).\n\nUpon conducting a reverse image search of the video key frames, we found that a longer (2-minute-59-second) version of the same video was shared on the YouTube channel of \u201cNation Bharatvarsh\u201d on November 1, 2019. The Hindi caption along with the video translates to, \u201cMeghalaya: Bus carrying 20 BSF jawans fell in a deep gorge. One civilian helper died on the spot. The jawans were returning to their base in Silchar from Jagiroad via Meghalaya.\u201d\n\nWith this information, we did a keyword search on Google and found several news reports which confirmed that the video is indeed related to a bus accident involving BSF jawans in Meghalaya last year. Several news websites had covered the incident then.\n\nSome news websites had published an image of the accident taken from a different angle.\n\nThe video went viral last year too when some Pakistani social media users claimed it was an act of revenge by their army. These users claimed that the Pakistani army blew up a bus full of Indian soldiers after ceasefire violations by the Indian Army. One such social media post can be viewed here.\n\nThis claim was then bunked by \u201cThe Times of India\u201d.\n\nHence, it is clear that the viral video is not related to the ongoing tension along the LAC in Ladakh between Indian and Chinese troops. It was an accident involving a bus carrying BSF jawans in Meghalaya last year.", "lang": "en"}
