In a tweet posted that around 6 PM that same day, Prasad asked Congress President Rahul Gandhi to apologise for Tharoor\u2019s comments, which he described as a \u201chorrific denunciation\u201d of Hindu Gods and the faith.\n\nSeveral other BJP leaders also reacted strongly against Tharoor, with Bihar MP RK Sinha penning an article where he called Tharoor a \u201chabitual abuser\u201d, accusing him of using foul language against Prime Minister Modi by dragging Lord Shiva\u2019s name.\n\nMinister of State for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Giriraj Singh said that Tharoor would have been \u2018silenced\u2019 had he made the remark in Pakistan. \u201cHe has not only insulted the Prime Minister but crores of Hindus and followers of Lord Shiva in this country,\u201d stated the BJP minister.\n\nBJP spokesperson Sambit Patra demanded that Congress President Rahul Gandhi expels Tharoor from the party for his remarks.\n\nAmerican-Hindu acharya Dr David Frawley also condemned Tharoor, claiming that he \u201cmisleadingly used Lord Shiva to attack Modi\u201d.\n\nWhat did Tharoor really say?\n\nIf one carefully listens to the video where Tharoor is making the statement, it is clear that the remark wasn\u2019t his but the Congress MP was quoting an unidentified RSS leader who gave a bite to The Caravan\u2019s Vinod Jose.\n\nThis is what Tharoor said at the Bangalore Literature Festival on October 28: \u201cThere is an extraordinarily striking metaphor expressed by an unnamed Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) source to the journalist Vinod Jose of the Caravan, which I quote. In which they expressed their frustration in their inability to curb Modi. Modi is like a scorpion sitting on a Shivling, you cannot remove him with your hand and you cannot hit it with a chappal either.\u201d\n\nIn a 2012 report \u2013 \u2018The Emperor Uncrowned \u2013 the rise of Narendra Modi\u2019 \u2013 by The Caravan\u2019s Executive Editor Vinod Jose, an RSS leader gave the Modi-scorpion metaphor.\n\nWhen Jose was asked by a Twitter user to reveal the name of the RSS leader, he declined to say. \u201cHow can a journalist betray his source?\u201d he tweeted, adding that the Modi-scorpion metaphor was not only quoted by the RSS leader but also by Gordhan Zadaphia, former Gujarat Home Minister under the chief ministership of Narendra Modi in 2001-02.\n\nShashi Tharoor tweeted a 50-second clip of Zadaphia quoting the same metaphor.\n\nThe original video is six minutes long and was posted by NewsX on September 12, 2010. In the 20th second of the video, the words \u2013 \u2018Modi a Bichhu\u2019 \u2013 are flashed on the screen, subsequent to which Zadaphia says \u2013 \u201cIf I wanted to say, I can say that a scorpion is sitting on a Shiva Linga. Neither can sangh parivar touch it, nor can they throw anything (at it which) damages (the Linga). The whole parivar is visualising, they are having these feelings but they can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nShashi Tharoor did not make the Modi-scorpion reference himself but quoted an RSS member, which he clearly stated in his speech, yet BJP leaders attempted to portray it as an anti-Hindu and anti-Modi remark. In fact, Ravi Shankar Prasad went so far as to hold a press conference based on this twisted narrative.", "lang": "en"}
