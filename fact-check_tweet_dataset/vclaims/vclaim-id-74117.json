In the first and last weeks of June, netizens and FB pages Mahal ko bansa ko, SOLID Duterte, and Pres. Digong Supporters recycled a two-year old TIME magazine article by American political scientist Ian Bremmer.\n\nIn the story, Bremmer labeled Duterte and his counterparts in Russia, Turkey and Hungary as strongmen, although it meant anything but a compliment. The title was even decried by Duterte, saying he \u201cnever sent anybody to jail for talking or bad mouthing\u201d him.\n\nIn a follow-up article after Duterte\u2019s denial, Bremmer stood by his story and said strongmen were \u201cleaders who\u2019ve won elections in their countries while restricting basic freedoms to tighten their hold on power.\u201d He then pointed out Duterte\u2019s war on drugs that killed thousands \u201cincluding children, most of them poor people,\u201d and the persecution of his critics including Sen. Leila de Lima and former Supreme Court Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno.\n\nThree of the five spurious posts used a photo of the \u201c2009 TIME 100\u201d magazine cover juxtaposed with a Reuters photo of Duterte. It carried the text, translated from Filipino, \u201cPresident Duterte recognized again by TIME Magazine as 'strongman' in the world!\u201d\n\nThe two other posts used a 2018 cover of the news magazine. The particular issue featured strongmen. The FB posts, however, but did not indicate that the TIME feature was outdated. A similar claim, but in video format, made the rounds in May.\n\nThe five false posts came as the Duterte administration continued to face criticism over a number of issues, including the still-rising number of COVID-19 cases in the country, the shutting down of media giant ABS-CBN, and the controversial Anti-Terror Bill which was called \u201ca human rights disaster in the making\u201d by the Human Rights Watch. The bill was signed into law by Duterte on Friday.\n\nCollectively, the posts have accumulated over 600 comments, 3,200 reactions, and 2,800 shares from netizens on FB. Mahal ko bansa ko, Pres. Digong Supporters and SOLID Duterte were created in February, July, and April 2020, respectively.", "lang": "en"}
