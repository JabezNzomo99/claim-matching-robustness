This claim is false.\n\nExamples can be seen here and here .\n\nOne image reads, \u201cToo funny not to post. HAHAHAHAHAA Hillary Clinton in 2013: \u201cI Would Like To See People Like Donald Trump Run For Office. They\u2019re Honest And Can\u2019t Be Bought\u201d (She got Her Wish)\u201d\n\nThe quote originated from a now-deleted article on a now-deleted website called therightists.com ( here ). The \u201cAbout Us \u201d page of the website describes it as a mixture of real news and satire: \u201cThis is HYBRID site of news and satire. part of our stories already happens, part, not yet. NOT all of our stories are true!\u201d ( archive.vn/1dFo2 ) While it doesn\u2019t specify whether the article about Clinton was written as a real news or satire, it appears to be the latter.\n\nThe article refers to a speech Clinton made at the Builders and Innovators Summit by Goldman Sachs on October 19, 2013, the transcript of which was released in a series of emails from John Podesta by Wikileaks. Clinton\u2019s campaign did not release these transcripts of her speeches ( here ) and the campaign also refused to confirm the authenticity of the documents released by Wikileaks. ( here ).\n\nThis document does exist and is available to download here (View source > download raw source > open email > 3rd attachment for oct 29 transcript). The transcript does not include the quote in the claim.\n\nThe most similar quote to the claim in the email is in the following answer Clinton gave in response to a question from an attendee: \u201cYou know, I would like to see more successful business people run for office. I really would like to see that because I do think, you know, you don\u2019t have to have 30 billion, but you have a certain level of freedom.\u201d\n\nClinton does not mention Donald Trump in this exchange or in the rest of the transcript. The article appears to have embellished what Clinton said in the speech and fabricated the part about Trump.\n\nFalse. There is no evidence Hillary Clinton said she would like to see Donald Trump run for office.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
