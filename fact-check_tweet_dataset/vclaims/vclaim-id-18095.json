The Reuters article is a preview of the August 2004 Esquire story, but just one month earlier. In any case, by the middle of 2004, many Americans had turned against the war, making Trump\u2019s position not particularly unique. [Update: In light of Trump\u2019s repeated false claim, Esquire has added an editor\u2019s note to its August 2004 story. The note reads: \u201cThe following story was published in the August 2004 issue of Esquire. During the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed to have been against the Iraq War from the beginning, and he has cited this story as proof. The Iraq War began in March 2003, more than a year before this story ran, thus nullifying Trump\u2019s timeline.\"]", "lang": "en"}
