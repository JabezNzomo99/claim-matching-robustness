Lindsey Graham suggested President Donald Trump \"probably\" knows more about medicine and viruses than the NIH and the CDC.\n\nThe tweet, which has been deleted, is circulating on other social media platforms and reads:\n\n\"CAPITOL HILL: @LindseyGrahamSC says @realDonaldTrump \"probably knows more about medicine and specifically viruses than any of the so-called scientists at the NIH and CDC. If anyone is going to eradicate this plague it'll be the president.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThis is not a genuine quote by Graham. No credible news reports have published the statement, and we couldn\u2019t find it on any of the senator\u2019 s social media pages.\n\nGraham released a statement on Feb. 26 praising Trump\u2019s response to the current coronavirus outbreak, but he doesn\u2019t suggest in that statement that he believes Trump knows more about the virus than medical professionals.\n\nWe reached out to Graham\u2019s office for comment but did not hear back in time of publication.\n\nThe person who tweeted the made-up quote, Dan Lyons, describes himself on his Twitter account as an \"inventor of fake news.\" But this context is lost on people who viewed the tweet on other platforms and those who didn\u2019t visit his profile.", "lang": "en"}
