The claim is false; the video was filmed in Sydney, Australia.\n\nThe 15 second video was shared in this Twitter post on July 7, 2019, where it has been viewed more than 17,000 times.\n\nThe caption of the French-language tweet translates to English as: \u201cHailstorms in France. Protect your cars\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the video:\n\nThe video has been included in several news reports about hail storms that hit south-central France in early July, including here on CNN Greece, here on Russian TV network RT and here on Indonesian news site Okezone News.\n\nHere is an AFP report about the storms.\n\nThe claim is false; the video was shot in Sydney, Australia.\n\nThis Facebook post containing the video shows the Instagram ID @tors_ and a horizontal bar at the top which indicates it is an Instagram story.\n\nThe video was posted here during the week of December 24, 2018, on the Instagram stories archive of Instagram user @tors_.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the video on Instagram:\n\nTori McPherson, owner of the @tors_ account, told AFP in an email dated 9 July, 2019, that she filmed the video in Bondi, an eastern suburb of Sydney, Australia.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the email:\n\nPaul Parks told AFP that he was the man seen in the video.\n\n\"The hail arrived suddenly but because I have a brewery in my garage (@BeachBeerBondi) I couldn't park it in there. I started to lay some boxes on the bonnet then got walloped in the noggin by an ice brick. I had to protect head so I put a box on and continued the task at hand.\n\n\"At the time i thought it might be a funny situation so I also setup my phone from the inside view. Check it out,\" he told AFP by email, providing this dropbox link to a video showing the same scene from inside his car and garage.\n\nThe same structures seen in the video in the misleading posts can also be seen on Google Street View here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading tweet (L) and Google Street View (R):\n\nThe video was posted originally shared on Instagram as hail storms hit Sydney in December 2018.
