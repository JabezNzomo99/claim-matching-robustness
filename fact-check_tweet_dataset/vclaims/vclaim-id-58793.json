No, that's not true: in an interview Gates estimated that the economic benefits to the world from his $10 billlion in charitable investments totalled $200 billion, he did not say that he personally profited or would profit from it.\n\nThe windfall claim appeared in a post published on YouTube on May 3, 2020, titled \"Bill Gates admits on CNBC TV he's making 200 BILLION US$ on his Vaccinations\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nBill Gates admits on CNBC TV he's making 200 billion US$ on his vaccinations.\n\nA fake caption, under an image of Gates and CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" interviewer Becky Quick, states:\n\nInvesting in global health organizations aimed at increasing access to vaccines created a 20-to-1 return in economic benefit, billionaire Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates told CNBC on Wednesday.\n\nHere is the 25-second edited version designed to make Gates look like a profiteer.\n\nHere is the transcript:\n\nThe edits in the video are clumsy. At 0:17 on the tape, for example, there is a visible jump in the picture where Gates' body jerks and words were removed.\n\nAmong the portions cut from the video are Gates' estimation of the value of vaccine readiness: \"You literally save millions of lives.\"\n\n\"It is increasingly clear that the world's response to this pandemic will not be effective unless it is also equitable,\" said Gates Foundation co-chair Melinda Gates. These funds will support efforts against COVID-19 in low-and-middle-income countries.\n\nThe poster, who calls himself TheRobolinux, put the video on YouTube on May 13, 2020, but the real CNBC interview took place January 23, 2019, in Davos, Switzerland. (That was a full year before the novel coronavirus was heard of.) Gates was attending a World Economic Forum summit where he spoke about how saving lives through vaccinations can boost the economy of a country where preventable diseases are still rampant.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has funneled billions into three main groups: the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. The money doesn't go into Gates' pocket.\n\nThe estimate of $10 billion turning into $200 billion actually came from the Copenhagen Consensus Center, a think tank that estimates cost analysis to global problems, and was not invented by the Gates Foundation.\n\nCNBC asked whether, because of all the anti-vaxxers in the United States, Gates is worried that the power of vaccinations will diminish. Robolinux edited out the part where Gates said \"300,000 kids worldwide die of measles.\"\n\nGiven the apparent generosity on Bill Gates' part, why is he the top target for Coronavirus conspiracy theories?\n\nWriting for CNBC's Make It page on April 17, Tom Huddleston Jr. said:\n\nTheories have claimed that Gates knew ahead of time that Covid-19 would erupt and that he was readying the technology to implant chips in the population as a means of forced vaccination. Mentions of Gates at 18,000 per day in April, according to Zignal Labs.\n\nThe rumors are kept alive by anti-vaxxers and others who do not like the fact that Gates has been outspoken about the broader threat a global pandemic could pose for several years, with some claiming that fact as evidence the billionaire knew, specifically, about coronavirus ahead of time. The family stores extra food in their basement to prepare for a pandemic, according to his wife, Melinda.\n\nAnd Gates gave a TED Talk speech in 2015 warning people that an infectious virus was a greater risk to humanity than nuclear war. Various anti-vaccination groups and the conspiracy group QAnon now reportedly cite the video as supposed evidence of Gates' foreknowledge of the event.\n\nLead Stories has debunked numerous Gates rumors of that type: Gates did not patent the coronavirus. And he will not profit from a Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nMark Suzman, CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, told the New York Times, it is \"distressing that people are spreading misinformation when we should all be looking for ways to collaborate and save lives.\"\n\nHere are several recent fact checks by Lead Stories about Bill Gates:\n\nFact Check: Bill Gates Did NOT Admit That 700,000 People Will Be Harmed Or Killed By 'His' Coronavirus Vaccines\n\nFact Check: Bill Gates Did NOT Say The Catholic Religion May Have To Be Suspended Forever\n\n\n\nFact Check: Dr. Fauci Did NOT Serve On Microsoft's Board of Directors\n\n\n\nFact Check: Video Does NOT Reveal That Coronavirus Vaccine Was Patented By Bill Gates In 2006\n\n\n\nFact Check: Bill Gates, WHO & World Bank NOT 'Trumped' By President Amid Coronavirus\n\n\n\nFact Check: No Proof Is U.S. Planning to Force Vaccinations With Bill Gates Amid Coronavirus\n\n\n\nFact Check: India Is NOT Suing Bill Gates For Vaccination Deaths\n\n\n\nFact Check: Bill Gates Does NOT Have Access To Your DNA And Does NOT Have Ownership In WHO\n\n\n\nFact Check: Bill Gates Did NOT Write Open Letter Saying COVID-19 Reminds 'We Are All Equal'", "lang": "en"}
