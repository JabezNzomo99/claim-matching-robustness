What added credibility to this earth-shattering allegation was the country's anti-corruption watchdog National Accountability Bureau (NAB) ordering an investigation based on a media report. The report had claimed that the World Bank's migration and remittance book 2016 had carried this information.\n\nThe NAB's press release further went on to add that \"The foreign exchange reserves of India were increased by $4.9 billion by receiving such huge amount sent through money laundering, inflicting losses to Pakistan's national kitty as per media report.\"\n\nBut as the news spread like wildfire on May 8, the World Bank issued a press release denying any such mention of money laundering in its report.\n\nThe World Bank also referred to a statement by the State Bank of Pakistan that refuted the $4.9 bn remittances number on September 21,2016.\n\nSo, where did this news report originate from? Journalists from Pakistan have pointed out on Twitter that the NAB now claims that the incorrect information first came up in an Urdu newspaper Daily Ausaf.\n\nThe NAB has come under heavy fire for ordering a probe without doing its own checks and relying on a single media report. According to Dawn, Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi strongly criticised the NAB for launching the probe and asked the National Assembly to constitute a committee which would summon the NAB Chairman Justice Javed Iqbal and investigate the allegations.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Pakistan had disqualified Sharif last year, forcing him to resign from the country's top post. This was following the release of the Panama papers in April 2016 that revealed three of his children owned offshore companies and assets not shown on his family's wealth statement. Mr Sharif has dismissed the corruption charges as politically motivated.\n\nThe indictment by the country's top court has put the most powerful political family and their future in a lot of trouble. If convicted, Sharif could face jail time.", "lang": "en"}
