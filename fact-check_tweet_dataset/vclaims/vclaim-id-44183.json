See you in New Mexico!\u201d\n\nGriffin\u2019s comments were originally made on May 17, 2020, during an event in Truth or Consequences, a city in New Mexico. He equivocated by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t say that in the physical sense,\u201d although the local newspaper, the Alamogordo Daily News, pointed out that \u201chis prior statements received cheers from the crowd before the clarification.\u201d\n\nThe retweet by Trump drew criticism that Trump and Griffin were promoting violence against legislators who are members of the opposing political party. Griffin\u2019s comments, in their entirety and as heard in the video tweeted by Trump, are:\n\nI\u2019ve come to a place where I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the only good Democrat is a dead Democrat. I don\u2019t say that in the physical sense and I can already see the videos getting edited where it says I wanna go murder Democrats. No, I say that in the political sense because the Democrat agenda and policy is anti-American right now. It\u2019s where our country\u2019s not coming to a place if you love or hate Donald Trump, our country\u2019s coming to a place if you love or hate America. Because that\u2019s what it\u2019s boiling down to. But um, but as far as Democrats go you had some great conservative candidates. We need to have, I say the reason why the only good Democrat\u2019s a dead Democrat, I\u2019m saying it politically speaking and I\u2019m saying it because we need to have the majorities in the House and the Senate. It\u2019s the only way that we\u2019re gonna put the brakes on a out-of-control governor. Sometimes you have to hit very rock bottom in order to make real change. It can happen in our own personal lives. It happens in community but it\u2019s also happening in government right now. I believe our government is showing the very worst than they have, and I believe that it\u2019s gonna bring about the very best that our country has politically speaking.\n\nCowboys for Trump is marketed as a for-profit organization in New Mexico that accepts donations from the public. The tweet that Trump retweeted was originally posted by the organization to refute a Daily Beast article that reported Griffin had called for Democratic politicians to die.\n\nIn spite of Cowboys for Trump labeling the Daily Beast article titled \u201cAnti-Lockdown Protesters Now Calling for Dems to Die\u201d as fake news, Griffin is quoted in that article saying that certain Democratic governors should be executed for what he views as treason, stating, \u201cYou get to pick your poison: you either go before a firing squad, or you get the end of the rope.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether protesters angry over stay-at-home orders meant to slow the spread of COVID-19 were considering using violence, Griffin said in the article, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, partner, as far as I\u2019m concerned, there\u2019s not an option that\u2019s not on the table.\u201d\n\nWe rate the claim that Trump retweeted a video stating that \u201cthe only good Democrat is a dead Democrat\u201d as \u201cTrue,\u201d because equivocation or not, those were the exact words of Griffin as recorded in the video posted in the tweet, which the president retweeted.", "lang": "en"}
