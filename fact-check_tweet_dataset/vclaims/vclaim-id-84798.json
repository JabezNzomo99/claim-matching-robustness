I was not at all. In fact, frankly, he\u2019s complaining about the fact that we\u2019re losing some of the most talented people. They go to Harvard. They go to Yale. They go to Princeton. They come from another country, and they\u2019re immediately sent out. I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cI\u2019m in favor of people coming into this country legally. And you know what? They can have it any way you want. You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want. \u2026 As far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, it\u2019s fine. They have to come into this country legally. We have a country of borders. We have a country of laws. We have to obey the laws. It\u2019s fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cI\u2019m changing. I\u2019m changing. We need highly skilled people in this country, and if we can\u2019t do it, we\u2019ll get them in. But, and we do need in Silicon Valley, we absolutely have to have. So, we do need highly skilled, and one of the biggest problems we have is people go to the best colleges. They\u2019ll go to Harvard, they\u2019ll go to Stanford, they\u2019ll go to Wharton, as soon as they\u2019re finished they\u2019ll get shoved out. They want to stay in this country. They want to stay here desperately, they\u2019re not able to stay here. For that purpose, we absolutely have to be able to keep the brain power in this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know the H-1B. I know the H2B. Nobody knows it better than me. I\u2019m a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We\u2019re allowed to do it. \u2026 I will take advantage of it; they\u2019re the laws. But I\u2019m the one that knows how to change it. Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know the H-1B very well. And it\u2019s something that I, frankly, use, and I shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use it. We shouldn\u2019t have it. Very, very bad for workers. And second of all, I think it\u2019s very important to say, well, I\u2019m a businessman and I have to do what I have to do. When it\u2019s sitting there waiting for you, but it\u2019s very bad. It\u2019s very bad for business in terms of \u2014 and it\u2019s very bad for our workers and it\u2019s unfair for our workers. And we should end it.\u201d\n\nTrump is speaking out of both sides of his mouth. He has used the H-1B program as an employer, and supports bringing talented, educated workers into the country. But he also wants to end the H-1B program because he believes it\u2019s full of abuse. He proposes restricting the program so that the industry that most relies on it \u2014\u2013 the tech industry \u2014 can\u2019t use it to shut Americans out from jobs in Silicon Valley. Yet he says he supports Silicon Valley taking measures to retain talented and educated foreign workers.", "lang": "en"}
