The post was shared after Boris Johnson\u2019s televised address on Sunday 10 May.\n\n\u201cIt doesn't matter what Boris Johnson has just said, it DOES NOT apply to you in Wales. You CANNOT sit in the park on a bench , you CANNOT drive to your place of exercise. WALES stays the same as before for another 3 weeks. You must exercise near your home more than once a day if you so wish ONLY with members of your household. You must stay home unless absolutely necessary. Wales regulations are not permitting you to jump in your car to visit places other than shopping for essentials, helping someone who is shielding, or to work.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s correct that Boris Johnson\u2019s statement on easing lockdown applied to England only, and the Facebook post\u2019s claims about what is allowed in Wales are partly correct at the time of writing.\n\nThe Welsh guidance currently says: \u201cGoing for a walk and also stopping to have something to eat or sit in a park, for example, is intended to be permitted. Most of the time away from home should, however, be spent exercising.\u201d\n\nWhen the Facebook post was first shared, on Sunday 10 May, the guidance for Wales was slightly different and said: \u201cGoing for a walk and then having a picnic or spending a prolonged period on a park bench, for example, is not considered to be exercise and is not intended to be a reasonable excuse.\u201d\n\nThe Welsh government has said that the lockdown in Wales will be extended for another three weeks with \u201cminor adjustments\u201d. These changes were that people could exercise more than once a day and that certain garden centres would be allowed to open.\n\nAnd it\u2019s true that in Wales exercise must still start and end at home, so you cannot drive to a location to exercise, though there are exceptions for some people for whom this isn\u2019t possible. On 8 May, the Welsh government announced that from Monday 11 May, people would be allowed to exercise more than once a day, but that \u201cexercise should start and end at home and not involve going a significant distance from home.\u201d This has not changed since lockdown in Wales began.\n\nAlso, the post claims that in Wales you can exercise only with members of your household. This is correct. \n\n\n\nBy comparison, in England, Boris Johnson has said that from Wednesday 13 May, people may \u201csit in the sun in your local park\u201d and \u201cdrive to other destinations\u201d. Further guidance published the day after his televised address said you can \u201csit and rest outside\u201d and \u201cdrive to outdoor publicly accessible open spaces irrespective of distance\u201d. It adds that the public should check whether these places are open before they travel.\n\nThe guidance also clarified that you can also exercise or spend time outside with one person who is not in your household, as long as you stay two metres apart at all times.\n\nFor England, from Wednesday 13 May, people may take unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise, with members of their household.\n\nThe post also says: \u201cWales regulations are not permitting you to jump in your car to visit places other than shopping for essentials, helping someone who is shielding, or to work.\u201d\n\nThis is basically correct. The law in Wales, as in England, says you should not leave your home without a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d. Shopping for essentials, helping the vulnerable and travelling to work are among the reasonable excuses listed, though there are other reasons given such as escaping the risk of harm. There\u2019s nothing that says you can\u2019t use a car to do these things.\n\nThe Welsh government has specified that garden centres will be allowed to open from Monday 11 May, if they have social distancing measures in place, so you will presumably be allowed to drive to these as a customer if they are open.\n\nIn England, from 13 May, the government says \u201cDay trips to outdoor open space, in a private vehicle, are permitted\u201d. It also adds you shouldn\u2019t use a car with anyone who is not a member of your household.\n\nThe UK government can only change lockdown regulations in England\n\nThe Institute for Government says: \u201cthe UK government can only change the \u2018lockdown\u2019 regulations in England.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe respective devolved governments are responsible for making any changes to the rules on social distancing in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (for example, to allow for exercise more than once a day).\u201d", "lang": "en"}
