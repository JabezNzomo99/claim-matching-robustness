One recent attack focuses on both men.\n\n\"I bet you didn\u2019t know Dr. Fauci sat on Microsoft\u2019s board of directors \u2014 and that Bill Gates \u2014 was his boss\u2026\" a Facebook post says.\n\nIt was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThat\u2019s because Fauci is not on Microsoft\u2019s 12-member board of directors, and according to Microsoft, he never has been.\n\nWe reviewed the company\u2019s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission going back to 1994 and Fauci is not mentioned.\n\nSearching for Fauci\u2019s name on Microsoft\u2019s website, we found citations of his work on Microsoft Academic, where people can search for scientific journal articles, but nothing connecting him to Microsoft\u2019s board. We also didn\u2019t find news coverage suggesting he served on Microsoft\u2019s board when we searched Nexis news archives for articles about Fauci, the company and its board.\n\nScouring the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation website for Fauci\u2019s name, we found a 2010 press release about \"a collaboration to increase coordination across the international vaccine community and create a Global Vaccine Action Plan.\" Fauci was among five people named to the Decade of Vaccines Collaboration leadership council, which was formed to oversee the collaboration\u2019s planning efforts, according to the press release.\n\nA 2003 Gates Foundation press release about a partnership with the National Institutes of Health said Fauci, among other scientists, was named to a scientific board to \"guide and direct\" an initiative to \"identify critical scientific challenges in global health and increase research on diseases that cause millions of deaths in the developing world.\"\n\nBut we found nothing to corroborate what this Facebook post says, and Microsoft denies the claim.", "lang": "en"}
