Truman signed a bill proclaiming a National Day of Prayer (\u201con which the people of the United States may turn to God in prayer and meditation at churches, in groups, and as individuals\u201d). This bill did not establish a specific calendar date for the event, but left it up to each president to designate a date of his choosing. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan fixed the date of the National Day of Prayer as the first Thursday of May.\n\nIn 2009 (and every year since), rumors were circulated claiming that President Barack Obama had \u201ccanceled\u201d that year\u2019s National Day of Prayer:\n\nPresident Obama has decided that there will no longer be a \u201cNational Day of Prayer\u201d held in May. He doesn\u2019t want to offend anyone. Where was his concern about offending Christians last January when he allowed the Muslims to hold a day of prayer on the capitol grounds. As an American Christian \u201cI am offended.\u201d if you agree, copy and paste no matter what religion you are. This country was built on freedom! If he gets re-elected \u201cit\u2019s all over but the crying\u201d When we get 100,000,000, that\u2019s one hundred million willing Christians to BOND together, voice their concerns and vote, we can take back America with God\u2019s help. Please become one of the One hundred million, then lets get 200 million. It can be done by sending this email to your friends. Do the math. It only takes a willing heart and a fed up soul. God Bless America and Shine your light on Her.. In 1952 President Truman established one day a year as a \u201cNational Day of Prayer.\u201d In 1988 President Reagan designated the First Thursday in May of each year as the National Day of Prayer. In June 2007 (then) Presidential Candidate Barack Obama declared that the USA \u201cWas no longer a Christian nation.\u201d This year President Obama canceled the 21st annual National Day of Prayer ceremony at the White House under the ruse of \u201cnot wanting to offend anyone\u201d BUT\u2026 on September 25, 2009 from 4 AM until 7 PM, a National Day of Prayer FOR THE MUSLIM RELIGION was Held on Capitol Hill Beside the White House. There were over 50,000 Muslims in D.C. that day. HE PRAYED ALL DAY WITH THE MUSLIMS It Didn\u2019t matter if \u201cwe Christians\u201d Were offended by this event \u2013 He really do not hold us as a nation of Christians! The direction this country is headed should strike fear in the heart of every Christian, especiall knowing that the He and the Muslim religion believes that if Christians cannot be converted, they should be annihilated. This is not a rumor.\n\nThese claims were false and were based on a misunderstanding of the nature of the National Day of Prayer and the role of the President of the United States in its observation.\n\nNo official ceremony (presidential or otherwise) is prescribed for the observance of the National Day of Prayer: it is a day on which the people of the U.S. are called upon \u201cto turn to God in prayer and meditation,\u201d however they choose to do so. President Obama opted to issue the traditional proclamation designating the National Day of Prayer in 2009 (as he did again in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016) while observing the occasion privately:\n\nOther observances of the National Day of Prayer in the nation\u2019s capital have continued throughout President Obama\u2019s administration, with the 2015 and 2016 events streamed live online from the Cannon House Office Building on Capitol Hill.\n\nAlthough it is true that President Obama chose not to host an ecumenical service in the East Room of the White House in observance of the National Day of Prayer as his predecessor, President George W. Bush, did each year throughout his tenure in office, that service was a personal preference of President Bush; it was neither an official ceremony prescribed by the bill that established the National Day of Prayer nor a long-standing presidential tradition.\n\nIn fact, George W. Bush was the president who ever regularly organized White House events in observance that day: President Ronald Reagan hosted only one throughout his eight years in office (a 1982 Rose Garden event), President George H.W. Bush also hosted only one during his four years in office (a 1989 State Dining Room breakfast), and President Bill Clinton hosted none at all in the course of his eight-year presidency. Claims that President Obama has \u201ccancelled\u201d the National Day of Prayer because he opted not to hold a public prayer ceremony in observance of the occasion are therefore akin to asserting that Independence Day was \u201ccanceled\u201d if a president chose not to attend a fireworks show on the 4th of July.\n\nThe status of the National Day of Prayer became uncertain on 15 April 2010 when a federal judge ruled in favor of a challenge brought by the Freedom from Religion Foundation and held that the National Day of Prayer was unconstitutional. The Obama administration was actually the defendant in that suit, arguing in favor of retaining the National Day of Prayer:\n\nThe Obama administration appealed the ruling, and in April 2011 it was overturned by a three-judge panel of the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago, who decreed that the Freedom from Religion Foundation and its plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the National Day of Prayer.\n\nA December 2009 version of this item offered a photograph purportedly documenting President Obama\u2019s participation in an \u201cIslamic Prayer Day\u201d observance at the White House:\n\nThis photograph does not show President Obama instead observing \u201cIslamic Prayer Day\u201d or engaging in a \u201cmosque prayer session\u201d at the White House. This picture of the president was taken at Istanbul\u2019s Blue Mosque (where protocol dictates that visitors remove their shoes before entering), the national mosque of Turkey, during the chief executive\u2019s two-day state visit to that country in April 2009. (Another photograph of the president removing his shoes can be seen here, and video of President Obama at the Blue Mosque can be viewed here.)\n\nAlso, no national \u201cIslamic Prayer Day\u201d is acknowledged or observed by the White House: someone has confused the independently organized prayer service held by Muslims on Capitol Hill in September 2009 with an officially designated Islamic prayer day.\n\nA March 2012 version of this item included the claims that \u201cObama says we are no longer a Christian nation\u201d and \u201cMuslims celebrate a day of prayer at the Capitol,\u201d both of which are inaccurate. During a keynote address to a \u201cCall to Renewal\u201d conference on 28 June 2006, what Barack Obama (then a senator from Illinois) said in context was, \u201cWe are no longer a Christian nation\u201d:\n\nAlso, as noted above, no national \u201cIslamic Prayer Day\u201d is acknowledged or observed by the White House: someone confused the independently organized prayer service held by Muslims on Capitol Hill in September 2009 (which President Obama did not attend) with an officially designated Islamic prayer day. Contrary to the e-mail which trumpets \u201cHE PRAYED ALL DAY WITH THE MUSLIMS,\u201d President Obama spent the day in Pittsburgh attending G-20 meetings.", "lang": "en"}
