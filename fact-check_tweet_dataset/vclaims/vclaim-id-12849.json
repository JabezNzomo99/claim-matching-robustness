He also said that McCaskill called Kislyak, rather than the other way around. \u201cShe did attend a group meeting about adoptions with other senators and had a brief, proactive call with the ambassador amid calls to several other parties to the Iran nuclear deal,\u201d Lombard said.\n\nBy contrast, LaBombard said, \u201cAttorney General Sessions met one-on-one with the Russian ambassador in the midst of a Russian cyber campaign against the U.S., and then misled the Judiciary Committee under oath about that meeting. He then tried to excuse it by saying it was part of the normal course of his Armed Services Committee work.\u201d\n\nOne of Session\u2019s interactions with the ambassador was as part of a group \u2014 in July, at the Republican National Convention, after Sessions gave a speech at an event for about 50 ambassadors sponsored by the Heritage Foundation. Sessions then spoke individually to some of the ambassadors, including Kislyak.\n\nThe second Sessions meeting is more sensitive, but details are not clear. It took place in his Senate office, on Sept. 8, but it\u2019s unknown whether aides were present. It is also not known if Kislyak or Sessions initiated the meeting. A spokeswoman for Sessions characterized it as a meeting done as part of Sessions\u2019s work on the Senate Armed Services Committee, not as a Trump campaign surrogate. She said that Sessions had more than 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors in 2016.\n\nIn a statement issued Wednesday night, Sessions said that he \u201cnever met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.\u201d\n\nMcCaskill went too far to suggest that she had never met or had a phone call with the Russian ambassador in the last 10 years, especially given that she had tweeted about such interactions in the past. Certainly the circumstances of the Sessions-Kislyak meeting in September raise questions \u2014 as do his answers under oath during his confirmation hearing \u2014 but McCaskill undercuts her outrage by making such misleading statements.\n\nIf the full explanation doesn\u2019t fit in 140 characters, sometimes it\u2019s best not to tweet. McCaskill should delete or revise her tweet to set the record straight.", "lang": "en"}
