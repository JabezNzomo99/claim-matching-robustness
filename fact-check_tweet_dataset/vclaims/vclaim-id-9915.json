No, that's not true: the professor and his theory are not real, they evolved from the mind of a satire writer who made the whole thing up.\n\nThe theory and the professor appeared in an article published on April 4, 2018 on World News Daily Report titled \"Panel of Saudi scientists conclude that Europeans 'evolved from pigs'\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nJeddah | A panel of top scientists of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has concluded that people of Caucasoid origin are directly evolved from a common pig ancestor. It had been previously accepted in Saudi scientific literature that people of Negroid origin came from a common ape-like ancestor, yet the origins of the Caucasoid race remained a mystery to this day. \"The mystery of the Caucasoid race, with its protuberant nose, pink skin, and immoral sexual behavior can now be explained by science\" explained Professor of Biology, Abdul Al-Numair. Professor Abdul Al-Numair's suggested that pigs and Caucasians may actually share a hidden evolutionary relationship. \"The sexual depravity of pigs could also explain the Caucasoid people's indulgence with homosexuality and its estrangement from the one true God,\" he added.\n\nThe picture used with the story indeed seems to be taken at a conference in Saudi Arabia: the Saudi Science and Creativity Festival. But that's about the only part of the story that is remotely connected to reality.\n\nAccording to science's most recent understanding all humans (not just Caucasians) shared a common ancestor with pigs about 95 million years ago when the paths of the species diverged.\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories.
