The FBI declined to recommend prosecution in Clinton\u2019s case.\n\nComey concluded that Clinton was wrong when she repeatedly said that classified emails didn't end up on her personal system and he characterized her handling of very sensitive information as \"extremely careless.\"\n\nTrump told the crowd at a July 11 campaign rally in Virginia Beach, Va., that Clinton's conduct as \"willful, intentional, and unlawful.\"\n\n\"Just look at what the FBI director said about her \u2014 her misconduct is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country,\" Trump said.\n\nComey was tough on Clinton, saying at one point that any reasonable person in Clinton's position \"should have known that an unclassified system was no place\" for some of the conversations she was having. But we didn't recall him saying her conduct was \"a disgrace\" or an \"embarrassment.\" So we decided to check it out.\n\nThe Trump campaign doesn't regularly respond to PolitiFact's requests for information. But in this case, the Trump campaign posted the speech (as prepared but without his extemporaneous remarks) with annotations.\n\nThe speech transcript specifically indicates, via the dash, that Trump was explaining the remarks of the FBI director, not just giving his own opinion. Trump's delivery on video makes it sound that way, too, and that's what caught our attention.\n\nThe campaign said that the source for the \"disgrace and embarrassment\" line came from the Washington Post's transcript of Comey's July 5 news conference.\n\nWe checked. Neither the words \"disgrace\" nor \"embarrassment\" are contained in the transcript.\n\nWe wondered if Comey might have used the words during the hours he spent before the House committee two days later. He did not.\n\nWe read his public comments again, looking for words that mean the same thing as a disgrace or an embarrassment. We didn\u2019t find them. Instead, Comey used words that focused on her conduct as showing a lack of attention.\n\n\"I think she was extremely careless. I think she was negligent. That, I could establish. What we can't establish is that she acted with the necessary criminal intent,\" was about as harsh as Comey got.\n\nHe declined to say whether Clinton lied to the public. He did suggest that Clinton may have been less sophisticated about email than most people assumed. \"She didn't have a computer in her office at the State Department, for example,\" Comey said.\n\nWe wondered if anybody used the words \"disgrace\" or \"embarrassment\" during the hearing. They did not.\n\nTrump said, \"Just look at what the FBI director said about her (Hillary Clinton) \u2014 her misconduct is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign indicated Comey said it during his news conference. He didn't. He said her actions were careless, but he didn\u2019t call them a disgrace or an embarrassment or the equivalent.\n\nIt's possible that Trump was trying to convey two different thoughts, urging people to look up the FBI director's comments and the \"disgrace and embarrassment\" comment was supposed to be his own characterization.\n\nBut that's not how it comes across, both when spoken and in the transcript.\n\nWith that in mind, we rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
