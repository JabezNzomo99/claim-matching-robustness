Officials say the permits were requested in late February. \n\n\n\nApplication for \u2018March For Our Lives\u2019 permit was made months before Parkland school shooting\n\nA number of viral stories are claiming that the March for Our Lives demonstration held March 24 on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., was \u201cseveral months\u201d in the making \u2014 a timeline that, if true, would raise questions about how the event came to be.\n\nThe march was announced by a group of student-survivors days after the deadly high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14. Similar marches were planned nationwide, in part with the coordination of groups such as Everytown for Gun Safety and Giffords Courage. Celebrities donated to the event and showed up to protest.\n\nSeveral readers asked us about some of the false stories, which say the application for a permit to demonstrate had been filed months earlier. Facebook users also flagged as potentially false nearly two dozen stories with headlines stating as much.\n\nThe claims, which first appeared March 30 on the website fellowshipoftheminds.com, are evidently rooted in a miscommunication.\n\nThe stories center on a March 28 email from Officer Scott Earhardt of Washington, D.C.\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department to an individual whose name is redacted. In the email, Earhardt responds to an inquiry regarding the march and states: \u201cMPD received a permit application several months prior to the actual event, and there was several months of planning for this large event.\u201d\n\nBut a Police Department spokeswoman told us that isn\u2019t the case.\n\n\u201cMPD received a permit application for the March for Our Lives rally on Wednesday, February 21, 2018; which is several weeks prior to the March 24th event, not several months,\u201d Karimah Bilal, a public affairs specialist with the department, said in an email.\n\nResponding to our questions about the email\u2019s authenticity, Bilal said that \u201cto my knowledge the email Officer Scott Earhardt responded to is authentic; however, he used incorrect jargon to describe the permit application timeline.\u201d\n\nWe submitted a Freedom of Information Act request for the permit on file with the Police Department, but haven\u2019t received it yet.\n\nReached by phone, Earhardt declined to comment and referred our questions to the department\u2019s communications office. He reportedly told PolitiFact this week that he had mixed up the rally with the annual March for Life rally (held in January) \u2014 and that the March for Our Lives permit was issued March 13. (Bilal, however, told us the permit was issued March 7.)\n\nThe Feb. 21 application date cited by Bilal would coincide with the timing of an initial application for a permit for March for Our Lives that was submitted to the National Park Service. That application was filed Feb. 20, when the event was planned for the National Mall. The location was changed because another permit had been granted for the Mall that day.\n\nThe application for the march was filed by Deena Katz, a co-executive producer of \u201cDancing with the Stars.\u201d BuzzFeed confirmed at the time that Katz, who also served as a co-executive director of the Women\u2019s March Los Angeles organization, was helping to organize the march.\n\nThough the National Mall wasn\u2019t available, the National Park Service worked with organizers to find a different location, a spokesman confirmed in an email to us.\n\n\u201cThe National Park Service identified multiple alternate locations for the March For Our Lives and on February 28 the organizers amended their permit application for the event to take place on Pennsylvania Avenue, between 3rd Street and 12th Street,\u201d Mike Litterst said.\n\n\u201cThe National Park Service and the Metropolitan Police Department issued separate permits for the demonstration for affected properties under our jurisdiction to ensure the safety of march participants, visitors, and city residents, as well as the protection of park and city resources.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cApplication for \u2018March For Our Lives\u2019 permit was made months before Parkland school shooting.\u201d fellowshipofthemind.com. 30 Mar 2018.\n\nBilal, Karimah.
