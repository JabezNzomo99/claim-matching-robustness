The photos have been shared in a misleading context; authorities said preliminary post-mortems showed the elephants were poisoned and experts noted it was the result of the intensifying human-elephant conflict in the country.\n\nThe photos were published in this Facebook post on September 29, 2019.\n\nThe post was shared in a group with more than 170,000 followers. It has been shared more than 1,500 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe Sinhala-language text superimposed on the post\u2019s image translates to English as:\n\n\u201cIn order to fulfill a vow due to being granted presidential candidacy, Sajith has killed seven nursing female elephants in the middle of the Habarana forest.\n\nBy September 28, 2019, a total of seven carcasses of male and female elephants had been found in Habarana, a small city located in north-central Sri Lanka. Here is an AFP report about the incident.\n\nThe misleading Facebook post blames ruling United National Party (UNP) politician Sajith Premadasa, a presidential candidate, for the deaths.\n\nThe lengthy Sinhala caption that accompanies the misleading post is titled: \u201cHow the vow was fulfilled to obtain UNP candidacy\u201d.\n\nThe Sinhala caption alleges Sajith was instructed by a South Indian occultist to make a vow to kill seven female elephants within a day, if he was chosen as the ruling party candidate. The caption goes on to claim the elephant carcasses reveal how Sajith fulfilled his vow upon being selected as the UNP presidential candidate.\n\nThe same photos were shared on Facebook here and here with a similar claim.\n\nThe photos in the post are being shared in a misleading context; authorities and local elephant conservationists told AFP preliminary investigations indicated the elephants were poisoned by local farmers after the animals damaged their crops.\n\nVeteran elephant conservationist and member of the IUCN Asian Elephant Specialist Group, Jayantha Jayawardena, told AFP by phone on October 2, 2019, that the elephants were likely poisoned by local farmers.\n\n\u201cIt appears the elephants may have consumed locally grown pumpkins and ash gourd that were poisoned with folidol. It was possibly an act of one or more angry farmers as they may have been experiencing a loss of crops for the past few months,\u201d he said.\n\nFolidol is an insecticide and is used by hunters and farmers to produce \u201chakka patas\u201d, a locally made explosive trap where the folidol is mixed with gunpowder and inserted into vegetables targeting animals.\n\nJayantha also told AFP the human-elephant conflict in the country has intensified over the past few years, as human settlements have moved within the range of elephant corridors, resulting in the deaths of more than 200 elephants and about 50 humans annually.\n\n\u201cSri Lankan elephants migrate internally, moving along elephant corridors depending on the availability of food and water. When villages and settlements encroach on these territories, elephant migration results in damages to crops,\u201d Jayantha said.\n\nJayantha also completely dismissed the false claims made in the Facebook posts, noting \u201cit's not an easy task\u201d to kill seven elephants, as it is next to impossible for a human to get close enough to a wild elephant to physically harm it.\n\nDirector General of the Department of Wildlife Conservation, Chandana Sooriyabandara, told AFP on October 4, 2019, that investigators believe the elephants were poisoned.\n\n\u201cWe suspect it's poisoning due to certain indications observed during on-site inspections, such as internal hemorrhaging. However, to probe further, samples of the bodies have been sent to the Government Analyst's Department, the Veterinary Research Institute of Sri Lanka and the Veterinary Faculty for further analysis,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nChandana added they are expecting the results of the body sample analysis within the next few weeks, which he said should help apprehend the culprits.\n\n\u201cDue to increasing conflicts between villagers and elephants, various tactics have been deployed by villagers to keep the wild elephants at bay, which have at times resulted in their deaths. However, this is the first time we discovered the animals poisoned,\u201d he added.\n\nElephant conservationist and chairman of the Species Conservation Centre, Pubudu Weerarathna, told AFP by phone on September 30, 2019, that on-site post-mortems revealed poisoning to be the cause of the elephant deaths.\n\n\u201cThe on-site post-mortems have revealed the deaths were likely caused by poisoning,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nA similar false allegation was levelled against Sajith\u2019s rival candidate, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the presidential candidate of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, in this Facebook post.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Facebook post:\n\nThe Sinhala text superimposed on the post\u2019s image translates to English as:\n\n\u201cAs told by occultists, in order to regain state power, Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the gang have killed female elephants. It is told this operation was carried out in secret and had deployed a group of extremely trustworthy individuals.\u201d\n\nSimilar allegations against Gotabaya were published in this article in Sinhala, titled \u201cSince Gota doesn\u2019t have a Raja yoga, seven female tuskers killed to make an offering of seven tusks\u201d, on local news website SLStory.com.\n\nRaja yoga in astrology denotes the formation of planets in a way that brings an individual the success and fortune of a king.\n\nSri Lanka has sought to introduce tougher penalties in a bid to protect wild elephants following the deaths of the seven elephants. Here is an AFP report about the developments.", "lang": "en"}
