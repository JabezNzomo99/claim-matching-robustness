As per the release, the vaccine will be introduced as Measles-Rubella campaign, targeting children from 9 months to below 15 years, in a phased manner over a period of two to three years. This will be followed by the provision of MR vaccine in routine immunization, replacing the currently given measles vaccine, at 9-12 months and 16-24 months of age. This wide age range campaign, as recommended by NTAGI, will rapidly build up immunity for both measles and rubella and reduce measles and rubella transmission in the community.\n\nMR-VAC (Measles-Rubella Vaccine) is highly safe and well-tolerated as per doctors. This vaccine does not cause infertility as claimed in the viral post.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right. If you have a doubt on any news that could impact you, society or the nation, let us know.
