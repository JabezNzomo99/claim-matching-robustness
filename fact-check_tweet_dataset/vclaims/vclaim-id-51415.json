For example, to find the mean height of a group of people, you would add up all their heights and divide by the number of people.\n\nBut sometimes the mean isn\u2019t a suitable measure of the typical or the average. In particular it\u2019s not suitable when you have either a very wide range or a very skewed distribution of data.\n\nFor example, in the UK we often talk about income using a median figure. The median is the middle value of a list. For example the median of the incomes \u00a315,000, \u00a320,000, \u00a325,000, \u00a330,000 and \u00a31 million would be \u00a325,000.\n\nThe median is better than the mean as an average of income, because while the mean would be skewed by outlier results (like the \u00a31 million in the example above) and so wouldn\u2019t really represent a typical income, the median limits the impact of particularly high or low numbers.\n\nIn the case of this survey on the Covid-19 death rate, people were asked: \u201cWhich percentage of the population in Great Britain do you think have died from coronavirus?\u201d\n\nWhile most people said that fewer than 2% of the population had died, the few people who answered with high figures skewed the mean upwards.\n\nSo, to take Guido Fawkes\u2019s article, 7% doesn\u2019t really represent what the average Brit thinks the coronavirus death rate has been.\n\nAfter discounting people who said they didn\u2019t know what the Covid-19 death rate had been, 71% of people thought the death rate was lower than \u201c6-10%\u201d and 29% thought it was \u201c6-10%\u201d or higher.\n\nThe median average answer was around a 1% death rate (we can\u2019t say what the exact median answer was without the raw data which we have asked Kekst CNC for). Almost half of respondents who estimated a death rate said it was around 1%.\n\nWhile there are undoubtedly some people who are significantly overestimating the Covid-19 death rate, a mean average gives them more voice than people who gave more realistic answers.\n\nThe data was also broken down for each of the three nations in Great Britain. The median average for Scotland was also around 1%, far from the mean average of 10% that was reported (though only 93 Scots were surveyed, and with such a small sample size this is only a very rough guide as to the Scottish public\u2019s perception).\n\nAt the time of the survey around 44,000 in Great Britain had died after testing positive for Covid-19, with the vast majority of these deaths having been caused by the disease.\n\nThe true death toll may be higher still, given the potential for some Covid-19 deaths to have not been categorised as such.\n\nThat means about 0.1% of the population of Great Britain has died from Covid-19, rounding to one decimal place.\n\nSo the median average of people thinking the death rate is about 1% is still likely an overestimate, but to a lesser extent than the mean average.", "lang": "en"}
