But that\u2019s exactly what happened to former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on the presidential campaign trail, according to one quote meme:\n\nIn this case the meme is accurate. While speaking at a town hall event in Des Moines, Iowa, hosted by the Asian & Latino Coalition on Aug. 8, 2019, Biden let slip with a statement that \u201cpoor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids,\u201d thereby implying that economically disadvantaged persons are all non-white.\n\nThe unfortunate remark by Biden was reported on by The New York Times and captured on video:\n\nFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. raised eyebrows during a speech in Iowa when he said that \u201cpoor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids,\u201d an apparent gaffe for a Democratic presidential candidate whose record on race has come under intense scrutiny during the primary. Mr. Biden was speaking on education and the need to challenge students at a town hall hosted by the Asian & Latino Coalition in Des Moines when he made the remark, and then quickly sought to recover from it. \u201cWe should challenge students in these schools,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cWe have this notion that somehow if you\u2019re poor, you cannot do it. Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.\u201d He paused, then added: \u201cWealthy kids, black kids, Asian kids \u2014 no I really mean it, but think how we think about it.\u201d\n\nKate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, later issued a statement asserting that the candidate \u201cmisspoke\u201d:\n\n\u201cVice President Biden misspoke and immediately corrected himself during a refrain he often uses to make the point that all children deserve a fair shot, and children born into lower-income circumstances are just as smart as those born to wealthy parents,\u201d Ms. Bedingfield said. \u201cJoe Biden has spent his life fighting for civil rights and the dignity of all people.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
