It was flagged as possibly providing false information, as part of Facebook\u2019s effort to combat fake news.\n\nA website called NRTONLINE posted an article on April 14, 2018, headlined, \"BREAKING: British Intelligence Seizes Clinton Foundation Warehouse, $400 Million In Cash.\" Here are the opening paragraphs:\n\nThe Clinton Foundation is once again trying to distance itself from a scandal surrounding something they\u2019re involved in. This time, the warehouse they use in the UK to store food and toiletries to make ready for shipping to Africa and Indonesia was raided by MI6.\n\nThe warehouse, which is leased by the Foundation and one other tenant, is owned by a man known for shady arms deals and exploiting cheap Asian labor for counterfeit goods. The Brits took down his office and storage space, finding 400 Million in US Dollars. Maleek Bin Shalakta has been on the UK terrorist watch list for some time.\n\nThe problem: None of this ever happened.\n\nThe article was lifted wholesale from the website Reagan Was Right, which -- before the site was taken down earlier this year -- described itself as a \"whimsical playland of conservative satire.\" Another disclaimer read: \"Everything on this website is fiction.\"\n\nYou can\u2019t find the Reagan Was Right article on its original web page any more, but a version of the article dated Nov. 10, 2017, is available on the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine.\n\nReagan Was Right was affiliated with Christopher Blair, a Maine man we\u2019ve written about previously. Blair told us his websites are a carefully curated social experiment designed to \"feed the Hoverounders their daily need for hate and their undying urge to blame everything in the known universe on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.\"\n\nAmong the dubious elements of both the original Reagan Was Right article and the NRTONLINE facsimile is a reference to the nonexistent country of Latkavia, as well as a stray reference to a correspondent for \"LLOD.\" The article doesn\u2019t explain the acronym, but fake news cognoscenti will recognize it as one of Blair\u2019s other fake (and now shuttered) sites, the Last Line of Defense.\n\nMeanwhile, the photograph that accompanies the post was published in June 2017 by the Sun newspaper in the United Kingdom to illustrate an entirely different article -- one about police evicting a group of trailer-home residents who had seized a warehouse for 24 hours.\n\nAs for the publisher of the most recent version, NRTONLINE, a quick click into the site\u2019s \"About Us\" page shows not an explanation of the site\u2019s background but rather an un-filled-in web page template. So, unlike the Reagan Was Right version, NRTONLINE offered no indication that this article was \"satire.\"\n\nThe Clinton Foundation confirmed to PolitiFact that the article is \"totally false.\"\n\n\"We don\u2019t rent a warehouse in the U.K., the quote from \u2018Chelsea Clinton\u2019s assistant\u2019 is made up, and nothing in this story seems to be based in reality,\" spokesman Brian Cookstra told PolitiFact.\n\nFake Clinton Foundation raids are a staple of dubious web posts. For instance, in May 2017, some of our fellow fact-checkers debunked an Internet claim that a Clinton Foundation cargo ship had been caught smuggling people from Syria, drugs and illegal fruit.\n\nThe source of that claim? The Last Line of Defense.\n\nSocial media posts linked to an article headlined, \"British Intelligence Seizes Clinton Foundation Warehouse, $400 Million In Cash.\" But that never happened -- the tall tale originated with a self-described satirical post.
