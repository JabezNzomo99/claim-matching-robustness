I\u2019m the only candidate running, in either party, who will tell you my goal, my pledge, is to raise incomes, not taxes, on the middle-class. And that\u2019s what I think we should be doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI also think it\u2019s imperative that we fix the tax system so it no longer favors the rich and the corporate interests in America. So I\u2019ve outlined a bunch of ways to close those loopholes, get rid of those deductions and also do more to help middle-class families. I\u2019m the only candidate in this race on either side who has said my goal is to raise your incomes, not your taxes, and that is a pledge.\u201d\n\nThere are few facts more interesting than a brand new talking point. This line emerged this week from the Clinton campaign, and the former secretary of state repeated it since then to many audiences.\n\nBut a talking point has to makes sense in order to be effective. Clinton is trying to seize the anti-tax mantle from both her primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and from Republicans. But just about every Republican has signed an anti-tax pledge. What\u2019s she getting at?\n\nAs we said, just about every Republican running for president has signed the famous pledge promoted by Americans for Tax Reform that promises to \u201coppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal tax rates for individuals and/or businesses.\u201d A signer of the pledge also refuses to opposes any reduction in deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by lower tax rates.\n\n\u201cWhile Hillary Clinton has repeatedly made it clear that she views raising incomes for hardworking families as the defining economic challenge of our time, no Republican has offered a real plan to raise incomes for middle class families beyond the same failed trickle down economics proposals that have been proven ineffective,\u201d Schwerin said. \u201cUnlike the Republicans, Clinton has put out concrete, comprehensive plans to raise incomes and create good-paying jobs across a range of key areas, from infrastructure and higher ed to profit sharing and raising the minimum wage.\u201d\n\nClinton certainly has lots of proposals, drawn from the standard Democratic wish list, but it\u2019s hard to claim with a straight face that her plans are guaranteed to raise incomes. Sanders, in fact, has many similar proposals, though on a grander scale (such as boosting the minimum wage to $15 an hour, compared to Clinton\u2019s $12).\n\nSanders\u2019s tax plans are mainly aimed at the wealthy. While he has not ruled out small increases on the middle class\u2014his proposal for guaranteed family and medical leave includes a relatively small payroll tax\u2014his campaign argues that the middle class would easily see far more in benefits, thus raising incomes. (The Sanders campaign claims that free college tuition would supposedly save an average of nearly $10,000 a year and universal health care would save $5,000, and so forth. But we have not vetted those figures.)\n\nLikewise, the Republicans each have a bevy of plans that in theory would raise incomes. Many of these plans operate through the tax code or target union rules\u2014typical positions for Republicans\u2014but they can credibly argue that they do offer plans that would raises incomes and spur economic growth. Dismissing them as not \u201creal plans\u201d is not really credible, given how few of these campaign plans ever survive the reality of governing.\n\nFrankly, this is rhetorical hooey. Every candidate can claim they have plans\u2014few of which will ever come to fruition in exactly the same way if the candidate is actually elected president\u2014but it\u2019s absurd for Clinton to claim that she is the only candidate in either party to have a plan to both raise incomes and not raise middle class taxes. The Republicans all say they won\u2019t raise taxes\u2014and every candidate promises to raise incomes.\n\nEven if Clinton\u2019s plans are a bit more detailed\u2013a debatable point\u2013she cannot sweepingly suggest that she is the only candidate in either party who would not raise middle-class taxes. That\u2019s really her key talking point\u2013and that\u2019s certainly news to Republicans, and maybe even Bernie Sanders.", "lang": "en"}
