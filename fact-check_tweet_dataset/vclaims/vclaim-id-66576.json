'S' for subsidy.\"\n\nSharpton said critics of the move worry that it might lead hospitals and doctors to turn away patients who use tax credits to make their insurance more affordable.\n\nWe wondered: Did the Texas Senate approve a new ID card that includes an \"S\" for subsidized Obamacare plans?\n\nThe bill in question, , started in the Texas House. The original language indeed included reference to the letter \"S.\" Here\u2019s that text:\n\nAn identification card or other similar document issued by a qualified health plan issuer to an enrollee of a qualified health plan in this state must ,... display on the card or document in a location of the issuer\u2019s choice: (1) The acronym \"QHP\"; or (2) If the enrollee receives advance payment of the premium tax credit, the acronym \"QHP-S\".\n\nThe bill\u2019s language is in government-speak, but basically any enrollee in a qualified health plan (more on that in a bit) who gets a premium tax credit through the federal health care exchange would receive a card that includes the letter \"S.\" That would be a clear cue to a doctor or hospital that a person\u2019s health insurance is being subsidized by the federal government.\n\nBut before the bill passed the House (by a vote of 129 to 8 margin) on May 11, that language was amended. The revised bill dropped the letter S. Here\u2019s the text the Senate passed on May 26, 2015:\n\nAn identification card or other similar document issued by a qualified health plan issuer to an enrollee of a qualified health plan purchased through an exchange must... display on the card or document in a location of the issuer\u2019s choice the acronym \"QHP.\"\n\nSo Sharpton was more than two weeks out of date. The Texas bill requires that insurance through the online exchange be labeled as such, but the precise identification of those who use the federal tax credits is not part of the bill.\n\nAn MSNBC spokeswoman said Sharpton would address this issue on his June 3 show.\n\nSo all plans purchased through the federal exchange -- whether they include a subsidy or not -- would have ID cards marked QHP. Why is that?\n\nHospitals and doctors say the issue is that people who buy their insurance through the federal government\u2019s exchange have 90 days to stay current with their premiums. That\u2019s two months longer than the industry standard. If a patient goes to the hospital during the first month that they have failed to pay, even if they never pay another dime of their premium, the insurance company will cover the cost.\n\nBut for care given in the second and third months, federal law allows the insurance companies to make the providers pick up the tab retroactively.\n\nThat\u2019s what the providers want to avoid.\n\nThe Texas Medical Association, the Texas Hospital Association, the Texas Academy of Family Physicians, and other trade groups supported the bill. , a medical association member, testified that seeing the QHP designation would create a teachable moment with such patients.\n\nIt would be an \"opportunity to stress the importance of continuing to pay their portion of the premium that is not subsidized by the federal government,\" she said.\n\nAustin said the change would reduce the number of times that providers have to go after patients to collect on a bill.\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear how much the current bill will accomplish.\n\nSabrina Corlette, director of Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms, thinks it won\u2019t do much.\n\n\"That label wouldn't tell a provider whether the patient is actually in the grace period,\" Corlette said. \"It also doesn't tell the provider whether the patient is subsidy eligible. So I wouldn't think it provides much in the way of useful information.\"\n\nHowever, Corlette said there is a possibility that the QHP label might prompt providers to call insurance companies before they provide care, rather than afterward. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 85 percent of plans purchased through the federal exchange in Texas receive a tax subsidy.\n\nThere\u2019s also room for a tug-of-war between the providers and insurers. the insurance companies to put hospitals and doctors on notice when there is a possibility that claims might be denied because the patient is in the second or third month of the grace period.\n\nIn other words, under existing law, the providers have another option to seeking collection from the patient who fails to pay his premiums. They can go after the insurance companies.\n\nSharpton said that the Texas bill would add a label to insurance cards for coverage purchased through the federal exchanges and that people receiving a subsidy would see the letter \"S\" on their insurance card.\n\nThat provision was dropped more than two weeks before Sharpton said it. The bill that passed the Legislature and has been sent to the governor would add the letters QHP to any insurance card tied to a health care plan on the federal exchange. But it wouldn\u2019t differentiate between those purchased with or without a federal tax credit.", "lang": "en"}
