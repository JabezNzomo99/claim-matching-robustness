Value of looted items is very less. Imagine, if she was our sister or daughter...Hindus, if you don't get it even now, a lot can go wrong...where do your daughters kidnapped from the districts of Bengal and Alwar disappear, nobody knows.'\n\nThe post can be viewed here and its archived version can be accessed here. The image has also gone viral on Facebook.\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search on the viral photo and found tweets from 2017 featuring the same image along with other photos that make it clear the picture is staged.\n\nThe tweet said the images were staged by Nadia Bashar for International Women's Day to create awareness about the lives of Yazidi women held as sex slaves in ISIS captivity.\n\nBashar's Facebook profile describes her as a performance artist and painter.\n\nWe also found the viral image on Bashar's Facebook timeline.\n\nFollowing the publication of this fact-check Bashar posted BOOM's article on her Facebook page and reiterated that the image was created for awareness.\n\nThe Islamic State has systematically used rape and sex-slavery as a way to reward its fighters as well as to punish \u2018kafirs\u2019 or non believers in Iraq and Syria. The terrorist organisation has used trafficking as a means to raise funds for the caliphate. (Source \u2013 Rape and slavery was lure for UK Isis recruits with history of sexual violence). Even as the the official estimates of rape and sexual assault are hard to pinpoint, according to UN Women, news reports indicate the numbers are in thousands.\n\nThe Yazidis, a majority-Kurdish speaking tiny religious group, have suffered the worst of these war crimes. Islamic State militants have slaughtered, enslaved and raped thousands in northern Iraq since 2014, purging Yazidis whom they see as devil worshipers.\n\nBOOM wrote a similar fact-check when a street play about the horrific condition of enslaved women in ISIS captivity was passed off as a real auction in London.
