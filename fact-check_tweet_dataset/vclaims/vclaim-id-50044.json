Wallace said that \"we have the seventh-highest mortality rate in the world. Our mortality rate is higher than Brazil, it's higher than Russia and the European Union has us on a travel ban.\"\n\nTrump responded that \"when you talk about mortality rates, I think it's the opposite. I think we have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.\"\n\nWhen Wallace fact-checked that characterization, Trump doubled down: \"I heard we had the best mortality rate. Number one low mortality rate.\"\n\nNeither the White House nor the Trump campaign responded to an inquiry for this article.\n\nScientists define \"mortality rate\" as a measure of how frequently death occurs within a defined population. Data on this question is imperfect because of reporting inconsistencies between and even within countries. We turned to widely cited coronavirus data compiled by Johns Hopkins University to analyze Trump\u2019s assertion.\n\nSpecifically, we looked at the university\u2019s calculations of COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 in population, which is a standard measurement of mortality rate.\n\nFirst, we compared the United States with other nations that have been hard-hit by the coronavirus. To do this, we looked at all nations that have recorded at least 100,000 confirmed cases.\n\nThe United States has the sixth-highest mortality rate using this metric, behind the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Chile and France.\n\nBut 16 hard-hit nations had a lower mortality rate: Peru, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Iran, Colombia, Germany, South Africa, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Argentina, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.\n\nWe also looked at how the United States compared with its peers among advanced industrialized nations.\n\nIn this comparison, six countries had higher mortality rates than the United States: Belgium, the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Sweden, and France.\n\nBut 15 countries had lower mortality rates than the United States: Ireland, the Netherlands, Canada, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Germany, Denmark, Austria, Finland, Norway, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nBy neither comparison is Trump close to correct.\n\nMortality rate is strongly related to the age distribution in a country, said Brooke Nichols, a health economist and infectious disease mathematical modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health.\n\n\"The countries with the lowest mortality rates will probably end up being the ones with the younger population age structures,\" she said.\n\nWhen \"Fox News Sunday\" aired the interview, Wallace said the White House had been referring to the \"case-fatality rate\" rather than the mortality rate. (White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany handed Trump a paper chart citing \"case-fatality rate\" during the interview.)\n\nThe case-fatality rate is not the same as the mortality rate. The case-fatality rate shows how likely you are to die from the coronavirus if you are infected with it. The mortality rate shows how common it is to die of coronavirus in a particular population, such as a country.\n\nTrump\u2019s point about the U.S. is not more accurate when looking at the case-fatality rate compared with other countries.\n\nNine countries have a higher case-fatality rate than the United States. One country, Peru, has an equal rate and 11 have a lower rate: Colombia, Chile, Turkey, India, Pakistan, Argentina, Russia, South Africa, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.\n\nNichols said that the younger populations of many developing countries helps explain why their case-fatality rates are lower than that of the United States. (Infected patients who are younger and, often, healthier tend to die at lower rates from the coronavirus.)\n\nAnd when you compare the United States with its industrialized peers, seven countries have a lower case-fatality rate: Austria, Portugal, Norway, South Korea, Luxembourg, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nNichols said that the U.S ranks relatively low on this measure because, despite its problems rolling out testing, it still handles more tests per capita than most other comparable countries.\n\nTrump said, \"We have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world\" from coronavirus.\n\nThe United States doesn\u2019t have one of the world\u2019s lowest mortality rates from the coronavirus: No fewer than 15 advanced, industrialized nations currently have a lower mortality rate, as do a host of other countries, including Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Russia, Turkey, Argentina, and India.\n\nAnother measurement called the case-fatality rate, which Trump incorrectly referred to as the \"mortality rate,\" doesn\u2019t place the United States at or near the bottom internationally.", "lang": "en"}
