It was shared a lot and getting nasty.\n\nOn 7 November 2016, so-called \u201cviral evangelist\u201d Joshua Feuerstein \u2014 who is probably best known for a 2015 Facebook video in which he ranted that Starbucks \u201chates Jesus\u201d because its holiday cups were solid red and bore no religious symbols \u2014 posted a video capture and text alleging that hiphop artist Jay Z, who had appeared with his wife, singer Beyonce, at a Hillary Clinton campaign event, had rapped the words \u201cMiddle finger to the Lord, nigga grip, I\u2019m a boss\u201d during his performance:\n\nFollowing Feuerstein\u2019s lead, other Facebook users posted helpful video clips with captions showing the allegedly blasphemous lyrics:\n\nThere was just one problem: the transcription of Jay Z\u2019s lyrics was incorrect. The song was \u201c Dirt Off Your Shoulder ,\u201d from \u201cThe Black Album,\u201d released in 2003. And the verse in question (as noted by Media Research Center when it criticized President Obama for referencing the lyric in 2012) actually goes like this:\n\nWe\u2019ll grant you that if the standard being applied were offensiveness, the real lyrics are arguably no better than the erroneous ones. But the implicit claim isn\u2019t simply that the words are offensive; it\u2019s that they blaspheme Jesus \u2014 which, in fact, they do not.\n\nThe technical term for misheard words or phrases is \u201cmondegreens,\u201d of which the annals of pop music are chock-full. The example before us is actually quite common and often turns up in Internet search results. If you look up the lyrics of \u201cDirt Off Your Shoulder\u201d on Google, for instance, this is one of the top results (and it comes from Google Play itself!):\n\nAs Hemant Mehta of Patheos demonstrates, however, \u201cmiddle finger to the Lord\u201d makes no sense in the context of the rest of the song:\n\nIn his song \u201cDirt Off Your Shoulder,\u201d Jay Z isn\u2019t talking about raising a middle finger to the Lord. He\u2019s talking about a symbolic reaction to the law. He\u2019s rapping about doing what he had to do \u2014 things the police might have arrested him for \u2014 when he wasn\u2019t rich. The lyrics actually go like this: I probably owe it to y\u2019all, probably be locked by the force\n\n Tryin to hustle some things that go with the Porsche\n\n Feeling no remorse, feeling like my hand was forced\n\n Middle finger to the law, nigga, gripping my balls You can go to Genius to see what all that means, but the point is that it wasn\u2019t blasphemy. It\u2019s a song about not letting the haters get to you. (For what it\u2019s worth, Jay Z believes in God, though he doesn\u2019t belong to any particular denomination.)", "lang": "en"}
