Sonny Leggett, the official spokesperson for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, confirmed on Twitter Jan. 27 that an Air Force plane did crash in the Ghazni province but said there was \u201cno indication that it was brought down by enemy fire.\u201d The bodies of the two crew members on board were later recovered from the crash site, The New York Times reported.\n\nFort Russ News reported that the Taliban took credit for bringing down the Bombardier E-11A, but different sources within the group appear to contradict one another. Zabihullah Mujahid, an official Taliban spokesman, told The Washington Post and other outlets the plane had been shot down, while a statement from the Taliban\u2019s website simply said the plane \u201ccrashed.\u201d\n\nThe article\u2019s claims that the Taliban shot down a helicopter en route to the crash site and killed more than 30 American servicemen don\u2019t hold up either.

If as many as 34 members of the U.S. military had been killed in such a short timespan, it would have been covered by the media, yet no outlets have reported on it.\n\nNor did the DCNF find any media reports or about the Taliban shooting down a U.S. helicopter in late January. In fact, Leggett debunked that allegation in a Jan. 27 tweet.\n\n\u201cTaliban claims that additional aircraft have crashed are false,\u201d he wrote.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
