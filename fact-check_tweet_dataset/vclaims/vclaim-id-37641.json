That\u2019s not all extra money\u2014it\u2019s the total amount local health services across England can expect to spend in the next five years. Presumably they would have received much of this money with or without the Long Term Plan. It also doesn\u2019t account for inflation (or the way prices will change over time).\n\nFunding is set to increase by around \u00a33 billion each year in real terms.\n\nSo what exactly is this \u00a3570 billion?\n\nWe asked NHS England for more information about the \u00a3570 billion in funding it had announced. It told us that it is the total amount of government funding that clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) is set to receive over the next five years.\n\nClinical commissioning groups are groups of GPs, other doctors and nurses who plan and buy health services for their local area based on need.\n\nThat \u00a3570 billion isn\u2019t all new or extra money that\u2019s been announced\u2014it\u2019s the total amount CCGs can expect to have to spend until 2023/24. Presumably they would have received much of this money, even without the introduction of the new \u2018Long Term Plan\u2019, as part of the funding they receive annually in order to run.\n\nThe draft budgets for CCGs across England show that in 2019/20 they are set to receive \u00a3104 billion which will increase each year to 2023/24, when they will receive \u00a3124 billion.\n\nThe above figures don\u2019t account for how prices are expected to change over the coming years (inflation). For example, although funding may increase from one year to the next, if prices rise at a faster rate, this would mean a drop in funding in \u201creal terms\u201d.\n\nOnce inflation is factored in the budgets are set to increase from around \u00a3104 billion in 2019/20 to \u00a3115 billion in 2023/24, based on 2019/20 prices\u2014an increase of around \u00a311 billion in real terms.\n\nLooked at another way, each year the overall budget for CCGs increases by around \u00a33 billion in real terms.\n\nWhen you account for inflation over the five years, the budgets total around \u00a3550 billion.", "lang": "en"}
