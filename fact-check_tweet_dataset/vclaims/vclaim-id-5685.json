Hardest hit would be the less than 0.1 percent of taxpayers who earn more than $5 million per year.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim about Clinton\u2019s tax plan has become a regular feature in stump speeches and interviews.\n\nTrump at a rally at Pittsburgh International Airport, June 11: Hillary Clinton is going to raise your taxes very substantially, possibly to 55 or 60 percent. That is going to be the end. She\u2019s gonna raise your taxes. And you know what? She has no plan. She doesn\u2019t talk about it. She won\u2019t talk about it. She\u2019s gotta raise them to at least 55 percent. Trump in a speech in Dallas, June 16: Hillary Clinton is going to raise your taxes big league. That\u2019s the last thing you need. She has to. And you know, she doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. But they\u2019re talking about 55 and 60 percent. \u2026 She\u2019s gonna raise your taxes like you\u2019ve never seen before. Trump at the Faith and Freedom Coalition Road to Majority Conference, June 10: Hillary\u2019s agenda of taxation, and she wants to raise your taxes big league, folks, big league. Get used to it. Hear it. She wants to raise your taxes tremendously. Trump in an interview on Fox Business News, June 21: Hillary has to raise taxes to 55 or 60 percent. There\u2019s no way she can do anything less than that.\n\nUnlike Trump, Clinton has not formally unveiled a comprehensive tax plan. Instead, Clinton has released her tax proposals over the course of her campaign, such as in January when she announced a 4 percent surcharge on people making more than $5 million per year. Most of her tax proposals to date are included in a fact sheet produced by the Clinton campaign, though the campaign promises that more middle- and lower-income tax cut proposals are coming.\n\nStill, here are the biggest changes Clinton has proposed so far to individual income taxes:\n\u2022 Enact the \u201cBuffet Rule,\u201d a 30 percent minimum tax on those with taxable income above $1 million.\n\u2022 Limit the value of itemized deductions to 28 percent for taxpayers in higher tax brackets.\n\u2022 Amend the schedule for capital gains rates: Assets held less than two years would be taxed as short-term gain at ordinary income tax rates; assets held six or more years would be taxed at 23.8 percent.\n\u2022 Prevent people with high balances in tax-deferred and tax-free retirement accounts from making additional contributions.\n\u2022 Tax so-called \u201ccarried interest\u201d \u2014 which are profits from investments held for more than a year \u2014 at ordinary income tax rates, rather than at the lower capital gains rate.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center concluded that the sum of Clinton\u2019s proposed tax changes \u2014 including changes to both individual and business taxes \u2014 would increase revenue by $1.1 trillion over the next decade.\n\n\u201cNearly all of the tax increases would fall on the top 1 percent; the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers would see little or no change in their taxes,\u201d the Tax Policy Center concluded.\n\nIn fact, the Tax Policy Center wrote, the \u201ctop 1 percent of households would pay more than three-fourths of Clinton\u2019s total tax increases.\u201d\n\nThe top 1 percent in 2017 would be those with incomes above $730,000 (in 2015 dollars), the Tax Policy Center noted. Those taxpayers would see a reduction in after-tax income of about $78,000, or 5 percent. \u201cTaxpayers outside the top 5 percent (those earning less than $300,000 in 2015 dollars) would see little change in average after-tax income.\u201d\n\nThe two biggest revenue-generators in Clinton\u2019s proposal are the Buffet Rule and the 4 percent surcharge on income over $5 million, said Roberton Williams, the Sol Price fellow at the Tax Policy Center.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a tiny sliver of people who would be affected by these very high taxes,\u201d Williams said.\n\nThe 4 percent surcharge, for instance, kicks in for those who earn more than $5 million a year. That\u2019s less than a tenth of 1 percent of U.S. taxpayers.\n\nAccording to the TPC analysis, the bottom 40 percent of taxpayers would see no increase in their tax rates. The next 40 percent of taxpayers would see a 0.1 percent increase on average in their tax rates, and the top 20 percent of taxpayers would see an average rate increase of 1.3 percent. The very wealthiest taxpayers would bear the greatest burden, with the top 1 percent getting a 3.4 percent tax rate hike on average, and the top 0.1 percent seeing an average 5 percent tax rate increase.\n\nAs for Trump\u2019s claim that Clinton would raise taxes \u201cpossibly to 55 or 60 percent,\u201d it wasn\u2019t clear to us whether Trump was saying some would be paying an effective tax rate of 55 percent to 60 percent, or if some taxpayers would see their rates rise by 55 percent to 60 percent. We reached out to his campaign for clarification, but we did not hear back.\n\nWilliams was hard-pressed to describe anyone who would pay an effective tax rate as high as 55 percent or 60 percent under Clinton\u2019s plan. A few very wealthy taxpayers could see an effective tax rate approaching 50 percent, he said. More common would be those who might see a 55 percent to 60 percent increase over what they are paying now. Very high income people with lots of deductions, for example, could be hard hit by the Buffet Rule, Williams said.\n\n\u201cYou could cherry-pick cases where someone would have a very large tax increase,\u201d he said.\n\nBut those cases are far from the norm. Most middle-income taxpayers would see no change at all to their taxes under the proposals Clinton has laid out so far, Williams said.\n\nThe Tax Foundation reached a similar conclusion about Clinton\u2019s tax increases falling on the wealthiest Americans. The Tax Foundation concluded the plan would decrease the country\u2019s economic output, and specifically reduce the gross domestic product by 1 percent over the long term. And so, the Tax Foundation provides two sets of forecasts \u2014 static and dynamic \u2014 with the latter factoring in the expected effect on the economy. By the Tax Foundation\u2019s calculation, Clinton\u2019s tax plan would increase revenues by nearly $500 billion over the next decade, but only by $191 billion when accounting for the plan\u2019s overall economic effect.\n\n\u201cThe largest sources of revenue in the plan are the new taxes targeted at high-income taxpayers,\u201d the Tax Foundation wrote.\n\nChanges from Clinton\u2019s plan would be negligible for those below the top 10 percent of earners, said Alan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation. The cap on itemized deductions at a value of 28 percent (thereby lowering the value of itemized deductions to people in higher tax brackets), would start to affect single people making $190,000 or couples making $230,000, Cole said. At the next threshold, the Buffet Rule applies to those making more than $1 million. And finally, the 4 percent surcharge kicks in for those making more than $5 million.\n\nAs for Trump\u2019s claim about raising taxes 55 percent to 60 percent under the Clinton proposal, Cole said it is difficult to \u201ccome up with the right kind of person that would apply to.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at someone who\u2019s maybe got a lot of gross income but a lot of deductions because they are running a business, you could maybe find someone whose taxes would be raised that much,\u201d Cole said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not true for someone with a normal financial situation. You\u2019d have to be mining for the exceptions.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton campaign website claims she would give \u201cworking families \u2026 tax relief that will help them manage rising costs.\u201d The Clinton campaign points to several tax cuts that Clinton supports, such as a tax credit for out-of-pocket health care costs, tax relief for families caring for ailing parents or grandparents, and a tax credit for college tuition. But those are all targeted tax relief measures, not across-the-board tax cuts for middle-income families.\n\nThe Clinton campaign told us \u201cthere will be more\u201d middle-income tax cuts. The Tax Policy Center also noted that \u201crepresentatives of the campaign told us that Clinton intends to propose a tax cut for low- and middle-income households later in the campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t know what those may be,\u201d Williams said.\n\nIt is true that Trump has called for tax cuts that would result in lower taxes at all income levels, though the biggest cuts would come for the wealthiest taxpayers, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation. But when Trump claims that Clinton would \u201craise your taxes very substantially,\u201d that\u2019s not true for the vast majority of taxpayers.", "lang": "en"}
