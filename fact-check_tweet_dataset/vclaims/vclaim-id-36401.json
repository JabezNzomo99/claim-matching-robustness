While Trump is certainly taller than Bloomberg, this photograph doesn\u2019t document the true height disparity between the two men. It was manipulated to make Bloomberg look small.\n\nThe original photograph showed Trump, Bloomberg, and Jared Kushner at an event in New York in March 2013. It was taken by Paul Bruinooge/Patrick McMullan and is available via Getty Images along with the caption:\n\nWe cropped the original photograph (left) in order to compare it to the doctored image (right): You can see the uncropped photograph on Getty Images.\n\nAlthough we\u2019re not able to independently verify the actual heights of these two individuals, it seems that their statures have been exaggerated over the years. While Bloomberg is currently listed on Google at 5 foot 8, the former mayor of New York once identified himself as 5 foot 7.\n\nTrump\u2019s 2016 White House physical listed him as 6 foot 3, but he was listed as 6 foot 2 on his 2012 driver\u2019s license.\n\nRegardless, it appears that height may be a leading issue in the lead-up to the 2020 elections:", "lang": "en"}
