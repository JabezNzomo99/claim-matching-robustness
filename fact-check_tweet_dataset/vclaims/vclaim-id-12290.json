We are experiencing global warming: the planet is getting hotter over time, and at a faster and faster pace.\n\nAll the evidence shows that the planet is getting hotter\n\nIt\u2019s correct that the global average temperature was higher in 2016 than in 2017 or 2018, but this is not evidence that \u201cglobal cooling\u201d is occurring.\n\n2016 was the hottest year on record, 2017 was the second-hottest, and 2018 was the fourth-hottest, according to the data from NASA that is linked in the Facebook post itself. 18 of the 19 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001, and the average global temperature has increased by about 0.8\u00b0 to 1.0\u00b0 Celsius in recent years, compared to the average temperature between 1951 and 1980.\n\nAs Gavin Schmidt, Director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies summarises: \u201c2018 is yet again an extremely warm year on top of a long-term global warming trend\u201d.\n\nThis graph of NASA\u2019s data shows that long-term trend more clearly. Global warming does not mean that every year has to be hotter than the year before. Rather, it means that generally average temperatures are on the rise (the red line), even if they may fluctuate somewhat year-to-year (the blue line).\n\nThe drop in temperature in 2017 and 2018 is not \u201crecord-breaking\u201d as the post suggests. Since 1980, there have been eight separate years (including 2011 and 2008) that saw bigger drops in the average global temperature than the ones we saw in 2017 and 2018.\n\nJudith Curry, a climatologist and former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology has commented on the slightly lower temperatures in 2017 and 2018. She said: \u201cA two-year trend is not meaningful in terms of understanding anything about how climate is changing.\u201d\n\nClimate change continued to have a big impact on the planet in 2018\n\nEven if it was only the fourth-hottest year on record across the planet as a whole, plenty of cities and countries did see their hottest-ever temperatures in 2018. This interactive map from the BBC allows you to see this in full.\n\nRising temperatures were also linked to plenty of other extreme weather events last year.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) points to \u201cabnormal\u201d levels of heatwaves, wildfire and drought in much of Europe and the USA in 2018. There were also floods in Kerala that affected over five million people, and hundreds of people killed by flooding in Japan. The WMO has produced a map charting all of the extreme weather events in 2018.", "lang": "en"}
