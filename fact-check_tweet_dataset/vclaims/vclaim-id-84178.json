The claim is false; the footage has circulated online since at least 2016; Cyclone Fani made landfall India on May 3, 2019.\n\nThe video has been posted repeatedly on Facebook, for example here on May 3, 2019, where it has been viewed over 2,600 times.\n\nA caption says: \u201cCyclone \u2018FANI\u2019 continues to strengthen as it tracks over the \u2018BAY OF BENGAL\u2019...\u201d\n\nThe video and misleading claim have been shared repeatedly on Facebook, for example here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nHere is an AFP report on Cyclone Fani in India and Bangladesh.\n\nCyclone Fani made landfall at around 0930 IST (0400 GMT) on May 3, 2019 over India's eastern Odisha state, according to this tweet by India\u2019s Meteorological Department.\n\nBut the footage does not show Cyclone Fani -- the exact same footage has been online since at least 2016.\n\nThe footage was posted here on Russian social media on November 17, 2016, with a caption saying: \"A level 12 storm on the Beaufort scale\".\n\nThe Beaufort Scale is an empirical measure that relates wind speed to observed conditions at sea or on land, according to this post on the Royal Meterological Society website.\n\nAt 1:30 in the original footage, the camera pans to the right; at 0:16 in the shorter, cropped clip in the misleading Facebook post, the camera also pans right.\n\nThe original 2016 footage is embedded below:\n\nThe footage has circulated widely online, for example it was posted here on YouTube on May 23, 2018, with an Arabic language caption claiming it showed the Arab Sea and here on a Polish language website which claimed it was a storm in the North Sea.\n\nThe same footage was also posted here on Twitter by severe-weather.EU on March 1, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
