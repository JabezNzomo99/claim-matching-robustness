They travel on budget airlines out of Luton, Stansted and so on. Heathrow is used by businessmen and women who get off one plane and get on another.\u201d\n\nMore people flying from Heathrow are on connecting flights or business trips than at most other major UK airports. But the majority are leisure travellers and on terminating flights (as opposed to connecting ones).\n\nThe data referenced comes from a survey of passengers flying out of airports, conducted by the Civil Aviation Authority, the aviation regulator. It surveys a representative sample of departing passengers at most of the UK\u2019s large airports.\n\nIn 2017 the survey found that 26% of passengers departing Heathrow were flying for business reasons, higher than other London airports included in the study (except London City airport at 50%).\n\nIt also found that 34% of departing passengers from Heathrow were on a connecting flight (i.e. they had flown into Heathrow and were now immediately flying out on another flight). Of the London airports, Gatwick had the next highest proportion of connecting flights at 8%.\n\nThe survey asks respondents how much their flight cost, but that information isn\u2019t published. What we do know is the average income (before tax) of passengers at each airport.\n\nAgain, according to the survey Heathrow\u2019s passengers say they have higher average incomes than at other London airports, except City, though this includes all passengers, not just UK residents. As income is to some people sensitive personal information, it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that not all people report their income in surveys.\n\nLooking just at UK residents travelling for leisure reasons, City fliers (\u00a375,000) have slightly higher average household incomes than Heathrow fliers (\u00a362,000).\n\nMore generally, air travellers have higher incomes than the average. Survey data from 2014 found passengers with higher incomes were more likely to have flown in the previous 12 months.\n\nThe average household income of UK leisure passengers flying from London airports was higher than the UK household average of around \u00a344,000.", "lang": "en"}
