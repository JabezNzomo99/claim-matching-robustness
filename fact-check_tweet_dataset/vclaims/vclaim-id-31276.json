(RELATED: Does The US Have The Most Military Satellites In Space?)\n\nIn June, college student Matty Roberts created the Facebook event \u201cStorm Area 51, They Can\u2019t Stop Us All,\u201d which jokingly called for the public invasion of Area 51 in search of extraterrestrial lifeforms. The event also spawned festivals in the nearby towns of Rachel and Hiko.\n\nOf the more than 2 million people who, according to the Washington Post, signed up to attend the event, only about 100 people showed up at the border of the military facility in the early morning of Sept. 20. At least two people were detained by local law enforcement.\n\nHowever, the viral image does not show the crowd outside Area 51. A reverse image search reveals that the picture, found on the In His Name Ministries website, actually depicts attendees at 2014 \u201ccrusade\u201d in Nkomazi, South Africa, according to the post. The international Christian evangelical organization holds several open-air events like the one in the mis-captioned picture each year.", "lang": "en"}
