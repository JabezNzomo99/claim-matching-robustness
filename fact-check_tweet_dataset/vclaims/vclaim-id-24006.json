No, This Video Is Doctored", "subtitle": "BOOM found that the audio of the clip has been spliced to add 'Allah hu Akbar' to it.", "author": "www.boomlive.in", "date": "2019-07-16T17:51:30+05:30", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-24006", "url": "https://www.boomlive.in/did-trump-panic-hearing-allah-hu-akbar-no-this-video-is-doctored/", "vclaim": "A two-year old video of a security breach at US President Donald Trump's rally in Ohio has been doctored and shared on the social media with a caption that purports to show Islam in bad light.\n\nAn audio-track of 'Allah Hu Akbar' has been added to the viral video.\n\nThe 40-second long viral clip shows the US president speaking from a dais when someone in the background can be heard saying 'Allah Hu Akbar'. This leaves Trump visibly startled and security personnel immediately form a wall around him. Later in the clip, Trump is shown resuming his speech.\n\nA caption with the video reads, 'watch for yourself the fear that Allah Hu Akbar evokes...Trump was delivering a speech when someone from behind murmured Allah Hu Akbar. Watch for yourself what happened next'.\n\nThe viral post can be viewed here and its archived version can be accessed here. The video has been shared widely on both Twitter and Facebook.\n\nBOOM broke the viral clip into fragments and ran a reverse image search to trace the original video. We found the same video published by CNN on March 12, 2016 with a caption 'Trump swarmed by security on stage'.\n\nThe original video does not have Allah Hu Akbar in it, and the audio has been added to the original video.\n\nBOOM also found several reports related to the security breach incident from 2016. NBC news, in its report, had identified the man who attempted to breach Trump's security cover in Dayton (Ohio) as Thomas Dimassimo, who according to US media, has a history of carrying out political protests.\n\nRead more about the incident here and here.\n\nBOOM also found other videos of the same incident shot from different angles that shows the security breach more clearly.\n\nHowever, none of the reports or videos that BOOM went through mentions about the Allah Hu Akbar chant as claimed by the viral post.", "lang": "en"}
