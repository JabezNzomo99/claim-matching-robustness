It shows an army man\u2019s attempt to commit suicide by holding a high tension terminal in a transformer on Madurai district collectorate on January 7, 2020. He was rushed to Government Rajaji Hospital where he was treated.\n\nP Muthu, a 25-year-old army man posted in Rajasthan, had appeared before the Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO) after his wife committed suicide. Muthu married Thenisha from Nilakottai in Dindigul district three-and-a-half months ago. According to a report by The Times of India, there was a dispute in the family over dowry. She consumed poison and was subsequently admitted to a private hospital for first-aid. On January 6, Thenisha was shifted to GRH where she died. A case was registered with the Nilakottai police under 174-CrPC and an inquiry was carried out along with an RDO inquiry in progress. Muthu came out of the RDO office and went straight to the transformer and climbed on to it. His relatives and others tried to pacify him.\n\nThis claim was earlier fact-checked by news website News Meterwhen the same video was shared with the false narrative of a farmer committing suicide in Amravati, Andhra Pradesh.\n\nIn conclusion, a video of an army man who attempted to commit suicide in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, is being shared with the false narrative that an LIC employee from Surat wanted to commit suicide after government\u2019s move to sell the company\u2019s stake. It is noteworthy that LIC is likely to go public in the next financial year.", "lang": "en"}
