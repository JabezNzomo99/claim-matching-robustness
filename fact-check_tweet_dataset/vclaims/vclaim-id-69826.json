Scott Walker.\n\n\"Do you trust Scott Walker on education?\" asks the TV ad, released Sept. 25, 2018. \"He\u2019s the politician who cut $800 million from our schools.\"\n\nThat\u2019s very similar to an Evers claim we fact-checked in April -- that Walker \"has taken over a billion dollars from the public schools.\" We rated that Mostly False.\n\nEvers\u2019 team said the number in the ad referred to cuts in 2011-\u201913, under Walker\u2019s first budget.\n\nThough much of that funding has since been restored, Evers spokesman Sam Lau argued that doesn\u2019t make the claim less true -- and doesn\u2019t lessen the impact of the reduction.\n\n\"Each and every year of a student's education matters,\" Lau said in an email. \"Scott Walker's $800 million cuts to Wisconsin's public schools were devastating and continue to be felt today.\"\n\nThe state\u2019s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau provided numbers for our April fact check on this topic, and we\u2019ll rely on those again.\n\nThe chart below has a lot to take in, but we\u2019ll focus on a couple numbers we\u2019ve designated with asterisks. This looks at general purpose revenue (GPR) routed to schools, which includes per-pupil aid, equalization aid and other categorical aids.\n\nIt starts with the 2010-\u201911 budget, the last one under Gov. Jim Doyle. That\u2019s the baseline for the comparison.\n\nThe numbers do show a large drop when Walker first took office.\n\nThe state had GPR school aid of $5.27 billion the last year under Doyle. The \"cuts\" Evers alleges come from comparing actual funding in the following two years to what funding would have been if it remained at that $5.27 billion level annually.\n\nThe GPR school aids dropped by $426.5 million in 2011-\u201912 and then rose by $68.9 million in 2012-\u201913. Taken together, that reduced school aid by $784.1 million in the two-year budget.\n\nThat\u2019s in the ballpark of Evers\u2019 claim, but it leaves out a lot of information.\n\nIt\u2019s critical to note the 2011-\u201912 funding reduction did not happen in isolation.\n\nAct 10, enacted in 2011, required public employees to pay more toward their pensions and decreased their collective bargaining power. That allowed schools to save money that would have gone toward employee pensions and to charge employees more for health insurance.\n\nWhen all districts were tallied in 2012, they spent $451.5 million less on employee benefits than in 2011, according to a study by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, now the Wisconsin Policy Forum. In 2013, benefits were $433.6 million less than in 2011.\n\nSo across the two years where state funding was cut by nearly $800 million, school districts saved nearly $900 million in benefits. And that savings would be higher if you assume costs would have continued to rise from the 2011 levels (likely about 4.3 percent per year, according to the study).\n\nAnother important factor: The Evers ad does not say it is referring to a funding change made more than five years ago in a single budget.\n\nThus, viewers might assume school spending is $800 million less today than when Walker began. In reality, after the initial cuts, Walker has increased GPR school aids every year, hitting a high of $5.84 billion this year.\n\nThat\u2019s above the last year of Doyle\u2019s term, though that doesn\u2019t account for inflation.\n\nThose increases mean most of that $784 million in cuts has been returned to the budget. The right-hand column of the chart shows the difference between actual funding and what it would have been cumulatively if the schools budget remained $5.27 billion every year since 2011. That gap was more than $1 billion at one point but now is down to $183.6 million.\n\nIn the ad, Evers claims Walker cut $800 million from schools. He did cut close to that ($784 million), in raw dollars in a single two-year budget.\n\nBut that ignores changes made through Walker\u2019s Act 10 that saved districts money. And the ad does not make clear that it\u2019s referring only to cuts from 2011-\u201913, so viewers wouldn\u2019t know that subsequent funding increases have made up most of that reduction.\n\nOur definition for Mostly False is \"The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\"", "lang": "en"}
