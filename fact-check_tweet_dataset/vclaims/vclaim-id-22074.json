This statement came as Trump mentioned a number of India's achievements while addressing the Indian-American community at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Howdy, Modi' rally in Houston.\n\nAlso Read: President Trump To Attend \u2018Howdy Modi\u2019 Rally In Houston: What We Know\n\nWhile the numbers are true, President Trump's attempt to give credit solely to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pro-growth reforms can be termed as misleading. While Modi came to power in May 2014, the numbers are for the period 2005-2006 to 2015-2016, with a large part of that period being under Congress led coalition government's rule. Here's all you need to know about these numbers.\n\nWhere did President Trump get this data from?\n\nThese numbers are from the 2019 Global Multidimensional Poverty Index released by the United Nations Development Program and the University of Oxford. It can be found here.\n\n\n\nWhat did the UN report study?\n\nThe report studied poverty across 101 countries - 31 low income, 68 middle income and 2 high income - covering 76% of the global population.\n\nThe study also grouped 10 particular countries in low, lower-middle and upper-middle income categories - whose combined population is 2 billion, to illustrate shifts in poverty levels.\n\nThese countries are Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Pakistan, Cambodia, Ethiopia and Haiti.\n\nWhat was the aim of report?\n\nThe study not only measured absolute shifts in the number of people coming out of poverty, but also how countries performed across 10 developmental measures which encompass health, education and standard of living.\n\nThey are nutrition, child mortality, years of schooling, sanitation, electricity, school attendance, drinking water, housing, cooking fuel and assets.\n\nSome salient features of the report\n\u2022 There are 23% people in multi-dimensional poverty between 2006 -2016. This equals around 1.3 billion people.\n\u2022 Two-thirds of the multi-dimensionally poor people are found in middle-income countries.\n\u2022 Half of these people are under the age of 18. A third are under the age of 10.\n\nWhat are the primary findings on India?\n\nIn India, in 2005 - 2006, there were 640 million people below the poverty line, or around 55.1% of the population. This number was reduced to 369 million people in 2015 - 2016, or to around 27.9%. This reduction measures around 271 million people.\n\nThe report further said that in India, the rural-poor grew out of poverty faster than their urban counterparts. Further, India has shown significant improvement in all the 10 development metrics covered in the report.\n\nIn the 10 countries highlighted to illustrate poverty reduction, India and Cambodia reduced poverty the fastest. Further, both these countries did not leave the poorest of groups behind.\n\nThe report also states that the Indian state of Jharkhand reduced the multi-dimensional poor the fastest - from almost 75% in 2005 - 2006 to 46.5% in 2015-2016.", "lang": "en"}
