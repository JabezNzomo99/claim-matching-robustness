Police get involved\u201d during a turbulent protest outside the White House. The Secret Service said the local police were involved.\n\u2022 Trump urged Philadelphia officials to call in the National Guard to help stop looting \u2014 hours after they had already done so.\n\u2022 Trump said Minneapolis had been too slow to bring in the National Guard, and again got the timeline wrong.\n\nThe inaccuracies come as the president has scolded state and local officials, often singling out Democrats, for not being tough enough in dealing with protests. In a conference call June 1, Trump told the nation\u2019s governors they were \u201cweak\u201d and said they needed to act more aggressively in quelling violent behavior.\n\nD.C. Police Were on the Scene\n\nThe president, in a series of tweets May 30, praised the Secret Service for its work protecting the White House as an unruly crowd of more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered outside the White House early that morning. At the same time, Trump charged that Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser wouldn\u2019t let the D.C police help protect him.\n\nBut the D.C. police were involved in the protection during the tumultuous protest, as this Washington Post article makes clear. \u201cBowser and D.C. police Chief Peter Newsham said city police had in fact joined with Secret Service and U.S. Park Police on Saturday to control the demonstrators on Pennsylvania Avenue, even supplying the Secret Service with extra protective gear,\u201d the article says. The Post also said its reporters covering the protests saw that D.C. Police were there.\n\nAnd the Secret Service said in a statement about the episode, \u201cThe Metropolitan Police Department and the U.S. Park Police were on the scene.\u201d\n\nPhiladelphia Had Already Asked for National Guard Help\n\nTrump also was off-base on May 31 when he tweeted that Philadelphia officials should call in the National Guard to help deal with widespread looting in the city, suggesting their failure to do so reflected a general weakness in the way Democrats dealt with civil unrest. But the guard had been called in hours before Trump\u2019s 4 p.m. tweet.\n\nThe guard was already on the way.\n\nAt a noon press conference of city officials that day, Philadelphia Police Chief Danielle Outlaw said, \u201cWe have requested support from the Pennsylvania National Guard.\u201d At a 6 p.m. press conference, Philadelphia Managing Director Brian Abernathy reiterated that the National Guard was en route and was expected later that night. He said the guard\u2019s role would be to support the local police and act as a \u201cforce multiplier.\u201d\n\nNational Guard troops began arriving in Center City Philadelphia around 1 a.m. June 1 and were on patrol by dawn.\n\nNational Guard Had Already Arrived in Minneapolis\n\nTrump also suggested \u2014 falsely \u2014 that members of Minnesota\u2019s National Guard didn\u2019t arrive in Minneapolis to assist local and state law enforcement control crowds until the evening of May 30.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to our National Guard for the great job they did immediately upon arriving in Minneapolis, Minnesota, last night,\u201d Trump tweeted May 31. \u201cThe ANTIFA led anarchists, among others, were shut down quickly. Should have been done by Mayor on first night and there would have been no trouble!\u201d\n\nAt least some Minnesota National Guard soldiers and airmen had been deployed to Minneapolis for duty the night of May 28.\n\nEarly that day, after a second day of demonstrations in Minneapolis over Floyd\u2019s death became increasingly violent, including looting, fires being set and a fatal shooting, Mayor Jacob Frey officially declared a local emergency and called for the state\u2019s National Guard to be deployed to his city. (Frey\u2019s office told us he actually asked for that help May 27, as the Star-Tribune reported.)\n\nBut it was up to Minnesota\u2019s governor, Tim Walz, to authorize the activation of the state\u2019s National Guard, which he did by signing an executive order the afternoon of May 28. (At a roundtable discussion with business executives May 29, Trump left the inaccurate impression that he had called in National Guard troops to Minneapolis, saying \u201cwe brought in the National Guard today.\u201d)\n\nAfter Walz signed the order, the Minnesota National Guard tweeted late on May 28 that it had \u201cactivated more than 500 soldiers to St. Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding communities.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Walz called for a fuller mobilization of the guard\u2019s soldiers and airmen on May 30.\n\nIn a tweet late that day, the Minnesota National Guard said, \u201cWe now have more than 4,100 \u2014 quickly moving toward 10,800 \u2014 Minnesota Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen supporting our friends and neighbors in the Twin Cities.\u201d That was \u201ca significant increase over the 700 on-duty\u201d as of May 29, the tweet said.\n\nA public affairs official for the guard told us that about 7,000 members had been deployed as of June 1.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
