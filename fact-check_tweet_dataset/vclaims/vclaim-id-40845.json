Pelosi urged people to shop and eat there at a time when tourism was suffering because of the novel coronavirus, which originated in China late last year.\n\u2022 Trump falsely tweeted that \u201cCrazy Nancy Pelosi\u201d had deleted a video from Twitter of her visit to Chinatown. \u201cShe wanted everyone to pack into Chinatown long after I closed the BORDER TO CHINA,\u201d Trump said. But there is no record such a video was ever posted on Twitter by Pelosi.\n\u2022 At an April 13 coronavirus briefing, Trump falsely claimed that during her visit Pelosi said, \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s all have the big parade \u2014 Chinatown parade.'\u201d Pelosi didn\u2019t say that. In fact, that parade had taken place on Feb. 8, more than two weeks before Pelosi went to Chinatown.\n\u2022 At a coronavirus briefing on April 15, Trump exaggerated when he said Pelosi \u201cwas trying to have, in San Francisco, parties in Chinatown, because she thought it would be great.\u201d Pelosi didn\u2019t mention parties during her visit, although she urged people to come to Chinatown to shop and eat.\n\u2022 Trump also falsely said Pelosi visited Chinatown \u201cto show that this thing doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d referring to the novel coronavirus. Pelosi never suggested that it didn\u2019t exist. She stressed the need for \u201cprevention, prevention, prevention\u201d \u2014 urging people to be \u201cconcerned and vigilant,\u201d but not \u201cafraid.\u201d\n\nThe president has raised Pelosi\u2019s visit several times in recent days to counter criticism that he was slow to react to the coronavirus. He repeatedly mentions that he issued travel restrictions on China, which he did on Jan. 31. Meanwhile, he points out, the House speaker was urging people to go to Chinatown.\n\nTrump is mischaracterizing and exaggerating what she said during her visit. And while Trump did issue the travel restrictions, as we have reported, he also downplayed the danger of the virus in a series of remarks and tweets from Jan. 22 to March 10.\n\nThe California Democrat\u2019s visit to Chinatown came three weeks before six Bay Area counties implemented shelter-in-place restrictions. On the same day as Pelosi\u2019s visit, Trump tweeted, \u201cThe Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s Trump\u2019s April 16 tweet accusing Pelosi of deleting a video from her Twitter account:\n\nWe could find no record that the video was ever posted on Pelosi\u2019s Twitter account.\n\nWe checked Politwoops, a project of ProPublica that preserves tweets deleted by politicians, and there\u2019s no record Pelosi deleted a tweet of the video, nor a record of her deleting a tweet about the Chinatown visit. The Internet Archives\u2019 Wayback Machine captured an image of Pelosi\u2019s Twitter page on Feb. 27, and that, too, shows no tweet of the video. Pelosi still has a tweet about her Chinatown visit on her Twitter feed.\n\nPelosi spokesperson Drew Hammill tweeted that Pelosi\u2019s office hadn\u2019t posted it. \u201cFact check: We never posted this video. It\u2019s obviously local TV coverage of the Speaker visiting Chinatown in San Francisco\u2026.\u201d\n\nPelosi explained at the time that she was making her Chinatown visit \u201cto say to everyone: we should come to Chinatown.\u201d\n\nSo, Pelosi mentioned the Chinese New Year parade. But she did not say, \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s all have the big parade \u2014 Chinatown parade,'\u201d as Trump maintained during the April 13 coronavirus briefing. In fact, the parade occurred on Feb. 8.\n\nAnd, while she encouraged people to \u201cvisit and enjoy Chinatown\u201d and called it \u201cvery safe,\u201d Trump went too far in saying at his April 15 briefing that Pelosi \u201cwas trying to have, in San Francisco, parties in Chinatown, because she thought it would be great.\u201d Pelosi didn\u2019t mention parties during her visit.\n\nAs for the coronavirus, Pelosi didn\u2019t deny its existence \u2014 contrary to Trump\u2019s remarks \u2014 while visiting Chinatown. She struck a middle ground. \u201cPrevention, prevention, prevention. We want people to be concerned and vigilant,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, we don\u2019t want them to be afraid.\u201d\n\nDuring her excursion, Pelosi was asked if it was irrational for people to stay away from Asian-American-owned businesses in San Francisco and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s one of the reasons we are here today,\u201d she replied. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense, but it\u2019s not just Asian-owned now. You see in Italy where the shows \u2013 the fashion shows and all of that were done without an audience because people \u2013 they just didn\u2019t \u2013 because people were not coming. So, again, this fear is \u2013 I think \u2013 unwarranted in light of the precautions that are being taken here in the United States.\u201d\n\nBut in response to a question, Pelosi rejected the notion that racism was the reason people were avoiding Asian businesses.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, I do think that because it started in China, there\u2019s a concern that are the \u2013 is the Chinese government doing what it needed to do early enough, and now as we go forward. But that should not be carried over to Chinatown and San Francisco.\u201d\n\nAsked whether she felt the federal government was doing enough to control the virus, Pelosi said, \u201cI have confidence in Dr. [Anthony] Fauci at the National Institutes of Health, who has even further confidence in what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nTrump and Pelosi have long had a frosty relationship, one that wasn\u2019t warmed up by the impeachment battle. And the president has bristled at her criticism that he was slow to react to the threat of the novel coronavirus. On March 29, on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d she said, \u201chis denial at the beginning was deadly. His delaying of getting equipment to where \u2014 it continues \u2014 his delay in getting equipment to where it\u2019s needed is deadly.\u201d\n\nTrump returned fire the following day in an interview on Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d assailing Pelosi as a \u201csick puppy.\u201d\n\nTo sum up: Pelosi did visit Chinatown in late February in an effort to encourage people to go there to eat and shop. But she did not support parades or parties, try to show the coronavirus didn\u2019t exist or delete a tweet of her visit, as Trump claimed.", "lang": "en"}
