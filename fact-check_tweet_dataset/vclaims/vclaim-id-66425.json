Taking up the cause on Fox News Sunday was 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.\n\n\"You've seen in polls and in discussions across the country a feeling that Hillary Clinton is just not trustworthy,\" Romney said April 12, 2015. \"This whole story about her having erased all of her emails even though they were subject to recall and review by Congress, I think that's made people remember that with the Clintons, it's always something.\"\n\nWe have dissected before the web of that surround Clinton\u2019s use of a private email account as Secretary of State. For this fact-check, we look at Romney\u2019s claim that she erased all of her emails when they should have been kept for use by Congress.\n\nA review of the facts shows Romney had a point, but he mangled the details.\n\nIn March, the public learned that instead of using a State Department email account when she was in charge, Clinton ran all of her email through a private server in her New York home. When State Department officials asked for copies of her government-related emails late last year, Clinton\u2019s staff went through her files and sent over about 30,000. According to Clinton, about an equal number of emails were judged to be personal and were erased.\n\nSpecific to Romney\u2019s statement that Clinton erased all of her emails, there is no question that she preserved and delivered thousands to the State Department.\n\nClinton has said that all of this was in line with federal regulations. We have found that it isn\u2019t so cut and dried.\n\nThe (NARA) oversees federal recordkeeping, and its code requires federal agencies to keep records that document agency activity so that they are readily available when needed -- such as for Freedom of Information Act requests or congressional inquiries.\n\nHowever, not all records need be retained. to delete material that is deemed to have no value.\n\nThe laws are tighter today than when Clinton was secretary, but even during her tenure, her sole reliance on a private email account skirted the law, experts tell us.\n\n\"The key thing is that while use of a personal account was not prohibited, exclusive use of it was,\" said Daniel Metcalfe, professor of law at American University and former director of the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Information Policy.\n\nWith a State Department email account, all of Clinton\u2019s emails would have been stored on a government computer. Any researcher or government body would then have access, pending the normal privacy and security reviews. (That said, the department .)\n\nClinton\u2019s private email account changed the process completely. She, not a government worker, had control over the emails, and even though emails she sent to government workers would have been saved under their email accounts, searching those records would be infinitely more complicated.\n\nThe legal experts we reached said Romney\u2019s use of the phrase \"recall and review by Congress\" is ambiguous. (We tried to reach Romney for clarification and did not hear back by the time we published. If we learn more, we will update this fact-check.)\n\nJason R. Baron is a lawyer at Drinker Biddle and Reath and a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration. Baron told PunditFact that in the most literal sense, Congress plays no role at all in deciding what materials should be preserved when an official leaves office.\n\n\"This is an executive branch function,\" Baron said. \"In most agencies when a senior official leaves, there is a protocol to review the documents that the official might have. The Federal Records Act doesn\u2019t expect Congress to review anything.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Congress has the right to subpoena records as part of an investigation and congressional committees have been investigating the deaths at the American compound in Benghazi, Libya. This might be what Romney had in mind. But if he did, that makes his point even harder to prove.\n\nDouglas Cox is a law professor who specializes in government records law at the City University of New York. Cox said Romney is on thin ice if he meant that Clinton ducked a congressional subpoena.\n\n\"Clinton has stated that she turned over to the State Department any records responsive to congressional subpoena at the time,\" Cox said. \"An allegation that she destroyed records subject to subpoena is a serious one, and it is speculative absent more specific evidence.\"\n\nBaron raises one legal wrinkle that might bolster Romney\u2019s claim. He said it\u2019s possible that Clinton had a reasonable expectation that a committee might want to dig further. Baron said in the private sector, if you think that a future lawsuit might call for certain records, you should keep them.\n\n\"If I were her lawyer, I would have told her that it would be prudent to preserve any evidence that might be subject to a congressional inquiry,\" Baron said.\n\nRegardless of the legal arguments on that score, Baron said he believes that what Clinton did -- stepping down without a department review of her records and then unilaterally deleting some -- was inconsistent with the spirit if not the letter of the Federal Records Act. Cox shares that view, even as he discounts Romney\u2019s statement.\n\n\"Clinton's decision to destroy all emails that she and her private attorneys unilaterally decided were not federal records is both shocking and suspicious,\" Cox said. \"But the problem is that not all of her emails were \u2018subject to recall and review by Congress.\u2019 There is plenty of justifiable criticism for Clinton's actions, but that does not appear to be one of them.\"\n\nRomney said that Clinton \"erased all of her emails even though they were subject to recall and review by Congress.\" Romney got it wrong when he spoke of all of her emails. We know that about 30,000 emails were turned over to the State Department.\n\nRomney\u2019s words about recall and review by Congress are ambiguous. In terms of preserving records, legal experts agree that Congress has no direct role. That is a function of the executive branch. In terms of a congressional investigation, a legal expert told us Clinton did respond to congressional subpoenas, and there is no proof she destroyed evidence subject to a congressional investigation.\n\nRomney\u2019s statement contains an element of truth -- Clinton did delete some emails -- but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
