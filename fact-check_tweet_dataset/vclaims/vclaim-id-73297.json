The claim, however, is false; the video in fact shows Zhang dining in Beijing in 2019.\n\nThe video was published here on Twitter on July 31, 2020. It has been viewed more than 35,700 times.\n\nThe 14-second footage shows several people sitting around a table. Remarks in Mandarin are heard throughout that translate to English as: \u201cIt\u2019s time to eat now! Yay! Let's show everyone our hearty main dishes!\u201d\n\nThe simplified Chinese text superimposed on the video reads: \u201cOpposes the US for work, but lives in the US / Admiral Zhang's family sent greetings from the US!\u201d The logo for Douyin, the Chinese version of the video-sharing platform TikTok, can also be seen embedded in the video.\n\nThe video\u2019s caption, also written in simplified Chinese, reads: \u201cChief Zhang is in the US [when] he should be a member of the Chinese Communist Party and an internet celebrity who hates the US. The US government should expel Zhang Zhaozhong and his family.\u201d\n\nZhang Zhaozhong is a military commentator and a former admiral in China\u2019s People's Liberation Army.\n\nThe video was also shared here, here and here on Twitter alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim, however, is false.\n\nA keyword search found that the original video was published here in August 2019 on Zhang\u2019s official page on Bilibili, the Chinese video sharing website.\n\nThe video\u2019s simplified Chinese headline translates to English as: \u201cChief\u2019s daily -- New food blogger; Strategic Fool-You Agency\u2019s time to eat!\u201d\n\nStrategic Fool-You Agency is reference to a nickname given to him by critics -- \u201cChief of the Strategic Fool-You Agency\u201d -- for his several incorrect predictions about global military events, as per this report by the Chinese state-owned online magazine Sixth Tone.\n\nThe video in the misleading post corresponds to the Bilibili video from its 10-minute and 21-second mark.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison between the video in the misleading tweet (L) and the Bilibili video (R):\n\nAt the Bilibili video\u2019s 45-second mark, Zhang can be heard saying in Mandarin: \u201cMy friends will dine at my house today. I\u2019ll buy something delicious for them.\u201d\n\nThere are also several shop signs seen throughout the video that indicate it was shot in the Chinese capital.\n\nA sign reading \"METRO EXCLUSIVE\" can be seen in the video\u2019s seven-second mark. METRO is a multinational supermarket chain with stores in China.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the video at its seven-second mark, with the store front circled in red by AFP:\n\nThe video\u2019s two-minute and 14-second mark also features a florist\u2019s sign that reads: \u201cGaoshan Jixue Flower Shop\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the video at the two-minute and 14-second mark with the sign circled in red by AFP:\n\nBoth the Gaoshan Jixue florist and METRO store inside Wanquanhe mall in Beijing can be seen on Baidu Maps here and here.\n\nThis 2017 post on the florist's verified Weibo account shows corresponding decoration as seen in the Bilibili video around its two-minute and 17-second mark. The location tag of the nearby METRO superparket is also included in many of its Weibo posts.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the 2017 Weibo post by the Gaoshan Jixue florist, with a location of the METRO supermarket circled in red:\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the Bilibili video at the two-minute and 17-second mark (L) and a photo from the florist's 2017 Weibo post (R), with corresponding decoration:", "lang": "en"}
