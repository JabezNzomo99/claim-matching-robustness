It lauds the bill as one that will direct funding away from abortion providers and calls the hearings on the bill a step toward making 2012 a \"groundbreaking year for Ohio's pro-life movement.\"\n\n \n\n PolitiFact Ohio decided to examine Ohio Right to Life\u2019s claim about public funding of Planned Parenthood, in light of its underlying contention that the funding of the agency supports abortion.\n\n \n\n We asked Michael Gonidakis, executive director for Ohio Right to Life, for specifics on the taxpayer money Planned Parenthood has received. Gonidakis said state agencies disbursed the federal grants, authorizing more than $1.6 million in 2010 to Planned Parenthood locations in Ohio and more than $1.7 million this year.\n\n \n\n He also provided a memo the nonpartisan Ohio Legislative Service Commission prepared detailing state agencies\u2019 disbursement of federal grants to Planned Parenthood branches in Ohio. LSC compiled the information for Rep. Kristina Roegner, a Republican from Hudson who is a primary sponsor on companion legislation introduced in the House to defund Planned Parenthood. Roegner\u2019s office confirmed the memo\u2019s authenticity.\n\n \n\n Tara Broderick, president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Northeast Ohio, said the organization does receive federal grant money. But none of that money pays for abortions, she said.\n\n \n\n \"A huge myth,\" Broderick said. \"Absolutely I can say taxpayer money is not used for abortion services,\" she said.\n\n \n\n Planned Parenthood must sign an agreement affirming it will not use taxpayer money to provide, promote or refer abortion services, said a spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Health, which distributes the bulk of federal grant money that Planned Parenthood receives. Additionally, an audit is performed to account for the organization\u2019s use of government dollars, Broderick said.\n\n \n\n According to Planned Parenthood, the vast majority of its clients receive health care services such as Pap tests, birth control and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. Less than 4 percent of Ohio Planned Parenthood clients received an abortion, the organization stated.\n\n \n\n Nationally, Planned Parenthood performed 332,278 abortion procedures in 2009, the most recent year data was available. Those procedures made up 3 percent of the organization\u2019s services, according to a Planned Parenthood fact sheet that was last updated in October.\n\n \n\n Gonidakis, of Ohio Right to Life, acknowledged that the federal Hyde Amendment and state law prohibits tax dollars for paying for abortions.\n\n \n\n \"However, the significant public dollars Planned Parenthood does receive keeps them afloat and pays for pretty much their entire operations,\" he said in an e-mail.\n\n \n\n Not true, said Broderick, of Planned Parenthood of Northeast Ohio. She said the federal dollars make up 16 percent of the branch\u2019s budget.\n\n \n\n So where does that leave us?\n\n \n\n Ohio Right to Life is correct to say that Planned Parenthood locations in Ohio have received millions in federal grants. But the connection between Planned Parenthood\u2019s federal funding and its abortion services is not as direct as Ohio Right to Life\u2019s news release implies.\n\n \n\n Federal law bars Planned Parenthood from using taxpayer money for abortions, and the agency must certify to the state that it does not do so. The money that would be redirected by S.B. 201 is used to provide other health services.\n\n \n\n Ohio Right to Life\u2019s claim about funding for Planned Parenthood is accurate.\n\n \n\n That the money cannot be used for abortions and that abortion procedures make up a small percentage of Planned Parenthood services are additional pieces of information that provide the full picture.\n\n \n\n We rate the statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
