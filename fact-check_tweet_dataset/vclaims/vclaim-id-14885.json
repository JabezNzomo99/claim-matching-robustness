Comments to the post seemed to believe the story, with majority of the comments slamming Gutoc for her supposed threat. Rappler spotted the post via Crowdtangle, one of its channels for fact-checking.\n\nThe facts: The story in question is fake. The Inquirer did not publish a story with this headline, as clarified by the news organization in its April 14 article.\n\nThe screenshot posted in the Facebook group is instead a manipulated version of Lalu's April 12 story on Gutoc telling her critics that wearing a life vest wrong is better than having wrong principles.\n\n\n\nThe statement was in response to criticisms Gutoc received when she and her fellow Otso Diretso candidates stood beside a jetski at the Masinloc Fish port in Zambales to remind President Rodrigo Duterte of his promise to assert Philippine rights over the West Philippine Sea.\n\nFAKE NEWS ALERT!!! This is not like me at all, hahaha. Sadya po talagang may mga taong sinungaling na nagkakalat ng fake news. At may mga sinungaling na hindi dapat binoboto para sa Senado.

This is not like me at all. Sadya po talagang may mga taong sinungaling na nagkakalat ng fake news. At may mga sinungaling na hindi dapat binoboto para sa Senado (There are really some liars who are spreading false news. And there are liars who should not be voted for the Senate),\u201d Gutoc clarified in a tweet.\n\nMeanwhile, the Facebook group Cruelty of Noynoy \u201cAbnoy\u201d Aquino and His Government claims to be a group about the \u201ctruth\u201d on Aquino's administration. It has, as of this writing, a total of 22,817 members. \u2013 Addie Pobre/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
