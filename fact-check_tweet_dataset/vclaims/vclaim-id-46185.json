Duterte is the kind of leader who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way. Filipinos are very fortunate to have him. Seriously, he looked so overworked. He may not be perfect, but he truly loves his country. Philippines doesn\u2019t have the worst government. It actually has the worst citizens,\u201d the graphic quoted Queen Elizabeth II as saying.\n\nThe graphic was dated April 6, 2020. A brief description below the statement said the quote came from the Queen\u2019s speech that day as she delivered \u201ca message of hope amid the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d\n\nSeveral readers emailed the graphic to Rappler for verification. Claim Check, Facebook\u2019s monitoring tool that identifies potentially dubious posts on the platform, flagged multiple posts from different pages and accounts. The earliest post was shared on April 6.\n\nThe Queen addressed the United Kingdom amid the coronavirus pandemic on April 6, but there was no mention of Duterte in her speech. The full broadcast of her address can be found here.\n\nThe original quote of Queen Elizabeth from Inquirer.net\u2019s graphic was: \u201cThis time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal... We will succeed \u2013 and that success will belong to every one of us.\n\nFake quotes have been a common type of disinformation spread during the coronavirus pandemic. Other personalities that became a victim of this were Senator Kiko Pangilinan, Vice President Leni Robredo, and Senator Risa Hontiveros.\n\nIn 2018, Queen Elizabeth II was falsely quoted as saying that Donald Trump should follow Duterte\u2019s footsteps. In 2019, we also debunked a fake letter from Jovito Salonga to former President Corazon Aquino that was supposedly signed by the Queen. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
