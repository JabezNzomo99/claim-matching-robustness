The way it is, is wrong,\u201d she said, comparing the current process to her experience in 1993, when she was confirmed in a 96-3 vote. \u201cI wish I could wave a magic wand and have it go back to the way it was.\u201d\n\nIf Ginsburg, who was nominated by then-President Bill Clinton, were to step down, her vacancy would present Trump with an opportunity to nominate another justice to the highest court \u2014 further deepening the conservative majority achieved through Kavanaugh\u2019s addition.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nBerman, Dan. \u201cGinsburg suggests she has at least five more years on the Supreme Court.\u201d CNN. 21 Aug 2018.", "lang": "en"}
