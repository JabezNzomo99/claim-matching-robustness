The posts claim \u201c20 Indian people died\u201d and \u201c60 Chinese died\u201d. The claim is false; the video has circulated online since at least late May 2020; media reports of a clash between Indian and Chinese troops along the Himalayan frontier on June 16 stated that at least 20 Indian soldiers died, but did not mention any Chinese casualties.\n\nThe video was published here on Twitter on June 17, 2020. It has been viewed more than 50,000 times.\n\nThe 19-second footage is filmed near a lake in a mountainous area and shows a group of soldiers shouting and throwing rocks.\n\nThe video, captioned in both simplified Chinese and English characters, translates to English as: \u201cWorld war III\n\n\u201cToday's stone fight at the China-Indian border.\n\n \u201cAn Indian army colonel was said to be killed.\n\n \u201c20 Indian people died.\n\n \u201c60 Chinese died with several injured.\u201d\n\nThe same footage was also shared alongside similar claims on Facebook here, on YouTube here and on Weibo here.\n\nOn June 16, at least 20 Indian soldiers were killed in deadly clashes between Indian and Chinese border troops, as AFP reported here.\n\nHowever, the claim about the footage is false.\n\nA reverse image search of keyframes extracted from the footage found this longer video published on YouTube on May 31, 2020.\n\nThe same footage can be seen from the YouTube video\u2019s one-minute and 36-second mark.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison between the misleading footage (L) and the YouTube video (R):\n\nThe same video was also published here and here on YouTube in late May 2020.\n\nETtoday, a Taiwanese news site, published screenshots from the footage here on June 2, 2020.\n\nThe article\u2019s traditional Chinese-language headline translates to English as: \u201cZhao Lijian responded to the border conflict between China and India: Overall \"stable and controllable\" / Can properly solve two countries' problem\u201d.\n\nThe article reads in part: \u201cRecently, a video supposedly showing a group of People's Liberation Army soldiers being attacked by another group of Indian soldiers in Pangong Tso has been widely spread on the Internet, which shows that the conflict between China and Indian has intensified again.\u201d\n\nPangong Tso is a lake that runs across the territories of both India and China.\n\nThe video was also cited in Indian media in May 2020; for example by Indian newspaper ThePrint here and Indian television channel CNN-News18 here. Indian Army said the video was \u201cnot authenticated\u201d, according to both reports.", "lang": "en"}
