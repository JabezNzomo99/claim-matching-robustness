The video was shared on Twitter. The claim around the video is false. Firstly, the video is not from Rajasthan but Brazil. Secondly, the incident is not of Muslim men killing Hindu girl. But of a 19-year-old Brazilian woman who was killed in 2018 by a rival drug gang. We reverse searched the video which led us to an article published by New Straits Times in 2018. The article is titled as \u2018Police: Viral video of woman being beheaded nothing to do with Sarawak murder.\u2019 The article mentioned that the video had gone viral in Malaysia and police had denied that it was from Malaysia. Rather, the police reportedly stated that the incident is from a country in South America.\n\nConsequently, we did a search on TweetDeck, a dashboard application for management of Twitter accounts using keywords \u2018girl beheaded stabbed.\u2019 This led us to a tweet which suggested that the video is from Brazil. If I'm not mistaken, it's a video from January 2018 whereby a chubby lady was beheaded and stabbed simultaneously. The criminals were members of a drug cartel wanted in Brazil. The girl was also from a separate gang. \u2014 Adedamola Bello (@Adedamola_Bells) June 4, 2019 Further, taking a cue from the tweet, we searched on Google that led us to an article which had the name of the woman ie Deborah Bessa. On searching more, we found an article on the same incident by G1, a Brazilian news portal on 30 January 2018. The article mentioned that the 19-year-old woman had gone missing on 9 January 2018. Her family found her in Rio Branco on 13 January 2018. Google search led us to an article published by G1 in 2018. On 26 January 2018, the police stated that it had used the decapitation video which it found on a seized cell phone, to find the people who were responsible for the incident. She was allegedly killed by people from a rival drug gang. As per G1, Cristiano Bastos, investigating officer said that two people were responsible for the execution and three people filmed the incident. He told G1, \u201cDeborah was a rival faction and there are indications that she has participated in crimes against the faction that she was executed.
