Earthquakes cannot be predicted, according to the United States Geological Survey.\n\nThe claim circulated after Tropical Cyclone Kyarr lashed coastal parts of Yemen and Oman and UAE's east coast in the week of October 25. According to CNN reports dated October 29, Kyarr \u201creached the intensity of a Category 4 hurricane, becoming the strongest storm recorded in the [Arabian Sea] for 12 years.\u201d\n\nIn a separate report by tribune.com.pk, the online site of Pakistan-based newspaper The Express Tribune, satellite imagery issued by the Pakistan Meteorological Department showed it \u201cposed no major risk to any coastal areas of Pakistan.\u201d The weather bureau tracked the movement of Kyarr in real-time and issued warnings posted on this page. The latest advisory was October 31.\n\nThe articles only reported about the forecast of rainfall in Dubai and Abu Dhabi since November marks the onset of more frequent rain in the Emirates. The articles do not mention the strongest tropical cyclone or earthquake that could trigger a tsunami and landslides in any Middle East country.\n\nThe earthquakes that recently hit the Middle East were neither devastating nor recorded as the strongest: Oman felt a mild earthquake on November 4; the United Arab Emirates felt a magnitude 5.1 tremor that struck Iran in October 2019; a magnitude 5.9 earthquake that hit southwest Iran was felt in Kuwait in July 2019; and a magnitude 6.2 earthquake struck Yemen in July 2018.", "lang": "en"}
