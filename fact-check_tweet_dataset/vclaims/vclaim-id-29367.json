The poll wasn\u2019t a forecast, YouGov said nothing about the results in specific seats, and you can\u2019t reliably predict how local seats will vote in an election based on a national poll.\n\nThe figures are based on a YouGov poll\n\nYouGov conducted a survey last week which asked over 2,000 adults in Great Britain who they would vote for in the event of several different hypothetical scenarios.\n\nOne such scenario involved a Corbyn-led Labour Party standing on an election platform of delivering an alternative Brexit deal, which would keep Britain in the customs union. The scenario also had Boris Johnson as Conservative leader, Jo Swinson for the Lib Dems and Nigel Farage for the Brexit Party.\n\nOn a national scale, the poll suggested this platform would result in Labour losing 39% of its 2017 voters to the Lib Dems and ending up with only 17% of the vote overall, behind the Brexit Party (19%), the Conservatives (24%) and the Lib Dems (30%).\n\nThe first thing to note is that this is not a typical survey of voting intention: the poll unusually set out a 100-word hypothetical scenario before asking respondents who they would vote for.\n\nIt\u2019s also misleading to present any results from this survey as a \u201cforecast\u201d, as the Islington Liberal Democrats did, because it assumes that the given hypothetical scenario will be the case at the time of the next election.\n\nThere\u2019s another big problem with using the poll to make predictions about specific parliamentary constituencies.\n\nFlavible, a polling website that is not affiliated with YouGov, extrapolated the survey\u2019s national results and localised them to give a projection for each Westminster seat in England, Wales and Scotland.\n\nFor Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s seat of Islington North, the website projected that in the event of the scenario mentioned above, the Liberal Democrats would win 31.3% of the vote to Labour\u2019s 30.1%.\n\nThis would be a significant change from the 2017 election, when Mr Corbyn won the seat with 73% of the vote and the Lib Dems came third with 9%.\n\nThe main problem here is that you can\u2019t reliably convert national polling results into local areas.\n\nFlavible\u2019s stated methodology is a \u2018weighted swing\u2019, whereby changes in support for the parties at the national level are applied to each constituency, with the numbers weighted by things like which way the seat voted in the Brexit referendum and whether it changed hands in either of the last two elections.\n\nThe evidence suggests that this does not always yield reliable results. For example, a localisation of a YouGov poll from 26 June suggested the Brexit Party would win nearly 25% of the vote in Islington North.\n\nThis contrasts sharply with the vote share that the Brexit Party is estimated to have secured among Islington North constituents in the European elections on 22 May\u2014around 9%.", "lang": "en"}
