Trump made that statement after the San Bernardino, Calif., attacks.\n\nThe video calls for American Muslims to leave the United States and join the terrorist group, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThis spring, Newsweek also reported that an ISIS video released in the wake of the Brussels attack featured an audio clip of Trump speaking about Brussels.\n\n\"Brussels was one of the great cities, one of the most beautiful cities of the world 20 years ago. It was amazing, actually, and safe. And now it's a horror show. It's an absolute horror show,\" Trump says in the video, as ISIS lets the phrase \"absolute horror show\" repeatedly echo and fade.\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign sent us a Politico story about that video, pointing out that it also features \"English subtitles, musical accompaniment and a song of sorts, with the lyrics: \u2018Brothers rise up! Claim your victory! Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go for jihad.\u2019 \"\n\nHer campaign also pointed to Foreign Affairs and Time articles reporting that an ISIS spokesman wrote on ISIS-affiliated channel, \"I ask Allah to deliver America to Trump.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign did not return requests for comment.\n\nClinton is right about the Trump\u2019s comments being incorporated into propaganda, but it\u2019s difficult to know what effect his words have had on recruitment, said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\n\"Obviously, we know less about how effective his comments have been as a recruiting tool -- reliable data is hard to come by,\" Gartenstein-Ross said. \"But that is how it's being used.\"\n\nClinton said, \"you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists' sites and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters.\"\n\nAn East African affiliate of the al-Qaida terrorist group has used a video clip of Trump in one of its videos, telling \"Muslims of the West\" that they are not welcome in countries like the United States and urging them to join the terrorist group, according to multiple news reports.\n\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to determine how effective the videos are, at least one has featured Trump\u2019s words.
