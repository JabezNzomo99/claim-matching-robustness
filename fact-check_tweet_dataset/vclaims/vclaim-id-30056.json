The website is run by Pamela Geller, an activist who co-founded Stop Islamization of America, a far-right group.\n\nThis is just one of many false statements circulating on social media at what appears to be a break-neck pace \u2013 far faster than the spread of the health threat itself.\n\nThis latest post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nFirst, the Geller Report article is questionably sourced. It says that a guy named Bill Holter heard from a friend named Robert who heard from an American friend who heard from a Chinese friend who has relatives in Wuhan that \"there may already be ~10,000 dead there from the virus.\"\n\nBut here\u2019s what we know from credible sources about the Wuhan coronavirus:\n\nAccording to a Jan. 26 report from the World Health Organization, more than 2,000 people have contracted the virus, the vast majority of whom live in China. More than 100 people in the United States are being evaluated for possible infection. According to the New York Times, 81 people have died, all of them in China.\n\nThe figure of 81 deaths was also reported by CBS News and other media.\n\nAs of 7 p.m. Eastern on Jan. 27, the figure reported by Johns Hopkins University, which is mapping the virus, was 82\n\nHowever, as we were putting this fact-check together, Agence France-Presse, in a report carried by CBS, said the death toll, according to Chinese authorities, had reached 106.\n\nThe South China Morning Post also reported the 106 figure and attributed it to Chinese authorities.\n\nSo, while the death toll appears to be climbing, the Geller Report story is way, way off.\n\nA claim circulating on Facebook says: \"CORONAVIRUS: Reports of 10,000 DEAD in Wuhan, China.\"\n\nThere is nothing but mostly anonymous hearsay to back it up.\n\nCredible news and university reports put the death toll at a tiny fraction of what is claimed \u2014 106 as of the evening of Jan. 27.\n\nWe rate the statement Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
