He said he does not want to interfere with the ongoing Russia investigation led by Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III.\n\n\u201cI told Bob Mueller Tuesday that I would never do anything wittingly or unwittingly that veered over into his lane,\u201d Gowdy told a group of reporters on June 23. \u201cHis lane is broad and is undetermined at this point.\u201d\n\nHowever, Gowdy is also a member the House Intelligence Committee, which is still investigating Russia\u2019s meddling in the election, as well as potential ties between Russian officials and Trump associates.\n\nWorld Politicus credited its story about Gowdy to the Washington Examiner, which did not report that he ended the Russia investigation.\n\nInstead, the Examiner wrote that \u201cGowdy criticized the Trump administration for the ongoing \u2018drip, drip\u2019 of Russia-related revelations that escalated this week when the president\u2019s son admitted he met with a Kremlin-linked attorney who promised damaging information on Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nThe Examiner quoted Gowdy as saying: \u201cSomeone close to the president needs to get everyone connected with that campaign in a room and say, \u2018From the time you saw Dr. Zhivago until the moment you drank vodka with a guy named Boris, you list every single one of those and we\u2019re going to turn them over to the special counsel,\u2019 because this drip, drip, drip is undermining the credibility of this administration.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve written before that it is important to read beyond a provocative headline, especially when a story sounds unbelievable. The story headlined \u201cTrey Gowdy Ends The Russia Investigation ONCE AND FOR ALL\u201d is an example. It has no facts to back it up.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nForan, Clare. \u201cTrey Gowdy Tapped to Take Over as House Oversight Chair.\u201d The Atlantic. 8 Jun 2017.\n\nWong, Scott. \u201cGowdy won\u2019t use Oversight gavel to probe Russia.\u201d The Hill. 23 Jun 2017.\n\nKim, Kyle, and Krishnakumar, Priya. \u201cA guide to every Russia investigation happening right now.\u201d Los Angeles Times. 14 Jun 2017, accessed 25 Jul 2017.", "lang": "en"}
