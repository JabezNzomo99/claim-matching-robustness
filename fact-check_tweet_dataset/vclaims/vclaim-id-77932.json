Steve Contorno, an editor for the Tampa Bay Times, shared an image of the sparsely attended rally that was then altered and posted by a social media user using the name \u201cLudger,\u201d who claimed that it was the \u201cofficial video released by the White House.\u201d\n\nTwitter users retweeted the fake images, claiming they were doctored by the White House to \u201cmake the crowd bigger.\u201d In a comment on the original post, Ludger confirmed that the altered image was meant as a joke.\n\n\u201cI figured that by using Paint (no Photoshop was harmed in the production) the resulting edits would be so obvious that EVERYONE would immediately recognize it as a joke, chuckle and move on,\u201d Ludger wrote. \u201cBut this has been eye-opening.\u201d\n\nThe photo was reportedly flagged and removed for violating Facebook\u2019s community standards as being fake, but remained on Twitter at the time of publication.\n\nTrump also caused a riffle in the Twitter community on Aug. 3 when he mistyped \u201cFlorida\u201d in a tweet referring to his rallies in \u201cTexas and Frorida\u201d:\n\nSnopes received a number of queries regarding the authenticity of the misspelled presidential tweet after it was widely shared on social media. An archived version showed that the tweet had been posted in the morning and remained online for nearly six hours before being deleted and replaced with a similar tweet, sans typo.", "lang": "en"}
