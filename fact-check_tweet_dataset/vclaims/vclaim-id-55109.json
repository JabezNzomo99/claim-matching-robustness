No, there is no evidence to support this. A video by Dr. Carrie Madej making many claims about vaccines includes \"urgent information\" about \"the coming vaccine\" for COVID-19. But there is no current vaccine available to the public, and those in the works have not completed trials to be mass-distributed.\n\nMadej's various claims can be found in a video posted to YouTube on June 25, 2020, titled \"Urgent information on Covid Vacc!ne\" (archived here). The text below the video included this text, as well as links to research:\n\nClick below to watch the video on YouTube:\n\nThe video can also be found on Facebook from July 18, 2020:\n\nMuch of the 22-minute video from Madej, an internist who says she is trained on osteopathic medicine, talks about the dangers of vaccines. But she also says that she has information that needs to be widely shared online.\n\nSo who is she? According to the Georgia Composite Medical Board, she is licensed to practice internal medicine with her license current through March 2021, and she practices in Forest Park, Georgia. US News & World Report, in its Health section information on doctors, gives this background for Madej. Here is her LinkedIn profile.\n\nAmong other things, Madej asserts that big pharmaceutical companies, along with the military's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency -- DARPA -- and Bill Gates are behind a vaccine effort that could ultimately track our every movement and every thought and rewire the human genome with the potential for a new species to be generated. \n\n\n\nMadej's video also claims that artificial intelligence technology is being created to insert into human brains so people could, for example, control smart homes with their thoughts -- but with the caution that these homes could turn and control the people. This story, however, talks about brain-reading threads to help people, not control them:\n\nThe video also says that, backed by Gates and others, chips and gels are being developed to work with contact-tracing apps, putting onto, or implanting in, people to track their comings, goings and thoughts -- even menstrual cycles or our sex lives -- under the guise of developing a vaccine to battle the virus. Gates, the subject of many theories surrounding vaccines and COVID-19, denied on July 22, 2020, that he planned to microchip humans through a vaccine or other tech.\n\nThe video states that vaccines being tested are being rushed to market so quickly to arrest the coronavirus that normal testing procedures are being skipped -- making them unreliable and possibly harmful. But there are no approved vaccines currently on the market. In the video, she borrows some old conspiracy theories while pressing for widespread social media attention to the piece.\n\nWe'll start around the 5-minute mark, when she talks about how engineering foods, much like the company Monsanto does with seeds for, as an example, tomatoes, is similar to how vaccines and genetic engineering can wholesale change a human into something that isn't actually human -- but could be patented and, therefore, owned.\n\nAt 5:37, she says:\n\nThere is no evidence that any company trying to develop a vaccine or trying to genetically alter humans so that they can be patented and owned by anyone or anything. This would include Pfizer, which July 22 announced along with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense a $1.95 billion contract to provide its potential vaccine to the government for possible distribution around the country. From the HHS site:\n\nIn the video, Madej claims that Gates -- co-founder of Microsoft, philanthropist and vaccine proponent -- backs or is associated with most major companies trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine. She gives no evidence of this, but it is no secret that Gates' foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has donated hundreds of millions to develop vaccines to battle the novel coronavirus.\n\nThere is no claim by the government or any agency that \"everyone\" would have to be injected with any potential vaccine.\n\nAt 7:12, she says:\n\nAgain, she offers no evidence that the makers of the potential vaccines are ignoring all scientific protocol under Operation Warp Speed, which is the Trump administration's plan to quickly develop a vaccine. And again, there is no evidence -- anywhere -- that people's right to refuse vaccinations would be ignored as \"they want to inject it into everybody.\"\n\nAt 11:45, she says:\n\nThere is no justification for making such a claim with vaccines being developed for COVID-19. This is just supposition on her part.\n\nIn the last seven minutes of the video, Madej gets into gels, implants and AI-powered databases that could control people, as well as a potentially new species developing out of a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nIt is a question whose answer is yet unknown because no such tech exists on the market, though DARPA is working on interfaces to, for example, help with brains communicating with prosthesis limbs through the BRAIN Initiative under the National Institutes of Health.\n\nAt 16:18, she talks about \"next-gen non-surgical nanotechnology\":\n\nThis has been debunked by Health Feedback as early as May 15, 2020:\n\nPolitiFact also debunked a similar claim that Gates was behind RNA vaccines to permanently alter people's DNA -- a claim that can be found in this article from Waking Times (which later added a correction).\n\nAnd studies indicate RNA vaccines are safe and effective, something that Gates wrote in his blog in April, mostly about RNA vaccines, has him \"excited\" about their potential to fight the pandemic.\n\nAt 20:17, she says:\n\nThis claim is not based in any science that Lead Stories has found.\n\nMadej's final claim comes at 20:32, where she says the new vaccine(s) would also be:\n\nLead Stories has written about ID2020, and we have debunked claims it has to do with microchipping people to track everything humans do:\n\nFact Check: Bill Gates Will NOT Personally Profit From A COVID-19 Vaccine And He Does Not Own A Company That Will Put A Tracking Microchip In You", "lang": "en"}
