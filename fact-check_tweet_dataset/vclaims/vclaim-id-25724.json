The claim is false; the video is four years old and shows a clash between protesting teachers from Islamic seminaries and local police in Patna, the capital city of India\u2019s eastern Bihar state.\n\nThe video, which is one minute and two seconds long, was shared here on Facebook on July 7, 2019, where it has been viewed more than 18,000 times.\n\nA Hindi-language caption translates into English as: \"Distribution of sweets started in Kashmir.\"\n\nSweets are often given out in India after religious rituals are performed; the term is apparently being used ironically in this context.\n\nThe Indian government rescinded the autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir on August 5 and put the state in lockdown, as described in this AFP report.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe video has also been shared elsewhere on Facebook, for example here, here and here alongside the same claim.\n\nThe same video was widely shared a year ago with similar claims in multiple Facebook posts, for example here, here and here.\n\nThe claim is false; the video shows a clash between protesting teachers from Islamic seminaries and local police in Patna city of the eastern Indian state of Bihar in August 2015.\n\nThe words \u201cGardanibagh Police Station\u201d are written in Hindi on a red and blue sign at the video\u2019s 35 second mark. The sign is highlighted in yellow in the screenshot below:\n\n\u2018Traffic Police Patna\u2019 is also written in Hindi on another sign, highlighted in green in the screenshot below.\n\nGardanibagh is in the centre of Patna city, where government buildings and the chief minister\u2019s residence is located.\n\nA Google search using the keywords, \u2018Police beat protesters and Gardanibagh\u2019, found multiple video and text reports with the same footage.\n\nA video report was published here on YouTube by news channel India TV on August 27, 2015.\n\n\u201cWatch this video as Madrasa teachers got injured in police lathi-charge during the protest in Patna,\u201d says a description alongside the video.\n\nA lathi-charge refers to a manoeuver involving police running forward wielding sticks to disperse a group of people.\n\nThe incident was also reported on media outlet \u201cIndia\u201d, alongside a screenshot of the video from the same day. A screenshot of the article is shown below:\n\n\u201cBihar: Madrasa (Islamic seminaries) teachers protest against government for non-payment of dues; police resort to lathicharge,\u201d reads the headline of the report.\n\nBelow is a comparison between a screenshot from the video in the misleading post (L) and in the India news outlet (R).\n\nThe Times of India also reported on the police action against the protesters, who were demanding the refurbishment of thousands of madrasas in Bihar.\n\nThe first paragraph reads: \u201cPolice resorted to lathicharge on Thursday on the supporters of the All India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat (AIMMM) and madrassa teachers. They were protesting at the Gardanibagh stadium but allegedly tried to go to the CM\u2019s house to meet him when they were stopped by the police. Many of them were injured in the lathicharge\u201d.\n\n\u201cCM\u2019s house\u201d is a reference to the official residence of the chief minister.", "lang": "en"}
