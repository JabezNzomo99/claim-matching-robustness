COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, does not appear on that list, however.\n\n\u201cAt this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks,\u201d states the CDC. (RELATED: Does This Video Show Defective Medical Gowns Made In China?)\n\nThe World Health Organization also addresses the claim on its myth busters page, saying, \u201cTo date, there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.\u201d\n\nFor a mosquito to transmit a pathogen from one host to another, it must suck blood from an infected host and become infected itself in the salivary glands. The pathogen must \u201cbe highly specialized to survive within both a host animal or human and within the mosquito\u201d to transmit via the saliva that the mosquito injects when it bites, Montana State University entomology professor Dr. Robert Peterson explained in an email to the Daily Caller.\n\n\u201cThere is no scientific evidence that the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has this ability,\u201d Peterson added.", "lang": "en"}
