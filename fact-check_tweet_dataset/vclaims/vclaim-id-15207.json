Kennedy and Donald Trump.\n\nWhile the quotes from Kennedy and Trump are legitimate, the saying attributed to Lincoln does not appear in any of his written works. The expression was written about Lincoln, extolling his character, years after his death.\n\nIn an attempt to compare Trump\u2019s rhetoric to that of well-regarded presidents, Proud Liberal Americans posted all three quotations, one beneath the other, to its Facebook page.\n\nThe quotes from Kennedy and Trump are genuine. Kennedy delivered the famous expression during his inaugural address, and the Trump quote comes from remarks given during a Michigan campaign rally. However, there\u2019s no evidence that the third quote belongs to the nation\u2019s 16th president.\n\nForbes and author J.K. Rowling have also attributed the quotation to Lincoln in the past, despite the fact that neither the saying, nor any variation of it, appears in Lincoln\u2019s completed works. Forbes did not immediately respond to a press inquiry.\n\nIt does, though, appear in literature written about Lincoln\u2019s presidency, and it seems that some took an expression written about Lincoln and began attributing the phrase to the man himself.\n\nIn a piece published in 1883, years after Lincoln\u2019s death, author Robert Ingersoll wrote, \u201cNothing discloses real character like the use of power. It is easy for the weak to be gentle. Most people can bear adversity. But if you wish to know what a man really is, give him power. This is the supreme test. It is the glory of Lincoln that, having almost absolute power, he never used it, except upon the side of mercy.\u201d\n\nIn author Horatio Alger Jr.\u2019s 1883 biography, \u201cThe Boyhood and Manhood of Abraham Lincoln,\u201d he quoted an unknown person as saying, \u201cIf you want to find out what a man is to the bottom, give him power. Any man can stand adversity \u2013 only a great man can stand prosperity. It is the glory of Abraham Lincoln that he never abused power only on the side of mercy.\u201d\n\nAlger may have been inspired by Ingersoll\u2019s writings on the president, according to the website Quote Investigator.", "lang": "en"}
