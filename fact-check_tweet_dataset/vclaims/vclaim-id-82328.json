It has been claimed that this incident happened after Congress was voted to power in the state. The message circulating along with the video claims that local police is not initiating action against the perpetrators as they belong to the Muslim community and the incident occurred in a Muslim-majority area.\n\nSeveral individual Facebook and YouTube users have posted this video with the identical narrative.\n\nAlt News broke the video into multiple key-frames using Invid, a chrome extension, which were then used to perform a reverse image search on Google. Reverse searching the images, we found that the people seen in the video were mourning the martyrdom of late constable Hansraj Gurjar of the BSF. Gurjar was killed in firing along the International Border in the Chamliyal post area of Samba district in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nA photo-story published by News 18had captioned the picture of the devastated woman as Manju Devi, the wife of the martyr. It reported that a huge crowd had gathered in the ancestral village of Mugalpur, Rajasthan to give a final salute to the martyr\u2019s body and that the health condition of Manju had worsened.\n\nAn article published by The Hindustan Times on June 14, 2018 reported that Gurjar\u2019s 15-day-old son had to lit his pyre as his wife was inconsolable. \u201cHans Raj was supposed to come to his village June 14 to participate in Kuala Pujan ceremony of his infant son on June 15. Even after receiving the news of his son\u2019s death, a 70-year-old Rameshwar Gurjar said that he will send his grandson to the army,\u201d stated the report. We also found a video posted on YouTube in June 2018, titled, \u201cHansraj Gurjar Bansur, \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u092e\u093e\u0901 \u0915\u0940 \u091c\u092f, \u091c\u092f \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926 \u091c\u092f \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u201d. SMHoaxslayer had earlier fact-checked this claim.\n\nA six-month-old video of a family mourning at the tragic loss of a martyr was falsely passed off as mourning over the death of a Hindu girl raped by perpetrators belonging to the Muslim community. In the last one year, misinformation has been weaponised and used to target minorities in India. (Read this compilation by Alt News). Another popular narrative on social media is of Hindus under threat after Congress assumed power in the three Hindi-heartland states in the recently held assembly elections.", "lang": "en"}
