The story says the rounds disappeared during President Barack Obama\u2019s presidency and were recently discovered in Afghanistan.\n\n\"2 million rounds of ammo that \u2018went missing\u2019 under Obama turns up in enemy hands,\" states the Nov. 13 headline in world-newss.com.\n\nOne of many signs that the article is fake is that the website misspelled \"news.\" We left a comment on the website and did not hear a reply. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to combat fake news.\n\nThe article lists as its source a Nov. 9 article from defense-usa.club, another known peddler of deliberately false news stories.\n\nThe article attributes the information to \"an insider report from the office of the Quartermaster at the Pentagon.\" It states that the ammunition went missing in 2010 and was recently recovered by U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The article quoted Brig. General George Mason\u2019s assistant chief of staff: \"This was a huge violation of the public trust, not to mention an incredibly bold theft from the U.S. taxpayer. Sources say the Taliban paid nearly a dollar a round. Someone in Obama\u2019s circle pocketed that money.\"\n\nAll of that, however, appears to be made up.\n\nWe searched news accounts and found no mentions of missing ammunition discovered in Afghanistan. Major Adrian J.T. Rankine-Galloway, a Pentagon spokesman, told PolitiFact that there hasn\u2019t been a recent discovery of 2 million U.S. rounds of ammunition in Afghanistan.\n\nTo top it off, \"We're not aware of a Brigadier General George Mason in any position of responsibility in Afghanistan,\" Rankine-Galloway said. \"There's no such thing as \u2018the Quartermaster at the Pentagon.\u2019 \"\n\nThere is no evidence that 2 million rounds of U.S. ammunition went missing and were discovered in Afghanistan.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
