In the midst of the Coronavirus pandemic, it is mandatory for every individual to wear masks.\n\nWith the help of keywords \u2018Protest Mohali Article 370\u2019, we found a video on YouTube which was uploaded on September 15, 2019, claiming that 15,000 people protested in Punjab against the removal of Article 370 in Kashmir and raised fierce slogans against the Modi government.\n\nWe found the same video on BBC News Punjabi claiming that different organisations of workers, students and farmers came together in solidarity with people in Kashmir on the issue of abolishing Article 370. These organisations had announced holding a protest in Mohali on September 15. However, the administration had refused permission for it.\n\nBy matching the frame of the viral video and video of 2019 of the man wearing a blue checked shirt who is pointing out his finger, we can clearly see the man in both frames is same.\n\nOur further investigation took us to a news article on Indian Express dated September 16, 2019.\n\nOn comparing another snapshot of a woman protestor wearing a yellow coloured top, we can clearly see that the woman in the viral video and the picture on Indian Express are the same.\n\nIn conclusion, with the help of the above information, it has been proved that the video of Punjab protest is old and is resurfaced to mislead the masses.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
