The ball is followed by several other balls painted in Belarus\u2019 flag colours, representing the protesting common man.\n\nThe caption to one such video uploaded on Twitter reads, \u201cThis Belarus protest is like wow\u201d.\n\nSeveral people on the internet perceived this video as a scene from the ongoing unrest in Belarus.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is not real. It is a computer graphics made using visual effects software.\n\nThe video is also viral on Facebook and YouTube.\n\nThe archived versions of the post can be seen here, here and here.\n\nWith an advanced keyword search on Twitter, we found the official Twitter account of BBC_HaveYourSay enquiring about the authenticity of a similar video uploaded by Twitter user Janek Lasocki.\n\nThe Twitter user replied: \"It was made by a special effects artist based in St Petersburg called Alexander Ivanov.\"\n\nThe artist's Instagram account was also shared in the reply to BBC's question.\n\nTaking clues from this, we found that the same video in question was posted on August 19, 2020, with the caption \"You shall not pass, Lukashenko!\" on the Instagram page of Alexander Ivanov, a filmmaker and VFX artist based in St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\nWe can also see the artist's Instagram handle (@jilrock1) marked in the video.\n\nWhen AFWA reached out to Ivanov, he confirmed to us that the video is not real and was only a symbolic representation of the ongoing protests in Belarus.\n\n\u201cThe video was not captured on the ground. I created it using computer graphics. The portrait of President Alexander Lukashenko used in the video was given to me by Boris Groh, an artist based out of Ukraine,\u201d Ivanov said.\n\nWe also found the portrait of Alexander Lukashenko used in the video on the Instagram page of Groh.\n\nHence, the viral video is not of the ongoing protests in Belarus but is a computer graphics made using special effects by a VFX artist from Russia as a symbolic representation of the protest.", "lang": "en"}
