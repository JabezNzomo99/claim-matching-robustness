The baby zebra, named Tira, had proved a hit online and claims that she had been sold met with dismay from Kenyan social media users. But an online tip-off and some expert help have allowed us to confirm that these pictures show a different zebra altogether. Kenyan wildlife authorities say rumours of a sale are \u201ccompletely false\u201d.\n\nTira was spotted in the Maasai Mara in mid-September, to the delight of the national and international media. AFP recorded a video of the foal, which was named after the owner of the bushcamp where it was spotted.\n\nLast week, rumours began spreading that the polka-dot zebra had been captured, placed in a truck and transported out of the Mara to be sold. One post on a private Kenyan Facebook group shared a screenshot of the claim to its more than 100,000 followers.\n\nThis tweet -- using another name given to the animal by some social media users, \u201cDebra\u201d -- claimed the polka-dot foal was being moved to an unknown destination. The post was retweeted over 250 times and gained more than 650 likes.\n\nThe same claims and images were posted here on Facebook and on Jamii Forum, a Tanzania-based message board. This tweet claimed the foal had been sold to \u201ca certain Western Country\u201d.\n\nThe zebra in the pictures is from South Africa, not Kenya\n\nWe ran a Google reverse image search to try to find the original source of the two images circulating alongside the rumours, but this didn\u2019t provide any leads.\n\nHowever, scrolling through comments under one of the posts, we spotted a link to a Facebook post by Craig View, a veterinary clinic in South Africa.\n\nThe post included the images that have been circulating alongside the rumours about Tira, plus an extra one of a man posing with the animal. The post identified the man as Clifford Bull, the clinic owner. He\u2019s recognisable in other social media posts and news articles about wildlife in South Africa.\n\nDr Bull told us he had shared the pictures on September 30 after headlines appeared about the Kenyan foal, to show that Tira was not the only animal of its kind. The photos began circulating alongside the rumours a couple of days later, but he confirmed that the two are unconnected.\n\n\u201cIt is not the same zebra,\u201d he told AFP in an email. \u201cIf one compares the markings on the two zebra it\u2019s evident that the two animals are different.\u201d\n\nEach zebra, he explained, \u201chas different stripe patterns, much like human fingerprints. This serves two purposes: when the young are born they can imprint on their mothers, which allows them to recognize and stay with their mothers in the herd. It also serves as a mechanism that confuses predators.\u201d\n\nThe zebra pictured with him is a colt, a young male.\n\nDr Bull added that both of these spotted zebras are vulnerable since their markings make them stand out, making them more easily seen by predators.\n\nThis sadly makes it \u201ca slim possibility that they will reach adulthood and have offspring of their own,\u201d he said.\n\nHow to tell the two zebras apart\n\nJustine Cordingley, a researcher at Grevy\u2019s Zebra Trust, an independent wildlife conservation Trust in Kenya, helped us distinguish the two animals by examining their markings.\n\nComparing the two, you can see that the foal in the Mara has a darker back and more spots on its belly and back leg than the one in the truck. Its neck is also spotty rather than stripey. The one in the truck also has very stripey legs.\n\nDr Bull encountered the South African zebra colt at a small private game farm in the Mookgopong area of Limpopo province in July, and he estimates it to be between 10 and 12 months old.\n\nTira is a lot younger. \u201cThe umbilical cord was still very fresh by the time I spotted it on Matira Bushcamp located in the Masaai Mara,\u201d said tour guide Jonathan Tira, who first saw the foal on September 13. \u201cFrom my analysis, it could have been born two days before I spotted it,\u201d he told AFP by telephone.\n\nWhere is Tira now?\n\nNgugi Gecaga, communications officer at the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), said there was no truth at all to rumours that Tira had been sold abroad.\n\n\u201cThere is no animal being sold, the claims are completely false,\u201d Gecaga told AFP in a phone interview.\n\nHe added that the KWS rejected calls to put the foal under special protection because its spots make it more vulnerable than other zebras.\n\n\u201cKWS operates on the premise that animals should be in the wild. The zebra is not a special species, it is just a freak of nature -- similar to the albino zebra that we recently had. It won't be fair to isolate the animal and from a conservation point of view that would inhumane,\u201d Gecaga said.\n\n\u201cThe zebras protect each other and it will be protected by its own. If a predator spots it and preys on it, it will be just the course of nature.\u201d\n\nTira\u2019s current whereabouts are not known.\n\nHowever, French wildlife photographer Tony Crocetta wrote in a Facebook post on September 29 that he had seen the spotted zebra crossing the Sand River, which separates Kenya\u2019s Maasai Mara National and Tanzania\u2019s Serengeti Park.\n\n\u201cThe probability of coming across Tira again one day is sadly close to zero,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut I still believe in miracles.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
