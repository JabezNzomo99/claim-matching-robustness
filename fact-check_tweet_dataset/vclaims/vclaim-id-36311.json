Experts tell AFP there is no truth to this claim. Shaking the bottle also won\u2019t tell you how much gas is left inside.\n\nThe posts, like this one here, shared more than 8,000 times on Facebook, begin with the following warning emphasised in uppercase letters: \u201cGAS EXPLOSION ALERT!!! STOP SHAKING YOUR GAS CYLINDER!!!\u201d.\n\nOther examples of the post can be found here, here, here and here on Facebook, as well as on this website. The post ends with an appeal to \u201csave a life today by sharing this information\u201d.\n\nA similar version also appears here on Twitter (screenshot below), although the claim about the dangers of shaking a gas cylinder has been omitted.\n\nThe claim goes further by suggesting the safest way to test for residual gas is to pour water over the cylinder.\n\n\u201cAfter a while, the used top part will be dry while the lower part with gas will remain wet. The wet portion tells you the amount of gas left.\u201d\n\nThere seems to be merit to this part of the claim\n\nAFP asked Liquefied Petroleum Gas Safety Association of Southern Africa if the claim had any merit.\n\nAfter carrying out the experiment, the association said their test found that hot water poured over a cylinder adhered to the portion of the bottle still containing gas.\n\n\u201cWe have tried this out ourselves and there seems to be some truth to this,\u201d spokeswoman Gaahele Mokgoro said in an email.\n\nDavid Tyler, a safety specialist at the Paris-based World LPG Association, said the method was a \u201ccrude but indicative way\u201d of determining the remaining level of gas left in the cylinder.\n\nAn explanation of how this is possible can be found on this blog here, while the video below also offers a quick guide.\n\nBut can shaking the bottle cause an explosion?\n\nBoth Mokgoro and Tyler agreed it was pointless to shake a bottle to determine the amount of gas, but that doing so would not cause an explosion.\n\n\u201cLPG cylinders are designed to withstand robust treatment as they travel through the distribution channel,\u201d said Tyler. \u201cI think shaking is unnecessary but not dangerous.\u201d\n\nMokgoro agreed that \"cylinders do not explode from mere shaking\", but nonetheless advocated caution.\n\n\"There are consumers that are purchasing their cylinders from illegal dealers who do not have permission from the cylinder brand owners to fill that cylinder, so we may never know what condition their cylinder is.\"\n\nThat said, if proper safety practices are followed - as this website explains here - gas cylinders themselves are perfectly safe to use.\n\nMokgoro said the best way to know how much gas was left in the bottle was to weigh it and subtract the number from the gross mass, which is usually stamped somewhere on the bottle.", "lang": "en"}
