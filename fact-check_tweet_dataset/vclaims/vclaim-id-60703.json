There is no evidence of U-Haul trucks being involved in weapon stashes in D.C.\n\nThe Instagram post features the screen grabs of two June 2 tweets from One America News Network host Jack Posobiec, who, according to The Associated Press, was involved in the spread of the \u201cpizzagate\u201d conspiracy theory.\n\n\u201cBreaking: 2 crates filled with pipe bombs discovered near Korean War Memorial in DC after suspects spotted in bushes. Federal assets in pursuit,\u201d reads the first tweet in the post. The second screen grabbed tweet reads, \u201cUPDATE: Now DC is receiving intelligence about U-Haul trucks connected to suspected weapons stashes around the city.\u201d\n\nThe National Park Service, under which the U.S. Park Police (USPP) operates, denied the finding of any pipe bombs in an emailed statement to the Daily Caller. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show All The Lights Out At The White House During George Floyd Protests)\n\n\u201cUSPP received information that a tweet was sent stating that there were pipe bombs at the Korean Memorial,\u201d reads the statement. \u201cUSPP dispatched officers and EOD K9s to sweep the memorial and areas around it. Nothing was found.\u201d\n\nAn internet search by the Caller also turned up no evidence of U-Haul trucks connected to weapon stashes stationed around D.C. Had such weapon stashes been found in the capital city, media outlets would have reported on it, yet none have.\n\nPosobiec tweeted a day later that he stands by his statements regarding the pipe bombs.\n\n\u201cAn known unethical blogger is now trying to write a false smear piece about my reporting on this incident yesterday,\u201d the tweet reads. \u201cI stand by my source. And I do not give up @OANN sources to unethical bloggers, or anyone, for that matter.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
