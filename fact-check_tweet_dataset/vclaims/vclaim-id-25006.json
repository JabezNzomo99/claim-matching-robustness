The post\u2019s description says that this is the rare photo of the shivlinga of Mecca Madina. In our investigation we found that this claim is false. This Shivling is actually located in the Bhim Ki Dungari temple in Viratnagar, Rajasthan.\n\nThe viral post has a picture of a Shivling. The post\u2019s description says that this is the rare photo of the shivlinga of Mecca Madina. The post\u2019s description reads: \u201cFor the first time in history, Shivalinga of Mecca Madina is shown here, all Hindus should share.\u201d\n\nTo begin our investigation we first saw this photo properly. In this photo a person can also be seen performing Shashtang in front of Shivling. There is a rock above Shivalinga which makes it look like a cave. There are some flowers around the Shivling too. Overall it looks like a temple where lord Shiva Pooja is worshiped.\n\nTo move ahead with our investigation, we took a screenshot of this photo and searched it on Google reverse image. In this search, we found an article published on MapofIndia website in which this photo was used. The headline of this article was \u2018Viratnagar: Buddhist Art and Mughal Architecture in Jaipur.\u2019 This article was written by a freelance writer, Aba. The photo\u2019s caption was: 12 face Shivling of Bhim\u2019s Dungari located in Pandu cave.\n\nTo further investigate, we use key words Viratnagar Shivaling and Google\n\nsearched it. On the very first page we found many images of this shivlinga.\n\nFor more confirmation in this matter, we spoke to Acharya Dharmendra Maharaj, the famous Acharya of Viratnagar in Rajasthan, who told us that \u201cThis picture is actually of Ekadash Shivalinga situated in Dungari of Bhim ji in Viratnagar. This Shivlinga was established some 10-12 years ago in this cave. This Shivalinga has nothing to do with Mecca Medina. \u201c\n\nThis post has been viral on many social media pages for quite some time now. Recently this post was shared by a Facebook user named Rishi Bhola.\n\nConclusion: In our investigation we found that this claim is false. This Shivling is actually located in the Dungari temple of Bhima in Viratnagar, Rajasthan and not in Mecca Madina.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
