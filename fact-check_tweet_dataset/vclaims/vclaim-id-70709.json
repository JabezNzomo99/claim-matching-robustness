The new version provides greater context for Mayor Dwight Jones\u2019 statement, but does not change our original ruling of False.\n\nMayor Dwight Jones opened his annual State of the City Address quoting from the popular travel guide Frommer\u2019s, which Richmond\u2019s outdoor offerings and craft beer scene as reasons it recommends the capital as a top travel destination this year.\n\n\"What they\u2019re saying is something that we already know: That Richmond is a cool place to live, work and play,\" Jones said.\n\nLater in the speech, Jones cited additional Richmond accolades, and one particularly caught our attention.\n\n\"We are the most vegan-friendly city,\" he said, drawing chuckles from the audience.\n\nHas the old confederate capital become become the Mecca for people who abstain from all animal products? Lettuce take a look.\n\nTammy Hawley, the mayor\u2019s spokeswoman, pointed us to 2013 by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, a group that promotes meat-free diets and opposes animal testing. PETA ranked U.S. cities based on \"availability of vegan options\" as well as the \"influence of vegan culture,\" said Lindsay Rahat, the group\u2019s associate director of campaigns.\n\nRichmond won kudos for being \"packed with meat-free restaurants\" and hosting an annual .\n\nBut those accolades did not result in Richmond winning the vegan-friendly crown. In fact, Richmond was ranked 10th.\n\nThe top spot went to Austin, Texas, in the heart of cattle country.\n\nAlso ranked ahead of Richmond were Portland, Ore.; Los Angeles; New York; Chicago; Seattle; Salt Lake City, Las Vegas and Boulder, Colo.\n\nIn trumpeting Richmond\u2019s other accolades, Jones accurately noted that various groups have included Virginia\u2019s capital in Top 10 lists of cities that are the best place to work and live, the most creative, the best place for jobs and have the best outdoors.\n\nBut in addition to botching Richmond\u2019s vegan standing, the mayor erred on two other ratings:\n\n*He touted Richmond as the \"happiest city for young professionals\" based on a 2011 posting by Careerbliss, an online jobs site. Richmond was 15th on the .\n\n*He said Richmond is the \"healthiest city for women,\" although it actually ranked 51st in a 2011 by Self Magazine.\n\nJones said Richmond is the \"most vegan friendly city.\" The source he cited, however, rated Richmond 10th in providing animal-free food.\n\nWe don\u2019t doubt Jones\u2019 contention that Richmond is \"cool.\" When it comes to vegans, Richmond may be hospitable, but it has not been rated the friendliest city for them. So we rate the mayor\u2019s claim False.", "lang": "en"}
