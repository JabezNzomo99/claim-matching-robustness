No, that's not true. The study is not \"new\" as claimed in a Russian-sponsored YouTube video and it does not conclude that face coverings don't help in reducing the transmission of the virus that leads to COVID-19. The research cited was published by Chinese scientists -- not the CDC or WHO -- in February 2020, a month before WHO declared the COVID-19 pandemic, not in May 2020 as claimed by video host Ben Swann.\n\nThe claim is in a video (archived here) published on the RT channel on YouTube on July 23, 2020, under the title \"Reality Check | New CDC and WHO Study Proves 'No Evidence' Face Masks Prevent Virus.\" The text below the video read:\n\nClick below to watch the YouTube video:\n\nThis video was a direct response to a Lead Stories article titled Fact Check: Video Claiming 'Multiple Scientific Studies' Show Masks Don't Work Uses Old Data, Ignores Current Science On COVID-19 that debunked an earlier RT video.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the Lead Stories' article RT was calling out:\n\nThis video, which runs about 14 minutes, is posted on the RT YouTube channel. YouTube added a notice below the video informing viewers that RT, which was previously called Russia Today, \"is funded in whole or in part by the Russian government,\" with this link. (In 2017, the Department of Justice determined that RT helped Russia interfere in the 2016 U.S. elections, and forced the outlet to register as a foreign agent, according to POLITICO.)\n\nThe host Swann went to work for the Russian operation after he was fired from Atlanta's CBS News station, CBS46, in January 2018 after concluding that Swann often \"veered into alt-right conspirarcy theories,\" including a 2017 report on \"PizzaGate,\" the unfounded conspiracy theory claiming Hillary Clinton and other high-ranking Democratic officials were engaged in a human and child sex trafficking ring. That report led to Swann's \"first suspension and the removal of his Truth in Media website and most of his social media platforms,\" according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution:\n\nSwann's new video contains multiple falsehoods, and Swann actually argues with his own statements as the video goes on. His conclusion changes from the top of the video, in which he claims to have proof from the CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) that masks do nothing against COVID-19, to the second half -- when he acknowledges much debate exists about the efficacy of masks. In effect, he defeats his own argument.\n\nHere is a quote from the beginning of the video. Right at near the top, at 21 seconds, he says:\n\nTwo things are wrong with this section. First, the study that Swann claimed was published in May 2020 was first published (as noted on the study) on February 6, 2020 -- as the outbreak was just beginning to widely spread from China, and more than a month before WHO declared a global pandemic. See the date of the study in the screenshot below of a section of the study, which is on the same page as the \"discussion\" upon which Swann relies:\n\nAdditionally, this study was not produced by the CDC and WHO. This, from CDC spokesman Jason McDonald:\n\nLast, this study never \"proved\" masks don't work. The authors did not find evidence they do work, but didn't \"prove\" they don't work. In fact, when other resources are \"stretched,\" the study found that masks \"might\" have value:\n\nSwann then makes a passing reference to a Brigham Young University study at 9:39 in the video -- a study that was published July 19, but updated July 21. Here's Swann's reference:\n\nThe study did more than that. Here is the executive summary of the BYU study, which looked at 115 studies on the face-mask issue and sought to put complicated science into everyday terms for people to understand the importance of masks (emphasis in the below is from the orginal document):\n\nAnd with that, the RT argument turns against itself. A few seconds later, at 9:43, he says:\n\nAt 13:28, he begins wrapping up the video with a similar statement, but also takes aim at Facebook, Lead Stories and fact checkers in general. He says the media has made mask-wearing not about safety or science, but rather about \"compliance\":\n\nOne of the studies left out of the video that finds masks have an effect in reducing the spread of the virus is found here. The Wall Street Journal, on July 18, ran this piece, titled \"Face Masks Really Do Matter. The Scientific Evidence Is Growing,\" with this subead: \"New research suggests that face coverings help reduce the transmission of droplets, though some masks are more protective than others.\"\n\nAmong other studies, the Journal cites this one from Florida Atlantic University from June 2020. Among other things, it found:\n\nIt includes this video produced by the university and posted to YouTube on June 30, 2020:\n\nAs for fact-checking partners not offering an avenue for those flagged for posting false or misleading information on Facebook, Swann's claim is without merit. The publisher's help page details the appeals process which allows a content creator to make the case for a rating revision:\n\nRT could appeal the fact check conclusions by Lead Stories, but has not.\n\nLead Stories reporters Chelsea Carter and Helena Cavendish contributed to this report.", "lang": "en"}
