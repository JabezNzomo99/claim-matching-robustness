Accidents are down 50 percent and injury accidents are down 60 percent.\"\n\nThe $800 million rebuilding of the Marquette, in the heart of downtown Milwaukee, was a huge traffic story from 2004 until the work was completed in 2008.\n\nSince then, Milwaukee has moved on to other mega-highway renovation projects, including the $1.7 billion Zoo Interchange and the re-decking of the Hoan Bridge.\n\nStatewide, a glut of highway projects has led to concern that Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s budget seeks too much borrowing for roadbuilding. The Legislature is reviewing options.\n\nIn the Marquette, the old cloverleaf was having trouble handling increasing traffic. Motorists had to crisscross lanes to reach exits. Key components were falling apart and accidents were topping 600 a year.\n\nThe reconstruction didn\u2019t solve all the design puzzles in the busy interchange.\n\nChanges were needed in 2010 to slow traffic on the long curve tying I-94 eastbound to I-43 northbound after the Milwaukee County Sheriff\u2019s Office and others raised concerns about accident rates.\n\nIn 2012, DOT had to make adjustments after backups and long delays plagued westbound I-794 in the Marquette.\n\nBut what about the overall claim?\n\nDid the reconstruction add up to the big safety improvements claimed by the ?\n\nPat Goss and Kevin Traas from the group pointed us to the state Department of Transportation, which collects data on reported accidents from local law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe association cited a comparing the average number of crashes annually in the three years before the rebuild (2001-2003) to the first three years after (2009-2011).\n\nIt showed annual crashes down 48.2 percent, and injury or fatal crashes down 60 percent.\n\nBy the numbers, that\u2019s 365 fewer reported accidents every year, and 143 fewer per year involving injuries.\n\nSo those figures generally back up the group\u2019s claim, albeit by rounding up from 48 percent to 50 percent.\n\nThe numbers are out of date though, so we obtained from before and after the construction period. Those figures run through 2013.\n\nThere\u2019s a caveat: The boundaries used for the interchange were somewhat different in DOT\u2019s five-year comparison than in the three-year comparison.\n\nBut they help confirm the trends.\n\nThey also show a big drop in total accidents, though not quite as sharp: 45 percent for total accidents, and 55 percent for injury accidents.\n\nThe same count from 2009-2013: 1,890.\n\nFor injury accidents in the five-year comparison, there were 561 fewer in the five years after the rebuilding.\n\nMichael Pyritz, DOT spokesman for the southeast region, attributed the improvement in accident rates to several factors.\n\nThe new interchange made exiting safer and improved sight lines while incorporating modern safety and efficiency designs, he said.\n\n\"We expect to see the same trend when the Zoo Interchange is done,\" Pyritz said.\n\nAs a double check on the DOT data, we got crash figures from the Milwaukee County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which responds to most accidents in the Marquette Interchange.\n\nThat data showed somewhat smaller, but still significant, declines in accidents.\n\nFor example, comparing the three years before the project (2001-2003) vs. the latest three years (2012-2014), accidents are down 45 percent and injury accidents 49 percent, according to the Sheriff\u2019s Department. The two agencies defined the interchange somewhat differently.\n\nBy another measure -- the three years before rebuilding vs. the first three years after (2009-2011) -- the Sheriff\u2019s Office found 27 percent and 32 percent drops in total accidents and injury crashes, respectively.\n\nThat same comparison using the DOT data yielded the 48 percent and 60 percent drops. There\u2019s a large discrepancy in which the Sheriff\u2019s Office shows far fewer injury accidents before the project than are reported in the DOT figures.\n\nSheriff\u2019s officials said a changeover in data collection methods, and late reporting of injuries by crash victims, likely explains some of the discrepancy.\n\nStill, even with that, both agencies show a clear drop in accidents.\n\nOne final note: more traffic could also explain the higher numbers of accidents before the reconstruction.\n\nBut DOT data we reviewed on its website suggests that traffic volumes were not significantly higher, if higher at all, back then.\n\nIn the broad view, after 30 years of steady increases, miles traveled on state highways leveled off in 2000 and have not budged much. On I-94, which feeds the Marquette, a DOT reported a 5 percent increase eastbound from the Brewers ballpark from 1989 to 2009.\n\nAll that might suggest that volume in the Marquette after the rebuild is roughly the same or higher than it was before construction.\n\nThe Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association radio ad contended that \"accidents are down 50 percent and injury accidents are down 60 percent\" since the redesign of the Marquette Interchange in Milwaukee.\n\nThere are different ways to slice this, but the ad cites official state data that is backed up within a few percentage points by more recent figures, and is generally confirmed by local data.", "lang": "en"}
