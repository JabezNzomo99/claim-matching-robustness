Let\u2019s try to verify the authenticity of the video and analyze the claims made in the post.\n\nClaim: Muslims in Birmingham have attacked vehicles, as they wanted the road to be closed so that they can break their Ramadan fasting on the road. Fact: The video is actually from Basel in Switzerland and the rioters in it are football hooligans fighting after a match between Basel and Lucerne. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the video in the post is run through InVid Plugin, several keyframes are obtained. On performing Google Reverse Image Search on the keyframes, Swiss Media news reports on the incident were found. As per the article of Basler Zeitung, published on May 20, 2018, the incident actually took place in Basel city of Switzerland and the rioters seen in it are football hooligans fighting after a match between Basel and Lucerne (two local teams).\n\nTo summarize, neither the incident had taken place in Birmingham nor the rioters are Muslims.\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
