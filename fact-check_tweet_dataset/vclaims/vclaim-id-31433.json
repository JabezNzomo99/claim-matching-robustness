Let\u2019s analyze the claim about the image.\n\nFact: At Shaheen Bagh, women are protesting against CAA since \u201815 December 2019\u2019. But, the image in the post is found to exist on the internet at least since 2016. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFrom the article of \u2018Indian Express\u2019, it is learnt that women are holding a sit-in protest at Shaheen Bagh since 15 December 2019 against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA).\n\nOn subjecting the image to Google reverse image search technique, it was found in an article on the news website \u2013 \u2018Doisongphapluat\u2019. In the article, no concrete information was given about that image but the article was published in 2016. So, it is in no way related to the Shaheen Bagh protests going on since 15 December 2019. The same image is found on multiple websites and all of them were published years ago.\n\nTo conclude, an old image is being shared as \u2018Condoms found in drainage at Shaheen Bagh\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
