The page has more than 5,000 followers.\n\nThe accompanying caption says in English: \u201cMoments before Ethiopia plane crash as seen by an eye witness. May they find rest and their families and friends find comfort. #Tragic #Africa #EthiopianAirLine #Nairobi #PlaneCrash #Kenya #Nigeria #Canada.\u201d\n\nBelow is a snapshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe video has been viewed thousands more times on Facebook here, and here. It also received more than 2,600 views on Twitter here.\n\nHere is the AFP story about the Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10, 2019.\n\nHere is a tweet from Ethiopian Airlines confirming the accident.\n\nA Google reverse image search for a screenshot of the footage reveals multiple results for a US cargo plane crash near Bagram airfield in Afghanistan on April 29, 2013.\n\nThis is a video report on the Guardian website about the crash, published on May 1, 2013. In the clip, which shows a wider frame than the misleading clip shared on Facebook, a barbed wire fence can be seen on the right-hand side of the road.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the clip with the barbed wire fence circled in red:\n\nThis is consistent with other photos of the airbase from media reports, such as this report by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nHere is a screenshot of a photo of the air base by photographer Spencer Platt on the website for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nHere is another report about the crash on the CNN website, dated May 2, 2013.\n\nBoth reports indicated the footage was captured on a motorist\u2019s dashcam, but did not provide the name of the motorist.\n\nSeven crew were killed in the crash, the BBC reported.\n\nHere is a link to the National Transportation Safety Board report on the crash, published on September 14, 2015.\n\nCommenting on the video, the report states: \u201cA dashboard camera from a moving ground vehicle captured video images of the airplane after rotation that showed it in a steep climb with a high pitch attitude before it reached its highest point and entered a roll to the right. At the time of the airplane\u2019s right roll, the camera captured audio similar to engine thrust noise. The images showed that the airplane then began a rapid descent as it rolled back to the left then struck the ground in a nose-down and nearly wings-level attitude\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
