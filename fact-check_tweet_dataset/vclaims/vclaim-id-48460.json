The original photo does not show any image being displayed on the Burj Khalifa, the tallest skyscraper in the world with a height of over 2,700 feet and a popular tourist destination.\n\nAmong many, Facebook user Abdul Quadir shared the viral photo and captioned it, \"A tribute to social reformer Sir Syed Ahmad Khan by UAE Government. This depicts the power of the vision.\"\n\n\n\nAFWA probe\n\n\n\nA simple Google reverse image search revealed the reality of the viral photograph. We also thoroughly scanned the internet but could not find any media report regarding the tribute to Sir Syed Ahmad Khan by the UAE government.\n\n\n\nWe also checked the Twitter handle of Burj Khalifa but could not find any post related to Sir Syed Ahmad Khan. However, on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Burj Khalifa was lit up with his image and of the Indian national flag.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia Today tried to get in touch with the public relations team of Burj Khalifa, ASDA\u2019A Burson-Marsteller. The story will be updated after their response.\n\nSir Syed Ahmad Khan was an Indian philosopher and scholar of 19th century British India. He founded AMU in 1857 in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh.\n\nIt is to be noted that on October 17, AMU celebrated the 202nd Sir Syed Day on the birth anniversary of its founder. The AMU alumni in the UAE also celebrate Sir Syed Day every year.\n\nBut the viral image of Burj Khalifa displaying an image of Sir Syed Ahmad Khan is photoshopped.\n\nUpdate: In its response, the Burj Khalifa team confirmed to India Today TV that the viral image is photoshopped and LED projections are not possible in the daylight.", "lang": "en"}
