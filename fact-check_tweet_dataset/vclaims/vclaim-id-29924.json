More generally, there is a risk that leaving the EU will be globally interpreted as a narrow, xenophobic, backward-looking thing to do.\u201d\n\n\n\nThese words are taken from an article Mr Johnson wrote for the Telegraph in 2013, but they have been edited and taken out of context to make it seem like he\u2019s unambiguously arguing against leaving the EU. The article is actually titled \u201cWe must be ready to leave the EU if we don\u2019t get what we want.\u201d (Although he also writes: \u201cAs it happens, I think the question of EU membership is no longer of key importance to the destiny of this country.\u201d)\n\nIn it, Mr Johnson presents four possible arguments for staying in the EU, and four for leaving it. Amongst the arguments for staying in the EU, he said that the EU is \u201carguably\u201d in a better place to make trade deals, and separately he wrote that leaving it might appear xenophobic, although he says that both these propositions are \u201cuntested\u201d.\n\nThese two points have been edited together, with the word \u201carguably\u201d and several counterarguments removed, to produce the quote circulating on social media.\n\nThe full quote of his third and fourth arguments in favour of remaining reads:\n\n\u201c3) Global influence. The EU is arguably better placed to strike trade deals with the US, or China, than the UK on its own, though this proposition is plainly untested, and the idea of an EU \u201cCommon Foreign Policy\u201d is plainly a joke. Where was the EU on Iraq, or Libya? What, come to that, is the EU position on the Falklands?\n\n\u201c4) Perception of UK. It is often said that our strategic significance for the Americans or the Chinese depends on our membership of the EU; though, again, this is untested. More generally, there is a risk that leaving the EU will be globally interpreted as a narrow, xenophobic, backward-looking thing to do.\u201d\n\nHis arguments in support of leaving the EU included the fact that leaving the EU would save money, regain sovereignty, would allow the UK to \u201cmake our own laws again\u201d and mean that \u201cwe can no longer blame Brussels\u201d. \n\n\n\nDuring the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Johnson backed the Leave campaign.", "lang": "en"}
