Let\u2019s check the authenticity of the claim. \n\n\n\nThe post was made on Facebook in July but, it is now being shared widely and has attracted more than 19,000 shares till the time of writing this article.\n\nClaim: Image of students arrested at Allahabad University (Uttar Pradesh) for their involvement in terror-related activities at the campus. Fact: The image shows Madhya Pradesh Police with people arrested in a \u2018sex racket\u2019 burst during the raids at the Parwalia village of Ratlam district in the state. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nIn the comments section of the post, a few users have written that it is \u2018fake\u2019 and a certain user has enclosed a screenshot of an e-paper article that had the same picture.\n\n\n\nFrom this clip, it was found that the Madhya Pradesh Police have arrested fifteen people who are part of a \u2018sex racket\u2019. They were caught during the Police raids at the Parwalia village of Ratlam district in the state. At the bottom of the clip, it can be seen that the clip is that of e-paper published on July 25, 2019, by \u2018Patrika\u2019. When searched based on the information regarding the incident, the article of \u2018Patrika\u2019 was found and it can be seen here.\n\nThe same information can also be found in the article of \u2018Mandsaur Sandesh\u2019 which published the same image. \n\n\n\nTo summarize, an image from MP is being falsely shared as \u2018students arrested at Allahabad University (UP) for involvement in terror-related activities\u2019.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
