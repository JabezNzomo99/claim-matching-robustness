Meanwhile, Pakistan's leading news channel \"Dawn\" telecast news of his death. In its report, \"Dawn\" attributed the information to \"BBC Breaking News\".\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that \"Dawn\" had misreported. At the time of filing this story, Johnson was undergoing treatment at intensive care.\n\nMany social media users, including journalists Naila Inayat and Atika Rehman pointed out the mistake in their tweets.\n\nThe source of Dawn's news was a Twitter account by the name \"BBC Breaking News\" without a blue tick. AFWA has found that the Twitter handle is fake and it has been deleted (https://twitter.com/BBCbreaki/status/1247451946870624257) for violating Twitter rules.\n\nWhile the original Twitter handle for BBC's breaking news section is @BBCBreaking, the fake handle was @BBCbreaki.\n\nUK cabinet office minister Michael Gove told LBC radio on April 7, \"The prime minister has received some oxygen support and is kept under close supervision, but he is not on ventilator.\"\n\nMany prominent media houses are keeping an eye on his health and publishing updates.\n\nUnited Kingdom is among the European countries worst affected by coronavirus infections. Till April 7 evening, it reported more than 51,000 positive cases of Covid-19 and over 5,300 deaths. Even Prince Charles of the royal family, the heir apparent to Queen Elizabeth, tested positive for coronavirus. A number of ministers and royal family members are in quarantine or self-isolation.\n\nBut it is clear that the news published by \"Dawn\" is not true. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is down with Covid-19 and undergoing treatment at intensive care.", "lang": "en"}
