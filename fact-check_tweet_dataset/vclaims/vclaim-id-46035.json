It doesn\u2019t conform with what the initial information showed us weeks ago, but it does seem to be more and more evident.\u201d\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp made a similar claim on Thursday. \"What we've been telling people from directives from the CDC for weeks now, that if you start feeling bad, stay home. Those individuals could have been infecting people before they ever felt bad. But we didn't know that until the last 24 hours.\"\n\nContrary to those claims, solid evidence of asymptomatic transmission has been publicly available for weeks.\n\nAs The Dispatch reported in a fact check published on March 12, the CDC website states: \u201cThere have also been reports of asymptomatic infection with COVID-19.\u201d\n\nOn February 13, Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, confirmed that asymptomatic transmission of coronavirus was happening.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been good communication with our colleagues to confirm asymptomatic infection, to confirm asymptomatic transmission, to be able to get a better handle on the clinical spectrum of illness in China. What we don\u2019t know though is how much of the asymptomatic cases are driving transmission,\u201d Dr. Redfield said on CNN.\n\nAs Redfield\u2019s comments suggest, medical professionals\u2019 understanding of the role played by asymptomatic transmission in the spread of coronavirus has evolved as data about the virus has accumulated.\n\nDuring a World Health Organization briefing on March 5, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove said: \u201cWe know that that is possible, but we do not believe that that\u2019s a major driver of transmission.\u201d\n\nThe study that de Blasio refers to analyzed Singapore\u2019s 243 confirmed cases from January 23 to March 16 and found instances of asymptomatic transmission.\n\nOn March 19, CNN published an article in which several epidemiology experts confirmed asymptomatic transmission and suggested it was a major factor in the growing number of cases. \u201cWe now know that asymptomatic transmission likely [plays] an important role in spreading this virus,\" said the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota Dr. Michael Osterholm.\n\n\"Asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic transmission are a major factor in transmission for Covid-19,\" said CDC adviser and Vanderbilt School of Medicine professor Dr. William Schaffner.\n\nAnd Dr. Caroline Colijn, the lead author of an international collaborative coronavirus study, said: \"Our analysis would suggest that presymptomatic transmission is pretty commonplace.\u201d\n\nThe Singapore study that de Blasio cited does indeed show evidence that coronavirus can be spread by asymptomatic carriers. But contrary to his claims, it doesn\u2019t provide new evidence that asymptomatic transmission is occurring, it reaffirms what the health care community already knew.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
