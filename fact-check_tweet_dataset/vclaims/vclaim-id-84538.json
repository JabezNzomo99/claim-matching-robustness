Did you ever wonder where lynch mobs come from? Here is a seemingly normal person casually calling for a pledge to lynch someone without finding out the truth. What is the truth behind the bus? Read on\u2026\n\nA bus with a picture on Jinnah? How would you react? When residents spotted a bus with the picture of Mohammad Ali Jinnah plying on Bengaluru roads, the reactions were varied. Some called up the travel company to check, others complained to the police. Some others took to social media to outrage and take pot shots at the non-BJP Karnataka government.\n\nNeeraj Kamath, also former core committee at Namo Brigade, was the first to report the green \u201cDemocracy travels\u201d bus with a picture of Mohammad Ali Jinnah on social media. The post was shared over a 1000 times and as expected it caused much outrage.\n\nIt is normal to react on seeing the photograph but the right-wing fuelled the outrage. Here is the reaction of Prasanna Mudugabe, also a contributor to Postcard News.\n\nIt drove Abhishek Singh to give a call for lynching the bus owner.\n\nThis posts were later picked up by many right wing websites and Facebook pages including \u2018Say \u201cNo\u201d To Sold Media\u2018 and Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\n\nThe picture of the bus is not fake. Yes, such a bus with the picture of Mohammad Ali Jinnah was spotted on the roads of Bengaluru. The bus was a prop for a Malayalam movie, Aabhaasam, that was being shot in the city. Here is the screenshot of the Facebook page of the movie.\n\nWhen Alt News spoke to the crew, they confirmed the bus was used for shooting. They put a board saying so but forgot to do it on the day the pictures were clicked.\n\nFrom what little we know of the movie from the IMDB page, the bus \u201cDemocracy travels\u201d is an integral part of the movie script\n\nKamath, who was the first to post the picture of the bus, reported that the picture has been deleted. In a second Facebook post, he wrote, \u201cDemocracy travels\u201d is free From Jinnah. The Owner has apologised & removed the photo & confirmed by sending this photo. He didn\u2019t even know what they had done with the sus and who Jinnah Was. The Bus Was Hired By A Malayalam Movie Crew For Shooting.\u201d He also called for the nationalists to be united against the anti-nationals.\n\nAs reported by Times of India, fearing backlash, the owner of the bus has removed the image.\n\nNationalist pride is fragile. Freeing a bus called, \u201cDemocracy travels\u201d which was a movie prop, from Jinnah is a victory for them. The Postcard contributor who used the picture to malign the Karnataka government has not deleted his post even after learning that truth about the bus. Nor has the one who called for lynching the bus owner. The bus owner could be under a real threat from such a call. We hope Bengaluru police have taken note of it.", "lang": "en"}
