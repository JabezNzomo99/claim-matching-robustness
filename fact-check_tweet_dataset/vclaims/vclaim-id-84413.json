However, when it comes to certain domestic issues when condemnation from the highest authority is much needed, the same alacrity has never been seen.\n\n52-year-old Mohammad Akhlaq was mob-lynched by cow vigilantes in Dadri on 28 September 2015. Narendra Modi finally broke his silence about the issue in a rally on October 8th. When 4 Dalit boys were tied to a car and were beaten up in broad daylight by cow vigilantes in the middle of a small town called Una in Gujarat, PM Modi chose to stay mum for the longest time till he realised that the public anger is out of hand. Una incident happened on July 11th, PM Modi finally spoke about it on August 7th, 2 days after the start of a highly successful march from Ahmedabad to Una to protest against Dalit atrocities. The march started from Ahmedabad on August 5th.\n\nOn April 3rd, Pehlu Khan, 55, died in hospital, two days after a mob attacked his cattle truck on a highway in Alwar in Rajasthan. The Home Minister of the State made a shocking statement in connection with the case as reported in DNA in which he appreciated the work of these murderous cow vigilantes.\n\nThe cow protectors have done a good job by protecting cows from smuggling. But they have violated the law by beating people brutally.\n\nBJP\u2019s Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi in fact completely the incident on the floor of Rajya Sabha before taking a U-turn.\n\nWhile BJP leaders were trying to do yet another cover-up job following a day-light murder by cow-vigilantes, when PM Narendra Modi and Rajasthan CM Vashundhara Raje decided to tweet about the alleged terror attack in Stockholm, Sweden, while not having spoken a single word about the Alwar attack, this became an issue of contention. Many people on social media mocked the PM and Rajasthan CM regarding the same.\n\nWhile PM Modi avoids tweeting about cow-vigilante terrorism, it took him just a few hours to tweet when a farmer committed suicide in an AAP rally. Isn\u2019t the PM of a country supposed to act like a statesman, especially when he has promised \u2018Sabka saath, sabka vikaas\u2019 and not exclusively look at issues through the prism of political agenda?", "lang": "en"}
