However, the clip has been taken out of context and Magufuli was not talking about this match. It was filmed in March 2019 when Magufuli invited the team to the State House, and he was talking about a different game.\n\nThis is the second time Tanzania has made an appearance at AFCON -- the last time was 30 years ago. This year\u2019s tournament is not going so well for the East African country, and they are trailing with zero points in the group matches.\n\nOn June 24, Tanzania was thrashed 2-0 by Senegal and three days later they were beaten by Kenya 3-2.\n\nPosts claiming that Magufuli was angrily addressing the national team over their poor performance at AFCON first circulated online after the Senegal game. This post for instance, on KTN Kenya\u2019s Facebook Page, shared an article from The Standard titled: \u2018Kwani tumekosa wachezaji?\u2019 (Is it that we don\u2019t have players?) \u2013 Magufuli in furious tirade after Tanzania\u2019s AFCON loss\u2019.\n\nAccording to social media analysis tool CrowdTangle, the Standard article generated nearly 1,500 interactions and more than 180 shares.\n\nThe website Nairobi News also carried the same incorrect story.\n\nIn the 30-second clip that has been taken out of context, Magufuli is heard wondering how Tanzania could be defeated by a country with two million people. \u201cIs it that we could not get 11 players from the 55 million people?\u201d he asks in the Swahili-language clip.\n\nThe Standard\u2019s article embedded this tweet that included the clip, which has been viewed more than 5,000 times and retweeted more than 60 times.\n\nThe tweet complained that Magafuli did not know the population of Senegal. But in fact, he wasn\u2019t talking about Senegal at all.\n\nThe clip was taken from live footage filmed during the national team\u2019s visit to Tanzania\u2019s State House on March 25, 2019 -- you can watch it on YouTube here.\n\nMagufuli had invited the national team to his residence after they qualified for AFCON, and gifted each player a parcel of land as a reward, as reported by AFP, as well as money for training.\n\nThe clip used in the misleading posts was taken from a section of the speech when he was talking about Tanzania\u2019s 1-0 loss to Lesotho during qualification in November 2018.\n\nWe reviewed the long version of the footage. Magufuli says the following:\n\n\u201cI had planned not to invite any team to the State House after you were thrashed in Lesotho yet I had given you my 50 million shillings. That game frustrated me. I want to talk about it because I watched the game and how you were playing. Some good players were not placed in their rightful positions. And I kept on asking myself, \u2018Whoever was planning the match, did they do it intentionally so that the team doesn\u2019t win, or what were they thinking?\u2019\u201d\n\nHe then goes on to make the comment about being defeated by a country of two million, which is indeed the approximate population of Lesotho. This can be viewed here.\n\nFrom the full version of the clip it is clear Magufuli was referring to the earlier qualifier against Lesotho. The match against Senegal came months after the footage was filmed.", "lang": "en"}
