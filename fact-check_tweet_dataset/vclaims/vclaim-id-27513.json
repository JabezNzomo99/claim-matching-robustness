The gunman was himself shot and killed by police, who later identified him as 36-year-old Seth Ator.\n\nAlmost immediately upon the heels of that identification, the usual online disinformation game-playing began, with various bad actors and misinformed social media users spreading false details about the perpetrator\u2019s putative political affiliations. The most widespread and prominent rumor about Ator held that he was a \u201cDemocrat Socialist\u201d whose vehicle sported a sticker endorsing Beto O\u2019Rourke, a former U.S. representative from Texas who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination:\n\nThis rumor quickly became a predominant narrative about the shooter on Twitter, along with claims that his social media profile had been scrubbed:\n\nIn fact, Texas Department of Public Safety Spokesman Sgt. Oscar Villarreal stated that no such sticker was found on Ator\u2019s own vehicle, nor on the mail truck Ator hijacked after abandoning his car.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign manager also took to Twitter to state that the rumor was \u201ccompletely false\u201d:\n\nThe rumor received a boost through being spread by Tony Shaffer, a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer whose Twitter profile describes him as a member of the \u201cTrump 2020 Advisory Board\u201d:\n\nRelated misinformation spread online proffered an alleged picture of Ator\u2019s truck bearing a \u201cBeto 2020\u201d sticker (the photo was actually swiped from an online store\u2019s website) and the false claim that he was a \u201cregistered Democrat\u201d (his most recent voting record indicates no party affiliation):\n\nIn the days since the shooting, the claim continued to morph into new status updates and posts on social media. Some Facebook users posted a picture of a white truck with a \u201cBeto 2020\u201d sticker on the back window, saying it belonged to Ator. That image actually came from an online retailer who sells campaign decals. Its owner, Stacy Pyle, said via email that the photo originated from her Etsy store website. But she said she did not sell any version of that decal and had \u201cno clue\u201d the image was being used to spread misinformation. Unproven statements that the shooter was a \u201cregistered Democrat\u201d also spread quickly on social media hours after the rampage. Texas voting records list the 36-year-old Ator registered as an unaffiliated voter in 2012, his most recent record.", "lang": "en"}
