That hasn't stopped Democrats from falsely claiming he has a \"plan\" that does not exist.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2020-09-04T14:00:42.029Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-79383", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/04/biden-campaign-attacks-trump-social-security-plan-that-does-not-exist/", "vclaim": "While the Trump White House has suggested this is similar to a payroll tax holiday in the Obama administration during the Great Recession, that law had a provision saying Social Security would be made whole with transfers from general funds (regular tax revenue). This executive order does not say that, but one would presume that any forgiveness would be accompanied by such transfers.\n\nWhite House aides insisted that Trump was referring only to the executive order, not all payroll taxes. \u201cWhen he referred to \u2018permanent,\u2019 I think what he was saying is that the deferral of the payroll tax to the end of the year will be made permanent,\u201d White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cIt will be forgiven. The tax is not going to go away.\u201d\n\nBut on Aug. 13, Trump appeared to make his position clearer: \u201cWhen we win the election \u2014 when I win the election, I\u2019m going to completely and totally forgive all deferred payroll taxes without in any way, shape or form hurting Social Security. That money is going to come from the general fund. We\u2019re not going to touch Social Security. I said from day one that we\u2019re going to protect Social Security, and we\u2019re going to protect our people. And Social Security is one of the things that will be protected.\u201d (On Aug. 10, Trump also had said he would pay through the general fund with \u201czero impact\u201d on Social Security, but then he contradicted himself again the next two days.)\n\nA Biden campaign adviser defended the ad. Citing Trump\u2019s comments in mid-August, especially about Americans saving $5,000, he said: \u201cTo eliminate the payroll tax is a fair estimate of what Trump\u2019s plan is. I think it\u2019s a fair hit. He left himself open to a fair hit, and in the world of politics, it was a fair hit.\" He said it was ridiculous to believe Social Security could be funded in the long term through regular tax revenue, without the Social Security payroll tax, as Trump claimed Aug. 12.\n\nTrump campaign spokesman Zach Parkinson said in a statement: \u201cJoe Biden and his campaign\u2019s scare tactics are a sad attempt to distract from his own record. President Trump and Administration officials have repeatedly said he wants to make the payroll tax cut deferral permanent to help America\u2019s workers. The President has been clear: his payroll tax cut will have \u2018zero impact\u2019 on Social Security or the seniors that rely on the program. He supports transferring money from the government\u2019s general coffers, protecting the program\u2019s Trust Fund. America\u2019s seniors can rest assured that President Trump will always protect Social Security, unlike Joe Biden who bragged in the 1990s about his efforts to \u2018freeze\u2019 benefits.\u201d\n\n\u201cI've been here for almost four years. I would have played the Social Security card a long time ago. I'm not touching Social Security,\u201d Trump said. Asked about a payroll tax cut, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re looking to do that. We will do it second term. We're looking to do something now if we can.\u201d Asked whether that would harm the program, as Democrats claim, he replied: \u201cWe\u2019re taking it from the general fund. We're not taking it from Social Security. Comes right out of the general fund and we make up for it with the tremendous growth that we're going to experience.\u201d\n\nTo make a long story short, Democrats ginned up a letter from the chief actuary to describe a plan that does not currently exist. Trump certainly suggested he might eliminate the payroll tax, but then he pulled back from that idea and reiterated that any diversion for a payroll tax holiday would come out of general funds. We were torn between Three and Four Pinocchios, but the ad\u2019s framing tipped us to Four.", "lang": "en"}
