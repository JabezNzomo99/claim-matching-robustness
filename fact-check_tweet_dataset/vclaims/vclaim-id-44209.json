It also quoted the same pathologists in saying that ventilators and intensive care units \"were never needed.\"\n\nThe facts: Multiple studies show that thrombosis or blood clotting is among the complications brought by COVID-19. However, not all COVID-19 patients exhibit this, and more studies are needed to determine the effectiveness and proper use of anticoagulants for treatment.\n\nAccording to Johns Hopkins Medicine, thrombosis happens when a blood clot blocks the blood flow in a vein or an artery. Serious problems and complications can occur where the thrombosis is located. Pneumonia, on the other hand, is a serious lung infection where the air sacs fill with pus and other liquid due to bacteria, viruses, or fungi.\n\nPneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS, and sepsis are among the clinical syndromes associated with COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization. In severe to critical cases, venous thrombosis and venous thromboembolism are among the complications, said the WHO and the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nAnimal Politico cited a study that said pulmonary thrombosis \"could further complicate the course of pneumonia.\" It also talked to an expert who said hospitalized COVID-19 patients \"are affected by pneumonia with respiratory insufficiency caused by the virus, often accompanied by cardiovascular complications and, in particular, venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.\"\n\nOther accredited fact checkers like Politifact in the United States and Full Fact in the United Kingdom also rated this claim as false. Politifact, for instance, quoted a doctor who said COVID-19 begins in the lungs like any form of common-cold coronaviruses, then wrecks the immune system, resulting in long-term damage or even death.\n\nThere is an Italian study in April \u2013 which is pre-print and has not been peer-reviewed yet \u2013 that detailed the autopsy of 38 patients who died of COVID-19 in Milan and Bergamo. The study said the main pattern they saw in patients is the diffuse alveolar disease, which severely affects the alveoli or air sacs in the lungs.", "lang": "en"}
