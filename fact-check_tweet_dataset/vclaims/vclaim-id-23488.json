Read the archived version of the post here.\n\nRahul Gandhi won Wayanad seat in Kerala with a margin of around 4.2 lakh votes, but he lost to BJP's Smriti Irani in Amethi.\n\nIndia Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral claim is misleading.\n\nAs per the data available on the ECI website, Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency has a total 11,02,097 electorates.\n\nThe actual result of Wayanad constituency can be seen here.\n\nFacebook page 'FekuExpress' shared two screenshots of the ECI website, showing the election data of Wayanad seat.\n\nThe first screenshot showed the final vote count of Rahul Gandhi at 7,34,888.\n\nThe second screenshot highlighted his vote count on Thursday (May 23) at 13,37,438 votes.\n\nThe calculation explained in the post showed the vote difference at 6,02,550.\n\nHence, the post claimed that six lakh votes were deleted from the website.\n\nWe found that there was a display error on the ECI website on Thursday afternoon. Due to this, it was showing around 13 lakh votes in the name of Rahul Gandhi and more than four lakh votes for PP Suneer on Wayanad seat.\n\nHowever, the data was rectified on the website a few hours later when pointed out.\n\nAs per the Election Commission of India 2009 report, the total number of electorates in the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency is 11,02,097 which include 5,43,764 male and 5,58,333 female voters.\n\nWayanad constituency was formed in 2009 and consists seven Assembly segments spread over three districts - Wayanad, Kozhikode and Malappuram.\n\nWayanad district is the least populated region in Kerala with a population of 8,16,558, as per the 2011 Census.\n\nThe total number of votes polled in Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency was 10,92,197.\n\nAn ECI official confirmed India Today that there was some screen display error on the website due to which the vote count on Wayanad seat was showing incorrect data, which was rectified within an hour.\n\nAs the total number of voters in the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency is around 11 lakh, it is not possible for Rahul to have got 13 lakh votes on this seat.", "lang": "en"}
