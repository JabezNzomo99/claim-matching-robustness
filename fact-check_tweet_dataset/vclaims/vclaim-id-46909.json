But it was posted as part of a photo gallery that included a post that reads in part, \"Huge wildfire in Australia has resulted in deaths of more than 480 milion animals.\"Australia\u2019s bushfires. We rated that post Mostly False after finding that many of the images are several years old and weren\u2019t taken in Australia to begin with.\n\nThe image was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nAfter conducting a reverse-image search, we found that the deer image was taken by photographer Josh Edelson on Nov. 10, 2018, in Paradise, Calif.\n\nThis photo shows the aftermath of the deadly Camp Fire that killed over 85 people and burned hundreds of thousands of acres in Northern California in 2018.\n\nThis image is authentic, but it does not show destruction from Australia\u2019s wildfires. Given the context in which it has been presented, we rate this viral image Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
