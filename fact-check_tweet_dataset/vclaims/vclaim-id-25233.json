The other seven increases came after President Donald Trump took office in January 2017.\n\nSo, this claim circulating on social media is wrong: \u201cFederal Reserve raises interest rates THE FOURTH TIME since Trump was elected. It raised them zero times under Obama. The goal? Slow down Trump\u2019s economic boom. Economic slowdown will affect the 2020 election. Another Deep State move.\u201d\n\nThe claim started out on Twitter, where it was retweeted more than 4,000 times, then it migrated to Facebook, where it\u2019s been shared more than 2,500 times.\n\nThe Federal Reserve lists the increases on its website. There are also press releases for each of nine as well.\n\nAlso, Jerome Powell, whom Trump nominated to be chairman of the Federal Reserve, has voted for each of them \u2014 first as a board member and then after he became the chairman in early 2018. So, Trump chose Powell to lead the central bank after he had voted for five interest rate increases.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cFederal Reserve issues FOMC statement.\u201d Press release.
