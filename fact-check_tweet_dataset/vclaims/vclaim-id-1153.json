A REAL second wave. 5G turned on in Leicester and it has been shut down for Covid! Wake up world! May the God's have mercy on those living in Leicester! It won't stop there though.

It is not connected to COVID-19. The World Health Organization says no research has linked exposure to wireless technology with negative health effects (here).\n\nLeicester has had 5G coverage since November 2019 (here) and it is one of dozens of British cities and large towns with the service (here).\n\nFalse. The technology behind 5G networks is in no way linked with COVID-19, which is a disease caused by a virus.\n\nRead more about our work to fact-check social media posts here.", "lang": "en"}
