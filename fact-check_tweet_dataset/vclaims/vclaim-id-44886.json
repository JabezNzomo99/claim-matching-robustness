But, FACTLY has found that SCI has not pronounced any such judgement. Recently, when a plea to change India\u2019s name exclusively to \u2018Bharat\u2019 was taken up for hearing, the SCI disposed of the petition and said that appropriate ministries can consider it as a representation. In a virtual court hearing, the Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde orally said \u2018Bharat and India are both names given in the Constitution. India is already called \u2018Bharat\u2019 in the Constitution\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
