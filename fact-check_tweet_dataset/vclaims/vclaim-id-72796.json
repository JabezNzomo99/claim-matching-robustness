Bobby Scott, D-3rd, recently touted his bill to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 a hour before the House Education and Labor Committee.\n\n\"Today\u2019s minimum wage worker making $7.25 an hour has less buying power than a minimum wage worker in the 1960s,\" he said during a Feb. 7 hearing.\n\nWe wondered if Scott was correct, so we looked at the data.\n\nIn 1960, the federal minimum wage was $1 an hour. That\u2019s equivalent to $8.57 an hour in today\u2019s dollars. (We used the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 inflation calculator for calculations).\n\nIn 1961, the minimum wage was raised to $1.15 and sat there the following year. In today\u2019s dollars, it was worth $9.63 in 1961 and 9.57 in 1962.\n\nIn 1963, the wage rose $1.25 and stayed there for the next three years. In today\u2019s dollars, it was worth $10.23 in 1963, $10.13 in 1964, $9.94 in 1965, and $9.69 in 1966.\n\nIn 1967, the wage increased to $1.40. In today\u2019s dollars, it was worth $10.56.\n\nIn 1968, the wage rose to $1.60 and stayed there for six years. In today\u2019s dollars, it was worth $11.58 - an all-time high - and $10.98 in 1969.\n\nWhen adjusted for inflation, the average federal minimum wage during the 1960s was $10.09 and hour - $2.84 higher than today\u2019s wage. That\u2019s a 28 percent decrease in value. Over a 40-hour work week, that translates to $113.60 in lost gross pay.\n\nScott\u2019s bill would gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour in 2024, and afterwards index it to inflation. Scott and other supporters of the measure say it would put more money in pockets of an estimated 40 million workers, many of them women and minorities. They predict that the increased spending power will lift the economy.\n\nOpponents of the bill, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, say the $15 an hour wage would harm small businesses, especially those located in the areas with low costs of living.\n\nIt should be noted that were at least three bills introduced in the General Assembly this winter to raise Virginia\u2019s minimum wage, which is set at the federal floor of $7.25 an hour. All of the measures were killed in committees. Thirty states have raised their minimum wages above the federal floor.\n\nScott said, \"Today\u2019s minimum wage worker making $7.25 an hour has less buying power than a minimum wage worker in the 1960s.\"\n\nWhen adjusted for inflation into today\u2019s dollars, the minimum wage of that decade varied from $8.57 an hour to $11.58. The average over the decade was $10.09 and hour - significantly higher than today\u2019s rate.\n\nCorrection: Bobby Scott is a Democrat.
