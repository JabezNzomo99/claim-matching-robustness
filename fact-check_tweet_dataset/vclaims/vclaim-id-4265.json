No, that's not true. No reliable news source has reported on the death and the only site that is pushing the story has a glaring errors in its article about the passing away of the patriarch of the Jackson family that includes such legendary entertainers as Michael, Janet and La Toya Jackson and the Jackson 5. Jackson is not dead.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by a website named The Weekly Observer (unaffiliated with the newspaper by the same name) on June 23, 2018 titled \"Joe Jackson died today from terminal cancer\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nJoe Jackson, the father of the famous family Jackson, lost the fight against cancer as he suffered from incurable illness and was in the final stage, many American media reported. The TMZ.com website, citing family sources, reported that 89-year-old Jackson suffered from cancer at the final stage. The Variety magazine supports a source that knows its status confirmed this information while DailyMail.com, based on family members and other unspecified sources, wrote that Joe Jackson suffered from cancer in the pancreas. Zerman Jackson, one of Joe Jackson's sons, confirmed on Twitter that his father died .\n\nTMZ did indeed report Jackson suffered from cancer:\n\nBut it is definitely not true \"many American media reported\" he had lost the fight against the disease: we weren't able to find a single legitimate news outlet reporting that news.\n\nIn addition Jackson does not have a son named \"Zerman Jackson\". The closest to that would be \"Jermaine Jackson\", who did not tweet about his father's death. His most recent tweets mentioning his father are from four days ago:\n\nDon't trust news about celebrities passing away that hasn't been confirmed by major news outlets and don't like and share without getting confirmation if you care about the feelings of the friends and family of the celebrity in question.\n\nBe especially wary of news about the death of a celebrity who has been reported to be in hospital (or very ill): some fake news websites like to push death hoaxes about them because they sound more believable, netting them millions of likes and shares.", "lang": "en"}
