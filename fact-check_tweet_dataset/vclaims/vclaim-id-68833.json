Ann Wagner, R-Mo., has been circulating a petition, encouraging constituents to add their names to \"Stand for", "author": "www.politifact.com", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-68833", "url": "http://www.politifact.com/missouri/statements/2017/nov/24/ann-wagner/satanic-temple-has-not-teamed-planned-parenthood-o/", "vclaim": "She went into more detail in an Oct. 25 Facebook post, Wagner wrote, \"As Planned Parenthood continues its march through Missouri to expand abortion practices, an organization called the Satanic Temple has emerged as their ally, pressuring legislators and filing state and federal lawsuits in an attempt to erase protections for the unborn. I refuse to stand by as unabashed Satanists challenge our respect for life in Missouri. Add your name to stand in support of life.\"\n\nWe reached out to Wagner to see where she was getting this information. Her campaign manager, Brecht Mulvihill, sent us a link to a statement from The Satanic Temple, and linked to articles from The Kansas City Star, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Newsweek, Slate and Huffington Post.\n\nIn November 2016, Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit challenging a Missouri statute that required abortion clinics to be licensed as \"ambulatory surgical centers.\" The lawsuit also challenged requirements that stipulated that physicians who provide abortions must have admitting privileges from a nearby hospital. After a judge ruled in favor of Planned Parenthood, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley and Director of Department of Health and Senior Services Randall Williams appealed the case.\n\nThe Slate article was picked up by other sites and is referenced in other articles from outlets such as The Kansas City Star and Patheos. Brietbart also wrote about the recent efforts by Planned Parenthood and The Satanic Temple. \u201cI have never sued a nun \u2014 any nuns.\u201d\n\n\"We are not collaborating nor competing with Planned Parenthood and we have no formal relationship with the organization,\" Greaves said. \"We contacted the ACLU of Missouri when we were initially seeking legal counsel for the case we\u2019re now litigating. After a few enthusiastic calls wherein we were led to believe they were interested in taking our case they soon stopped responding to our messages and we never heard from them again.\"\n\nThe Church of Satan pointed this out to Wagner by replying to her tweet with the incorrect graphic on Oct. 25, writing, \"We have nothing to do with this,\" and linking to a statement on its website.", "lang": "en"}
