Accompanying the tweet was a short 18-second video in which her words \u2013 \u201cBJP shorkar ke vote diye\u201d \u2013 were played in a loop. The English translation of the statement is \u2013 \u201cvote for BJP\u201d.\n\nIs it possible that Mamata Banerjee, the leader BJP political opponent All India Trinamool Congress, would make such a statement in a rally?\n\nIt turns out that BJP Bengal had tweeted a doctored video, which was clipped and played in a loop to give a misleading impression. Mamata Banerjee addressed a rally in Khanakul, West Bengal on April 23. While ending her speech, Banerjee asked the people to vote out BJP, with a sarcastic tone to her words. Banerjee\u2019s words \u201c6 May aasche din, ekhane bhalo kore gonotontroye BJP Sarkar ke vote diye bhalo kore kobor din, bhalo kore kobor din, bhalo kore kobor din\u201c, can be approximately translated as follows:\n\n\u201cOn May 6, cast your vote for BJP government and give them a proper burial, give them a proper burial, give them a proper burial\u201d.\n\nThe part where Banerjee says \u201cbhalo kore kobor din\u201c, which literally translates to \u201cput them in the grave\u201c, was clipped out by BJP Bengal. Instead, the part where Banerjee sarcastically says \u201cvote for BJP\u201d was retained and played in a loop. The relevant portion of the original speech can be seen in the video posted below.\n\nBJP\u2019s version of the video also includes a portion where the crowd chants \u201cModi Modi\u201d, which is not present in the live speech (starting 35:47) uploaded on Mamata Banerjee\u2019s official page.\n\nBJP Bengal\u2019s attempt to mislead using a doctored video was called out immediately by Twitter users. \u201cCheats exposed\u201d, tweeted the official handle of Trinamool Congress, attaching the full video. According to TMC, a complaint has been filed before the Election commission regarding the edited video.", "lang": "en"}
