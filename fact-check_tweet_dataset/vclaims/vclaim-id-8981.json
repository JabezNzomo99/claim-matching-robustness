These scams promise luxurious awards for the simple task of liking and sharing a page on Facebook, and since many users see this as a \u201clow risk, high reward\u201d situation, these pages often accomplish their goals of going viral. However, spreading these hoaxes actually has a detrimental effect on social media and can expose people to more fraudulent activity:\n\nBut why shouldn\u2019t you click or share? Where\u2019s the harm in it? One reason is \u201clike-farming.\u201d Facebook\u2019s algorithms in particular emphasize popular content, and therefore gathering \u201clikes\u201d and \u201cshares\u201d receives a high premium. Sometimes, it\u2019s just an annoyance \u2014 maybe that kid really does want a hundred thousand \u201clikes\u201d so that a Victoria\u2019s Secret model will go to a school dance with him, so he\u2019s inundating people with appeals (although that\u2019s doubtful at best) \u2014 but more often, the intent is scammy. Like-farmers will gather clicks, which denote popularity, then scrub the original content and replace it with something else (usually a scammy ad of some sort) to bypass Facebook constraints. Facebook has moved to quash this behavior by adjusting their algorithms, but of course, some scammers\u2019 efforts always get by the online gatekeepers.\n\nIn addition to tell-tale signs of \u201cLike Farming,\u201d there are several other ways to tell that this \u201cLuxury RV\u201d page is a hoax. First, while this message purportedly comes from a business that has been operating for 50 years, their Facebook page was only established on 21 July 2016. Second, the Facebook page claims that it represents Major RV, a company based out of California, but lists its location as Eving, Germany. The lack of contact information on the Facebook page is also suspect:\n\nMajor RV caught wind of the scam and posted on their Facebook page to warn consumers the offer was fake:", "lang": "en"}
