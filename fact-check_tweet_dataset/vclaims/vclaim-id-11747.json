This process, which is reviewed annually, is lengthy and often quite partisan.\n\nU.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., sent out a tweet praising the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2019. He said it \"includes the largest pay raise in nearly 10 years and provides our service members with the resources, equipment and training they need.\"\n\nWe wanted to take a closer look and see if service members were getting everything that Blunt asserted that they would.\n\nThe goal of the act, as stated in its introduction, was to restore readiness and increase capability and capacity in a force that has been asked to do too much with too little for too long.\n\n$17.7 billion to rehabilitate and replace worn out Army equipment. $23.5 billion to sustain, repair and rebuild crumbling military buildings and other infrastructure. $40.8 billion \"to overcome the crisis in military aviation by getting more aircraft in the air.\" Says he requested \u201c10,000 National Guardsmen\u201d for his Jan. 6 rally, but Nancy Pelosi \u201crejected it.\u201d\n\nOverseas Contingency Operations are defined as a separate pot of funding that is set aside and operated by the Department of Defense and the State Department. They are sometimes referred to as \"war funds.\"\n\nThe other large component of the act was to provide a 2.6 percent pay raise for those currently serving. This also extended special pay and bonuses for those in high demand fields.\n\nTo compare the pay raise that service members could receive in 2019 to the ones they have received in the past decade, we reached out to Blunt\u2019s team. It sent us records of the annual pay adjustments for those who have served dating back to 2007.\n\nMark Cancian, a Center for Strategic and International Studies senior advisor on the International Security Program, shared records of military and civilian pay increases, including estimates up to 2023. The information was published by the Department of Defense\u2019s Comptroller in Table 5-12 of National Defense Budget Estimates for fiscal year 2019.\n\nExperts we reached out to agreed that the first part of Blunt\u2019s statement rang true. Although last year\u2019s pay raise is just shy of 2.6 percent, the last pay raise higher that was higher was offered nine years ago.\n\nTodd Harrison, the strategic center\u2019s director of defense budget analysis, said that is is fair to say that the bill fully authorizes the level of total funding that the Department of Defense requested.\n\nBlunt said that members of the military would receive their highest pay raise in nearly 10 years thanks to legislation signed in August. Military compensation records and experts in defense analysis and government spending fields verified that this was correct.", "lang": "en"}
