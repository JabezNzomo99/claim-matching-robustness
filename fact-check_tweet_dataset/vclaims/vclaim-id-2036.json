But we\u2019ve not found any research into how widespread this is.\n\nThe Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has reported \u201cgrowing numbers of nursing staff using food banks, taking on additional jobs and accruing personal debt\u201d. It told us that:\n\n\u201cWe have a network of reps and RCN officers that stretches across the UK. They are in constant contact with members and this is what they report. This is not just one or two cases.\u201d\n\nWe also spoke to the Trussell Trust, the largest food bank network in the UK, which told us that the people who use its services aren\u2019t asked what job they have. So we don\u2019t know how many nurses are being referred to it. But the Trust did say that it \u201chad occasional reports from [its] foodbanks of nurses being referred for emergency food\u201d.\n\nAccording to a press release the RCN Foundation awarded over 500 financial hardship grants to working, retired, trainee, or unemployed nurses, midwives and healthcare assistants in the UK in 2016. The Foundation says that one in four grants went to a full-time nurse. They largely cover cost of living expenses, but from the press release it\u2019s hard to say whether many were given to put food in people\u2019s mouths.\n\nRCN also says that 6,500 trainee nurses were awarded hardship grants from their universities over the last three years, although we haven\u2019t been able to check these figures in detail.", "lang": "en"}
