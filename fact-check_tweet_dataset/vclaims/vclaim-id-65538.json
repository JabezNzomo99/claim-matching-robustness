Not a Latino.\u201d\n\nBiden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, committed to picking a woman to be his running mate. He didn\u2019t specify a woman of a particular race or ethnicity.\n\nThe attack ad was paid for by the Committee to Defend the President, a pro-President Donald Trump group that operates as both a super PAC and a traditional political action committee. According to Advertising Analytics, the 30-second spot aired in several major TV markets, including New York and Los Angeles, on July 31 and Aug. 1.\n\nAs a narrator speaks in Spanish, and as photos of several Latino politicians and political analysts are shown, the translated text on screen says: \u201cWe came from all over. We built skyscrapers and successful businesses. Risked everything, even our own lives, to make America home. But that wasn\u2019t good enough for Joe Biden. He\u2019s promised his party an African American Vice President. Not a Latino.\u201d\n\nThe group ran the same ad on Facebook July 31, as well as an English-language version with a Spanish translation on screen.\n\nBut we found no evidence that Biden made such a promise, and the Committee to Defend the President did not respond to our requests that it provide support for the ad\u2019s claim.\n\n\n\nAt a Democratic primary debate in March, the former vice president pledged to pick a woman as his running mate.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m elected president, my \u2014 my cabinet, my administration will look like the country,\u201d Biden said in response to a question about how a Biden administration would handle women\u2019s issues. \u201cAnd I commit that I will, in fact, appoint a \u2014 I\u2019ll pick a woman to be vice president. There are a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow. I would pick a woman to be my vice president.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s as far as he went. (Biden has committed to nominating a Black woman to the Supreme Court.)\n\nIt is the case that some political commentators and activists have pushed for Biden to choose a Black woman to join him on the Democratic ticket. But he hasn\u2019t said he definitely would.\n\nIn fact, when MSNBC\u2019s Joy Reid asked Biden on July 20 if he would commit to picking a Black woman, he didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI am not committed to naming any but the people I\u2019ve named, and among them there are four Black women,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBiden is reportedly strongly considering Sen. Kamala Harris, former National Security Adviser Susan Rice and Rep. Karen Bass \u2014 who are all African American. But other reported contenders \u2014 such as Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Duckworth \u2014 are not.\n\nAs for Latinas, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has reportedly been vetted by Biden\u2019s vice presidential selection committee. And Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, who also was reportedly on the campaign\u2019s list of potential picks, withdrew her name from consideration in late May.\n\nBiden said he plans to interview the finalists this week, and he is expected to announce his choice sometime before the start of the Democratic convention on Aug. 17.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
