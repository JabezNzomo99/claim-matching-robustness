Other photos also capture the two together, including at a 1983 White House event and 1985 state dinner for Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Fahd.\n\nWhether Trump knew the false nature of the quotation when he shared it isn\u2019t clear. We asked the White House about it, but did not hear back.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s retweet, which simply described the meme as \u201ccute,\u201d earned thousands of shares and likes \u2014 and it was followed by more posts of the meme on Facebook.\n\nThe Twitter account whose post Trump shared \u2014 @reaganbattaiion \u2014 was suspended soon after Trump\u2019s retweet went viral. The verified Twitter account of conservative website Reagan Battalion \u2014 @ReaganBattalion \u2014 claimed @reaganbattaiion was suspended for \u201cimpersonating us.\u201d\n\nA Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment on the specifics of the suspension but said such decisions are determined based on violations of the platform\u2019s rules.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
