For the much-anticipated second session, Raila Odinga the flagbearer of the main opposition coalition\n\non the podium after incumbent president Uhuru Kenyatta kept his promise\n\nAfrica Check looked at three key claims that Odinga made on the drama-filled night.\n\nWhen asked for the source of the claim, Odinga\u2019s campaign team said the figures were sourced from the country\u2019s official data agency, the\n\nOdinga was referring to the decline in purchasing power, Dr David Ndii, who heads the coalition\u2019s technical and strategy team, told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cThat was the point he was trying to make. He wanted to talk about the purchasing power of the poor\u2026 the numbers he was referring to would be the cumulative inflation from 2013 to now,\u201d Ndii said.\n\nDr James Shikwati, who is director of independent economic think-tank\n\n(IREN), told us that his interpretation of \u201ccumulative inflation\u201d as used by Odinga was the reduction of the Kenya shilling\u2019s buying power \u201cby 40%, that is, you need [40%] more to buy the same item\u201d.\n\nKwame Owino, the chief executive of the\n\n, told Africa Check that using total annual inflation was ideal as it \u201calso measures the money growth [while the month on month] just measures consumption on its own.\u201d\n\nTo calculate it, \u201cfind out what the inflation rate was in 2013 and go back and say if I had KSh100 and then it depreciated by 5.7% because of inflation, what would its value be?\u201d Owino said.\n\nfrom the official data agency shows the country\u2019s average annual inflation rate was 5.7% in 2013, 6.9% in 2014, 6.6% in 2015 and 6.3% in 2016. For the first six months of 2017, the average inflation rate was 9.7%.\n\nUsing this data and the prescribed methodology, Africa Check\n\nthat the value of Ksh100 depreciated to KSh105.70 in 2013, KSh112.99 in 2014, KSh120.45 in 2015 and KSh128.04 in 2016. At the end of the first half of 2017 it was KSh140.46.\n\nTherefore, in order to buy something that cost KSh100 in 2013 one would currently need at least KSh40 more. We thus rate Odinga\u2019s claim as correct.\n\nOdinga\u2019s policy chief Ndii told Africa Check that the number the opposition leader was referring to \u201cwould be the average minimum wage, the number in the economic survey\u201d.\n\n, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics says that between 2013 and 2016, the average minimum wage for workers in agriculture - the country\u2019s largest employer - increased from KSh6,503 to KSh7,284, a rise of 12%.\n\nMinimum wage increases for workers in the country\u2019s urban areas also showed an increase of 12% between\n\n, according to the statistic agency\u2019s data. Those in the cities of Nairobi, Kisumu and Mombasa saw their wages rise from KSh15,357 in 2013 to KSh17,200 in 2016. Municipalities had a Sh1,713 rise to KSh15,980 over the same period, while other towns recorded an increase of KSh1,457 to 13,593.\n\nin Kenya\u2019s minimum wage announced in May 2017 had not yet been implemented. Francis Atwoli, the secretary general of the\n\nhowever told Africa Check that this had been implemented through legal notices 111 and 112 on wages published a week ago. The\n\nwas published on July 21, four days before Odinga made his claim.\n\nThe union\u2019s economist George Otieno confirmed this. \u201cYes, the 18% for 2017 has been implemented, though not in full regard because in some workplaces we have had issues of redundancy cases,\u201d he said.\n\nThe wage increase between 2013 and 2017 is thus a cumulative 30%, not 12% as Odinga said, although it is yet to filter down to all workers.\n\nThe figure of \u201c40% is in the\n\nin Kenya from the\n\n\u201cI see it around a lot, but it doesn\u2019t come from our data, because we don\u2019t do an annual unemployment rate. If you want to get the unemployment rate, you have to get the labour force survey,\u201d Ndii told Africa Check.\n\nThe most recent data on unemployment in Kenya is a\n\nby the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, based on 2009 census data. Released in 2012, it put the overall unemployment rate at 9.7% then. (\n\nA survey with the latest unemployment data is being finalised, James Gatungu, the director of production statistics at the agency,\n\nThe director-general of the statistics agency, Zachary Mwangi, told Africa Check that the 40% unemployment rate \u201ccan\u2019t be correct\u201d. (\n\nestimated Kenya\u2019s total unemployment rate at 9.2% in 2015 while the youth unemployment rate (ages 15 to 24) was at 17.6%.", "lang": "en"}
