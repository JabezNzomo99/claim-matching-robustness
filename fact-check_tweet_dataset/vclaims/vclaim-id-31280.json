It actually comes from writer and politician Eugene Ware\u2018s 1889 poem.\n\nShakespeare was a playwright and poet active during the late 16th and early 17th century. He wrote, along with numerous sonnets and other poems, at least 37 plays, including \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d and \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream.\u201d\n\nHowever, nowhere is these works, or any of his other plays, does the statement attributed to Shakespeare in the Facebook post appear. The Daily Caller searched a digital archive of all his plays, as well as his collected poems, but found no similar or matching expressions.\n\nThe Folger Shakespeare Library included the saying in a 2017 list of \u201ccommonly misattributed\u201d quotes. (RELATED: Did Shakespeare Say, \u2018The Earth Has Music For Those Who Listen\u2019?)\n\nThe statement actually comes from Ware\u2018s poem \u201cJohn Brown,\u201d according to the Folger Shakespeare Library. The poem, inspired by the abolitionist of the same name, was published in 1889 as part of his \u201cRhymes of Ironquill\u201d poetry collection.", "lang": "en"}
