We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now, for remaining in the EU. A People's Vote may not happen - so vote now.\u201d\n\nThe government responds to all petitions that get more than 10,000 signatures and parliament debates any that get more than 100,000. This petition has comfortably cleared both those hurdles. It is the most signed parliamentary petition on record.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to sign a petition twice from the same email address\n\nIn order to sign the petition you have to tick a box to confirm you\u2019re a UK citizen, enter your name, email address, the country you\u2019re in and your postcode. A verification email is then sent to you (these emails were being delayed last week due to the high volume of traffic).\n\nA House of Commons spokesperson told us \u201cMany people share an email account with a partner or do not have access to email. To ensure that the petitions system is as accessible as possible, up to two people can sign from the same email address. An email address can only be used twice.\n\n\u201cThe number of these signatures is strictly monitored to ensure that this feature is not abused. The number of these signatures on the article 50 petition is within the normal range\u2014around 1%.\n\n\u201cThe Government Digital Service have a number of ways of identifying and preventing fraudulent activity based around blocking, removing and monitoring signatures as appropriate.\n\n\u201cSome types of fraud are monitored to ensure that it does not affect the integrity of the petition. Evidence of fraud may affect whether the Petitions Committee choose to act on the petition.\n\n\u201cWe do not comment in detail on fraud. Ideally someone who has tried to fraudulently sign the petition would never realise that they have failed.\u201d\n\nWe verified this by testing the petition system, attempting to sign a petition three times from the same email account using different false names each time. On the first two occasions we were told our signature had been added to the petition, but on the third time the system told us we couldn\u2019t sign again as we\u2019d used that email address before.\n\nWe subsequently asked the Petitions Committee to remove our test signatures, which it has now done.\n\nThe Petitions Committee also added on Twitter: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment in detail about security measures. We use different techniques\u2014automated and manual\u2014to identify and block signatures from bots, disposable email addresses and other sources that show signs of fraudulent activity. We also monitor signing patterns.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
