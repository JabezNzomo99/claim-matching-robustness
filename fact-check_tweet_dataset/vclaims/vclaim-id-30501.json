The speech initially referred to the collective Cross Country operations, he said, but it was then changed to only focus on this year\u2019s effort \u2014 and officials failed to correct the figures. He said the sentence was originally supposed to say: \u201cCollectively, thousands of law enforcement officers from hundreds of agencies have participated in the Cross Country operations, resulting in the arrest of hundreds of sex traffickers.\u201d\n\nThe FBI, for several years, used to reveal exactly how many people were rounded up through Cross Country, essentially exposing the fact that the effort to find exploited children also led to the arrests of hundreds of adult prostitutes and their customers. (By recovered, the FBI says it is referring to \u201cthe removal of the child from the victimization and work with social service entities to place the child victim in a safe environment.\u201d The FBI insists no one under the age of 18 is arrested for prostitution.)\n\nElizabeth Nolan Brown of Reason magazine found at least 300 sex workers were arrested as part of the 2015 operation, by doing a spot check of various news releases by local municipalities, but it\u2019s an incomplete list. We also have no data for the 2012 operation. But overall, the numbers suggest that at least 6,000 adult sex workers\u2013and probably far more\u2013have been rounded up as part of an effort that found 738 children engaged in the sex trade. That\u2019s an 8:1 ratio.\n\nIn some cities, the ratio is startling. During the 2015 operation, for instance, the Sacramento FBI field office announced that it had located five underage children, seven pimps and also arrested 90 adults \u201cfor various offenses including probation violations and prostitution-related charges.\u201d In Iowa, 10 adults were arrested (five for prostitution and five for soliciting sex), but no minors or pimps were found. In Mississippi, two minors were found, 24 adults were arrested on prostitution and other charges \u2014 and no pimps were arrested.\n\nMoreover, the FBI numbers are based on initial reports but apparently are not updated for actual charges. After Operation Cross Country in 2014, the FBI announced three pimps had been arrested in Anchorage, but Tara Burns, a sex worker activist, filed a public records request and found no charges were ever filed. In Virginia Beach this year, the FBI initially announced 10 pimps had been arrested, but the Virginian-Pilot later reported that two people had been released after determining they were not involved in prostitution \u2014 and two more of the alleged pimps were juveniles themselves. (Juveniles are not charged under federal sex trafficking laws.)\n\nThe Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA) includes language that allows politicians and law enforcement officials to offer such slippery reasoning. In the law, there is a broad definition of sex trafficking as \u201cthe recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for the purpose of a commercial sex act.\u201d But the operational part of the act for federal crimes \u2014 what is used for prosecutions \u2014 says that sex trafficking occurs when a \u201ccommercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age.\u201d\n\nJanie Chuang, an American University law professor who has closely studied the law, said that when it was drafted there was a \u201chuge fight\u201d over whether to include the force/fraud/coercion requirement. \u201cThe compromise was to include \u2018sex trafficking\u2019 (not requiring FFC) as a defined term in the legislation, but to reserve most of the operational provisions of the TVPA (e.g., criminalization, victim protection) to \u2018severe forms of trafficking in persons\u2019 (requiring FFC),\u201d she said. \u201cSo we could use the rhetoric of sex trafficking more broadly, but government interventions would focus on the severe forms.\u201d\n\nAs we have shown from examining numerous local news accounts of the arrests, there is little evidence that many of the pimps arrested were trafficking in underage women. Moreover, two major studies of children in the sex trade in New York City and Atlantic City, funded by the Justice Department, found that 90 percent reported that they had no pimp. That would suggest that even with 738 children recovered, the number of associated pimps (\u201csex traffickers\u201d) was under 100.", "lang": "en"}
