Clarke Jr. is emphasizing his fiscal record over his past decade in office.\n\nClarke will face Chris Moews, a Milwaukee Police lieutenant, for the second time in the Aug. 12, 2014 primary. In November, the winner will face independent challenger Angela Nicole Walker, who is running as a Socialist candidate.\n\nIn a July 27, 2014 interview on Upfront with Mike Gousha, which airs on WISN-TV, Clarke declared: \"I\u2019ve either balanced every budget or we\u2019ve turned back a surplus.\"\n\nBut is Clarke right?\n\nTo be sure, the county is required to balance the overall budget every year. So, to evaluate Clarke\u2019s claim, we are looking at what happened specifically within the Office of the Sheriff's budget. And we\u2019re looking at the final numbers for the year, which reflect actual spending.\n\nAccording to County Comptroller Scott Manske, it is expected that each department lives within the amount it is allocated. Most of the money comes from the property tax levy, though there are other sources of revenue, such as fees and grants.\n\nClarke did not respond to our request for backup, so we turned to County Auditor Jerome Heer. He directed us to the county\u2019s annual fiscal reports from 2003 to 2013. Clarke was appointed sheriff in 2002, but the first full year with his own budget was in 2003.\n\nAll told, the sheriff's office will spend about $78 million this year, compared to $64 million in 2003.\n\nThese are the budget surpluses and deficits the office has encountered under Clarke:\n\nSo, the fiscal reports prepared by the Comptroller's office show Clarke's office actually had a deficit in three of the 11 years. The number for 2013 is an estimate, since the books have not been closed.\n\nHere is a look at the three exceptions:\n\n2003: In Clarke\u2019s first full-year budget, the office ran a $2,393,755 deficit, because revenue from fines, forfeitures, grants and reimbursements came in nearly $2.2 million less than expected.\n\n2012: The office was hit with another deficit, totaling $660,579. A $942,666 difference between budgeted and actual revenues contributed to the deficit for that year.\n\n2013: The auditor\u2019s office has yet to determine final surplus and deficit figures because year-end adjustments are still \"firming up,\" Heer said.\n\nIn any case, Heer said he believes the office's final deficit will be between $162,000 and $217,000.\n\nAnother factor to consider is Clarke\u2019s temporary control over the House of Correction, inheriting a $5 million deficit on overtime pay when he took it over in January 2009. A court ruling unraveled his authority over the House of Correction in May 2013.\n\nBefore Clarke took it over, the House of Correction was its own separate entity that oversaw a $45 million budget and includes about 500 employees.\n\nWhile Clarke cut the overtime spending by 70 percent in his first year, two budgets sustained deficits in 2012 and 2013.\n\nIn an Aug. 1, 2014 appearance with host Charlie Sykes on WTMJ-AM, Clarke rephrased his claim a bit: \"I have a 10-year record where I\u2019ve balanced every budget or some of those years I\u2019ve turned back budget surpluses. Ten consecutive years.\"\n\nThe numbers show it is actually eight consecutive years where the office didn\u2019t have a deficit:\n\nClarke said he\u2019s balanced the budget or returned a surplus to Milwaukee County for every year since he became sheriff in 2002.\n\nBut county numbers show he didn\u2019t in 2003, 2012 and most likely won\u2019t in 2013.", "lang": "en"}
