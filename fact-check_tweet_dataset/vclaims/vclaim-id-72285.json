He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: \u2018You complain, I'll get you deported.\u2019 \"\n\nThis line of attack is similar to one used by one of Trump\u2019s primary rivals, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who in February accused him of hiring \"illegal\" Polish workers on a construction project decades ago. We rated Rubio\u2019s claim Half True because he attributed more blame to Trump and mentioned a separate issue of a legal settlement. There\u2019s also more evidence now to support Clinton\u2019s simpler statement.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1980, Trump hired a contractor to demolish a Manhattan building to make way for the eventual Trump Tower. That contractor in turn hired local union workers as well as 200 undocumented Polish workers to meet the tight deadlines.\n\nMedia reports indicated that the Polish employees were paid off the books, working 12-hour shifts every day for only $4 to $5 an hour without overtime pay.\n\nTime magazine reported that Trump allegedly sought out the workers after seeing them on another construction job, and then threatened through his lawyer to contact immigration services during a dispute over unpaid wages.\n\nIn 1983, union members hired to work on the project sued Trump, a union boss and the contractor for using the undocumented Polish workers to undercut their pensions and welfare funds. The future Republican presidential candidate appeared in court in 1990 and denied knowing that the workers weren\u2019t in the country legally, but a Manhattan judge ended up ruling against Trump and ordered him to pay the workers more than $325,000.\n\nTrump appealed the case, which dragged on for another decade, before quietly settling out of court in 1999.\n\nThe Republican candidate\u2019s alleged use of undocumented workers has continued even into the current presidential campaign.\n\nSeveral construction workers interviewed by the Washington Post in July 2015 said they were hired to help renovate the Old Post Office Pavilion in Washington despite residing in the country illegally. A Trump spokeswoman at the time said his business and contractors followed all applicable immigration laws.\n\nClinton claimed that Trump \"used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.\"\n\nThere\u2019s no question that undocumented workers were hired to do demolition work on the future site of Trump Tower. Questions remain as to how involved Trump was in the construction process and hiring of the 200 Polish laborers, but Clinton is factually correct to say that undocumented labor helped construct Trump\u2019s New York skyscraper.\n\nWe rate this statement as True.", "lang": "en"}
