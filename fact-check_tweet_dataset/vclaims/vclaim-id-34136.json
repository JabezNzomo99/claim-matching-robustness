Only two EU members\u2014the UK and Denmark\u2014have opt-outs established by treaty which mean they\u2019re not required to join.\n\nIn practice though, it\u2019s unclear whether members would or could be forced to do so against their will. Nicola Sturgeon cites the example of Sweden, which has been an EU member since 1995 but still doesn\u2019t have the euro.\n\nMs Sturgeon also cites European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker who said in 2017: \u201cI don't intend to force countries to join the euro if they are not willing or not able to do so\u201d.\n\nUltimately we don\u2019t know what an independent Scotland would negotiate with the EU. If it follows the example of recent countries who\u2019ve joined, it will be expected to sign up to adopt the euro in principle, once it has met the economic criteria for doing so. But then there\u2019s no way of knowing whether or when Scotland would meet those criteria.", "lang": "en"}
