Pandit\u2019s tweet came after JNU ABVP members alleged violence by students associated with Left-affiliated bodies. The highlighted text in the Facebook post reads, \u201cWe are planning to move into phase 2, and work on a flash mob strategy used by Hong Kong, and spread it across cities.\u201d\n\nThe complete Facebook post informs about Shaheen Bagh coordination committee calling off the 20 day-long blockades in the area and remodelling the protests around individual agitations. It reads, \u201cShaheen Bagh Coordination Committee has #called off the blockade that has continued for more than 20 days. Protest will continue in the form of individual campaign to teach community and make them aware of future plan of actions. We\u2019ll call for Bharat Bandh before hearing of the before the honourable Supreme Court. Our Committee and volunteers have withdrawn themselves from the protest site. We request all of you to stop sending any assistance to this stage which has been now hijacked by Congressis, and cash hungry gangs who don\u2019t care about riots and its implications for the community. We are planning to move into Phase 2, and work on a flash mob strategy used by Hong Kong, and spread it across cities. Please share it as much as possible. \u2013 Shaheen Bagh Coordination Committee\u201d.\n\nTwitter handle @RealHistoriPix also posted the same screenshots with the message, \u201cAs per reports, @DelhiPolice has arrested Afzal Hussain Khan, JNU student who planned violence in campus\u201d. Multiple Twitter users have circulated the same claim.\n\nChayan Chatterjee, grandson of Ashutosh Mukherjee, also shared the video with the false claim.\n\nAlt News found that Pandit\u2019s claim about Khan \u2018masterminding\u2019 the attack on JNU is false. Afzal Husain Khan was formerly associated with the All India Students Association (AISA). Khan edited his post after it went viral to clearly state what \u2018phase 2\u2019 meant, \u201cWe are planning to move into Okhla Phase 2. Please share it as much as possible,\u201d the post now reads.\n\nAlt News contacted Afzal Husain Khan who denied having any association with the Shaheen Bagh coordination committee and said that he was merely sharing the statement posted by Sharjeel Imam, one of the organizers of anti-CAA protests at Delhi\u2019s Shaheen Bagh.\n\n\u201cI just shared the statement regarding calling off of the Shaheen Bagh road blockade. It was shared in multiple WhatsApp groups and on Facebook as well. Actually there was much confusion among people regarding the call-off. So I took to FB and shared the same. As of now, I\u2019m not associated with any party or organisation. I don\u2019t know why BJP IT cell picked up my post and is trying to put my life in jeopardy. I\u2019m receiving open threats on FB. I\u2019m being framed by an FB post that has nothing to do with any kind of violence,\u201d Khan said.\n\nRefuting the claim of his arrest, he added, \u201cOn Twitter \u201cHistory of India\u201d claimed that I have been arrested, this is worrisome, my family members, friends and well-wishers are deeply concerned for my safety.\u201d According to media reports, arrests for the January 5-6 violence are yet to be made. Delhi police has however filed an FIR against JNUSU president Aishee Ghosh and named 19 others for \u201cattacking security guards and vandalizing server room on January 4.\u201d\n\nKhan\u2019s post reads the same as Imam\u2019s who had shared the information earlier.\n\nImam\u2019s statement about using \u201cflash mob strategy\u201d was also reported by mainstream media outlets like India Today, Outlook and The Finiancial Express on January 2, 2019.\n\nWhat was the flash mob strategy used in the Hong Kong protests?\n\nAccording to a Reuters report, pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong adopted a \u201cbe water\u201d strategy where demonstrators pop-up in different locations to catch the authorities flat-footed. The strategy has already been mirrored by anti-CAA protesters in Hyderabad. \u201cThe location of the protests, which change daily, are posted just an hour or two in advance, with the exact spots shared just minutes ahead of time,\u201d stated the article published on January 4, 2019. It interestingly also refers to Sharjeel Imam who talks about utilising the same strategy in Delhi.\n\nFilmmaker Ashoke Pandit compared a JNU student with Afzal Guru and put out a bogus claim of Afzal Husain Khan \u2018masterminding\u2019 the violence. Pandit has been found sharing multiple instances of misinformation around the JNU violence. The filmmaker had falsely claimed that SFI activist Soori Krishnan faked injuries sustained in the attack. He also retweeted a video which was shared with the false narrative that ABVP members were assaulted in the violence when in fact the opposite was true.", "lang": "en"}
