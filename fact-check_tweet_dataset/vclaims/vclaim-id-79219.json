Each state gets to decide how poor a household must be in order to qualify.\n\nMissouri covers children newborn to age 1 at 196 percent of the poverty level, meaning babies qualify as long as their families make just less than $40,000 dollars a year. For children 1 to 18 years old, Missouri covers them at 150 percent of the poverty level, or a yearly family income of about $30,000 dollars, according to Medicaid.gov. However, their parents are only covered if they make less than about 18 percent of the Federal Poverty Level, or about $3,600 dollars per year. Says 5-year-olds can \u201ctake hormones and change my sex.\u201d\n\nThe Missouri Department of Social Services charts income guidelines for parents to qualify for Medicaid; it shows the maximum income to qualify for a family of three is $301 dollars per month, or $3,612 dollars per year. We reached out to Koster\u2019s campaign, but did not get a response as to where he got the number he tweeted ($3,504).\n\nCarolyn Orbann, associate professor of health sciences at MU, said it\u2019s important to note that because Missouri has not expanded Medicaid, childless adults are not covered regardless of their poverty level. That\u2019s not the case in 32 other states. \"The states that have expanded Medicaid qualify adults without children who make 138 percent of the poverty level \u2014 in some states, even those who make more than that,\" Orbann said.\n\nIn other words, a woman without children in Illinois or Arkansas could make around $16,000 dollars per year and be covered by Medicaid, but a woman in Missouri with two children making above $3,600 would not.\n\nEven among states that have not expanded Medicaid, only Texas and Alabama had lower maximum income caps for parents on Medicaid than Missouri, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan information source on health issues. Kansas, which also has not expanded Medicaid, covers parents at 38 percent of the poverty level \u2014 more than double Missouri\u2019s 18 percent of the poverty level standard.\n\nKoster may be off by a little more than $100 when it comes to the maximum income a single mother of two can have and still qualify for Medicaid. But his point that Missouri\u2019s maximum yearly income for parents on Medicaid is one of the lowest in the nation is on target.", "lang": "en"}
