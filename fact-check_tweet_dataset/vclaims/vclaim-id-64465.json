Numerous readers contacted Snopes to investigate the legitimacy of such a claim, which was first reported by The New York Times on July 14, 2020.\n\nFirst, we searched for any evidence of the above-mentioned order by the Trump administration \u2014 that his administration announced a change for where on-the-ground health care staff send their observations on staffing and supply shortages, as well as data on testing, bed capacity in intensive care units, ventilators in use, and COVID-19 cases and deaths.\n\nWe found a 13-page memo titled \u201cCOVID-19 Guidance for Hospital Reporting and FAQs\u201d on the website of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department (HHS), of which the CDC is an arm, which was updated on July 10, 2020. Here\u2019s a summary of some of the document\u2019s main points:\n\u2022 In March 2020, Vice President Mike Pence requested that hospitals nationwide send his office daily COVID-19 reports. (HHS Secretary Alex Azar and Deborah Birx, the White House Coronavirus Task Force response coordinator, told journalists in summer 2020 that some hospitals failed to meet that request.)\n\u2022 Without naming the CDC or other agencies, specifically, the memo acknowledged that \u201cmany separate governmental entities\u201d were also asking for the same information and suggested that the variety of requests posed challenges for hospitals.\n\u2022 So in what was framed as an effort to streamline the reporting process, the memo said the federal government was ordering hospitals to send patient information to a centralized database operated by the HHS. (Additionally, HHS representatives and emergency preparedness experts have called the CDC\u2019s system inadequate and antiquated to meet the demands of the unprecedented public health crisis.)\n\u2022 Hospitals with certain permissions would be allowed to continue a former practice of sending daily updates to state health officials or a federal contractor \u2014 instead of directly to the federal government \u2014 and then those groups would report to the HHS.\n\u2022 Methods for submitting the reports under the new protocol include an online portal via TeleTracking, a Pittsburgh-based health data firm selected by the federal government. (Previously, hospitals in some cases were using the portal in addition to making daily reports to the CDC.)\n\u2022 The new guidelines also ask hospitals to report information that they hadn\u2019t previously, including their inventory of remdesivir \u2014 the first drug shown to be effective in alleviating COVID-19 patients\u2019 symptoms.\n\nIn other words, yes, the federal government in July 2020 \u2014 as the country\u2019s number of coronavirus cases surpassed 3.4 million \u2014 modified the guidelines under which medical facilities report COVID-19 patient data and the pandemic\u2019s impact on them. Per the memo, the White House planned to rely on the centralized system \u2014 and that system alone \u2014 for how it would divvy up supplies such as personal protective gear and potential COVID-19 treatments going forward.\n\nIn a special bulletin on July 13, 2020, the American Hospital Association, which represents thousands of medical systems nationwide, urged all hospitals to follow the new reporting guidelines and also stressed the federal government\u2019s announcement that they will be used for distributing resources.\n\nNext, we considered perhaps the most controversial aspect to the viral claim: that the change initiated by the Trump administration eliminated the CDC\u2019s previous role as overseer of COVID-19 hospital information. To that point, the memo explicitly reads:\n\n\u201cAs of July 15, 2020, hospitals should no longer report the COVID-19 information in this document to the National Healthcare Safety Network site.\u201d\n\nHHS spokesman Michael R. Caputo elaborated in The New York Times\u2019 story, saying the CDC \u201cwill certainly participate in this streamlined all-of-government response. They will simply no longer control it.\u201d\n\nThe details of the CDC\u2019s new role were unclear as of this writing, and that alarmed public health officials, researchers, and critics of the Trump administration who believed the new system would give the federal government greater control over what Americans know \u2014 and don\u2019t know \u2014 about COVID-19\u2019s toll on communities.\n\nThat group\u2019s concerns were largely related to unresolved questions over if, or to what extent, the HHS-run system would release the COVID-19 hospital data to the public like the CDC had done \u2014 and whether or not the HHS was going to report the hospitals\u2019 observations accurately. For instance, Thomas File, president of the Infections Diseases Society of America, said in a statement:\n\nNamely, critics of the reporting changes feared they would more easily allow the Trump administration to use COVID-19 data for its political gain, rather than in the best interests of Americans.\n\nKate Starbird, an associate professor at the University of Washington who studies how social media is used to disseminate information during crisis events, said on Twitter:\n\nIn sum, considering the official memo on the website of the HHS that explicitly states that hospitals should no longer report COVID-19 data under a system managed by the CDC, as well comments by officials under the leadership of Trump in July 2020, we rate the claim this claim \u201cTrue.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
