That seemed quite high, so we looked into this figure.\n\nThere\u2019s no official definition of \u201csanctuary.\u201d It generally refers to rules restricting state and local governments from alerting federal authorities about people who may be in the country illegally. Immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility, and state and local law enforcement can decide how much they want to cooperate with the federal government for immigration enforcement. (For more, check out our explainer and this graphic.)\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) can issue an \u201cimmigration detainer,\u201d which is a request to be notified when a noncitizen is being released at state or local levels. It\u2019s voluntary for these agencies to comply with an ICE detainer. If they comply, they hold noncitizens for up to 48 hours beyond the time they otherwise would have been released. ICE can take custody and figure out whether the inmate should be deported. If ICE doesn\u2019t take action during that 48-hour window, the local or state agency is required to release them.\n\nThe researchers said it was referring to whether cities should comply with immigration detainers, and did not suggest that undocumented immigrants arrested for crimes should automatically be deported, or that federal funding should be cut off. As we described above, cities have to release inmates if ICE doesn\u2019t take custody after 48 hours.\n\nThe use of the word \u201ccrime\u201d and \u201carrests\u201d could bring to mind violent crimes, our friends at PolitiFact noted. But not all these arrests are of noncitizens suspected of violent crimes, or even convicted of any crimes. And some cities still cooperate with federal authorities to prosecute or identify violent criminals.\n\nThere\u2019s not a lot of research on public opinion of sanctuary cities. But two reliable polls have found mixed public opinion in response to more nuanced questions about sanctuary cities, or when specifically asked about pulling federal funding from sanctuary cities (which the administration wants to do).\n\n\u201d \u2018Sanctuary City\u2019 is a term used to describe U.S. cities which do not enforce immigration laws and allow undocumented immigrants to live there and, in many cases, receive services. Which comes closer to your opinion? Undocumented immigrants should be deported so there is no reason to have sanctuary cities. Sanctuary cities are needed to provide services to undocumented immigrants while they are in this country.\u201d Response: 41 percent believed there was no reason to have them, and 50 percent believed they are needed.\n\nThere\u2019s no perfect polling question, and we recognize sanctuary policies and immigration detainers are not easily distilled into one question. It\u2019s clear that public opinion on sanctuary policies varies based on how you ask the question, and what exactly you ask about such policies. Criminality is a major factor, so questions that involve \u201ccrime\u201d and \u201carrests\u201d may elicit stronger responses against sanctuary policies.\n\nAmericans\u2019 attitudes are far more varied and complex on this issue than Spicer\u2019s definitive claim that \u201c80 percent\u201d of Americans \u201cdon\u2019t support sanctuary cities, they don\u2019t want their tax dollars used to finance people who are in this country illegally.\u201d The administration should not necessarily think that such a large percentage of Americans support its restrictions on sanctuary cities.", "lang": "en"}
