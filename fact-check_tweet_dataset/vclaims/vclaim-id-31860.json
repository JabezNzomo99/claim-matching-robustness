It may be a version of a quote by environmentalist writer Edward Abbey.\n\nThis falsely-attributed quote has been circulating on the internet and elsewhere for years. In fact, Energy Secretary Rick Perry cited Paine as the source of the quote in a February 2015 speech.\n\nHowever, there is no record of Paine ever writing or speaking these words; it appears nowhere in his collected works. The quote has come to the attention of the Thomas Paine National Historical Association, which includes it in a list of quotes \u201cNOT from Thomas Paine\u201d on its website.\n\nAccording to etymologist Barry Popik, the quote may have originated with Abbey, an American environmentalist and anarchist author who passed away in 1989. \u201cA patriot must always be ready to defend his country against his government,\u201d he wrote in his 1989 work \u201cA Voice Crying in the Wilderness.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
