What would happen if Christians don\u2019t obey?\n\n\"If Christians don\u2019t support Trump, they are risking the wrath of God,\" the story quoted Copeland as saying. \"Trump has been chosen by God, and by rejecting him, they are rejecting God. They could be punished with barrenness, poverty, or even having a gay child.\"\n\nOf course, Copeland didn\u2019t say this, because the story is fake.\n\nCopeland did support Trump prior to the election, and served as one of the billionaire\u2019s faith advisers during the presidential campaign. He also told followers in October 2016 that there would be consequences for skipping a vote for Trump.\n\n\"You\u2019re going to be guilty of murder,\" he said on a TV program. \"You\u2019re going to be guilty of an abomination of God. You\u2019re going to be guilty of every baby that\u2019s aborted from this election forward.\"\n\nAlternativeMediaSyndicate.com didn\u2019t indicate its post was fake, but the site is known to carry bogus stories. We tried to contact the website through their contact form, but did not get a reply.\n\nIt appears that the site took the story (rearranging it a bit) from a parody site called BizStandardNews.com. The original post was dated Aug. 10, 2016, before Trump became president, and didn\u2019t refer to him as the chief executive.\n\nThe Business Standard News, complete with a \"BS\" logo, noted that it made up its stories.\n\n\"The Business Standard News is a satirical site designed to parody the 24-hour news cycle,\" the site said on its \"About\" link. \"The stories are outlandish, but reality is so strange nowadays they could be true.\"\n\nThat BizStandardNews.com story also included references to evangelical Trump supporter David Barton, the founder of the group WallBuilders.\n\nBarton did say on on Aug. 10 that Christians would \"answer to God\" if they didn\u2019t exercise their God-given responsibility to vote, supporting Trump. References to Barton were edited out of the version appropriated by AlternativeMediaSyndicate.com.\n\nBut again, Copeland didn\u2019t say God would punish Trump opponents by affecting the sexual orientation of their offspring. The quote was made up by a parody site and reused by AlternativeMediaSyndicate.com.\n\nWe rate the statement Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
