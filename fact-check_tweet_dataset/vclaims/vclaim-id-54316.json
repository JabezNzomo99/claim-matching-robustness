It says the sound comes from the same part that had witnessed an earthquake a few days ago.\n\nFacebook user \u201cAfjal Khan\u201d shared the three-minute video and wrote a long caption, part of which says, \u201cThousands in China swarm to hunt for a \u2018mysterious creature\u2019 after hearing \u2018a dragon\u2019s growling\u2019 from the mountains.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. Mysterious sounds were heard from a mountain in the area, but the video with the strange sounds is heavily edited. It was actually a bird singing.\n\nWe found the same video posted by a YouTube channel called \u201cTi\u00ean Nguy\u00ean TV\u201d. \u201cSuper scary sound emitting from a mountain in GuiZhou, China for more than 10 days,\u201d reads the title of the video.\n\nThe archived versions of the posts can be seen here and here.\n\nWe found articles by \u201cexpress.co.uk\u201d and \u201cThe Science Times\u201d regarding the incident. According to these articles, it was on June 20 that villagers first heard a strange sound coming from the mountains.\n\nThe website quoted a local school teacher as saying, \u201cIt hummed twice or three times repeatedly every six or seven minutes. The sound was very deep. I thought it was quite strange as well.\u201d\n\nAfter the video went viral on social media, Guizhou wildlife management station director Ran Jingcheng and his team were deputed to investigate the mysterious sounds. And they did find the source of the sound a yellow-legged three-toed buttonquail.\n\n\u201cIt is hardly bigger than a sparrow and has a disproportionately loud song,\u201d the experts said according to \u201cThe Science Times\u201d.\n\nAs per experts, during the bird\u2019s breeding season, the female buttonquail repeatedly utters the booming hoots which can be heard as far as 100 metres away. To note, no local villager was quoted saying they heard a terrifying roar.\n\nAccording to Chinese media reports, police had arrested four people for doctoring the video. They had also released a video of the offenders.\n\nHence, the strange sound heard in a Chinese village was that of a bird called buttonquail. Some people edited the video with additional sound effects and spread it on social media.", "lang": "en"}
