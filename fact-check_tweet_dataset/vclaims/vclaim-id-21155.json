Having promised \"big news\" earlier in the day, Trump invited West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice to the lectern, where Justice announced that he was changing his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican.\n\nTHINK FACT-CHECKING MATTERS?\n\n KEEP POLITIFACT GOING FOR ANOTHER 10 YEARS.\n\n JOIN THE TRUTH SQUAD.\n\nOn a day when news reports indicated that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had empaneled a grand jury related to Trump, the president also showed defiance about questions of Russian influence. \"The reason why Democrats only talk about the totally made-up Russia story is because they have no message, no agenda and no vision,\" Trump said. He asked the crowd, \"Are there any Russians here?\"\n\nBut the meat and potatoes of Trump\u2019s speech addressed the economy. The accuracy of his talking points was mixed.\n\n\"As president, we are putting our coal miners back to work.\"\n\nThe federal Bureau of Labor Statistics counts 50,800 total coal mining jobs in the United States. The increase since Trump took office? 800. That\u2019s a lot less than the increase of 45,000 Trump had indicated in July.\n\n\"Economic growth has surged to 2.6 percent nationwide. \u2026 Nobody thought that number was going to happen.\"\n\nIt used to be common for the economy to grow by 3 percent a year, but it\u2019s been relatively infrequent for more than a decade. The biggest problem is that the population isn\u2019t growing fast enough. And productivity increases, the other big factor feeding economic growth, are hard for policymakers to predict and control.\n\nEconomists of all ideological stripes told us that it\u2019s possible for the economy to hit the 3 percent target sporadically. The figure was relatively close to that during the second quarter of this year, when gross domestic product grew by 2.6 percent.\n\nHowever, coming close to 3 percent in one quarter is not the same as hitting that mark for many quarters in a row, as was the case in the 1980s and 1990s. Can the economy beat the experts\u2019 expectations on Trump\u2019s watch? Check back in late 2017 or early 2018.\n\nThere was \"3 percent growth in West Virginia. \u2026 West Virginia, you are leading the average.\"\n\nAs the numbers go, Trump is on target here.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, West Virginia\u2019s economy grew by exactly 3 percent, the second-highest rate of any state in the country. That was well above the national average for the first quarter, which was 1.2 percent. (The national data is available for the second quarter, but it takes longer to release the state-by-state breakdown, so we\u2019ve used first-quarter data as the fairest comparison.)\n\nBut while West Virginia\u2019s 3 percent growth is an achievement, it\u2019s only one quarter. In 2016, West Virginia\u2019s economy actually decreased by 0.9 percent, falling by as much as 3.3 percentage points in the second quarter of 2016. Whether the 3 percent mark is a blip or the start of a sustained boom remains to be seen.\n\n\"The U.S. has the highest tax rate on business anywhere in the world.\"\n\nBy framing it this way, Trump successfully tweaked an incorrect claim he\u2019s often made. It\u2019s not true that the United States is the world\u2019s most highly taxed nation, but it\u2019s pretty accurate to say that U.S. corporate taxes are the world\u2019s highest, at least on paper.\n\nThe top corporate tax in the United States is 35 percent, ranking highest among the world\u2019s industrialized nations. But five smaller nations or territories have the same rate, and two smaller ones, the United Arab Emirates and Puerto Rico, have rates above 35 percent.\n\nThat said, the 35 percent rate is only the starting point, given that corporations can use exemptions and deductions in the United States to effectively reduce that rate and pay lower taxes.\n\nThe special counsel \"should be looking at the ... uranium (Hillary Clinton) sold that's now in the hands of very angry Russians.\"\n\nTrump has often distorted the story of Clinton and uranium from 2010.\n\nClinton, as secretary of state, was one of nine federal agency heads to sign off on Russia\u2019s purchase of a controlling stake in Uranium One, an international mining company headquartered in Canada with operations in several U.S. states. It was part of a regular process for approving international deals involving strategic assets, such as uranium, that could have implications for national security. Uranium One\u2019s U.S. mines produced about 11 percent of the country\u2019s total uranium production in 2014, according to Oilprice.com.\n\nBut even with its control of Uranium One, Russia cannot export the material from the United States. Russia was likely more interested in Uranium One\u2019s assets in Kazakhstan, the world\u2019s largest uranium producer.\n\nAs PolitiFact and others have detailed, some investors with an interest in making the Uranium One deal go through have a long-time relationship with Bill Clinton and have donated to the Clinton Foundation. But there\u2019s no concrete evidence those relationships or donations helped make the deal go through. Most of the donations occurred before Hillary Clinton could have known she would become secretary of state. And again, the secretary of state was one of nine agency heads that had input into the final decision, which ultimately lay with President Barack Obama.\n\nKEEP POLITIFACT GOING FOR ANOTHER 10 YEARS.
