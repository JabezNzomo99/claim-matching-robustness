The story comes from a single quote plucked from a longer interview.\n\nWhen read in context, rather than promising to wipe out all student debts, the Labour leader actually admitted that he didn\u2019t have any simple answers to the issue yet.\n\nSo what was said, exactly? And has Labour been misleading students?\n\nIn the run-up to the general election, Jeremy Corbyn made a comment about student debt. Speaking to the NME about the issue, he said: \u201cI will deal with it.\u201d\n\nAt the time, this was not widely picked up on by the national media. But \u2013 where it was reported \u2013 most papers accurately reflected that Corbyn had not explicitly promised to write off all debts. For instance, the Daily Mail said the Labour leader had pledged to \u201creduce or even write off\u201d student debt.\n\nBut then, on Sunday, Corbyn was quizzed about this remark during a BBC interview.\n\nPresenter Andrew Marr put it to him: \u201cIf you are a young voter and you heard those words: \u2018I will deal with it\u2019, you might have thought Jeremy Corbyn is going to relieve me of my debt.\u201d\n\nCorbyn was forced to defend his position, saying: \u201cWe never said we would completely abolish it.\u201d\n\nFor some, this constituted a U-turn.\n\nThe Mail said: \u201cLabour has backtracked on its promise to write off \u00a3100 billion of student debt.\u201d The Telegraph said the party had \u201cretracted its pledge to abolish student debt\u201d. And Alan Sugar called Jeremy Corbyn a \u201ccheat\u201d and said he should resign for having \u201clied\u201d.\n\nSo, did Corbyn really promise to write-off existing student debt?\n\nIt\u2019s true that he promised to \u201cdeal\u201d with the problem of people who are \u201cburdened with student debt\u201d. But this was just one sentence from a much longer interview.\n\nThe full context is important \u2013 and has been ignored by many critics.\n\nHe told the NME: \u201cThere is a block of those that currently have a massive debt, and I\u2019m looking at ways that we could reduce that, ameliorate that, lengthen the period of paying it off, or some other means of reducing that debt burden.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI don\u2019t have the simple answer for it at this stage \u2013 I don\u2019t think anybody would expect me to, because this election was called unexpectedly; we had two weeks to prepare all of this. But I\u2019m very well aware of that problem.\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t see why those that had the historical misfortune to be at university during the \u00a39,000 period should be burdened excessively compared to those that went before or those that come after. I will deal with it.\u201d\n\nIn context, it is clear that Corbyn stopped short of making any specific pledge about completely writing-off all student debts.\n\nIt\u2019s true that he was appealing to young voters by promising to address the issue and trying to reduce the burden of student debt. But at no point did he make any policy commitments. In fact, he explicitly said that he didn\u2019t have an firm answers yet.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, none of the possible solutions he mentioned included wiping out all debt. Instead, he talked about reducing or ameliorating (which simply means to make the situation easier) the burden of student debts.\n\nAnd this was not actually a new Labour position. The party had already said it would \u201clook for ways to ameliorate this debt burden in future\u201d.\n\nIndeed, while Labour\u2019s manifesto promised to \u201cabolish university tuition fees\u201d and said that many young people are \u201cheld back by debt\u201d, it made no mention of writing off student debts, or anything similar.\n\nHave other Labour MPs pledged to write off the debt?\n\nAfter Labour denied changing its policy, two main pieces of further evidence of a U-turn have been circulating.\n\nFirst is a video of shadow justice minister Imran Hussain, filmed during the election campaign. In it, he comments on the fact that Jeremy Corbyn had announced that \u201cevery existing student will have all their debt wiped off\u201d.\n\nSome have claimed that Hussain\u2019s comment appears \u201cat odds with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s insistence that the party never made that specific pledge\u201d.\n\nBut it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that.\n\nThe key phrase here is \u201cevery existing student\u201c. But it seems that some critics have conflated this with all existing student debt, which would include that held by thousands of graduates. Clearly, however, these are two very different things.\n\nThe actual policy announcement Hussain was referring to appears to have been pretty close to what he said it was \u2013 a promise to scrap debts for existing students only, rather than historic debts held by graduates.\n\nAnd this was not a secret pledge consigned to a single YouTube video. It was a major policy announcement that was widely reported in the press.\n\n\u201cTo discourage students who are planning to start university this September from deferring until after tuition fees are removed, we will guarantee to immediately write off their first year of fees.\n\n\u201cStudents part way through their degree will not have to pay fees for the remainder of their course. Part-time students will be covered for the cost of their first undergraduate degree.\u201d\n\nRegarding the debts of people who have already graduated, Labour did not promise to write these off. Echoing Corbyn\u2019s comments, the party simply said they would consider ways to improve the situation for those concerned.\n\nThe only aspect of the policy that Hussain appears to have exaggerated or misunderstood concerns debt already racked up by existing students. The official pledge was to only wipe the debt \u201cfor the remainder of their course\u201d, whereas Hussain said existing students would have \u201call their debt wiped off\u201d.\n\nThis was clearly wrong and misleading. But Hussain made no comment about the far more costly issue of wiping all debt for all graduates.\n\nThe second example that is being cited as proof of a Labour U-turn is a tweet from a shadow minister, Sharon Hodgson, in which she said that Labour \u201ccould write off historic student debts\u201d.\n\nIt seems that this was actually a headline from a Politics Home article, following up from the NME interview, rather than her own comment. But that doesn\u2019t diminish her responsibility for the tweet, which does appear to confirm a policy commitment that had not been made.\n\nThere is no doubt that these words were very misleading.\n\nIn fairness to Hodgson, she did say \u201ccould\u201d rather than \u201cwill\u201d, but that will do little to reconcile any voters who feel misled by her tweet.\n\nCorbyn has not U-turned on student debt, because he never made a commitment to do this in the first place. He expressed sympathy with debt-laden graduates and promised to help ease the burden on them. But \u2013 as far as we can tell \u2013 he never pledged to write off all graduate debts.\n\nFor Hussain, it is more complicated. The main accusation against Labour concerns U-turning on an alleged promise to wipe the debts of all students and graduates. Hussain made no promises about the debts of graduates but, regarding existing students, he slipped up by saying all debt would be wiped, rather than just the future debts.\n\nHodgson, on the other hand, posted a highly misleading tweet. Strictly speaking, it was not entirely inaccurate, but it clearly alluded to a policy that the party had not committed to.", "lang": "en"}
