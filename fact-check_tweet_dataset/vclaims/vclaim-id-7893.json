She said:\n\nThe first couple days I didn\u2019t notice any symptoms with Ernie, but on the fourth day, he was lethargic, unstable on his feet and was drooling excessively. My husband instinctively Googled eucalyptus oil. It stated that it can be toxic to cats and they can\u2019t metabolize it and stated all of Ernie\u2019s symptoms. It also said that without medical attention, it could be fatal! So I took him to the Vet right away!\n\nThe American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) lists essential oils like eucalyptus, orange and lemon (among others) as being among the leading causes for tremors among cats. The group also has warnings on its website for products that may contain essential oils.\n\nAccording to Tina Wismer, the medical director for the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center, cats exposed to essential oils can absorb it through their skin or orally. In some cases, she said, owners inadvertently put them at risk by applying substances with a high concentration of essential oils on their cats while trying to treat other problems, such as an open wound or ear mites:\n\nBefore using products containing essential oils on their pets, she said, owners should make sure that they are labeled for use with that specific species:\n\nOwners using diffusers like Murray did, Wismer explained, should move their cats to another room while doing so and avoid using the device for extended periods of time in order to minimize the risk that oil droplets could get onto their fur. The most common symptoms for cats exposed to essential oils, she said, were drooling, vomiting, coughing, and sneezing.\n\nWhile any animal can potentially have an issue with oils spread by diffusers, she said, birds are even more susceptible than cats:\n\nAnother post circulating online in February 2018 described a dog owner\u2019s account of her pooch\u2019s \u201cacting weird\u201d after being exposed to essential oils:\n\nWe asked Wismer about this case as well, and she told us:\n\nAll pet owners should be careful about exposing their animals to essential oils. Generally speaking, cats have more sensitivity to many toxins, including essential oils, than dogs do, because they have fewer metabolizing enzymes in their liver. With that said, dogs can develop the same symptoms as cats, including drooling, vomiting, sneezing, and coughing, and dogs with prior respiratory conditions can be particularly at risk for more serious effects.\n\nIn 2014, another Facebook user, Julie Muzynoski Miklaszewicz, also shared her story about her cat being affected by a diffuser, though in her case the animal lived, although it suffered chemical burns after knocking the device over.", "lang": "en"}
