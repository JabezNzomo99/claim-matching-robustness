Also, the colour of the two jets was also different.\n\nUpon searching, we found that it\u2019s a French Air Force Rafale.\n\nSo, we started our investigation by extracting the keyframes of the video via InVID tool. We then put those keyframes through Reverse Image Search and after scanning through multiple results, we found a link to a website featuring pictures of Rafale air show.\n\nOne of the pictures on that website resembled the jet in the video. The caption of that image read: AdlA Rafale Solo Display 2016 : AIRPOWER 16 \u2013 Zeltweg, Austria @ Helmut Richter\n\nUsing the caption as the keyword, we then ran another search on YouTube and found the same video which was uploaded on October 1, 2016, titled, \u201cDassault Rafale | MOST BRUTAL JET DISPLAY EVER.\u201d\n\n\n\n The description of the video read: I filmed this at the 2016 Airpower in Zeltweg, Austria. I can tell you, this was the hardest filming I did so far. Man that aircraft screamed like hell.", "lang": "en"}
