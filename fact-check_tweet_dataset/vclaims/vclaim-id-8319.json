The crux of the circular is that the AICTE has scrapped the 75% attendance rule in all B.E/B.Tech courses and is introducing vocational projects instead of mandatory attendance. The circular is addressed to all the directors & principals of AICTE approved institutions. The circular mentions the following.\n\u2022 Latest statistics from a recent survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) & AICTE in late 2017 indicate that 57.43% of the engineering graduates are unemployed\n\u2022 93% of the engineering graduates are unable to code in any of the programming languages\n\u2022 Considering the statistics, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) has decided to scrap the 75% attendance rule from 18th January 2018. Instead, students have to submit a vocational project related to their hobby or subject each semester. The degree would be awarded only to those who submit these projects and complete 3 mandatory internships.\n\nThe alleged circular then goes onto ask institutes to make relevant provisions and that detailed documents would be made available later both on the MHRD website as well as the AICTE website.\n\nAICTE says the Circular is \u2018FAKE\u2019\n\n The AICTE distanced itself from the circular and called it fake . In a communication uploaded on the AICTE website, AICTE said that the circular is misleading & mischievous. The communication asked that the circular be ignored. It also said that a police complaint is being lodged with the cybercrime cell of the Delhi Police.\n\nThe circular is FAKE for multiple reasons\n\n A careful reading of the circular would reveal that it is fake for multiple reasons.\n\nThere is no advisor by that name: The circular was signed by one Prof. G K Gokhale, an advisor in the Policy & Academic Planning Bureau of AICTE. The AICTE website does not list anyone by that name as an advisor in the bureau.\n\nThe 75% attendance rule is not uniform across: Universities that award B.E/B.Tech degrees and affiliate colleges in various states have different attendance rules. Below are the details of attendance rules in some of the universities.\n\nAttendance rules won\u2019t change in the middle of an academic year: Even if AICTE were to modify the attendance rules, they won\u2019t do it in the middle of an academic year. They would do it with effect from a fresh academic year.\n\nThere is no such NSSO report in the public domain: There is no such employability report in the public domain where the survey was undertaken by the NSSO & AICTE.\n\nAll those concerned should ignore the circular.", "lang": "en"}
