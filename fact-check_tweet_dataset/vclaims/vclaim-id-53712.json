Those explanations didn't make sense and appeared to contradict each other, but Trump made the attempt, however confusing, to clarify or distance himself from his original remarks.\n\nIn October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of reports that U.S. President Donald Trump had said his administration was building a border fence in Colorado, a state that does not share a border with any other country.\n\nSeveral major news outlets reported Trump\u2019s remarks, including the CNN, Washington Post, USA Today and Fox News.\n\nColorado\u2019s Democratic governor, Jared Polis, mocked the president on Twitter, writing: \u201cWell this is awkward \u2026 Colorado doesn\u2019t border Mexico. Good thing Colorado now offers free full day kindergarten so our kids can learn basic geography.\u201d Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., also made fun of Trump\u2019s remarks, tweeting out a map of the United States with the southern border crudely redrawn so that it appeared to run between Colorado and \u201c Mexico\u201d:\n\nThose news reports were accurate. Trump did indeed say, \u201cWe\u2019re building a wall in Colorado\u201d during a speech in Pennsylvania. However, he later offered an incoherent explanation (but an attempted explanation nonetheless) for his remarks.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments came towards the end of his keynote speech at the Shale Insight Conference in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 23. The official transcript of that speech can be read here, and the relevant portion can be viewed below. Trump was listing some of the purported accomplishments of his administration when he said:\n\nMassive new investments are bringing thousands of energy jobs to states like Ohio and West Virginia that we mentioned, that we love. New Mexico, which I think we\u2019re going to win. You know why we\u2019re going to win New Mexico? Because they want safety on their border. And they didn\u2019t have it. And we\u2019re building a wall on the border of New Mexico, and we\u2019re building a wall in Colorado. We\u2019re building a beautiful wall, a big one that really works, that you can\u2019t get over, you can\u2019t get under. And we\u2019re building a wall in Texas. And we\u2019re not building a wall in Kansas, but they get the benefit of the walls that we just mentioned.\n\nTrump clearly listed Colorado as one of the states in which his administration was purportedly building a reinforced border fence along the southern border with Mexico, an impossibility because Colorado does not border Mexico.\n\nThe president later attempted to explain his remarks, writing in a tweet:\n\nThat explanation did not appear to make sense. Its punctuation and grammar were confusing and made it difficult to extract clear meaning from the tweet, but Trump initially seemed to be saying that his remark about a border wall in Colorado was meant in jest (because of the initial parenthetical disclaimer \u201cKiddingly\u201d).\n\nThis does not accord with what the video footage shows, which is Trump saying, \u201cWe\u2019re building a wall in Colorado\u201d without laughing, and the audience\u2019s responding by applauding without laughing. It\u2019s also simply not clear, on its face, what the joke was supposed to be.\n\nTrump also seemed to offer a second explanation, that the aggregate sense or meaning of his remarks about Colorado and Kansas referred to people from Colorado and Kansas \u201cgetting the benefit of the border wall.\u201d\n\nThis does not make sense on its own terms, because while Trump did say \u201cWe\u2019re not building a wall in Kansas, but they get the benefit of the walls that we just mentioned,\u201d he specifically said something radically different of Colorado, namely \u201cWe\u2019re building a wall in Colorado.\u201d In Trump\u2019s speech, both states got the benefit of the border wall, but one of them (Colorado) supposedly derived that benefit specifically by having a portion of the wall located there \u2014 which it does not.\n\nThis second explanation also appears to contradict the first. If Trump sincerely intended to say what he said about Colorado, as part of a confusing larger point about the collective benefit to Colorado and Kansas of having a border wall, then how can this be reconciled with his apparent disclaimer that he had spoken \u201ckiddingly\u201d?\n\nWe put this and several other questions to the White House, requesting an explanation of what Trump said in Pittsburgh and a clarification of his subsequent tweet. We did not receive a response.\n\nTrump said \u201cWe\u2019re building a wall in Colorado.\u201d However, he subsequently made some effort to explain or clarify that statement, suggesting he may have been joking (although it\u2019s not at all clear what the element of humor was), and also making a somewhat garbled point about Colorado, like Kansas, getting the benefit of a border wall.\n\nThose explanations did not make sense, they contradicted one another, and it\u2019s still not clear whether Trump intended to name Colorado or simply misspoke. Nonetheless, the president has, after a fashion, addressed his statement that \u201cWe\u2019re building a wall in Colorado\u201d and endeavored, however incoherently, to put some distance between it and himself.", "lang": "en"}
