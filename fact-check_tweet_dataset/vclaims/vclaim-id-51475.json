He owns half the patent,\u201d said Kennedy. \u201cHe and these five guys who are working for him were entitled to collect royalties from that.\u201d\n\nThe claim was then repeated by outlets and media figures like Rush Limbaugh, InfoWars, and Gateway Pundit. Kennedy made the same claim during an interview in April and similarly claimed that the National Institutes of Health\u2014which houses the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, of which Fauci is director\u2014\u201cOwns Half of Moderna Vaccine\u201d in early July in an article he wrote for Children\u2019s Health Defense, an anti-vaccination advocacy group that Kennedy founded and for which he now serves as president and chairman.\n\nThe vaccine that Kennedy was referring to is one being created by biotech company Moderna, but similar claims have been made before. Claims that Fauci had a financial stake in drug Remdesivir were debunked, as was a claim that Fauci and Bill Gates invested in an unnamed coronavirus vaccine. One conspiracy theory posited that Fauci was the first CEO of Moderna and attempted to connect the company with Gates, George Soros, and Jeffrey Epstein. (No such connection exists.)\n\nModerna\u2019s vaccine is a part of the federal government\u2019s Operation Warp Speed, a project that \u201caims to deliver 300 million doses of a safe, effective vaccine for COVID-19 by January 2021, as part of a broader strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics (collectively known as countermeasures).\u201d As a part of Operation Warp Speed, the federal government has committed \u201cup to $483 million\u201d to accelerate production of Moderna\u2019s vaccine. The Moderna vaccine has been one of the most successful thus far, and is one of only three vaccines in the world so far to reach Phase Three of clinical trials, the last stage before approval. It is the first vaccine in the United States to begin this stage of trials. During Phase Three, the vaccine is administered to thousands of volunteers and researchers compare the rate of infection to a control group that is given a placebo. In order to be deemed effective, the FDA says it expects the vaccine \u201cwould prevent disease or decrease its severity in at least 50% of people who are vaccinated.\u201d\n\nAnalysis by Axios found that the National Institutes of Health may own intellectual property that is key to the production of the Moderna vaccine. This finding is backed up by comments made by Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, who said during an interview in May that the NIH has a stake in intellectual property being used in the vaccine. The Axios article, which Kennedy cited in his article claiming the NIH owned half the Moderna vaccine, does not say what percentage of the patent would be owned by the NIH or, indeed, even attempt to put any number on the percentage of the NIH\u2019s ownership.\n\nAxios also found that a disclosure in a pending scientific paper revealed four NIH scientists filed a provisional patent application for a \u201c2019-nCoV vaccine.\u201d A statement the NIH sent to Axios said that the scientists\u2019 contribution to the vaccine was \u201ccreat[ing] stabilized coronavirus spike proteins for the development of vaccines against coronavirus.\u201d Fauci was not among the four scientists named in the paper: Kizzmekia S. Corbett, Nianshuang Wang, Jason S. McLellan, and Barney S. Graham. While these four NIH scientists may receive royalties from the vaccine, federal law prevents their compensation from exceeding $150,000 a year.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health appears to have a financial stake in the Moderna vaccine, but it\u2019s unclear how much that stake is. What is clear, however, is that there is no evidence to support claims that Fauci has a financial stake in Moderna\u2019s coronavirus vaccine.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
