We came across a report by News18, featuring the same video, which was uploaded on their Facebook page on January 13, 2018.\n\nAccording to the report, the incident took place when Bihar CM Nitish Kumar was on his way to a village in Buxar.\n\nOn digging further, we came across several reports suggesting that the incident took place back in January 2018, in which Nitish Kumar escaped unhurt.\n\nReports say that the incident took place on January 12, 2018, when Nitish Kumar\u2019s car was attacked by stone pelters during his \u2018Samiksha Yatra\u2019- undertaken to make a first-hand review of development works in the state, in Nandar of Buxar.\n\nTwo security personnel got injured in the attack.\n\nIn conclusion, the above information proves that the video in question is old and is not related to Amit Shah.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
