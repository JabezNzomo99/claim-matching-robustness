He was raised on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, by a single mother. He grew up in an apartment project and worked his way through school.\u201d\n\nBut Fact Checker reader Michelle Pettigrew, an assiduous researcher who lives in California, was skeptical. She started digging into records and newspaper clips and suggested Cox\u2019s oft-repeated line was due for a fact check. (Note: Pettigrew has donated to Newsom\u2019s campaign and hosted a fundraiser for him.) Here\u2019s what we found, with the assistance of Washington Post researcher Alice Crites and other documents provided by Pettigrew.\n\nCox, a foe of abortion rights, has suggested that his mother was sexually assaulted and that is how he came into the world. \u201cMy mom was a single mom and to hear her tell it, and I believe her, she was impregnated against her will and he married her and he left,\u201d he said in a 2006 interview. Speaking to the South Carolina Republican convention in 2007, he said \u201cif abortion had been legal in 1955, I wouldn\u2019t be standing here.\u201d\n\nCox\u2019s mother, Priscilla, was a grandchild of an immigrant from Bohemia (now the Czech Republic), according to 1930 Census records; her father was born in Illinois and owned a hardware store. (Note: an earlier version of this article incorrectly said her father was an immigrant.) When she was 29, she married Arthur McGinty on April 28, 1951, in San Bernardino, Calif., and delivered a son named Michael a year later.\n\nSix months later, on July 15, John Cox was born, with the name of John Kaplan. \u201cMy real father took one look at me and left her soon after I was born,\u201d Cox wrote in a 2006 memoir. In the 2006 interview, he said \u201cmy real father left when I was three months old.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s where the story gets fuzzy. Cox frequently says he \u201cgrew up\u201d with a single mother, struggling on the South Side of Chicago. But records show that\u2019s not the case. His mother married a third time, to a Post Office supervisor named Thomas Cox, on May 23, 1959, according to the marriage license, which said the ceremony was performed by a minister.\n\nRecords indicate that shortly after the marriage, the Cox family moved to Alsip, 20 miles away in the Chicago suburbs, to a house built in 1959 on one-third of an acre of land. A local newspaper article published in 1961 describes Tom and Priscilla Cox as members of a bridge club; an article in 1962 says they were Oak Lawn bridge club champions. In his memoir, Cox says they had a \u201creasonably comfortable lower middle-class lifestyle\u201d that included traveling to national bridge tournaments. Two more children, a brother and sister, were born in 1960 and 1963.\n\nHis memoir is vague on when his mother remarried but in some interviews, Cox said that he lived on Chicago\u2019s South Side at least until he was six, such as in 2006: \u201cI always say that I spent the first six years of my life in Barack Obama\u2019s district.\u201d\n\n\"I don\u2019t remember my real father since he abandoned us when I was only 3 months old. It was tough being a single mom back then, and it still is today,\u201d Cox said. \u201cAlthough my mother remarried a few years later, I was basically raised solely by my mom. My new \u2018step-dad\u2019 worked nights for the post office and was seldom around. My clearest memories from that time were when I was five or six. When he was around, I remember him as physically abusive and violent. These aren't pleasant memories.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy stepfather came into the picture when I was 6 years old and he was a postman,\u201d Cox said in the 2006 interview. \u201cAnd he was okay. He was not a great stepfather, but he had two kids with my mom so he kind of treated them very differently. And that\u2019s fine; I understand how that works. And he was a postman, and he worked nights and he taught me the value of hard work.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
