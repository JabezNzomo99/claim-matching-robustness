In reality, ABC, NBC, NPR, CBS Chicago, and WTTW (Chicago\u2019s PBS station) have all published stories about this disturbing discovery:\n\u2022 NBC News on September 13: \u201cThousands of fetal remains found at Illinois property that belonged to abortion doctor.\u201d\n\u2022 NPR on September 19: \u201cFate Of Fetal Remains Unclear As Investigation Continues In Indiana.\u201d\n\u2022 CBS Chicago on September 14: \u201c\u2018No One Has Any Answers\u2019: Attorney Speaks For Family Of Abortion Doctor Who Left Thousands Of Fetal Remains On His Property After He Died.\u201d\n\nWe found no mention of this story, however, on MSNBC.com or CBSnews.com.\n\nThe Life News article, which was originally published on Newsbusters under the less sensational title \u201cBozell & Graham Column: Abortion Horrors Buried by the Press,\u201d is attempting to comment on the fact that the story of Klopfer received little attention on national television news broadcasts. And that is true. We searched for mentions of Klopfer on TV Eyes and, as of Oct. 3, 2019, found the vast majority of coverage on this case came from local news outlets.\n\nHowever, Life News\u2019 coverage of this critique is severely misleading. The website claimed that these outlets were \u201crefusing\u201d to cover this story, attempting to \u201ccensor\u201d the truth, and that they had failed to \u201crun a single word about the abortionist.\u201d But, as one can see above, that isn\u2019t the case. Many of the aforementioned outlets did provide coverage of this story, even if it was only on their websites. If ABC, NBC, or NPR were truly trying to \u201ccensor\u201d the truth about this abortionist, they probably wouldn\u2019t publish news stories about it on their sites.\n\nIt should also be noted that Life News\u2019 claim that these outlets \u201crefused\u201d to cover this story is based on little more than an absence of broadcast coverage. Life News provides no evidence (and makes no attempt to do so) to show that anyone in charge of the networks actively forbade reporters from covering the story. Simply not covering a story, of course, is not the same as refusing to cover a story.\n\nNews outlets, especially newspapers with limited space and television news outlets with limited airtime, continuously make decisions about which stories to cover in order to best serve their audiences. PBS News points to five criteria that journalists consider when determining if a story is newsworthy: Timeliness, proximity, conflict and controversy, human interest, and relevance.\n\nAs this discovery was made in Illinois and involved a doctor who performed abortions in Indiana, this story has received a lot of local news coverage from outlets in these states. National news outlets, however, have to serve a national audience and decide what to cover from a wider pool of reporting. The fact that this story did not make it to prime time national television doesn\u2019t necessarily mean these outlets \u201crefused\u201d to cover it, just that other stories were deemed more worthy of airtime.\n\nWhile Life News may have a point when it argues this story deserved more national coverage, claiming these outlets \u201crefused\u201d to cover the story, wanted to \u201ccensor\u201d the truth, and failed to \u201crun a single word about the abortionist,\u201d is simply untrue, as evidenced by the fact that many of these outlets published web articles about Klopfer.", "lang": "en"}
