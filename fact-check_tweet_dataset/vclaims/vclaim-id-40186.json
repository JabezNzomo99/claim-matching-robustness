The Facebook post, which has been shared more than 900 times, features a screen grab of her tweet. (RELATED: Is J.K. Rowling The First Person To Fall Off The Forbes Billionaires List For Charitable Giving?)\n\n\u201c[Fun Fact]: In 1770, British parliament banned lipstick, saying it had the power to seduce men into marriage, which was classified as witchcraft,\u201d reads the screen grab.\n\nHowever, neither the U.K. Parliament nor its precursor passed a law banning lipstick in 1770 or any other year. The Daily Caller found no record of any such legislation in JustisOne, an extensive legal database that contains British parliamentary acts dating back to 1707.\n\nA member of parliament (MP) introduced a bill against the \u201cvice of painting\u201d in June 1650 but it never received a full reading, according to U.K. National Archives spokeswoman Clare Kelly. It was \u201clikely introduced at the behest of a Puritan MP but the Council of State chose not to pursue it,\u201d per the U.K. National Archives.\n\nFurthermore, fears of witchcraft were no longer widespread in late 18th century Britain, making it unlikely that MPs would have pursued legislation on such issues.\n\n\u201cOne of the areas of witches\u2019 believed subversion was, indeed, male sexuality; and so such a claim had some credibility \u2013 a century and more earlier,\u201d said Phillips Stevens Jr., an anthropology professor at the University of Buffalo, in an email to the Caller. \u201cBy 1770 the witch fears had pretty well subsided.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
