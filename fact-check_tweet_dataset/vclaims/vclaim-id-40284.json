The post quickly went viral.\n\nThis may sound like a scandal, but it isn\u2019t. As BBC journalist Joey D\u2019Urso says: the tweet \u201csounds scientific but it's utterly wrong\u201d.\n\nThe reason is that the four polls which found Mr Corbyn to be the winner are not representative of the general population. A good survey, by design, asks a group of people (the \u201csample\u201d) what they think, and tries to make sure that those people represent the wider population.\n\nAll four polls which found Mr Corbyn to be the winner were conducted on Twitter. That means anybody with a Twitter account could answer it, and there\u2019s no way of knowing if those who did are representative of the views of the wider public.\n\nAnd they probably weren\u2019t representative\u2014only 17% of the UK aged 16 or over uses Twitter, and those people are typically younger, wealthier, and more urban than the general population.\n\nBy contrast, the YouGov poll was conducted with a sample that represented the general public.\n\nThe BBC reported the YouGov poll as suggesting \u201cthe public were evenly split on who had won the debate\u201d, while ITV said \u201cA YouGov snap poll suggested 51% of Britons believed Mr Johnson won the debate compared to 49% for Mr Corbyn. Those who answered \"don't know\" were removed from the result, with YouGov adding the figures are so close as to be within the margin of error.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s better to include those who answered \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d, if you want an understanding of perceptions among the public as a whole. Doing this, 48% thought Mr Johnson was the winner, 46% thought it was Mr Corbyn, and 7% answered don\u2019t know.\n\nTwitter and Facebook polls are poor indicators of public opinion, as we\u2019ve written before.", "lang": "en"}
