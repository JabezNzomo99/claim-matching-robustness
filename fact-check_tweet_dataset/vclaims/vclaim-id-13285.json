But Barr\u2019s letter also says Trump was not exonerated on the question of obstruction in Mueller's report.\n\nOn collusion, Barr\u2019s summary states that Mueller did not find criminal coordination between Moscow and the Trump campaign.\n\nHere, Barr quoted the Mueller report directly: \"(T)he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\"\n\nOne important caveat is that it\u2019s not clear from Barr\u2019s letter what level of evidence Mueller\u2019s office considered \u2014 for instance, the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard that\u2019s applied to criminal prosecutions, or some lower bar.\n\nGiven the intense pressure for Mueller\u2019s report to be released in its entirety, we may learn more about precisely what led Mueller to this conclusion.\n\nBut based on Barr\u2019s summary about the collusion question, it\u2019s fair for Trump to say Mueller exonerated him.\n\nTrump went beyond the collusion claim, however, to say \"no obstruction.\"\n\nThat\u2019s where Trump\u2019s claim runs into trouble. Mueller did not take a position on whether Trump obstructed justice in the course of the Russia investigation, according to Barr\u2019s summary.\n\n\"The special counsel did not (...) draw a conclusion \u2014 one way or the other \u2014 as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction,\" Barr\u2019s letter stated.\n\nAnd, in fact, Barr quotes Mueller directly saying that while he found Trump had committed no crime, his findings \"(do) not exonerate\" Trump.\n\n\"The special counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,' \" reads Barr\u2019s letter, quoting Mueller.\n\nThe special counsel left unresolved \"difficult issues\" of law and fact as to whether Trump's actions and intent amounted to obstruction, Barr wrote.\n\nSeparately, however, Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded that Mueller's findings were not sufficient to establish that Trump obstructed justice.\n\nThey noted that the fact that Trump wasn't involved in conspiring with Russia was a factor in reaching the conclusion that Trump did not obstruct justice.\n\nWith respect to the obstruction question, it\u2019s not clear whether Trump\u2019s claim applies to Mueller\u2019s report \u2014 or to Mueller\u2019s report plus the Barr and Rosenstein conclusion.\n\nIn sum: On obstruction, Mueller explicitly does not exonerate Trump, whereas Barr and Rosenstein do.\n\nThe big caveat is that we haven\u2019t seen Mueller\u2019s report \u2014 only a four-page summary from the attorney general. If Mueller\u2019s report is released in its entirety, we may learn new information about the Trump campaign\u2019s activity.\n\nAs some Trump critics have noted, Barr\u2019s summary also leaves unresolved some broader questions about whether Trump had a conflict of interest with respect to Russia. His former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has said negotiations over building a Trump Tower in Moscow continued longer into the 2016 campaign than Trump and his associates have claimed.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Trump\u2019s former lawyer has separately accused Trump of unrelated wrongdoing, namely, engaging in a campaign finance violation scheme involving Trump\u2019s alleged former mistresses. This was beyond the scope of Mueller\u2019s report, and Trump\u2019s possible culpability on this issue remains an open question.\n\nA summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report is now public. Here\u2019s what it says\u2014and doesn\u2019t\n\nHow much is the Mueller investigation costing? (updated)", "lang": "en"}
