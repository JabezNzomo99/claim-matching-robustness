And so our concern is that people on Medicaid can\u2019t get a doctor, and if you can\u2019t get a doctor, what good is your coverage?\u201d We explored the facts.\n\nThe pay raise, which was fully funded by the federal government, expired at the end of 2014. News reports and studies at the time of the expiration showed that the primary-care doctors will see fewer Medicaid patients because they won\u2019t be getting paid as much as they did under the pay raise. Experts warned that the expiration of the fee bump would restrict access for Medicaid enrollees.\n\nMoreover, some 18 states decided to extend the primary-care fee bump fully or partially beyond 2015. It\u2019s not yet clear whether the states that extended fee bumps had better Medicaid patient access to care than other states, said Stephen Zuckerman, senior fellow and co-director of the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute. But so far, the data does not support Ryan\u2019s claim, he said.\n\n\u201cI am not aware of any data source that would tell you one way or another whether the number of physicians who accept Medicaid or Medicare, or private insurance for that matter, is going up or down,\u201d said Julia Paradise, associate director of the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.\n\nParadise said one way to glean that information is by measuring patients\u2019 access to care: Are they able to get basic primary care? Do they have a usual source of care? Have they had a visit in the past year? Paradise warned against looking just at the sheer number of doctors or just the physician participation rates.\n\nMACPAC\u2019s study found adults with Medicaid were as likely to have a usual source of medical care as those with private coverage. Medicaid beneficiaries also were as likely to have seen a doctor in the past year as adults with private insurance. Compared with uninsured adults, Medicaid enrollees were considerably more likely to have seen a doctor in the past year.\n\nBut Medicaid enrollees do face more barriers \u2014 such as delays because of transportation problems and difficulty finding doctors who accept their insurance \u2014 compared with those with private coverage. Medicaid enrollees, on average, face more delays in getting appointments than those with private insurance. And Medicaid patients have more difficulty finding specialists who will treat them, compared with people with private insurance.\n\nExperts who study the data say they have not yet seen evidence that fewer doctors are taking Medicaid patients. One way they measure that is by looking at patients\u2019 access to timely care. The level of access for patients varies across states, and there are mixed outcomes. Medicaid enrollees report facing more problems getting appointments than those with private insurance, and finding specialists. But in general, Medicaid enrollees are as likely to have a usual source of medical care as people with private insurance.", "lang": "en"}
