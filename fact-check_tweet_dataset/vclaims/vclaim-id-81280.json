Mary Landrieu (D-La.) using vivid imagery.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2014-09-28T10:00:13Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-81280", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/09/28/the-nras-over-the-top-ad-stretches-the-facts-with-its-images/", "vclaim": "\u201cIt happens like that. The police can\u2019t get there in time,\u201d the narrator says. \u201cHow you defend yourself is up to you. It\u2019s your choice. But Mary Landrieu voted to take away your gun rights. Vote like your safety depends on it.\u201d\n\nThe ad, which is part of an $11 million election-year campaign to influence key races, itself does not cite a source for its assertion about Landrieu\u2019s record. But the NRA\u2019s documentation cites her vote in favor of the amendment to bolster gun background checks, authored by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) and Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Penn.).\n\nThe amendment, on a vote of 54-46, failed to overcome a Senate filibuster in 2013. (The vote was generally along party lines, though four Republicans voted for it and four Democrats voted against it, not counting Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who changed his vote to no to preserve his right to call it up again.)\n\nWhen The Fact Checker first contacted Arulanandam, asking how the Manchin-Toomey bill would have affected this woman, we noted that none of the statements issued by the NRA concerning the Senate proposal said at the time that it would take away a person\u2019s gun rights. So what was the NRA referring to?\n\nIn an e-mail, Arulanandam gave a specific example: \u201cOne example of how M-T infringes on individual gun rights and takes them away is by limiting who a person can sell a firearm without first asking the government\u2019s permission. Say you have a stalker and you are a located in a remote area and there are limited places for you to purchase a gun in a pinch. Your cousin\u2019s neighbor down the street wants to sell you his shotgun. He can\u2019t if M-T is law.\u201d\n\nWhen we checked with the Toomey and Manchin staffs, we got a different answer. Part of it hinges on whether a gun for sale has been advertised on the Internet or in a publication \u2014 and whether or not you knew it had been advertised. No background check was required if you were unaware it had been advertised \u2014 and simply posting a gun for sale on a church bulletin board would not compel a background check.\n\nWe went back to Arulanandam and, after consulting with the NRA lawyers, he provided us with a lengthy statement that included this section: \u201cA neighbor could still loan or sell a firearm to another neighbor who was a victim of stalking, etc., if they arranged the transaction between themselves outside of a gun show and not by means of a prohibited advertisement, and the recipient wouldn\u2019t have to go through the mandatory check.\u201d\n\nArulanandam stood his ground, insisting that \u201cManchin-Toomey takes away rights that gun owners currently have. If it didn\u2019t, they wouldn\u2019t have introduced their amendment. They were trying to make something illegal that is currently legal. For anyone to claim that M-T doesn\u2019t take away rights that gun owners currently have is untrue.\u201d\n\nArulanandam also cited a variety of other Landrieu votes that he said weakened gun rights. He pointed to a 1999 vote for a bill to tighten restrictions at gun shows \u2014 which failed to pass \u2014 and a 2004 vote on an amendment that also would have required background checks at gun shows. That amendment did succeed, but the bill it was part of (giving immunity to gun manufacturers) never emerged from the Senate. He also noted Landrieu\u2019s vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Sonya Sotomayor, despite what he said was clear evidence that Sotomayor was anti-gun and did not believe in the individual right to own a firearm.\n\nThe NRA has every right to offer its interpretation of various proposed laws, or to suggest that a single change in gun laws would take away a person\u2019s rights. But the vivid imagery of this ad goes well beyond the facts.\n\nThere was nothing in the Manchin-Toomey bill that would have prevented the mother in this ad from buying a weapon to defend herself, even on short notice. Even the NRA\u2019s own lawyers acknowledge that. The same holds true for the other votes on legislation cited by Arulanandam, which were limited to gun-show restrictions. The hyperbolic disconnect between the images on the screen and the practical impact of the law in question earns this ad Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
