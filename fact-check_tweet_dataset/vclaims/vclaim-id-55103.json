The two posts mentioned were flagged by Facebook's Claim Check, a tool that monitors potentially false content.\n\nThis is a rehashed false claim that was debunked in April. As of July 23, the Philippine National Police (PNP) said there is \"no such nationwide lockdown.\"\n\nRappler disproved this claim in April, which, in some cases, used the same text as the one currently being circulated. The PNP then said that circulating information about a total lockdown was \"fake.\"\n\nMoreover, no news reports say Duterte is set to announce a nationwide total lockdown. In fact, as of July 21, he allowed \"limited\" face-to-face classes in low-risk areas pending inspection.\n\nFacebook users have recently been resurfacing false claims that were made in the early stages of the pandemic. The claim that helicopters will fly over Luzon to spray anti-coronavirus substances, another previously debunked fake announcement, also re-appeared this month. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
