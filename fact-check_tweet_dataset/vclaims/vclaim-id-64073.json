He asked the federal appeals court in D.C. to rehear Flynn\u2019s case after the Department of Justice moved to dismiss it, according to ABC News.\n\nFacebook users appear to have shared the photo to link Sullivan to Obama, seemingly in an attempt to imply that their alleged connection factored into Sullivan\u2019s handling of the case. However, the man pictured with Obama is not Sullivan. (RELATED: Can A President Be Charged With Obstruction Of Justice?)\n\nThrough a reverse image search, the Daily Caller News Foundation discovered the photo was published as part of an August New York Post story about the former president and his half-brother Malik. The picture shows the pair in Boston in 1990, according to its caption.\n\nThe post also incorrectly claims that Obama appointed Sullivan as a U.S. district judge. President Bill Clinton appointed him to serve as the district judge for the District of Columbia in 1994, according to Sullivan\u2019s biography on the D.C. Judicial Nomination Commission\u2019s website.\n\nThe full Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit heard oral arguments related to the Flynn case Aug. 11, according to media reports.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
