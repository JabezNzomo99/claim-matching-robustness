The claim is false; local police and officials told AFP no such crime had been reported in the area; the hospital the youth was purportedly taken to does not exist.\n\nThe video was published in this Facebook post on August 2, 2019, where it was viewed more than 55,000 times before it was deleted.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post's Sinhalese caption translates to English as: \u201cA Sinhalese hacked in Maharagama\u201d.\n\nIn the five minute, 18 second video, a man dressed as a Buddhist monk speaks to the camera. During the first two minutes of the clip, his comments in Sinhalese translate to English as:\n\n\u201cMay the Triple Gems bless you all! Not sure if you are aware, but an incident has occurred in Maharagama\u2026 The night before yesterday, at around 11.30, a Sinhala youth has been hacked by a group of Muslims and the victim is currently receiving treatment at the Intensive Care Unit of the Maharagama Hospital. We have heard this from confidential sources. The youth had been hacked because he opened a shoe shop. A Muslim group opened another shoe shop in the adjoining space. The Muslims incurred losses within a few days of opening the shop. Due to jealousy regarding the business success of the Sinhala boy, they had asked the Sinhala boy to close down his shop. But the Sinhala boy had told that he will not stop this venture. The day before yesterday night at around 11.00 when he went to a shop, the group of Muslims had approached him, dragged him into the shop and hacked him. We have received information he is in the Intensive Care Unit. So we ask these dogs, these leaders who are wastes of space, why are you still asleep? This can\u2019t be given to media, reporting on this has been prohibited. None of the page admins who go in search of garbage, talk about this issue. This is the country of the Sinhalese; this is the holy country that Buddha visited thrice. This is not Allah\u2019s country. Various Muslims, good for nothing Muslims, are telling us to stop talking about our community; and that if we don't stop within a month they would teach us a lesson. Remember one thing! This country was safeguarded from parayas until this point because of this robe; it has been so in the past, it is the case now and it will be so in the future\u2026\u201d\n\nMaharagama is a town in Sri Lanka, located in the suburbs of its capital, Colombo.\n\n\u201cParaya\u201d deriving from the word 'pariah' in local context, refers to a social outcast.\n\nThe same video was also shared here on Facebook and here on YouTube with a similar claim.\n\nA similar claim that a Sinhala youth was killed in Colombo was published on Facebook here and here without the video within days of the first misleading post being published.\n\nThe claim in the posts is false; local police and officials told AFP no such crime had been reported in the area.\n\nThe man speaking in the video provides few details about the alleged attack, including the town where it purportedly occured.\n\nAt the 15 second mark in the video in the misleading posts, the man claims the victim was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the Maharagama hospital.\n\nA keyword search found that no hospital with this name exists.\n\nThe only major hospital in Maharagama is the National Cancer Institute of Sri Lanka, which only accommodates patients diagnosed with cancer.\n\nMaharagama Police Officer in Charge T S Meedin told AFP by phone on August 6, 2019 no such incident had been reported to his force.\n\n\u201cI am aware that some social media rumours have been circulating, with claims that a Sinhala youth was hacked by a group of Muslims,\u201d he said. \u201cNo such incident has been reported and neither has any complaint been lodged with the police with regard to any such crime.\u201d\n\nOn August 7, 2019, Treasurer of the Maharagama Trade Association Athula Samarasiri told AFP by phone that no such crime took place in the area.\n\n\u201cOver 257 shops in Maharagama town is registered with the Trade Association. If a crime of this nature occurred, we would definitely be aware of it,\u201d he said.\n\nResponding to claims, also mentioned in the misleading clip, that police and STF protection had been provided to Muslim shops, he said special security has not been provided to any of the shops in the town.\n\n\u201cFollowing Easter attacks security measures have been in place but we would definitely be aware if one or more shops separately received additional security. Such claims are simply not true!\u201d he said.\n\nSamarasiri was refering to attacks on Easter Sunday 2019 in Sri Lanka which left hundreds of people dead. Here is an AFP report in the incident.", "lang": "en"}
