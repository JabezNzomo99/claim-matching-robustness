But the expert in question, Dr. Allen Frances, said he was referring to the effects of climate change.\n\nFrances, professor and chairman emeritus of psychiatry at Duke University School of Medicine, was debating with Yale School of Medicine Psychiatry Professor Bandi X. Lee, author of the book \u201cThe Dangerous Case of Donald Trump,\u201d about the merits of mental-health professionals who have raised alarms about Trump\u2019s mental state. Frances stated, \u201cTrump is as destructive a person in this century as Hitler, Stalin, and Mao were in the last century. He may be responsible for many more million deaths than they were.\u201d\n\nComparing the American president to the dictatorial regimes of Mao Zedong, Adolf Hitler, and Joseph Stalin, which killed millions of people, unsurprisingly drew the attention of members of the news media, who wrote headlines like, \u201cUniversity psychiatrist: Trump \u2018may be responsible for many more million deaths\u2019 than Hitler, Stalin, and Mao.\u201d The backlash on social media was also predictably viral.\n\n\n\n But the follow-up statement to that sentence in the broadcast suggests Frances was talking about a potential rolling catastrophe resulting from the effects of climate change. Frances stated, \u201cIt\u2019s crazy for us to be destroying the climate our children will live in. It\u2019s crazy to be giving tax cuts to the rich that will add trillions of dollars to the debt our children will have to pay. It\u2019s crazy to be destroying our democracy by claiming that the press and the courts of the enemy of the people. We have to face these policies, not Trump\u2019s person.\u201d\n\nIn an email to us after the program aired, Frances stated that he was talking about Trump\u2019s climate-change denial, not the proactive slaughter associated with the likes of Hitler.\n\n\u201cI think it is no exaggeration to worry that the policies that follow from Trump\u2019s reckless climate denial may wind up causing the death of hundreds of millions of people. Our species appears to be on a path to self-destruction, and Trump is enthusiastically leading the way,\u201d Frances stated in the email.\n\nFrances, who is author of the book \u201cTwilight of American Sanity: A Psychiatrist Analyzes the Age of Trump,\u201d was otherwise critical of what he called \u201cmedicalizing politics\u201d and said attributing Trump\u2019s erratic behavior to mental illness stigmatizes the mentally ill and fails to adequately address his policies.", "lang": "en"}
