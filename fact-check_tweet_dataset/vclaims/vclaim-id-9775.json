If that sounds a bit weird to you, you would be right. The story is false and originated on a Spanish satire website and it was later copied by an American site dealing in \"faux satire\", aka \"fauxtire\".\n\nThe English article was published on March 28, 2018 by 8shit.net under the headline \"Vegan Couple Adopts Broccoli Because They Don't Want A \"Flesh And Blood Child\"\" (archived here) and opened:\n\nMario Bostez and Irene Sancho, a couple from Sevilla, managed to adopt a broccoli coming from Japan. The vegan couple had to deal with a complicated process to prove that they can take care of the broccoli by keeping it in optimal conditions. \"We didn't want a flesh and flood kid because we're vegans. That immediately makes you different and raises suspicions\", said Mario. Finally, after the long process they managed to get what they wanted and little Brasicacea is resting in her green-painted room. \"It's better to adopt them when they're little sprouts, since it's less traumatic for them\", Irene explained, who wanted a Japanese daughter. \"In Japan they don't want broccoli, and sometimes they let them go off or abandon them\".\n\nThe Spanish original was published by El Mundo Today in July 2012:\n\nThat site came with a legal disclaimer that read:\n\nTranslated to English it says:\n\nThe portal \"El Mundo Today\" is a satirical newspaper whose sole purpose is entertainment.
