She just came out. Because you know why? What I have been saying makes sense to a lot of people.\u201d\n\nOr at a rally in Denver on July 29, Trump said, \u201cJust like now she wants to try and renegotiate trade deals after she heard I want to renegotiate our trade deals. Now all of a sudden after 30 years, she wants to renegotiate trade deals.\u201d\n\nIn the ongoing campaign, for instance, Clinton was interviewed by Rachel Maddow about NAFTA on March 10 and said, \u201cI have said repeatedly that I would like to renegotiate it. I think there were parts of it that did not work as hoped for.\u201d\n\nReview the trade agreements we already have on the books. Hillary has said for almost a decade that we need to renegotiate NAFTA, and she still believes that today. And she would review all of our trade agreements with the same scrutiny.\n\nAlmost a decade? Some might have believed that her desire to renegotiate NAFTA was the result of being pushed against free-trade deals by Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and Trump. Well, we checked, and Clinton also called in the 2008 campaign for renegotiating NAFTA.\n\nIn one of the primary debates, on Feb. 26, 2008, she said: \u201cIt is not enough just to criticize NAFTA, which I have, and for some years now. I have put forward a very specific plan about what I would do, and it does include telling Canada and Mexico that we will opt out unless we renegotiate the core labor and environmental standards \u2014 not side agreements, but core agreements; that we will enhance the enforcement mechanism; and that we will have a very clear view of how we\u2019re going to review NAFTA going forward to make sure it works, and we\u2019re going to take out the ability of foreign companies to sue us because of what we do to protect our workers.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the pledge to renegotiate was also part of her 2008 campaign website, found through the Internet Wayback machine. This was the first item listed as part of her trade agenda:\n\nIn response, a Trump campaign official noted that Trump has opposed NAFTA from the beginning and that his emphasis on the issue has put free-trade deals on the 2016 campaign agenda.\n\nTrump, of course, earns Four Pinocchios. We suggest that he take a look at Clinton\u2019s campaign proposals before he automatically assumes that any of her statements represent a change in position.", "lang": "en"}
