The proportion of non-disadvantaged children achieving this level was on average three percentage points higher than the proportion of disadvantaged pupils reaching this level in each school.\n\nNationally (mainstream state schools excluding grammars) the difference is around 23 percentage points on average. So the gap in grammar schools is a lot closer to zero, but it\u2019s not quite zero.\n\nThis analysis doesn\u2019t account for variation between schools, or between pupils.\n\nSome schools have only a few disadvantaged pupils while others have over one hundred. But the gap is similar\u2014four percentage points\u2014if you compare the performance of all disadvantaged pupils in grammar schools to all non-disadvantaged pupils.\n\nData isn\u2019t given for schools with very small numbers of disadvantaged pupils, so 49 grammar schools are excluded.\n\nAccounting for pupil characteristics, research published by the Sutton Trust in 2008 found that \u201cpupils eligible for FSM [free school meals] appear to suffer marginally less educational disadvantage if they attend grammar schools\u201d. But it said the effect wasn\u2019t completely clear cut because there could well be further differences between grammar school pupils and their peers not accounted for in the study.\n\nWhether rich or poor, grammar school pupils do well in exams and in life. \u201cThere is robust evidence that attending a grammar school is good for the attainment and later earnings of those who get in\u201d, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies puts it.\n\nBut as we\u2019ve established, there tends to be a trade-off for society as a whole, as there\u2019s \u201cequally good evidence that those in selective areas who don\u2019t pass the eleven plus do worse than they would have done in a comprehensive system\u201d.\n\nWe updated the article, including the conclusion, with the statistics the government said the claim referred to. We also changed the wording of the claim to better reflect the quote.\n\nWe added \"This might reflect more about the types of children that go to grammar schools rather than the effectiveness of the schools themselves.\" into the conclusion. We also slightly expanded on why the Sutton Trust said the effect wasn't clear cut.", "lang": "en"}
