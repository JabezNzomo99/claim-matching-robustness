The Aug. 24, 2020, post described the mass endorsement for the former vice president as \u201cunprecedented\u201d and listed the names of the endorsers as follows:\n\nThe image in the Facebook post was a screenshot of a news release sent out by the campaign for Biden and vice presidential running mate Kamala Harris on Aug. 24, 2020. It\u2019s true that each of the referenced 27 Republicans did endorse Biden for president, although some of them had done so well before Aug. 24, and the meme had the potential to mislead readers by not stipulating that the listed persons were no longer members of the U.S. Congress. (By contrast, the campaign press release stated clearly that the endorsers were former Republican members of Congress.)\n\u2022 U.S. Sen.

Endorsed Biden on Aug. 24.\n\nThe list of names of 27 former Republican members of the U.S. Congress was accurate and authentic. The group comprised just one of several waves of endorsements of Biden by hundreds of prominent Republicans, whose number and significance constituted what could reasonably be described as an unprecedented level of support among former lawmakers and officials for the presidential candidate of an opposing party.\n\nAccording to CNN, a small number of national security officials broke party lines to support Ronald Reagan over Jimmy Carter in 1980, and historically rifts within major parties have, from time to time, grown so bitter that they resulted in full-on splits, third parties, and contested conventions, as the Pew Research Center noted in 2016.\n\nRepublican dissatisfaction with Trump hasn\u2019t yet grown to that level in 2020, but the volume of cross-party endorsement of Biden has undoubtedly been remarkable, as the following breakdown shows:\n\u2022 Christine Todd Whitman, former Republican governor of New Jersey, has launched what she described as a coalition of \u201ccurrent and former Republican elected officials, members of previous Republican administrations, and party leaders\u201d intent on campaigning for Biden. The 79-strong group also includes the former Massachusetts and Michigan governors Bill Weld and Rick Snyder, and three currently-serving Republican office-holders. (The list includes 16 of the former members of Congress named in the August 2020 meme).\n\u2022 Some 232 former officials from the two administrations of former U.S. President George W. Bush have endorsed Biden\n\u2022 42 staffers from U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney\u2019s unsuccessful 2008 and 2012 campaigns have publicly endorsed Biden\n\u2022 76 Republican former national security officials and U.S. ambassadors, including former U.S. Senator and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, have co-signed a detailed letter that states \u201cWe have concluded that Donald Trump has failed our country and that Vice President Joe Biden should be elected the next President of the United States.\u201d (That list includes four names already mentioned in the August 2020 Facebook meme).\n\u2022 Former Ohio Governor John Kasich, a candidate in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, gave a high-profile endorsement of Biden during the Democratic National Convention in August 2020.\n\nIn the 1972 presidential election, John Connally, Democratic former Texas governor and U.S. Treasury secretary, led a campaign committee called \u201cDemocrats for Nixon,\u201d in which prominent Democratic office-holders appealed to voters to reject the populist, anti-war platform of the party\u2019s candidate, U.S. Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota, in favor of re-electing Nixon.\n\nAmong the Democrats who endorsed Nixon were: Connally himself; former Florida Governor Farris Bryant; Nashville Mayor Beverly Briley; Former Boston Mayor John Collins; Frank Fitzsimmons, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; Miami Mayor David Kennedy; and Leonard Marks, former director of the United States Information Agency (a now-defunct federal agency for U.S. public relations overseas). Nixon also obtained public support from John and James Roosevelt, the sons of former U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in 1972.\n\nNixon\u2019s cross-party endorsements included the names of high-profile sitting Democratic office-holders (including the mayors of Nashville and Miami), while Biden\u2019s Republican supporters were largely retired, and none of the 27 names listed in the widely-shared Facebook meme were still in office. Nonetheless, we could not find a previous instance in which dozens of former members of Congress endorsed a presidential candidate from the other major party, outside a scenario in which a party was undergoing a schism.\n\nThe sheer volume of Republican support for the former vice president, along with the prominence and influence of some of those endorsing him (especially Kasich, Snyder, Warner and Dent, each of whom governed or represented potential battleground states in 2020), means a reasonable argument can be made that the overall level of Republican endorsement of Biden, if not the 27 names listed in the meme, has been unprecedented in the modern era of U.S. presidential elections.", "lang": "en"}
