Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nIn the Press Release, it can be seen that the helpline number is given as \u201803-8888 2010\u2019. So, when searched for that number on Google, it was found in \u2018The Star\u2019 news article that the number was set up as a special hotline by the Malaysian Government \u2018to address questions and complaints by the public on any issues relating to the movement control order, which was imposed due to the Covid-19 outbreak\u2019. The same number can be also seen in a tweet by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry \u2013 Malaysia (\u2018MITI Malaysia\u2019).\n\n\n\nThe same press release can be also found on the PMO-Malaysia website. So, the press release was not issued by the Indian Government.\n\nA lot of people are sharing the document on social media claiming that it was released by the Indian Government. If one looks at carefully, there are many clues in the document which suggest that it was not issued by the Indian Government. Some of those clues can be found in the picture below:\n\u2022 No such regulations as mentioned in the press release exist in India\n\u2022 Police & Department volunteers in Malaysia are called PDRM and there is no such thing in India.\n\u2022 The phone number mentioned does not belong to India\n\nAlso, the Press Information Bureau of India and Prasar Bharati News Services has tweeted that \u2018no such Press Release has been issued by PMO-India\u2019.\n\nTo sum it up, the press release on movement restriction for the COVID-19 outbreak was issued by PMO-Malaysia, not PMO-India.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
