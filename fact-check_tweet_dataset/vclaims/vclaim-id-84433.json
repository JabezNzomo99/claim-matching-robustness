The rightwing portal, set up around a year ago by Vivek Shetty regularly features \u201cnews\u201d that is in line with the nationalist agenda. With eye-catching headlines and provocatively worded content, Postcard News makes no attempt to hide its obvious attempt to further the pro-government, pro-Hindutva propaganda. Its articles are widely shared among like-minded people though, of late, a steady discontent is building up.\n\nA few days ago, a Twitter user, @rishiuvaach tweeted that another user, Saurabh Jha (@saurabhjha12), is getting abusive and threatening calls from owner of the postcard news portal. \u201cIf something wrong happens with @saurabhjha12 or me, world should know the culprit\u201d, he tweeted.\n\nThe altercation apparently started when Postcard News was accused of carrying advertisements from porn sites. @rishiuvaach posted a video proof of the advertisements carried by Postcard News to boost its revenues.\n\nThis accusation was denied by Postcard News and it is not clear how it escalated into the alleged threats. When asked \u201cbut why would Postcard be against you, they are not secular media\u201d, @rishiuvaach responded, \u201cOur one mistake.. put one post showing that portal is using adult ads from MGID ads panel for making money\u201d.\n\nAs the news of threats spread, there was a sharp reaction among the right-wingers with another Twitter user @muglikar_ tweeting that he will unfollow and block anyone who shares links of Postcard News.\n\nAnother tweet aptly summed up Postcard news and its style of operation.\n\nThe drama continued to unfold with Vivek Shetty writing an emotional facebook post. He accused fellow right-wingers of attacking him and his work, questioning his integrity and lack of knowledge. \u201cIt is time to say goodbye to facebook\u201d, he said.\n\nHe was however back after one day, \u201cthanks to all the love, unflinching support and trust\u201d he received from his followers.\n\nPostcard News is not new to controversy. In December 2016, postcard news was accused of carrying articles copied from another rightwing platform, OpIndia. In a series of tweets, @bwoyblunder from OpIndia accused postcard news of plagiarising their content. In the first case,they reposted an OpIndia article without permission. When confronted, they removed it. A few days later, they did it again. \u201dNext time post a link of @OpIndia_com itself, instead of stealing our content without permission & without even a link back\u201d, @bwoyblunder rebuked them. Despite this, there was soon a third instance of plagiarism. The two right wing sites were at loggerheads. One may not agree with OpIndia articles but they you usually seem to be original work. The concept of crediting other other\u2019s work was something difficult for Postcard News to understand as they continued to argue that they were only spreading the good word.\n\nRecently, Ankit Jain (@indiantweeter), in a set of tweets has called upon fellow right-wingers to raise a voice against Postcard News for its threats and blatant plagiarism. \u201cThis is the time to clean up the system\u201d, he said.\n\nThere is indeed a lot cleaning up required in the rightwing ecosystem. We wish them luck!", "lang": "en"}
