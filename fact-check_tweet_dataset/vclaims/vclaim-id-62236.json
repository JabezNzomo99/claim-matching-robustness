Hoffman took her oath into office on the children\u2019s book \u201cToo Many Moose,\u201d not a Dr. Seuss book. Her proposed changes to Arizona sex education guidelines did not move to teach kindergartners age about masturbation and sexual positions.\n\nThe post, which features a picture of Hoffman being sworn in, makes controversial claims about the Arizona public instruction superintendent, who was elected in November 2018 as Arizona\u2019s first Democratic superintendent in over 20 years.\n\n\u201c\u2018She\u2019 hates the Bible so much that she swore her oath on a Dr. Seuss book,\u201d the post reads, in part. \u201cShe is pushing sex education on kindergartners that includes teaching them masturbation and sexual positions.\u201d (RELATED: Viral Image Claims A Minnesota Middle School Discarded Books Because They \u2018Cannot Be Cleaned\u2019)\n\nBut these claims are inaccurate. Hoffman was sworn into office in January 2019 and, according to The Hill, took her oath on the children\u2019s book \u201cToo Many Moose!\u201d by Lisa Bakos. There is no requirement that public officials swear in on the Bible, or any other religious book, per the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Article VI, Clause 3.\n\nHoffman, who was a speech-language pathologist prior to being elected, said in an interview that she selected the book because it has a lot of \u201csentimental value\u201d to her and was her students\u2019 \u201cfavorite book.\u201d There is no indication her book choice was because she \u201chates the Bible.\u201d\n\nThe claim that she pushed for \u201csex education on kindergartners that includes teaching them masturbation and sexual positions\u201d appears to stem from proposed changes to the Arizona sex education guidelines brought to the state\u2019s school board by Hoffman in June 2019. It is likewise incorrect.\n\nThe proposal, crafted by Democratic State Sen. Martin Quezada, called for striking language from the guidelines about prohibiting the \u201cteaching of abnormal, deviate, or unusual sexual acts and practices,\u201d and adding language that states instruction should be \u201cmedically accurate,\u201d among other changes. The proposed changes did not mention changing the age at which children receive sex education. In fact, the guidelines specifically say, \u201cAll sex education materials and instruction shall be age appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe changes to the guidelines were never implemented, according to media reports. Sex education in Arizona is optional, and the curriculum is determined at the local level, AZCentral reported. Parents, under state law, must opt in for their children to participate in sex education courses, per the outlet.\n\nRichie Taylor, a spokesperson for Hoffman, told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an email that the claims \u201chave correctly been labeled as false,\u201d referencing an Associated Press fact check.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
