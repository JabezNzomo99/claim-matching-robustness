A recent iteration of the claim has garnered over 8,300 shares.\n\n\u201cAt its height, this tree trunk was 2.5 miles across,\u201d reads the caption for this particular post. \u201cThe tree full grown would reach 10 miles into the sky.\u201d (RELATED: Does This Video Show Hurricane Laura Approaching The Louisiana-Texas Coast?)\n\nIn reality, the formation in the image is Jugurtha\u2019s Tableland, a rock formation located in Tunisia near the country\u2019s border with Algeria. The Tunisian Ministry of Foreign Affairs tweeted the photo of the mesa in August 2017. Mesas, flat-topped mountains that are usually wider than they are tall, form via erosion, according to National Geographic.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time social media users have shared posts erroneously claiming a rock formation is the remnants of an ancient tree. In August, a viral Facebook post alleged the Devils Tower butte in Wyoming was one, despite the fact that geologists agree it formed from magma beneath the Earth\u2019s surface.", "lang": "en"}
