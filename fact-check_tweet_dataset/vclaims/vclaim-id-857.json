We've checked the claims in the campaigns' arguments.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-857", "url": "https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-referendum-voting-guide-stronger-trade/", "vclaim": "HMRC has previously estimated that almost 200,000 VAT-registered traders in the UK were importers or exporters of goods to other EU member states. That was in 2012, when there were 2.15 million businesses registered for VAT or PAYE. It\u2019s now 2.45 million.\n\nIt said that the number \u201cmay be significantly higher\u201d once businesses trading in services were added, but didn\u2019t have data on this.\n\nAbout 44% of UK exports in goods and services went to other countries in the EU in 2014. This share has been declining since the 2000s, as exports to other countries have been increasing at a faster rate.\n\nIt\u2019s sometimes argued that these statistics overstate the proportion of UK exports that go to the EU, as a lot of goods pass through ports like Rotterdam before being shipped to a final destination outside the EU.\n\nBoth the Office for National Statistics and the government's review of our EU membership have concluded that it's hard to quantify the extent of this \u2018Rotterdam effect\u2019 or establish whether it's a serious problem for the statistics. That said, the ONS have estimated that it may account for around 2% of all exported goods and services to the EU.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what would happen to this trade if the UK votes to leave the EU. If the UK leaves the EU, the future rules on trade would depend on what kind of agreement, if any, the UK reaches with the EU after its departure.\n\nWe added that the share of UK exports to other EU countries has been declining \"since the 2000s\", to make it clear when the share started to decline.", "lang": "en"}
