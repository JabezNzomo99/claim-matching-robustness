The posts also claim cannibalism in China has caused the outbreak of a new strain of the novel coronavirus. This claim is false; the photo shows a performance by Chinese artist Zhu Yu in 2000 which he titled \u201cEating People\u201d; the same performance has previously been used in hoax reports of cannibalism in China.\n\nThe photo was published here on Facebook on January 28, 2020. It has been shared more than 300 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Tagalog-language caption translates to English as: \"THAT'S WHY THE DISEASE CORONAVIRUS EMERGED IN CHINA BECAUSE THEY MADE DISHES OUT OF BABIES BECAUSE IT SUPPOSEDLY MAKES SKIN FAIRER. WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS COUNTRY ALLOWED TO EAT HUMAN FLESH ?!\u201d\n\nA new coronavirus epidemic, now declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization after spreading to more than 24 countries, has killed at more than 630 people and infected at least 31,000 others in China, according to this AFP report dated February 7, 2020.\n\nThe same photo was also shared on Facebook here and here, alongside a claim that it shows cannibalistic practices in China.\n\nThe claim is false; the photo shows a 2000 performance art titled \u201cEating People\u201d by the Chinese artist Zhu Yu, widely known for his controversial artwork.\n\nA combination of reverse image and keyword searches found this 2005 report published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Press on the controversy around Zhu\u2019s work, which contains a black-and-white version of the same photo.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo, highlighted in red by AFP, found on page 66 of the report:\n\nThe report states, in part: \u201cThe image originally came from a series of photographic documents from an art action entitled, Shi ren (Eating People), carried out by Beijing artist Zhu Yu as a piece of his xinguwei yishu (behavior art) - which is the Chinese translation for performance art or live art. Zhu produced Eating People for an exhibition called Bu heizhuo fangshi (Fuck Off), which took place at the Eastlink Gallery in Shanghai in November 2000.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading Facebook post (L) and the photo from the MIT Press report (R):\n\nIn a 2003 documentary titled \u201cBeijing Swings\u201d, it is said that \u201cZhu Yu has recently come out to reveal that [the performance] was all faked.\u201d\n\nRegardless, photos of Zhu\u2019s work have been used in multiple hoax reports of purported cannibalism in China since at least 2001.\n\nIn this article dated June 2001, Snopes debunked claims that the photos showed human fetuses for sale at a restaurant in Taiwan.\n\nIn August 2019, AFP Fact Check also debunked multiple French posts in which Zhu\u2019s photos were used in false claims that China had legalised the consumption of aborted fetal tissue.", "lang": "en"}
