But that\u2019s simply not true. The appropriations bill he signed early in 2018 included $1.6 billion for barriers, but legislative language was specific: None of the funds could be used for Trump\u2019s border-wall prototypes. Instead the money was restricted to bollard fencing, and it was generally used for replacement fencing. The bill that Trump signed Friday has even more restrictions, listing areas along the border where such bollard fencing cannot be used and requiring mutual agreement with the locally elected officials in five cities and localities before any construction could start. Trump\u2019s border-wall prototypes are still banned under the law.\n\nThis is a Four Pinocchio claim. During his campaign, Trump more than 200 times promised Mexico would pay for the wall, which the administration said would cost at least $18 billion. He also signed a \u201cContract with the American Voter\u201d that pledged he would obtain payment for the \u201cfull cost\u201d of the wall with Mexico. Now he says the minor reworking of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will earn enough money to pay for the wall. That betrays a misunderstanding of economics. Countries do not \u201close\u201d money on trade deficits, so there is no money to earn; the size of a trade deficit or surplus can be determined by other factors besides trade. Congress must still appropriate the money, and the new trade agreement has not been ratified.", "lang": "en"}
