Some posts also misleadingly say the \u201cpatient\u201d is escaping from an \u201cisolation facility\u201d instead of a hospital ( here ). The 14 second video with these claims shows a man running away from two people dressed in white Hazmat suits on a street crossroad while yelling \u201chelp, help!\u201d It has at least 330 shares and 925 reactions on Facebook as of March 11, 2020.\n\nThe claims attributed to this video are false. The video does not show an Italian COVID-19 patient escaping from a hospital nor an isolation facility. While Reuters could not find the original source of the video, a higher quality version of the footage was shared at earlier times on satirical U.S. pages. A geolocation search also shows this video was not recorded in Italy but in Elizabeth, New Jersey.\n\nOn February 27, 2020, the entertainment Facebook page Viral Lads ( here ) posted the video as satire with the caption \u201cWhen you test positive for coronavirus\u201d alongside a laughing emoji a few days prior to the claims linking it to Italy (see here ).\n\nIt was also posted on Reddit in the \u201cR/funny\u201d section by user \u201cu/taylor2121\u201d on March 2, 2020 with the caption \u201cWhat is the coronavirus is going on here?\u201d, further strengthening the notion the video was meant for comedy. The post was later removed by Reddit moderators. According to Reddit \u201cModerators remove posts from feeds from a variety of reasons, including keeping communities safe, civil and true to their purpose\u201d. ( here ). \"Commentary on COVID-19 (as well as the many tangential situations that it has prompted) is considered to be memetic at this point, given that a great many people have taken to intentionally emulating a number of behaviors associated with it. (As an example, please see the myriad images of people posing with Corona beer.) As such, posts about the virus are removed under Rule 2\", a Reddit Moderator told Reuters.\n\nThe video was not recorded in Italy and this was verified by geolocation. There is a flag from Kean University, a public New Jersey University, hanging on a light post, visible nine seconds into the video. The shops in the background of the video (such as \u201cChupitos\u201d on the corner, located at 296 Morris Ave, Elizabeth, NJ) are visible on Google Street View, at NJ27 and Morris Avenue, confirming this was filmed in the town of Elizabeth in New Jersey. Google Street View of the video\u2019s scene can be seen bit.ly/39PdbwE .\n\nAs of March 10, 2020 there were no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Elizabeth ( www.epsnj.org/domain/3176 ).\n\nOver 10,000 people have become infected in Italy in little over two weeks. According to the Civil Protection Agency, the death toll from an outbreak of coronavirus in the European country has jumped by 168 to 631, an increase of 36%, the largest rise in absolute numbers since the contagion came to light ( here ).\n\nThis video does not show an Italian coronavirus patient escaping from a hospital nor an isolation facility. The footage was shot in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Earlier versions suggest it was most likely recorded as staged comedy.\n\nFalse: Video does not portray an Italian Coronavirus patient escaping from a hospital, it was recorded in Elizabeth, New Jersey, presumably as satire", "lang": "en"}
