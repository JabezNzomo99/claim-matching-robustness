He is accompanied by a woman and four children. Later in the video, the man is seen sitting by the steps of a house, slipping on chappals and suddenly standing up and walking away.\n\nThe claim with the video says a miracle \"cured\" the diabled man.

A Youtube channel named 'Pakistan Zindbad' uploaded the same video on March 13, 2018 with the caption, 'Pakistani Beggar is the best actor'.\n\nThe video was uploaded by other YouTube channels with similar captions claiming the video is from Pakistan.\n\nBOOM also found the video uploaded on Turkish news website ShowTv's Facebook page Show Ana Haber on November 20, 2018. While the caption does not mention Pakistan, the anchor at 17 seconds says the video is from Pakistan.\n\nA report published by Gujarati news daily Divya Bhaskar in January this year also says the video is from Lahore, Pakistan.", "lang": "en"}
