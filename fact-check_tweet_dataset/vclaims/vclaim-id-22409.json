According to Naomi Canton who reports for Times of India in the UK, the event was interrupted by four protesters who had \u201cmanaged to evade heavy security to enter Rahul Gandhi\u2019s event\u2026\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to TOI, Shamsher Singh, spokesperson for the National Sikh Youth Federation who had gatecrashed the event with three of his associates said, \u201cWe slipped in through a side door to the venue at 5.30pm as the security was lax. Once inside, security asked us a few questions but we confidently walked through and said we are here for the event. We got a table and sat down.\u201d\n\nMoreover, television news channels have reported that slogans hailing the Congress party were chanted in response to the slogans raised by the Sikh separatists who had gatecrashed the event.\n\nIt has been observed on numerous occasions that videos and/or images are taken out of context and given misleading captions and meanings for purposes of political propaganda. This instance is no different; a disruption was sought to be portrayed as participation and advocacy of a secessionist position.", "lang": "en"}
