As per sources, expecting another petrol price hike\u201d. Akshay Kumar\u2019s tweet on rising petrol prices is timeless. It is as applicable today as it was in 2012 when Akshay Kumar tweeted it. This old tweet was dug out by Twitter users but before everyone could have a good laugh, Akshay Kumar decided to delete it.\n\nWe wonder what made Akshay Kumar delete his tweet. Is it because he doesn\u2019t want to be seen as critical of the BJP government? Is it because he doesn\u2019t want people to learn about his double standards? The reasons for deleting the tweet are best known to him.\n\nSince Akshay Kumar doesn\u2019t want people to see this tweet, he may not be very pleased to know that his tweet is archived for posterity.\n\nMany of those who shared jokes and witty one-liners on social media before 2014 have fallen silent now. So much so that Twitter users compete with each other to dig out old tweets and question the hypocrisy behind their silence.\n\nProminent Bollywood stars who are silent now include Amitabh Bachchan who has not cracked any petrol joke after 2014.\n\nHere is a parting gift for Akshay Kumar. A tweet he forgot to delete.\n\nNow that there is a BJP government in the Centre, we hope that Akshay Kumar is coping well with rocketing petrol prices. We wish him luck.", "lang": "en"}
