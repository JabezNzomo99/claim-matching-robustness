To read the others, click here.\n\nEl Paso Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke, who announced Thursday that he is running for president, had been teasing a presidential bid for weeks.\n\nSpeculation about his intentions prompted the conservative Club for Growth to release a television ad looking to weaken enthusiasm for O\u2019Rourke among Democratic primary voters.\n\nThe ad argues that O\u2019Rourke has coasted through life due to \"white male privilege\" and that he is a far cry from former President Barack Obama, as many have drawn comparisons between the two Democrats.\n\n\"Obama championed progressive causes on campus, seeking to combat inequality and harmful stereotypes,\" the ad stated. \"Beto perpetuated them, casting aspersions on working women whose \u2018only qualifications seemed to be large breasts and tight buttocks\u2019.\"\n\nClub for Growth provided a fact sheet detailing the source for each statement in the advertisement. Sources include newspaper articles and other sources online. O\u2019Rourke did not return a request for comment.\n\nDuring his Senate race, opponents of O\u2019Rourke unearthed a 1991 review he wrote for the Columbia University student newspaper of the Broadway musical \"The Will Rogers Follies\" and shared it with Politico, which reported on its contents.\n\nIn the review, O\u2019Rourke said the play was directed \"in such a showy, glitzy, and ultimately, tacky manner, that one cannot help feeling disgusted throughout the show.\"\n\n\"Keith Carradine in the lead role is surrounded by perma-smile actresses whose only qualifications seem to be their phenomenally large breasts and tight buttocks,\" he wrote.\n\nO\u2019Rourke later apologized for his comments and told Politico he is \"ashamed of what I wrote.\"\n\n\"There is no excuse for making disrespectful and demeaning comments about women,\" he said.\n\nClub for Growth said O\u2019Rourke cast \"aspersions on working women whose \u2018only qualifications seemed to be large breasts and tight buttocks\u2019.\"\n\nO\u2019Rourke wrote this comment in a review of a play for the student newspaper at Columbia University. The language in the ad is misleading, as it implies O\u2019Rourke was speaking generally about all women.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This is one of four fact-checks featuring a claim made in Club for Growth\u2019s TV ad about Beto O\u2019Rourke.
