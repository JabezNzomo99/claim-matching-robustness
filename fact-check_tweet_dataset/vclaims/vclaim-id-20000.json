However, his expected nomination to serve as the undersecretary of the agency\u2019s Research, Education and Economics division is controversial.\n\nWhile Clovis served in the U.S. Air Force, earned a doctorate in public administration, taught economics and public policy at Morningside College, and hosted a conservative talk radio show in Iowa, he lacks an extensive background in science. Critics argue that makes him unqualified for the undersecretary position known as the USDA\u2019s \u201cchief scientist.\u201d\n\nIn the story on USPoln.com, Clovis is quoted saying that he is \u201cproud\u201d that he doesn\u2019t have a scientific background, and was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with his USDA assignment because he doesn\u2019t \u201cagree with anything these people are trying to do.\u201d Clovis, the story alleges, also called scientists \u201cnarrow-minded\u201d and \u201cdumb, regular people with limited vision.\u201d\n\nBut he didn\u2019t really say that. USPoln calls itself a \u201cNews/Satire\u201d website and says on its \u201cabout us\u201d page that its content \u201cmay include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don\u2019t necessarily exist\u201d and \u201cthese articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.\u201d\n\nAs we often see with fake news stories, the one on USPoln was lifted from another unreliable website. In this case, it\u2019s an exact copy of a May 14 story posted on Politicops.com, which falls under Newslo\u2019s umbrella of websites. We\u2019ve written about Newslo stories several times before, as they regularly feature fabricated quotes.\n\nNewslo, like USPoln, calls itself a \u201chybrid News/Satire platform.\u201d But, unlike USPoln, stories posted on Newslo affiliated websites have \u201cfact-buttons\u201d that highlight the sections of its articles that usually come from legitimate news articles.\n\nIn this case, the first paragraph of the satirical story, which describes the \u201cchief scientist\u201d position and Clovis\u2019 background, was mostly taken from the opening of a ProPublica article titled \u201cTrump\u2019s Expected Pick for Top USDA Scientist Is Not a Scientist.\u201d\n\nProPublica, May 12: The USDA\u2019s research section studies everything from climate change to nutrition. Under the 2008 Farm Bill, its leader is supposed to serve as the agency\u2019s \u201cchief scientist\u201d and be chosen \u201cfrom among distinguished scientists with specialized or significant experience in agricultural research, education, and economics.\u201d But Sam Clovis \u2014 who, according to sources with knowledge of the appointment and members of the agriculture trade press, is President Trump\u2019s pick to oversee the section \u2014 appears to have no such credentials. Clovis has never taken a graduate course in science and is openly skeptical of climate change. While he has a doctorate in public administration and was a tenured professor of business and public policy at Morningside College for 10 years, he has published almost no academic work. Clovis is better known for hosting a conservative talk radio show in his native Iowa and, after mounting an unsuccessful run for Senate in 2014, becoming a fiery pro-Trump advocate on television.\n\nThe rest of the Newslo story was totally made up.\n\nClovis is \u201copenly skeptical of climate change,\u201d as ProPublica reported. In a 2014 interview with Iowa Public Radio, Clovis, then a Republican U.S. Senate candidate, was asked if he believed \u201cthat climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities.\u201d He described himself as \u201ca skeptic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have looked at the science and I have enough of a science background to know when I\u2019m being boofed,\u201d Clovis said in the interview. \u201cAnd a lot of the science is junk science. It\u2019s not proven; I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any substantive information available to me that doesn\u2019t raise as many questions as it does answers. So I\u2019m a skeptic.\u201d\n\nBut Clovis didn\u2019t say, as the fake story said, scientists are \u201cdumb, regular people with limited vision who think dinosaurs actually existed and the earth is somehow getting warmer.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nHarvey, Chelsea, and Eilperin, Juliet. \u201cTrump\u2019s expected choice for USDA science job lacks hard-science background.\u201d Washington Post. 13 May 2017.\n\nHuseman, Jessica. \u201cTrump\u2019s Expected Pick for Top USDA Scientist Is Not a Scientist.\u201d ProPublica. 12 May 2017.\n\nUSPoln. \u201cTrump\u2019s Top Scientist Pick: \u2018Scientists Are Just Dumb Regular People That Think Dinosaurs Existed And The Earth Is Getting Warmer.\u2018\u201d Accessed 5 Jun 2017.\n\nNewslo. \u201cTrump\u2019s Top Scientist Pick: \u2018Scientists Are Just Dumb Regular People That Think Dinosaurs Existed And The Earth Is Getting Warmer.\u201d 14 May 2017, accessed 5 Jun 2017.", "lang": "en"}
