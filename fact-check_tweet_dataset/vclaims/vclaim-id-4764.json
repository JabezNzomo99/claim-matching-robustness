We\u2019ve looked at similar claims in the past.\n\nAs of March 2017, HMRC employed around 500 staff to work with \u201chigh net worth\u201d individuals, with assets over \u00a310m, on their tax affairs. It employed another 500 or so staff to investigate the tax affairs \u201caffluent\u201d taxpayers with an income over \u00a3150,000 a year, or assets over \u00a31 million.\n\nIn 2016, The National Audit Office (NAO) estimated that there are around 550,000 affluent and super-rich taxpayers, and within that group they estimated there to be around \u00a32 billion in lost tax revenue, primarily due to tax avoidance and the disputes over how tax law is interpreted. The NAO told us it referred to the amount of tax at risk from wealthy taxpayers at that time, and is not based on a single tax year. Tax avoidance is the exploitation of tax rules to gain an advantage which wasn\u2019t intended by Parliament. \u201cIt involves operating within the letter \u2013 but not the spirit \u2013 of the law\u201d, according to the National Audit Office.\n\nAs of October 2017, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) employed around 4,000 staff to deal with benefit fraud, with around 1,900 of these directly involved in investigations. An estimated \u00a32 billion in benefits were fraudulently claimed in 2017/18.\n\nThese two sets of staff do different jobs in different government departments, so comparing the number of staff in each team won\u2019t give us the full picture of their roles.\n\nHMRC employed roughly 522 full-time equivalent staff in its \u201chigh-net worth unit\u201d as of 31 March 2017. That\u2019s the number of full-time staff there would be if everyone\u2019s hours were added together.\n\nThe high net worth unit deals with individuals defined as having assets (minus any debts) of over \u00a310 million\u2014though until 2016/17 it was those with a net worth of \u00a320 million. HMRC assigns each high net worth individual a \u201ccustomer relationship manager\u201d to deal with their tax affairs.\n\nThese managers are meant to develop an understanding of the taxpayer\u2019s affairs and behaviours and \u201cresolve issues before they submit their tax return\u201d. Not all of the 522 staff will be managers, they also have a team of staff that works with them\u2014in 2015/16 there were 40 managers out of around 400 staff (equating to about 160 high-net worth taxpayers for every manager).\n\nThere are around 550,000 \u201caffluent\u201d or \u201csuper-rich\u201d taxpayers\n\nHMRC employs about 518 more staff to investigate \u201caffluent\u201d taxpayers\u2014that\u2019s people with an annual income of at least \u00a3150,000 a year, or wealth of \u00a31 million or more. The affluent unit is tasked with investigating where wealthy individuals are avoiding or evading taxes.\n\nIn 2016, the National Audit Office reported that there were around 550,000 affluent or high-net worth taxpayers, and that they could account for around \u00a32 billion in lost tax revenue, primarily due to tax avoidance and the disputes over how tax law is interpreted.\n\nTax avoidance is the exploitation of tax rules to gain an advantage which wasn\u2019t intended by Parliament, but which is legal. Tax evasion is an illegal activity where people conceal or misrepresent information in order to reduce the tax they pay.\n\nHMRC estimates that \u00a31.7 billion in tax revenue was lost through avoidance in 2016/17, \u00a35.3 billion was lost through differences in legal interpretation, and another \u00a35.3 billion was through evasion.\n\nAs of October 2017, DWP employs around 4,045 full-time equivalent staff to deal with benefit fraud. Of these, 1,928 full-time equivalent staff are directly involved in investigations.\n\nAn estimated \u00a32 billion in benefits were fraudulently claimed in 2017/18, according to the government. That\u2019s the equivalent of 1.2% of total benefit expenditure. You can read more about types of benefit fraud here.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked DWP for more information about the cases which their benefit fraud team deals with. When we last looked into a similar claim two years ago, HMRC told us its dedicated units were important parts of its work in stopping tax evasion and avoidance, but far from the sum total.", "lang": "en"}
