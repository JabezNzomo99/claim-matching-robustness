The post\u2019s claim is false. The photo actually shows Subianto visiting an evacuation shelter in another part of the country after it was struck by a series of earthquakes three months' earlier.\n\nThe image in the December 28, 2018 post -- shared more than 4,000 times in just over a week -- shows Subianto interacting with people inside what appears to be an emergency shelter tent.\n\nThe post itself says major media outlets ignored Subianto's visit because they are supporting President Joko Widodo -- popularly known as Jokowi -- ahead of April elections.\n\nThe post's text translates as: \u201cNo media reports highlighted this one\u2026Prabowo visits a survivors\u2019 camp in Labuan, Banten. TV stations only favour Jokowi.\u201d\n\nLabuan is a town at the western edge of Java island that was struck by a volcano-triggered tsunami on December 21. Here is a report from AFP about the disaster which killed over 400.\n\nUsing Google\u2019s reverse image search, AFP found the image showed Subianto visiting survivors of a deadly earthquake on the island of Lombok in September 2018.\n\nThe photo, published by Indonesian state-run news agency Antara, appears with a text story headlined: \u201cPrabowo, accompanied by Titiek Soeharto, visits Lombok refugees\u201d.\n\nTitiek Soeharto is Subianto's ex-wife and a member of his campaign team.\n\nThe photo\u2019s caption translates as \u201cPresidential candidate Prabowo Subianto (second-left) talks to earthquake victims in a refugee camp at Guntur Macan village, Gunungsari district, West Lombok, Wednesday, September 5, 2018.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
