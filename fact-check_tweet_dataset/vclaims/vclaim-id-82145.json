In the 2016 rematch, Feingold has reversed course and is now taking the majority of his money from out of state.\n\nJohnson frames this as a broken promise in a recent campaign ad, noting that at the time Feingold\u2019s pledge originated he did not limit it to any time period. Rather, he declared he was making the commitment \"for the future.\"\n\nPolitiFact Wisconsin examined this issue before, giving Feingold a \"Full Flop\" in October 2015 for reversing his position and accepting a majority of his funding from out of state.\n\nThe Flip-O-Meter ruling only examined whether Feingold had changed his position \u2014 which he clearly did. We are taking another look because Johnson now alleges that in doing so Feingold broke a promise to always get the majority of his funding from Wisconsinites.\n\nThe ad is the latest volley on this point, which Johnson has also made in an interview, a tweet and on his website.\n\nIf you ask Feingold now, his pledge was always for the campaign at hand.\n\n\"When I said in 1992, whenever I said that I would get a majority of my contributions from Wisconsin citizens, I made that pledge for that term,\" Feingold said in January 2016 as part of an \"On The Issues with Mike Gousha\" appearance at Marquette University Law School.\n\nLet\u2019s go to the tape.\n\nFeingold stated in a 1992 TV ad that he would \"rely on Wisconsin citizens, not out-of-staters, to pay for this campaign\" -- a promise he touted often.\n\nBut he also took it a step further.\n\nIn an August 1992 primary debate on C-SPAN, an opponent accused Feingold of making a self-serving pledge because he was a newcomer to national races who didn\u2019t have the out-of-state contacts his opponents did.\n\n\"It\u2019s not just self-serving, because I\u2019m promising it for the future,\" Feingold responded. \"I\u2019m saying that\u2019s a pledge that I\u2019m going to keep. I\u2019m not going to get in (office) and go, \u2018OK, where are the PACs and where are the out-of-state contributions?\u2019\n\nThat is clearly not a pledge Feingold is keeping this time around. An analysis of Federal Election Commission data by the Center for Responsive Politics shows 70 percent of individual contributions to Feingold\u2019s campaign during this election cycle have come from out of state. That\u2019s the same number cited by Johnson in the ad.\n\nFeingold has acknowledged the change in position, asserting in an August 2015 interview that keeping the 24-year-old pledge \"makes no sense now\" since the campaign finance landscape has changed dramatically due to a deluge of massive, undisclosed contributions.\n\nWe encountered a similar question in 2014 when the group One Wisconsin Now claimed Walker broke a promise not to take contributions during the budget process -- a claim we rated False.\n\nIn that case, the group misrepresented the nature of the promise.\n\nFirst, the pledge was from Walker\u2019s brief gubernatorial bid in 2006, not his successful bid in 2010. And the promise, part of his first 100 days plan, referred to a specific period: \"Scott Walker will not accept any campaign contributions (from any source) from the time he takes office (January 3, 2007) until the state budget is signed into law.\"\n\nThat\u2019s not the case for Feingold, who repeatedly cited the pledge, said at the time the promise was \"for the future,\" and then went on to follow it for three future campaigns.\n\nMichael Tyler, a spokesman for Feingold\u2019s campaign, declined repeated requests to comment on how Feingold reconciles the \"for the future\" line with his current assertion that the promise, from the start, was only for the campaign at hand.\n\nFeingold used the words \"pledge\" and \"promise\" in 1992 while asserting his grassroots funding plan was for that election as well as \"for the future.\" The future is here, and Feingold has failed to keep his promise.\n\nNot only that, he claims he never said the pledge applied going forward, despite video evidence to the contrary.\n\nJohnson\u2019s ad includes several clips that, while short, are used in context.", "lang": "en"}
