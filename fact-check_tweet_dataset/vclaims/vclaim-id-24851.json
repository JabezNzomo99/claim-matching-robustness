They're businessmen. When I asked if they were sure, they said we have friends who work in the security services, they convey it is so, that it happened while he was on holiday\u2019.\u201d\n\nRubaev would later apologize to the relatives and people close to Berdimuhamedov, saying the Turkmen president\u2019s death has not been confirmed.\n\nRadio Liberty\u2019s Turkmen service also received information regarding Berdimuhamedov\u2019 death on July 20, but was unable to confirm it despite numerous attempts.\n\nReports of Berdimuhamedov\u2019s death would later circulate to larger Russian media outlets, prompting a response from the Turkmen Embassy in Moscow, which called the claim an \u201cabsolute lie.\u201d\n\nThe Turkmen embassy in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, likewise denied that Berdimuhamedov had died.\n\nAccording to media reports, Berdimuhammedov went on vacation on July 15, amid rumors that his ailing mother had been sent to Germany for medical treatment.\n\nThe BBC reported he had not been seen in public since July 5, having failed to meet with the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, at a July 6 meeting in Ashgabat, the Turkmen capital.\n\nCurrently, the fate of Berdimuhammedov remains unclear. While Turkmen state TV aired footage of him on July 21, that video is believed to have been filmed earlier, the Defense & Security Monitor blog reported.\n\nDuring an international health exhibition in Turkmenistan on July 20, a message attributed to Berdimuhammedov was read.\n\nAdding to the confusion, later, on July 23, Erkin Turkmenistan reported that the Turkmen leader had in fact fallen into a coma, with senior officials confident he was dead. That report said sources close to Berdimuhammedov later claimed he had recovered from that coma.\n\nOn July 24, the press service for Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev announced Berdymuhamedov had \u201cgreeted our country\u2019s leader on his birthday.\u201d\n\nOn the same day, Turkmen state TV broadcast previously unpublished images of the president.\n\nOther media outlets have suggested that he might not be dead, but likewise is suffering from health problems.\n\nThe Moscow-based Fergana News Agency, which focuses on Central Asia, reported that \u201cin the event of the president's death, they should not be expected to provide timely and reliable information\u201d due to the strict media regulations in Turkmenistan.\n\nReporters Without Borders called Turkmenistan an \u201cever-expanding news \u2018black hole\u2019\u201d where the government controls all media and the internet is highly censored.\n\nThe current situation is reminiscent of the 2016 death of Uzbekistan\u2019s dictator, Islam Karimov, whose fate was speculated over for nearly a week before state television finally broke the news. underpinning the belief among analysts that authorities were attempting to manage the power transition in the authoritarian state.\n\nAfter the 2015 assassination of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, Russian President Vladimir Putin disappeared for 10 days, sparking rumors about his own fate and the overall health of the Russian state.\n\n\u201cOur political system is totally concentrated on the leader,\" the Christian Science Monitor quoted Nikolai Svanidze, a prominent Russian TV host and member of the Public Chamber of Russia, as saying at that time. \u201cWe do not have a reliable system of succession, so can you blame people for getting scared when Putin suddenly falls off the radar screen?\u201d\n\nA similar dynamic appears to be at work in Turkmenistan related to the reports of Berdimuhammedov\u2019s passing.\n\nJeff Mankoff, Senior Fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Polygraph.info that in a top-down system like the one in Turkmenistan, there are no institutions or accepted rules for leadership transition.\n\n\u201cWhen Karimov died, a lot of his family were pushed aside, and having seen that up close, officials in Turkmenistan or anywhere else in Central Asia are not eager to see that history repeated,\u201d Mankoff said. \u201cSo they want to put a transition plan in place before word leaks out.\u201d\n\nMankoff noted that when Berdimuhammedov\u2019s predecessor Saparmurat \"Turkmenbashi\" Niyazov passed, the process by which he came to power was itself \u201cvery opaque.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a stitch up behind the scenes where it seems that people in the elite were able to hash out a compromise of some kind and that\u2019s why they settled on him,\u201d Mankoff said.\n\nDespite the opaque media environment, Polygraph.info finds the Turkmen embassy's refutation that Gurbanguly Berdimuhammedov has died to be likely true.", "lang": "en"}
