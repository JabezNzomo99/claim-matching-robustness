This is false; there has been no such announcement, and the footage actually shows a Fox News anchor speaking about the death of a colleague.\n\n\u201cBREAKING NEWS: VANESSA BRYANT Recorded her SUICIDE After Depression Attack this Morning,\u201d reads the headline that accompanies the video, which features a BBC News logo.\n\nBut there is no report of her death on the BBC News website.\n\nThe claim came weeks after Kobe Bryant and the couple's 13-year-old daughter Gianna died in a helicopter crash in California.\n\nVanessa Bryant spoke at a star-studded, nationally-televised memorial service for the two at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles on February 24, 2020 -- more than a week after the claim first appeared.\n\nThe footage in the video that accompanies the false claim is actually from Fox News, and shows anchor Neil Cavuto announcing the death of journalist Brenda Buttner in 2017.\n\n\u201cI have some very sad news to share with you today,\u201d Cavuto says in the video, which has been edited to cut off after that statement, warning users of graphic content and urging them to share the post in order to see the rest of the clip.\n\nClicking on some versions of the Vanessa Bryant suicide claim opens another video that follows the same pattern, but says that her daughter Natalia killed herself -- a claim that is likewise false.\n\n\u201cBREAKING NEWS: KOBE BRYANT's ELDEST DAUGHTER 'NATALIA BRYANT' left a 'Suicide VIDEO' of Herself 'COMMITTING SUICIDE' After BEING BULLIED\u2026\u201d reads the headline that accompanies that video, which, like the claim about her mother, features a BBC News logo.\n\nThere are, however, no reports of Natalia Bryant\u2019s death on the BBC News website or elsewhere.\n\nThe video shows another anchor saying: \u201cWell, tonight the shock is still raw for fans.\u201d It then prompts viewers that they must share the post to see the remainder.\n\nThe footage in the video is actually from Fox 32 Chicago, a network affiliate, and shows anchor Dawn Hasbrouck in a years-old clip.\n\n\u201cThe graphics in that clip are at least five years old, and we haven\u2019t used them in a long time,\u201d Will Hager, a digital content creator at FOX 32 Chicago, told AFP by phone. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really a dated video. Dawn looks different now. Everything is different.\u201d\n\nNeither Bryant nor a representative could immediately be reached for comment about either of the false claims.\n\nNews outlets including Snopes and PolitiFact have also debunked the claims about the two members of the Bryant family dying by suicide.", "lang": "en"}
