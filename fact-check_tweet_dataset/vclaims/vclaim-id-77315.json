I\u2019m my own strategist, and it wasn\u2019t like I was going to change strategies because I was facing crooked Hillary.\n\n\"Steve is a good guy, but I told them to straighten it out or I will,\" Trump said.\n\nThat\u2019s an altogether different story than Trump told when he first hired Bannon, a former top editor at the conservative website Breitbart, onto his campaign staff last fall. It also directly contradicts the public record.\n\nTrump announced the hiring of Bannon and adviser Kellyanne Conway as part of the Trump campaign on Aug. 17, 2016. Here\u2019s what he said at that time:\n\n\"I have known Steve and Kellyanne both for many years. They are extremely capable, highly qualified people who love to win and know how to win,\" Trump said. \"I believe we\u2019re adding some of the best talents in politics, with the experience and expertise needed to defeat Hillary Clinton in November and continue to share my message and vision to Make America Great Again. I am committed to doing whatever it takes to win this election, and ultimately become President because our country cannot afford four more years of the failed Obama-Clinton policies which have endangered our financial and physical security.\"\n\nSo, in Trump\u2019s own words he either \"didn\u2019t know Steve,\" or he has \"known Steve \u2026 for many years.\"\n\nOne of those claims is clearly wrong.\n\nRebecca Berg of RealClearPolitics provides the answer. She reported the day after Bannon\u2019s hiring by the campaign that Bannon first met Trump in 2011, when Trump was considering whether to challenge President Barack Obama in 2012. In later years, Bannon hosted a radio program in which Trump was a frequent guest, Berg reported.\n\n\"As Breitbart grew, Mr. Trump was constantly in touch with Steve about news articles and doing interviews with his reporters,\" David Bossie, president of the conservative advocacy nonprofit Citizens United, told RealClearPolitics.\n\nThe Washington Post counted nine times that Trump appeared as a guest on Bannon's radio show.\n\nThat version of events is corroborated by The New Yorker. \"In 2011, David Bossie, the head of the conservative group Citizens United, introduced Trump to Bannon; at the time, Trump was thinking about running against Obama. Bannon and Trump met at Trump Tower and discussed a possible campaign. Trump decided against the idea, but the two kept in touch, and Bannon gave Trump admiring coverage. Bannon noticed that, when Trump spoke to crowds, people were electrified. Bannon began to think that Trump might be \"the one\" who could shake up American politics.\"\n\nReporters who covered the Trump campaign were puzzled by Trump's retelling of events.\n\n\"Trump claiming he didn't know Bannon till late in campaign is flatly untrue,\" tweeted Maggie Haberman of the New York Times. Added McKay Coppins of The Atlantic: \"Just for the record: Trump is pretty blatantly not telling the truth when he says he didn't know Bannon until late in the campaign.\"\n\nWe've reached out to the White House and will update this post if we hear back.\n\nTrump said that before the presidential campaign, \"I didn\u2019t know Steve,\" referring to Steve Bannon.\n\nThat\u2019s contradicted by Trump\u2019s own words and independent reporting.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
