Well, that\u2019s gone.\n\n\u201cSo when you tell them what you\u2019ve got - or if you\u2019ve got anything - they can tell everybody now.\u201d\n\nFirstly, no changes were made to the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 or the Coronavirus Act 2020 on April 27, 2020 (see Reuters Fact Check article here).\n\nA spokesman for the General Medical Council, which oversees medical education and training in the UK, said guidance regarding doctor-patient confidentiality remained unchanged.\n\nThe spokesman said there may be specific circumstances - \u201cwhether in a pandemic or not\u201d - under which confidentiality may need to be waived. These are listed under GMC guidelines that were in place before the outbreak of COVID-19 and include situations where \u201cdisclosing personal information may be justified in the public interest if failure to do so may expose others to a risk of death or serious harm\u201d (here).\n\nIn such cases, the GMC sets out detailed guidelines (here) .\n\nThese include using anonymised information if it is practicable to do so and if it will serve the purpose; explaining to the patient how the information will be used; and keeping disclosures to the minimum necessary.\n\nPartly false. The Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 was not changed in April 2020, and no subsequent changes have been made regarding doctors\u2019 duty of confidentiality during the COVID-19 crisis. Under specific circumstances, medical professionals are able to share confidential information, but guidelines must be met regarding what information is provided, how it is shared, and what the patient is told.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
