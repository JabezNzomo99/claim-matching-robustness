The claim is false; Abubakar's spokesman rejected it as \"fake news\" and the story originated from a website with a history of spreading misinformation.\n\nThe article was published on pro-Biafran website Jamyco.com on April 3, 2020. It has since been shared more than 6,000 times in numerous Facebook posts, including this one, according to data provided by the social network.\n\nThe online report, which is riddled with grammatical errors, is headlined: \u201cBreaking: Atiku Abubakar Order his Bank to pay 10k to all Nigerians with BVN\u201d. BVN refers to Bank Verification Number, a unique 11-digit identity assigned to bank customers in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe said this while answering questions from newsmen on his son\u2019s health status, who tested positive to coronavirus,\u201d the article claims.\n\nAtiku Abubakar - who served as Nigeria\u2019s vice president from 1999 to 2007 - announced last month that one of his sons had tested positive for COVID-19. More than 370 people have tested positive for the disease in Nigeria as of April 14, 2020.\n\nThe outbreak has prompted Africa's most populous country to lock down its largest city Lagos, neighbouring Ogun State and the capital Abuja.\n\nThe article quotes Abubakar\u2019s spokesman Paul Ibe as having allegedly said that banks would carry out the documentation of the poorest and most vulnerable Nigerians who have records of low income and then disburse money to them.\n\nUsing the social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, AFP found that the link to the viral article was widely shared on Facebook and Twitter. We\u2019ve archived some of the posts here, here, and here.\n\nHowever, the claim is false. Ibe has dismissed both the allegation and the statement accredited to him. \u201cThis is fake news,\u201d he told AFP in a Twitter message. \u201cIt is not the first time a contrived news report targeting the former Vice President is being published.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis Excellency Atiku Abubakar never said anything like that. I did not speak to this media organisation. Indeed it is unknown to me.\u201d\n\nThe website Jamyco has a history of publishing falsehoods, some of which have been debunked by fact-checking organisations including Africa Check here and here. No major Nigerian media reported on the purported payout, because Atiku did not make such an offer, neither was there any evidence to support the claim.\n\nHowever, Abubakar did pledge to donate 50 million naira ($130,000) to a coronavirus relief fund in late March, while also calling on the government to distribute at least 10,000 naira to each Nigerian household.\n\nThe relief payout allegation is among several similar false claims that have circulated on social media in Nigeria. AFP has debunked some here and here.\n\nMore than half of the Nigeria's workforce are in the informal sector and largely depend on daily earnings. President Muhammadu Buhari has faced criticism that current lockdown support measures only target 3.6 million households of the 200-million-population in Africa\u2019s largest economy.", "lang": "en"}
