If a DACA participant marries a U.S. citizen, for instance, he or she could seek to obtain status as a lawful permanent resident, more popularly known as a green card. There are other routes to obtaining a green card, such as being a victim of a crime and helping police, being a battered spouse or a victim of human trafficking, and so forth. Green-card recipients are eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship after five years.\n\nFor perhaps 50 percent of DACA participants \u2014 precise numbers are not available \u2014 that is not a problem. That\u2019s because many undocumented immigrants overstay a visa, rather than illegally cross the border. In 2015 alone, more than 400,000 foreign visitors stayed in the United States beyond their visa, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Robert Warren, a demographer and senior visiting fellow at the Center for Migration Studies, estimates that about 50 percent of the 1.258 million people eligible for DACA are visa overstays.\n\nA person who entered the country illegally, even as a child, would not have this option. But it turned out there was one possible way to get around this, in what Grassley labeled as a loophole. Under existing law, a person with a pending application for a change in immigration status could seek to travel abroad under what is known as \u201cadvance parole\u201d to see a sick relative, attend a funeral or for another specific reason, such as education or employment (but not vacation travel).\n\nThe (Riverside, Calif.) Press-Enterprise in 2016 reported that Southern California universities were using the \u201cadvance parole\u201d provision to allow DACA students to attend a study-abroad program in Mexico, Vietnam or other countries. Once a student returned, he or she then had evidence of a legal entry, which in theory could be used to apply for a change in immigration status if other conditions were met (such as marrying a U.S. citizen). The article did not identify anyone who had done this, only that some experts thought it might be possible.\n\nIn June 2016, the Senate Judiciary Committee posted a letter from the USCIS that actually had more detail. That letter said that as of Dec. 31, 2015, 22,340 DACA recipients were approved for advance parole. Of that number, 2,994, or 13 percent, had subsequently applied for and been approved for a green card. Moreover, the letter noted that a certain number of these people (such as holders of lapsed visas) who were approved for a green card probably would have been eligible even without receiving advance parole. But USCIS said it was too time-consuming to review each case to determine a precise number.\n\nIf the 7-to-1 ratio had remained the same through 2016 and 2017, then the maximum number of DACA participants who had received advance parole and then been approved for a green card is about 6,000. That means the number of people who entered illegally, participated in DACA and then used advance parole to obtain a green card is going to be even smaller than that number \u2014 3,000 or less. That\u2019s out of a universe of 800,000 DACA recipients.\n\nGrassley\u2019s news release was confusing, and some news organizations jumped to false conclusions in reporting on it. About 45,000 DACA recipients had been approved for advance parole, and 39,000 DACA recipients had received green cards. But those numbers represent a Venn diagram with very little overlap. It certainly fails to take into consideration that about half of DACA holders are visa overstays and thus did not need advance parole to begin to qualify for a green card.\n\nAt most, 3,000 DACA recipients, or 0.375 percent, may have used the advance-parole program to obtain a green card. Whether such a small percentage, given the uncertainty of the numbers, constitutes a violation of Obama\u2019s claim that DACA was not a path to citizenship gets us into the realm of opinion. Thus, we will not do a Pinocchio rating on Obama\u2019s statement.\n\nAs for the Grassley news release, it says that \u201cthousands of DACA recipients [were able] to exploit an immigration law loophole to obtain green cards.\u201d Again, it\u2019s a matter of opinion as to whether this is a loophole. Given that we estimate about 3,000 may have used the advance parole provision to begin the green card process, \u201cthousands\u201d skates by as technically correct. But it\u2019s a much smaller number than the figures touted in the release \u2014 and Grassley\u2019s staff has a responsibility to set the record straight about the incorrect news reporting.", "lang": "en"}
