The \u201cSacrifice the Weak\u201d sign is real, although we can\u2019t say for certain whether this protester was holding this sign in earnest, or displaying it ironically as a way to mock these protests.\n\nThis screenshot comes from a WKRN broadcast featuring reporter Elizabeth Lane. Here\u2019s the full video of Lane\u2019s report. The \u201cSacrifice the Weak\u201d sign can be seen around the 1:40 mark:\n\nLane said that she didn\u2019t notice the sign while reporting on the \u201cReOpen Rally\u201d in Tennessee and only noticed the sign after it was brought to her attention on social media. Lane said that some people had asked if the protest sign was \u201csatire\u201d but said she did not have an answer:\n\nThis \u201cSacrifice the Weak\u201d sign can also be seen in a broadcast from ABC News Channel 9.", "lang": "en"}
