Gates, however, was in no way involved in creating the list.\n\nIt is a claim that refuses to die, as this Facebook post here from 2013 with at least 59,000 shares attests.\n\nA list of 10 to 14 rules billed as an antidote to unchecked political correctness in schools, it is widely credited to Gates in multiple posts here, here and here.\n\nGates, the claim says, delivered a speech at a high school where he used the occasion to bash contemporary education for its politically-correct teachings that were setting children up for failure.\n\nThe first rule? \u201cLife is unfair. Get used to it.\u201d\n\nMost posts like those above (and these recent ones here and here) end at number 11 on the list with the advice to be kind to nerds because \u201cchances are you\u2019ll end up working for one\u201d.\n\nThe claim conferring ownership of the list on Gates has been around for at least 20 years and one of the very first debunks was this one by Snopes in 2000, containing details of other misattributions at the time, including to American writer Kurt Vonnegut.\n\nOther fact-checking organisations here and here have similarly dispelled the idea of authorship by Gates.\n\nIf not Gates, then whom?\n\nThe man behind the list is US author Charles J. Sykes, whose 1995 book \u201cDumbing Down Our Kids\u201d was described as \u201ca searing indictment of America\u2019s secondary schools\u201d.\n\nBut it was on his radio show in Milwaukee, Wisconsin that he first introduced the public to his rules for children as a criticism of outcomes-based education. His list began with 10 rules and grew to 14.\n\n\n\n Sykes expanded even further in his 2007 book \u201c50 Rules Kids Won\u2019t Learn in School\u201d and included his original list, although the order was rearranged.\n\nIn the preface, he dedicated space to addressing the claims of authorship, stating that, while he was flattered to be associated with the billionaire philanthropist, Gates was not the author of his list.\n\nA comment was requested from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and will be added if and when AFP receives a response.", "lang": "en"}
