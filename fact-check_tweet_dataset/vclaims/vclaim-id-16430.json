We could have a free trade agreement with Europe that removes tariffs but, unless we\u2019re inside the customs union, goods imported into the EU will need to provide proof of where and how they were made.\n\nLeaving the customs union would allow us to agree our own free trade deals with other countries (you can\u2019t do this as a customs union member). By leaving, we would no longer be a part of existing EU trade deals with other countries, and would face tariffs on trade with other countries until free trade agreements were made.\n\nIn 2017, the UK\u2019s GDP grew by 1.8% in real terms compared to 2.3% in the USA, 5.6% in East Asia, 5.3% in Southeast Asia, and 2.7% in the EU. That\u2019s according to data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nThe fastest growing region worldwide (as defined by the IMF) last year was South Asia, with real GDP growth of 6.5%.\n\nThe IMF forecasts that these growth rates will stay quite stable over the next few years\u2014although they expect the EU, USA, and East Asia to slow slightly, and South Asia to pick up further.\n\nHow much is each economy worth?\n\nIn 2017, the USA made up 24% of the world economy, the EU made up 21% (or 18% without the UK), East Asia made up 24%, Southeast Asia made up 3%, and South Asia made up 4%. That\u2019s basing the value of each region\u2019s economy on the current value of the US dollar. That\u2019s not the only way of measuring an areas\u2019 share of world GDP, but it gives a better impression of the size of these economies as potential export markets at present.", "lang": "en"}
