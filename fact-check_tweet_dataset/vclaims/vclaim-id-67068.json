The article says, \"In one of the pictures, it is seen that the student of Gaurbanga College is sitting by the hole of the approach road.\"\n\n\n\nWe also found a news report by Dhaka18, a Bangladesh based news publication which identified the student as a Sangeet Roy (\u09b8\u0999\u09cd\u0997\u09c0\u09a4 \u09b0\u09be\u09df). The report says residents of English Bazar, Malda and Old Malda are worried after an approach road to a bridge connecting the city on both sides of the Mahananda river in West Bengal collapsed.\n\n\n\nWe looked through Facebook using specific keywords and found the Facebook profile of Sangeet Roy, who had shared a total of six images from the same incident in October, 2019. On Facebook, Roy identifies himself as a resident of English Bazar area in Malda.\n\nThe captions and the comments in the images written in Bengali refer to local places in Malda region in West Bengal. Roy in his post identified the places as Bypass road, Sukanta More. BOOM verified that the names mentioned in the caption are locations in English Bazaar area of Malda and most of them on the Bypass road, Mangalbari bridge.\n\nOne of the images shared by Roy has hoarding and several visual clues that the location is West Bengal. The image has West Bengal's Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's picture on the top left corner of the frame, and one banner on the top right corner of the frame has Malda written on the billboard. \n\n\n\nBOOM has reached out to Roy and the copy will be updated upon a response.\n\n\n\nAlso read: 2011 Video Of Tsunami In Japan Passed Off As China", "lang": "en"}
