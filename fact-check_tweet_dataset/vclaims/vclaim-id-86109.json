So here\u2019s a quick roundup of some of her recent eyebrow-raising claims, though to be fair to Ocasio-Cortez, the average member of Congress might easily make many bloopers over the course of so many live interviews.\n\nFirst of all, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that the percentage of people working two jobs has actually declined since the Great Recession \u2014 and been relatively steady at around 5 percent since 2010. The percentage bounced around a bit but it was as low as 4.7 percent in October 2017 and was 5.2 percent in the July jobs report, the most recent available. That hardly adds up to \u201ceveryone.\u201d\n\nAs our friends at PolitiFact documented, this is an urban legend. There is language in the 2016 appropriations bill that requires ICE to have 34,000 beds available \u2014 ICE \u201cshall maintain a level of not less than 34,000 detention beds through September 30, 2016\u201d \u2014 but it is not required to fill them. The main point of such language, a version of which dated to 2009, is to make sure the money is not spent on something else.\n\nBut the data show that while the middle class overall may have shrunk a bit, the upper-middle class has actually grown. In a 2016 paper published by the Urban Institute, Stephen J. Rose documented that the upper-middle class has grown substantially, from 12.9 percent of the population in 1979 to 29.4 percent in 2014. His analysis showed that there was a massive shift in the center of gravity of the economy, with an increasing share of income going to the upper-middle class and rich.\n\n\u201cIn a Koch brothers-funded study \u2014 if any study\u2019s going to try to be a little bit slanted, it would be one funded by the Koch brothers \u2014 it shows that Medicare for all is actually much more, is actually much cheaper than the current system that we pay right now.\u201d\n\n\u2014 interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cCuomo Prime Time,\u201d Aug. 8\n\nWe recently gave this sort of claim Three Pinocchios. Some Democrats have seized on a reference in a study released by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, which receives some funding from the Koch Foundation, that a Medicare-for-all plan advanced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would reduce the country\u2019s overall level of health expenditures by $2 trillion from 2022 to 2031. That\u2019s because the Sanders plan assumes that providers \u2014 doctors, hospitals, and the like \u2014 would face an immediate cut of roughly 40 percent for the treatment of patients now covered by private insurance. (*note: this sentence has been rephrased as a colleague suggested an earlier version used too much shorthand.)\n\nBut the study makes clear that this is an unrealistic assumption and in fact the plan would raise government expenditures by $32.6 trillion over 10 years. Without the provider cuts, the additional federal budget cost would be nearly $40 trillion. So, no matter how you slice it, the study does not say it would be \u201cmuch cheaper\u201d than the current system.\n\n\u201cThe reason that the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act is because they ruled that each of these monthly payments that everyday American make is a tax. And so, while it may not seem like we pay that tax on April 15th, we pay it every single month or we do pay at tax season if we don\u2019t buy, you know, these plans off of the exchange.\u201d\n\n\u2014 interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cCuomo Prime Time,\u201d Aug. 8\n\nIn the 5-4 opinion written by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., the Affordable Care Act was deemed to be an appropriate exercise of the government\u2019s taxing power. But Roberts was not referring to the monthly premium payments, as Ocasio-Cortez claims. Instead, Roberts was referring to the individual mandate to buy insurance \u2014 and the requirement to pay an annual penalty when filing a tax return if one did not buy health insurance.", "lang": "en"}
