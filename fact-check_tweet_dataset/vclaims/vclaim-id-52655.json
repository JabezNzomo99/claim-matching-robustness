While \u201cfast action\u201d is subjective, pandemic experts say the U.S. did not move quickly to set up an adequate system and in fact lagged behind other countries.\n\nWe have reported several times on a number of snags and miscues that prevented robust, widespread early testing.\n\n\u201cThe United States has lagged nearly every developed country in ramping up testing, and the slow action is one reason why we have the worst epidemic in the world and are discussing reopening when it is not safe to do so, while other countries have used testing as a centerpiece of their strategy to reduce cases to a point where reopening is much more appropriate,\u201d Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology and director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us in an email. \u201cThe lack of testing has been not only a public health catastrophe in the US, but also is a direct cause of our economic suffering.\u201d\n\nPaul A. Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, told us in an email: \u201cWe need only look at other countries (like South Korea, Germany, Singapore, New Zealand and others) to see what rapid testing and identification can do to slow down spread of this virus. South Korea had done 150,000 tests before we had done 500. The fact that we have more deaths per million in the population than many other developed countries is a testament to our slow response to this virus.\u201d\n\nThe new 30-second ad, called \u201cTough Steps,\u201d first aired May 5 in Indiana. The Trump campaign has spent more than $200,000 on the ad so far, according to Advertising Analytics.\n\nThe ad also includes a number of false and unsubstantiated claims that Trump has made before.\n\nIt says he \u201cbanned Chinese and European travel to the U.S.\u201d While Trump did impose restrictions, as we have reported, they included exceptions, so they weren\u2019t actual \u201cbans.\u201d For example, the New York Times reported that nearly 40,000 people flew directly from China to the U.S. in the two months after the China restrictions went into effect on Feb. 2.\n\nThe ad suggests that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden used the term \u201cxenophobia\u201d in connection with the president\u2019s travel restrictions. But it\u2019s not clear that he did.\n\nOn the day the China restrictions were announced, as we have written, Biden did say at a campaign event in Iowa, \u201cThis is no time for Donald Trump\u2019s record of hysteria and xenophobia \u2013 hysterical xenophobia \u2013 and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.\u201d But Biden didn\u2019t refer to the travel restrictions in his speech, and the Biden campaign says the candidate was referring to Trump\u2019s penchant for scapegoating, not the travel rules.\n\nOn April 3, the Biden campaign said that he supported the restrictions.\n\nThe ad also suggests that \u201cPresident Trump saved countless lives\u201d as a result of the travel restrictions. As we have written, in at least two coronavirus task force briefings, the president, without evidence, claimed that the travel restrictions he implemented on China \u201csaved tens of thousands\u201d and even \u201chundreds of thousands of lives.\u201d We found no support for such figures, and the White House didn\u2019t provide any.\n\nThe few studies that have been done estimate travel restrictions the United States and other countries enacted on China had a modest impact, slowing the initial spread outside of China but not containing the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWe have written on a number of occasions about the problems slowing down the nation\u2019s coronavirus testing efforts. The first case of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, in the U.S. was confirmed on Jan. 20.\n\nIn the early stages of the pandemic, testing was in the hands of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Problems arose after Feb. 5, when the CDC began shipping its kits out to qualified state and local public health labs in an effort to expand testing. The agency said it was releasing 200 kits \u2014 each capable of testing around 700 to 800 specimens \u2014 giving labs just one kit each. But by Feb. 12, the CDC told reporters that some labs had experienced problems when doing verification tests to make sure the tests worked.\n\nFor a while, the agency promised to remake the faulty component and distribute that to the public health labs and, in the meantime, asked any lab that had difficulties to send samples into the CDC for testing. As a result, as of Feb. 25, only 12 state or local labs out of more than 100 nationwide could do their own testing.\n\nMore than two weeks after first announcing the testing issue, the CDC said it had come up with a fix.\n\nAnother problem early on stemmed from the criteria the CDC used to determine who would be tested. At first, the CDC recommended testing only those with a fever and/or lower respiratory symptoms, and who had traveled to Wuhan, China, where the disease started, or had contact with someone suspected of having the disease.\n\nIn late February, after a patient in California was found to be infected despite a lack of known exposure, the CDC changed its guidelines to include anyone with a fever who was hospitalized with a respiratory illness. On March 3, Vice President Mike Pence announced that the CDC would lift all restrictions, as long as a doctor ordered the test. The CDC updated its clinical criteria web page the next day, stating that clinicians \u201cshould use their judgment\u201d in deciding who should be tested.\n\nAnother problem stemmed from the CDC\u2019s role early on as the sole player in the testing game.\n\nAs we have written, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and several former officials said that the CDC simply isn\u2019t set up to be a commercial test lab, let alone the only test lab for the country in such a pandemic. It was a month after the Trump administration on Jan. 31 declared a public health emergency that it took steps to allow testing to be conducted more broadly, and then several days more before the private sector announced testing availability.\n\nTom Frieden, who was head of the CDC during the Obama administration, wrote, \u201cA series of errors with lab testing delayed the U.S. response to the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d Besides the CDC test kit problems, he wrote, \u201cthe Food and Drug Administration was slow to allow hospital labs to develop their own tests; and the Department of Health and Human Services didn\u2019t work with commercial labs to start developing broadly available private sector tests until far too late.\u201d\n\nOn March 6, six weeks after the first case of COVID-19 was detected in the U.S., Trump famously declared that anyone who \u201cwants a test can get a test.\u201d Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said in a television interview the same day that there \u201cis no testing kit shortage, nor has there ever been.\u201d\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the case. On March 9, we were told by the Association of Public Health Laboratories that although things were improving, \u201cdemand for testing is greater than the tests available.\u201d\n\nOn March 12, at a congressional hearing, Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz asked who was in charge of \u201cmaking sure \u2026 as many people as possible across this country have access to getting tested as soon as possible.\u201d Fauci responded, \u201cThe system \u2014 the system does not \u2014 is not really geared to what we need right now, what you are asking for. That is a failing. \u2026 The idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we are not set up for that. Do I think we should be? Yes, but we are not.\u201d\n\nSo seven weeks after the first case of COVID-19 surfaced in the U.S., there remained a \u201cfailing\u201d in the nation\u2019s testing system \u2014 contrary to the ad\u2019s claim of \u201cfast action.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
