Quite an accomplishment! #MOSen,\" the party tweeted Sept. 10 as part of its support for challenger Josh Hawley.\n\nMorning Consult\u2019s methodology has various aspects to it. Surveys are sent out online to registered voters in each state. The questions asked of each respondent only included subjects about their voting preferences and specifics about their state\u2019s senator.\n\nThe poll is conducted quarterly, not every month, as readers of the GOP tweet might think. And it doesn\u2019t rank which senator is the \"most likely to be the most unpopular senator.\" The polls contain approval, disapproval and unknown/undecided ratings.\n\nThe poll also has a question in which voters are asked if they think it is time for someone new. McCaskill received the second-highest ranking of respondents saying yes, at 53 percent. That was behind Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, another Democrat, at 54 percent.\n\nAs of the most recent update Oct. 3, McCaskill was up to a 48 percent disapproval rating. McCaskill\u2019s disapproval rating has been increasing since the 44 percent in July, but has never eclipsed McConnell to be the senator with the worst disapproval rating.\n\nMorning Consult has also released its third-quarter senator rankings, and McCaskill is now the third-least popular. Although they do show that McCaskill has climbed up one rank, she is still not the most unpopular senator.\n\nCliff Zukin, Rutgers University professor of political science and public policy, brought up that the results from the surveys are brought from volunteer responses, which is not as accurate as a true scientific sampling method. Because the respondents would volunteer to answer the survey, it is not as representative of the underlying population as a completely random sampling method would be.\n\nClaiming that disapproval rating and being the \"worst\" are not as linked as one might think. Kenneth D. Wald, University of Florida professor emeritus of political science, claimed that politicians making decisions on polarizing topics will usually increase their disapproval rating as they would upset a some group of people.\n\nWhen compared to certain vulnerable incumbents, she does have the highest disapproval rating in the country. The Missouri GOP tweet said that she is the most unpopular senator in the country, which does not reference solely incumbents running for re-election.", "lang": "en"}
