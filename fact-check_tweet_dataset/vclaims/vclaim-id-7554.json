No, that's not true: the story was made up by a website that habitually invents stories about bizarre crimes and sex acts for entertainment purposes. It did not happen, it was not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on May 26, 2018 by World News Daily Report titled \"Male anal rape victim says 911 operator laughed at him, called him a \"fudge packer\"\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nLong Beach, CA | A 41-year-old man victim of sexual assault claims that when he reported the crime to a 911 operator, he was met with laughter and insults. Adam Schneider, 41, was on vacation for the weekend in Long Beach when after a night out at the bar he met four women who invited him to a hotel room. He remembers having sexual intercourse with the young women in the hotel room but when he woke up the next morning, he realized the women were, in fact, men and that they had also drugged him and taken advantage of him during his sleep. \"I woke up surrounded by four naked men in bed. The women I thought I had sex with the previous night had taken their wigs and makeup off and I could see their penises, that's when I realized what had really happened,\" Schneider told reporters in tears.\n\nAdam Schneider then quickly left the hotel room and called the 911 to report his assault but the operator that responded to the call did not take his claims seriously.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail and might have confused the story for real news:\n\nBut the picture illustrating the article was just a stock photo:\n\nAnd the website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories. The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: 17-year-old Teenager Did NOT Sue His Parents For Being Born White\n\u2022 Fake News: Babysitter NOT Arrested For Auctioning Kids Under Her Care On eBay\n\u2022 Fake News: Man's Hand NOT Cut Off For Masturbating During Ramadan In Saudi Arabia\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Did NOT Sue Alabama Over 1865 Document Giving Him Right To Own 'Black Slaves'\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Did NOT Crash Into River After Attempting To Give Himsef Oral Sex While Driving", "lang": "en"}
