However, PITAHC noted that there was a 2014 review of the plant's traditional use against hyperthermia and colics, both symptoms of malaria.\n\nOn the other hand, the practice of tu-ob/su-ob as a cure for COVID-19 has previously been debunked by DOH and the World Health Organization. (See: VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Salt water steam DOES NOT kill coronavirus and VERA FILES FACT SHEET: What is tuob or steam inhalation therapy?)\n\nIn a statement on June 26, PITAHC also said pagtutuob is not the \u201cstandard care treatment for COVID-19,\u201d as its clinical efficacy against the viral disease still needs to be proven by studies. It reminded the public that \u201cfrequent handwashing, physical distancing, and wearing of face mask\u201d are still the advised preventive measures against the novel coronavirus disease 2019.\n\nPITAHC, however, did say it \u201csupports the use of tu-ob/su-ob to alleviate the signs and symptoms of respiratory illness found common among COVID-19 patients,\u201d citing scientific studies that found the practice to be effective against symptoms of colds.\n\nThe two-month-old FB post has been shared over 7,800 times and received more than 3,600 reactions and 1,100 comments. It continues to circulate amid the rise in the country\u2019s COVID-19 cases, which hit 217,396 cases on Aug. 30, according to DOH records. Of this number, 56,473 are active infections and 3,520 deaths.\n\nThe World Health Organization maintains that there is still no medicine proven to cure COVID-19. However, just last Aug. 11, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his country\u2019s registration of Sputnik V, which he dubbed as the \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d COVID-19 vaccine.
