During that appearance, Host Brian Stelter questioned Pierson about a tweet she made back in 2012 referencing how neither President Barack Obama nor then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney was a \u201cpure breed\u201d:\n\nPierson (unconvincingly) defended the message in question to Stelter, claiming that she had been called a \u201chalf-breed\u201d herself:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an activist and I am a half-breed. I\u2019m always getting called a half-breed. On Twitter when you\u2019re fighting with liberals and even establishment, you go back at them in the same silliness they are giving you.\u201d \u201cSo, I myself am a half-breed. Here\u2019s the thing. We have entered silly season. Donald Trump is up in the polls again. There\u2019s desperate campaigns out there, they can\u2019t take him down so they try to take down the people that are around him. And we\u2019re just not going to get distracted by all that nonsense.\u201d\n\nShortly after Pierson\u2019s appearance on Reliable Sources, several publication posted stories about some of the other racial comments she has made on Twitter, including one which dubbed President Obama the \u201chead negro in charge\u201d:\n\nAlthough Pierson did post the messages in question to Twitter, she did so at least two years before she joined Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, not while she was actively working as his spokesperson.", "lang": "en"}
