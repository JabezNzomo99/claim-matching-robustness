The cases, a 27-year-old man and his 17-year-old brother have been confirmed by test results, and are being treated in hospitals in the province. The brothers had reportedly eaten \u2018marmot meat\u2019 following which they were infected.\u201d\n\nNone of the pictures included in the posts were of the recent bubonic plague cases in Inner Mongolia, China. Experts also said that cases of bubonic plague in July 2020 should not be a cause for panic.\n\nThe photo of people in white hazmats suits was taken in South Korea and was used by news outfits, such as CNN and Singapore\u2019s Business Times, as early as March 2020. A reverse image search showed that the people in the suits were South Korean soldiers spraying disinfectant in Seoul to curb the spread of COVID-19.

He added that countries have a better grasp of the plague unlike COVID-19. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
