And it will be a while before it does. Theoretically, one of its missiles could reach the continental U.S. in two-three years\u2026 The DPRK does not have any unique technologies, there can\u2019t be any\u2026 Only big states are able to develop military technologies. [North] Korea is not one of them,\u201d Podberezkin said.\n\nThe statement is false, and follows North Korea\u2019s two latest missile tests on July 4 and 28.\n\nUnlike the U.S., Japan, and South Korea, Russia claims that the missiles North Korea tested were intermediate range, not intercontinental range, and thus could not reach the continental U.S.\n\nThe Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, however, says that the July 4 missile launch marked North Korea\u2019s \u201cfirst-ever test of a true ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile]\u201d that \u201ccan deliver a warhead to a range of 5,500 kilometers or more,\u201d potentially reaching Alaska and Hawaii.\n\nThe July 28 test yielded more concerning results. David Wright, a missile expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said if the missile had been launched on a standard trajectory of flight, it could have reached Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, and possibly even New York and Boston.\n\nUnderscoring the threat posed by the country's nuclear and missile programs, on August 5, Russia joined the U.S. and China, among others, in voting for stringent UN Security Council sanctions against North Korea.\n\nNorth Korea has yet to miniaturize a nuclear warhead and put it on the tip of a missile. It would also have to ensure its nuclear-tipped missile had an effective guidance system and a warhead that could re-enter the atmosphere from space intact and still hit a target.\n\nBut while North Korea might not attain the capability to strike the U.S. with a nuclear-tipped missile until at least 2018, as the Pentagon estimates, Pyongyang has clearly demonstrated the capacity to make progress in the nuclear and missile technology development cycle.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s military is pushing ahead with testing and refining such technology using various missile delivery and launch systems, even if some, such as submarines, are outdated.\n\n\u200bThe threat of North Korea\u2019s missile program is thus not only real, but also multi-dimensional. And it is not just North Korea\u2019s capability to hit the continental U.S that is worrying. It is also the North Korean military\u2019s ability to strike U.S. military and economic assets and allies in the region -- all within the range, or close to the reach, of North Korea\u2019s missiles. Indeed, North Korea is developing missiles with different ranges and capabilities, and for different purposes.\n\n\u200bChina\u2019s inability and/or unwillingness to convince North Korea to renounce its nuclear weapons capability and resume talks with the U.S., Russia, China, South Korea, and Japan heightens U.S. concerns that Pyongyang will eventually complete all the required technological steps to make its coupled nuclear and missile program operational.\n\nThe missile threat also stems from Pyongyang\u2019s intentions, not just its capabilities. North Korea has on multiple occasions threatened to strike the U.S. with a nuclear-tipped ICBM if the U.S. attempts regime change or undertakes a military action against it.\n\nU.S. defense measures, meanwhile, have fallen short. The Ground-based Midcourse Defense system, designed to provide protection against long-range missiles, has had only a mixed performance record.\n\nAt the same time, North Korea has been rushing to build a viable nuclear capability to deter the U.S. from regime change or other actions (for example, defending South Korea in case of resumed hostilities).\n\nPodberezkin\u2019s claim that only big states are capable of developing military technologies is also false. In fact, states of all kinds develop military technologies. This is especially true of North Korea, which is working to overcome technological constraints as it seeks to build a nuclear deterrent.\n\nNorth Korea has displayed a sense of mission in this regard, particularly over the last decade, channeling major funding into its nuclear and missile programs, which the regime deems are essential for its survival given the perceived threat of U.S. military aggression.\n\nBesides these programs, North Korea has also demonstrated the technological capacity to develop robust cyber capabilities. It has done all this despite being a small and impoverished state that has done little to improve the wellbeing of its extremely poor and malnourished population.", "lang": "en"}
