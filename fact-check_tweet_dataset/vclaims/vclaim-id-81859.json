We refuse to fund drug treatment and mental health programs. We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book, and then we tell the police, \u2018You\u2019re a social worker, you\u2019re the parent, you\u2019re the teacher, you\u2019re the drug counselor.\u2019\"\n\nCritics pounced on the Glock remark, saying Obama was making a misleading \u2014 or even outright false \u2014 comparison. But the White House said it had evidence to back up Obama\u2019s line.\n\nSo we decided to take our own look.\n\nWhat the White House says\n\nThe White House offered PolitiFact several news reports to back up Obama\u2019s case.\n\nThe gist of these reports was that there are lots of guns to be found in low-income urban areas, but comparatively few books and relatively little access to the Internet.\n\nHowever, much of the evidence these articles provided was anecdotal, and none of the articles directly compared guns to computers or books --- not to mention Glocks, the specific make of handgun Obama cited.\n\nAnd none of the articles offered a rigorous academic comparison of the specific claim Obama made.\n\u2022 One study by New York University researchers found a scarcity of children\u2019s books in low-income areas of Detroit, Los Angeles and Washington. But the study looked at stores that sold books without taking into account public libraries or school libraries, which make obtaining books easier. More importantly, the study didn\u2019t compare the availability of guns.\n\u2022 Several articles offered quotes by people familiar with low-income communities that included observations similar to what Obama said in Dallas.\n\nFor instance, one Chicago resident told Al Jazeera America that getting a gun in her neighborhood is as easy as buying a pack of gum. \"If you want a gun, you can just go get a gun,\" she said. \"You got the money? You can get a gun.\"\n\nAnd D. Watkins, a young, African-American writer from Baltimore who wrote The Beast Side: Living and Dying While Black in America, told public radio host Terry Gross that he bought his first gun \"from some dudes in the neighborhood that sold guns. It was simple. ... (It was) Business as usual. And it's still like that.\"\n\nNone of these accounts offered a direct comparison of guns\u2019 availability compared with books or Internet access.\n\u2022 One link referenced an academic study about a lack of access to food in low-income areas, but it did not address either guns or books.\n\u2022 A news report cited research about the relative lack of Internet access in low-income households. But another article the White House provided said that while teens in families making less than $50,000 a year are less likely to have access to a desktop or a laptop computer than teens in higher income groups, the rate even for the lower-income group is still pretty high: All told, eight of every 10 of these lower-income teens had access to a computer.\n\nIn all, we find the White House\u2019s evidence unpersuasive on Obama\u2019s specific claim. There\u2019s no hard data making his comparison. And on the question of access to computers, we found data showing a relatively high rate of Internet access even among lower-income teens.\n\nWe considered the meaning of Obama\u2019s remark a few different ways \u2014 but none provide a slam dunk for his argument.\n\nHe said it was easier for a teen to obtain a Glock over a book or a computer.\n\nIt might be easier for some people in some places, but it\u2019s still against the law.\n\n\"It is already against federal law for someone under the age of 21 to buy a handgun, such as a Glock, from a licensed firearms dealer,\" said John R. Lott, Jr., president of the generally pro-gun Crime Prevention Research Center. And federal law on handguns also makes it unlawful for anyone \"to sell, deliver, or otherwise transfer (a handgun) to a person who the transferor knows or has reasonable cause to believe is a juvenile\" \u2014 that is, under 18.\n\nThat means that any teen would have to break the law to make such a purchase. Alternately, they could barter for a handgun or steal one, which might be practical but would also be against the law.\n\nSo let\u2019s now consider the case of teens who are willing to break the law.\n\nOne interpretation is whether a gun is cheaper to get than a book. Experts said the price of a \"street\" handgun can range between $50 and $500, depending on the local vagaries of supply and demand.\n\nGlocks in particular \"are very expensive,\" said Alan Lizotte, a criminal justice professor at the University at Albany. Street Glocks without a criminal history would be especially tough, he said.\n\nThat would make them easily more expensive than books purchased at a store, and certainly more expensive than books borrowed for free from a library.\n\n\"There are 80 public libraries in Chicago and 95 public high schools and 92 private high schools in the city,\" Lott said.\n\nThe second interpretation of Obama\u2019s remark is the ease, or accessibility, of locating a gun. This is perhaps the most favorable interpretation for Obama, since credible research shows that there\u2019s both a relative shortage of books and a relative surplus of guns in low-income neighborhoods.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth remembering that there don\u2019t appear to be any studies that compare books and guns directly. In addition, there\u2019s a lot of variation, neighborhood by neighborhood, across the country.\n\n\"If there\u2019s lots of street-gang activity where you live, you may know someone who can get you a gun,\" said James Alan Fox, interim director of the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University. \"If you live in a middle- or upper-middle class suburb, a gun may not be as accessible for a teenager. I wouldn\u2019t know who to ask to buy a street gun.\"\n\nExperts acknowledged, though, that Obama had a point with his remark, even if he made an imperfect comparison.\n\n\"It is pretty easy for a teen to get a handgun at little cost and very quickly, at least in some places, including urban places,\" Lizotte said.\n\nThat said, Jay Corzine, a sociologist and gun-policy expert at the University of Central Florida, called Obama\u2019s framing \"weird.\"\n\n\"The most credit I can give the president is that the statement may be true in a very small number of cases that are dependent on the context -- location, day of the week, time of the day, cash in hand,\" Corzine said.\n\nObama said, \"We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book.\"\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt that in some lower-income and high-crime neighborhoods, it is strikingly easy for even teens to acquire a handgun. On this, there is ample anecdotal evidence.\n\nBut buying a gun is not likely to be cheaper than buying -- or borrowing -- a book or securing access to a computer, even for teens in poor neighborhoods.\n\nOn multiple levels, Obama\u2019s comparison is flawed.
