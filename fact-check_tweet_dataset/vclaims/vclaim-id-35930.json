Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: \u2018Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) kicked out of India for conducting unethical medical vaccination trails\u2019. Fact: There is no news on BMGF being kicked out of India. Currently, the BMGF is actively working in the states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Similar news that the Indian government had broken ties with the BMGF went viral in 2017, but the Health Ministry, on the same day, issued a press note that termed the viral news as \u2018inaccurate and misleading\u2019. The information in the post about the 2009 case is true but in that case, it was \u2018PATH\u2019 (Programme for Appropriate Technology in Health) organization, which was involved. The BMGF is one of the donors of \u2018PATH\u2019 and was reportedly funding the programme. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen searched on Google about BMGF leaving India, no relevant news was found. On the BMGF website, it can be found that the BMGF is \u2018working closely with India\u2019s central and state governments\u2019. Also, it can be seen that the BMGF is currently focusing in the states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.\n\nIn the FAQ section on the BMGF website, it can be found that the BMGF operates in India under RBI\u2019s FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act) and funds the Indian NGOs which are under the regulation of Home Ministry\u2019s FCRA (Foreign Contribution Regulation Act).\n\nSo, the news that the BMGF was kicked out of India is false. Similar news went viral in 2017 that the Modi government had broken ties with the BMGF. But, on the same day, the Health Ministry issued a press note saying that \u2018some media reports have suggested that all health related collaboration with the Gates Foundation with National Health Mission (NHM) has been stopped. This is inaccurate and misleading. BMGF continues to collaborate and support the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.\u2019\n\nRegarding the 2009 vaccination incident, the information given in the post is true but it was not the BMGF which vaccinated the children. It was \u2018PATH\u2019 (Programme for Appropriate Technology in Health) organization which was involved and the project was \u2018reportedly\u2019 funded by the BMGF. On the \u2018PATH\u2019 website, it can be found that the BMGF is one of the donors of \u2018PATH\u2019.\n\nA Parliament Standing Committee report titled \u2018Alleged Irregularities in the Conduct of Studies using Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Vaccine by Path in India\u2019 was tabled in both the Houses of Parliament in 2013. The committee has found irregularities as claimed in the post and recommended action by the Government against PATH. The report did not recommend any direct action on the BMGF. The report can be read here and the counter argument by the \u2018PATH\u2019 officials can be read here.\n\nTo sum it up, Bill Melinda Gates Foundation \u2018reportedly\u2019 funded the 2009 HPV studies in India, but it was not kicked out.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
