[sic]\n\nHe post was soon shared thousands of times and was also posted on Walmart\u2019s Facebook timeline.\n\nOn 10 November 2016, a company spokesperson told us that they were trying to establish contact with Gawad to obtain more information about the alleged incident. Walmart also sent us the following statement on 11 November 2016:\n\nWe take what has been alleged seriously. We attempted to look into this matter but have been unable to verify that the claim posted to Facebook by a customer actually took place, and the page has been removed.\n\nPolice in Denver, Ohio (where the incident reportedly took place) said they had not been contacted regarding such an encounter. However, \u201cGawad\u2019s\u201d profile was later deleted; another Facebook user, Marwa Loly Hamdy Abdelhafiz, said that the images were taken from her account.\n\n\u201cGawad\u2019s\u201d post was one of several stories of anti-Islam (and other) harassment that have circulated online since Donald Trump was elected president. Another Muslim woman described a similar incident in New Mexico on Twitter, in a post that has been shared more than 17,000 times.\n\nThe Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), a leading American Muslim advocacy group, has already called on Trump to \u201crepudiate\u201d such attacks. The group\u2019s communications director, Ibrahim Hooper, told us:\n\nWe\u2019re hoping that perhaps Donald Trump as president will be different than he was while campainging for the presidency. We\u2019ll just have to see. We\u2019re just gonna maintain our defense of civil rights and religious freedom and any time those rights are challenged, we\u2019re gonna speak up and take legal action.\n\nHooper did note that one woman recanted her initial account of an attack at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. But even that case, he said, could be connected to an increase in phone calls CAIR has received from Muslim Americans facing mental health issues:", "lang": "en"}
