Trump, who was married to now-first lady Melania Trump at the time, has denied the accusation.\n\nBut the actress, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has not declared her intention to challenge Trump on the ballot.\n\nA false headline claiming as much \u2014 \u201cStormy Daniels Announces Plans To Run For President\u201d \u2014 appeared on several websites and circulated on Facebook this week, accruing thousands of comments and reactions. On pages such as the \u201cConservative Hub,\u201d commenters reacted to the supposed announcement with humor, disbelief and, in some cases, outrage.\n\nBut the stories, such as the one on conservative101.com, don\u2019t support the headline\u2019s claim.\n\n\u201cPorn star Stormy Daniels is considering running for President in 2020. And she would run as a Republican,\u201d the June 19 post claims, citing certain comments Daniels made in an interview with the Chicago Tribune. \u201cThen the conversation turned to the ridiculous idea of running for President. At first she was resistant and then she changed her mind.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the June 16 Tribune article notes that Daniels \u201csaid she has no plans to run for office.\u201d The newspaper said Daniels cited the campaign costs, in addition to her opinion that \u201cthe person best suited to represent the people probably would never get elected.\u201d\n\nThe Tribune report goes on to add that Daniels mused about running for the highest office \u2014 but seemingly in jest:\n\nApart from those comments, we could find no record of Daniels making any announcement about seeking any office.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Daniels actually did entertain the idea of entering politics once before. She publicly considered running against then-Sen. David Vitter, a Republican from Louisiana, in the 2010 midterm election, and notably declared she was switching her party affiliation, from Democrat to Republican.\n\nDaniels said in an MSNBC interview at the time that she was prompted to weigh the run after fans drafted her in hopes that she could unseat Vitter. The senator was facing his first election after the 2007 revelation that his phone number had been linked to a Washington, D.C., prostitution ring. Daniels decided not to run and Vitter won reelection.\n\nThe saga over Daniels\u2019 nondisclosure agreement spilled into public view in January, when the Wall Street Journal reported that, weeks before the 2016 election, Trump\u2019s longtime attorney, Michael Cohen, arranged to pay Daniels $130,000 to sign the agreement. Trump, who had initially denied knowing about the payment or where Cohen got the money for it, later admitted that he had reimbursed Cohen.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\nRothfeld, Michael and Joe Palazzolo. \u201cTrump Lawyer Arranged $130,000 Payment for Adult-Film Star\u2019s Silence.\u201d The Wall Street Journal. 12 Jan 2018.\n\nFarley, Robert and Eugene Kiely. \u201cQ&A on Stormy Daniels\u2019 Payment.\u201d FactCheck.org. 3 May 2018.", "lang": "en"}
