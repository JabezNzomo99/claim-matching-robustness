The sign was actually not vandalized and the billboards were taken down by the advertising company after a public controversy.\n\nOn August 19, several Canadian cities woke up to billboards decrying mass immigration and endorsing Bernier\u2019s People\u2019s Party of Canada (PPC), a marginal far-right party. \u201cSay NO to Mass Immigration,\u201d the sign read.\n\nOn August 25, a Twitter user tweeted a photo of one of the billboards in Halifax with a different message: \u201cSay NO to ass man,\u201d claiming the billboard had been vandalized. The photo received 11,000 retweets, 56,000 likes and many other users shared it as a screenshot on Facebook.\n\nHowever, the vandalism did not take place. The photo was digitally altered to make the billboard spell the message denigrating Bernier.\n\nHalifax reporter Alexander Quon pointed out that even as the pro-PPC message was being replaced by a different ad, the original letters were still visible. The containers in the background and the fence in the foreground confirm the location.\n\nQuon works for Global News, which published this video of a Pattison Outdoor Advertising employee covering the billboard.\n\nThe billboards attracted attention because of their anti-immigration stance, with Nova Scotia premier Stephen McNeil calling the tone of the ads negative and divisive in a tweet.\n\nThe PPC denied any involvement in the billboard campaign, which was actually orchestrated by third-party advertiser True North Strong & Free Advertising Corp.\n\nOn August 25, following criticism of the campaign, Pattison Outdoor president Randy Otto stated via Twitter that the ads would be removed as soon as possible.\n\nThe following day, The Canadian Press reported that True North Strong & Free disavowed the ads, saying the message had never been approved by its board. Frank Smeenk, the owner of the third party advertising company, wrote to the Canadian Press in an email that he does not always approve content that True North advertises.\n\n\u201cThe True North Strong & Free Advertising Corp was created as a vehicle to help third-party activists promote their views prior to the upcoming election with the intention that this would be welcomed as an innovative way to participate in our democratic process,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSmeenk did not return AFP calls for further clarification by the time of publication.\n\nBernier, whose face was used on the billboards, seized the opportunity to support the anti-immigration message of the ads, a cornerstone theme in his campaign, with a series of tweets.", "lang": "en"}
