North Korea got the bomb because the agreement collapsed. Yet at the same time, one could make the case that the story of the Agreed Framework supports the key point espoused in Cotton\u2019s letter. So let\u2019s explore this conundrum. (Note: Glenn Kessler covered the collapse of the Agreed Framework and subsequent efforts to negotiate a nuclear deal with Pyongyang as The Washington Post\u2019s diplomatic correspondent from 2002-2011.)\n\nIn 1994, the Bill Clinton administration negotiated an agreement with North Korea to essentially freeze its nascent nuclear program in exchange for the eventual construction of two light-water reactors. North Korea\u2019s program was clearly created to churn out nuclear weapons; the reactor at Yongbyon was not connected to the power grid and appeared only designed to produce plutonium, a key ingredient for nuclear weapons. The theory of the deal was that, with the plant shuttered and the plutonium under the close watch of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), North Korea would not be able to produce a bomb.\n\nThe deal was hugely controversial in Congress. Just as with Obama\u2019s Iran negotiations, Clinton structured the agreement so that it was not considered a treaty that would have required ratification by the Senate. As with Iran, there was also an international component, with South Korea, Japan and a European agency joining with the United States to create an organization to implement the accord.\n\nSince the \u201cAgreed Framework\u201d took the form of a presidential \u201cexecutive agreement,\u201d rather than a formal treaty (such as SALT I & II), the U.S. Senate did not need to give \u201cadvise and consent\u201d under the U.S. Constitution. However, the terms of the agreement are controversial and subject to scrutiny by the Republican-dominant U.S. Congress that began a series of congressional hearings in mid-January 1995. Some congressmen and senators demanded that the \u201cagreed framework\u201d be treated as a formal treaty; this move was resisted by the Clinton Administration but, because of the budgetary and appropriation clauses of the agreement, the U.S. Congress was inevitably drawn into the process of implementation and verification of the agreement.\n\nIn response, the Bush administration terminated a supply of fuel oil that was essential to the agreement \u2014 and then North Korea quickly kicked out the U.N. inspectors, restarted the nuclear plant and began developing its nuclear weapons, using the material in radioactive fuel rods that previously had been under the close watch of the IAEA. Japan and South Korea, the key partners in the accord, were not happy with the decision to terminate the Agreed Framework, but there was little they could do about it.\n\nYet the North Korean example also provides support for Cotton\u2019s key point in his letter \u2014 that a future president would not necessarily be compelled to support a deal negotiated with Iran. Bush\u2019s administration was stocked with people who were vehemently opposed to the Agreed Framework, and that certainly affected the pace of the diplomacy. The president himself was a key skeptic. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was even slapped down when he suggested the administration would follow the path set by the Clinton administration.\n\nAnalyst Jeffrey Lewis recently wrote that \u201cI suspect Clinton or [Al] Gore would have responded to intelligence about the enrichment program in the same fashion as Bush did,\u201d but former Clinton officials have disagreed. They have privately argued that they would have found a way to manage the process so that the plutonium would have remained out of North Korea\u2019s hands. (There is certainly evidence that the Bush administration seized on the signs of a clandestine program to force a confrontation.) Moreover, a continuing diplomatic process might have meant that Pyongyang would have had less reason to find ways to cheat on the Agreed Framework.\n\n[Joel Wit, who was in charge of implementing the Agreed Framework during the Clinton administration, writes that Lewis is \u201cjust wrong\" and a Gore presidency would have handled the situation differently. In the Clinton administration,\"we did know about the DPRK cheating on the highly-enriched uranium front starting in 1998 and had a strategy for dealing with it, namely to confront the DPRK and to use the leverage provided by the Agreed Framework in order to make the solution stick,\" he said, using the initials for the official name of North Korea (Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea).]\n\n(Some former Clinton administration officials will also concede that they never thought they would have to build the light-water reactors because they assumed, wrongly, that the regime would collapse before the reactors would be built. So one could argue that the Agreed Framework was built on a bad bet in the first place.) [Wit notes that if even this was the case, it had no impact on how the deal was implemented. \u201cThe Japanese and Republic of Korea didn\u2019t make the significant financial and other commitments they made just to fake it,\" he said.]", "lang": "en"}
