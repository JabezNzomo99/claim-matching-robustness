Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nFact: There is no Article 30A in the Indian Constitution. Also, Article 30 (1, 1A and 2) deals with the \u2018rights of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions\u2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched about the Article 30A in the Indian Constitution, it was found that there is no \u2018Article 30A\u2019 in the constitution. There are articles 30(1), 30(1A) and 30. But, they also deal with the \u2018rights of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions\u2019.\n\nArticle 30(1) enables all the minorities (based on religion or language) to establish and administer the educational institutions of their choice. The National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI) was set up in 2004 and protects the rights of minorities enshrined in Article 30. The guidelines released by the NCMEI for the \u2018determination of Minority Status, Recognition, Affiliation and related matters in respect of Minority Educational Institutions under the Constitution of India\u2019 can be read here. Also, an overview of the educational development of Minorities can be read here.\n\nTo sum it up, there is no \u2018Article 30(A)\u2019 in the Constitution which bans teaching \u2018Gita\u2019 and \u2018Ramayana\u2019 in schools. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
