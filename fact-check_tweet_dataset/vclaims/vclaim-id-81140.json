Income is how much money a person makes from a job or investments. Wealth is the value of everything a person owns after factoring in debt. The equity in a home, retirement savings and bank accounts, for example, are part of a person\u2019s wealth.\n\nWe asked Coates\u2019 publisher for more information on Coates\u2019 remark, but did not hear back.\n\nPolitiFact Texas checked a similar claim from Beto O\u2019Rourke, a former Texas congressman now running for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president. O\u2019Rourke said \"black Americans have 10 times less wealth than white Americans.\" That rated Mostly True.\n\nCoates\u2019 claim is more precise in that he referred to the typical family.\n\nThe claim is accurate when speaking about family median wealth. Economists told us median wealth data represents a typical family more than would data on average wealth. (The latter can be skewed by families with extreme wealth.)\n\nMedian wealth is the halfway point \u2014 half of families have wealth above the median, and half below.\n\nWealth is measured as net worth \u2014 the difference between a family\u2019s gross assets and their liabilities.\n\nHere, with some additional details, are the figures cited by PolitiFact Texas:\n\n\n\n The table shows that the median family net worth, or wealth, for black families was $17,600 in 2016, or roughly one-tenth that of the typical white family.\n\nThose 2016 figures, from the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances, are the most recent available. Five experts told us that\u2019s the most solid data source on wealth.\n\nThe figures exclude some things that could be considered \"wealth,\" such as aid from government programs, said economist Ryan Bourne of the Cato Institute\n\nThe survey, done every three years, collects information about various family finances, including income, net worth and credit use. \"No other study for the country collects comparable information,\" the agency says.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the table also shows that black families closed the wealth gap with white families a bit between 2013 and 2016. But the report said \"the long-standing and substantial wealth disparities\" between families of different racial and ethnic groups \"have changed little in the past few years.\"\n\nThe report offered a couple of possible explanations for the gap:\n\u2022 \"Well over half of white households are homeowners (73%), compared with just under half of black\" households.\n\u2022 White households \"tend to be older, more highly educated, more likely to have received an inheritance and less likely to be a single parent.\"\n\nA February 2019 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, however, drew a different picture.\n\n\"We find that the income gap is the primary driver behind the wealth gap and that it is large enough to explain the persistent difference in wealth accumulation.\"\n\nCoates said, \"The typical black family in this country has one-tenth the wealth of the typical white family.\"\n\nThe best way to measure typical wealth is with the median net worth, and the most recent figures are for 2016. The median net worth \u2014 gross assets minus liabilities \u2014 for black families was $17,600, about one-tenth the wealth of white families, which was $171,000.", "lang": "en"}
