Gwen Moore, D-Wisconsin.\n\n \n\n Moore began her remarks by referring to the keynote speaker, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, and his new memoir, A Reason to Believe.\n\n \n\n \"I was thinking: How in the world can you believe, what reason would you have to believe in anything, when you had just elected a governor who says that Wisconsin was open for business and therefore closed to every single human being in the state,\" Moore said to applause.\n\n \n\n Moore said Walker was cutting funding for schools, Medicaid, birth control and public transportation, but providing \"$200 million worth of tax breaks -- and (he) just literally invented a $3.6 billion budget deficit.\"\n\n \n\n Wait a minute. \"Literally invented\"?\n\n \n\n We\u2019ve been down this road a couple of times before.\n\u2022 In November 2010, as his time as governor was winding down, Democrat Jim Doyle said the deficit was as low as $1.5 billion. We rated that statement False, given that Doyle\u2019s top administrator almost immediately portrayed the figure as $2.2 billion and experts outside of government put it at about $3 billion.\n\u2022 In February 2011, about six weeks after Walker took office, state Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Madison) received a False for his claim about the shortfall. Pocan said Walker manufactured a fiscal crisis and that his $3.6 billion estimate was a \"bogus figure.\" At that time, we found Doyle had left a deficit of more than $3 billion and that Walker followed the past Madison practices in making his estimate.\n\nWe asked Moore what proof she had that Walker had invented a $3.6 billion deficit. We\u2019ll address point by point the response we received from Moore\u2019s spokesman, David Frey:\n\n \n\n Point 1: Moore thinks Walker \"made the state\u2019s fiscal situation worse\" and the fiscal bureau \"spells out the costs of his tax cuts.\" Frey noted the bureau said Walker\u2019s 2011-2013 budget includes $83 million in tax cuts.\n\n \n\n But that figure doesn\u2019t address the size of the budget deficit, which existed before Walker proposed his budget in March 2011. And it ignores the fact that the budget also includes $49 million in tax increases.\n\n \n\n Frey also noted $117 million less the state will take in because of other Walker tax changes, but that figure also does not go to the size of the deficit, either. \n\n \n\n Point 2: Moore thinks that when compared to other states, Wisconsin\u2019s budget situation \"is much more manageable.\" \n\n \n\n That\u2019s largely opinion and it doesn\u2019t specify the size of Wisconsin\u2019s deficit.\n\n \n\n Point 3: Moore thinks Walker \"is making all the wrong choices on this matter.\"\n\n \n\n Another opinion that doesn\u2019t get to the deficit question.\n\n \n\n Point 4: Walker\u2019s changes to state laws to reduce the collective bargaining powers of public employees \"were more about ideology than about budget issues.\"\n\n \n\n Again, that\u2019s an opinion -- one widely shared by Walker critics. But, like the others, that\u2019s not on point in terms of the size of the budget deficit.\n\n \n\n (On May 11, 2011, a new projection showed the state would take in about $200 million a year more than previously estimated over three years. It is unclear how Walker and the Legislature will adjust the budget proposal. But this, too, does not go to Moore\u2019s claim, which was made before the new projection was released.)\n\n \n\n In sum, Moore doesn\u2019t provide any evidence to back her claim -- which means we find ourselves at a familiar destination.\n\n \n\n Moore said Walker \"literally invented\" a $3.6 billion state budget deficit. We\u2019ve previously established that the figure is a reasonable estimate. Moore offers no new evidence to the contrary. We rate her claim False.", "lang": "en"}
