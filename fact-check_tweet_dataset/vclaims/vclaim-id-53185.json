Comparable data before this time is not available.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-53185", "url": "https://fullfact.org/crime/knife-crime-october-2019/", "vclaim": "Last week the Office for National Statistics (ONS) published the latest crime statistics showing that knife crime in England and Wales had risen to a record high.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting a few things here. Firstly, while it is accurate that knife offences have risen to a record high, we only have comparable data going back to 2011. So a \u201crecord high\u201d is maybe more fairly described as an eight-year high.\n\nSecondly, statistics in this area aren\u2019t perfect. Knife crime is measured using police recorded crime data and so only reflects crimes that are reported and recorded, not total crime.\n\nThe ONS says: \u201cA rise or fall in police recorded crime does not necessarily mean the actual level of crime in society has changed. The data can be affected by changes in recording practices, policing activity and victims\u2019 willingness to report crime.\u201d\n\nAlso the data doesn\u2019t include Manchester as before December 2017 knife crime was undercounted there and so you can\u2019t compare the data over time .\n\nThose things aside, most newspapers reported the story accurately.\n\nHowever, the Express reported that knife murders had fallen 14% over the past year \u201clargely due to increased stop and search operations in London.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s correct that the number of homicides (including murders, manslaughter and infanticide) committed with knives and sharp instruments fell by 14% last year. This was mainly due to a fall in the number of homicides involving a blade in London.\n\nIt\u2019s less clear whether the number of stop and searches increased over this time period. While the crime data in question compares the year to June 2017 and the year to June 2018, stop and search data covers a slightly different time frame, the year to March.\n\nThat aside, in 2017/18 there were around 3,000 fewer stop and searches in London overall than the year before, but around 4,000 more searches for offensive weapons specifically. So the Express has a point in saying that stop and searches increased, if what it meant was searches for offensive weapons.\n\nBut the Express also says that that one has explicitly caused the other, and there is no evidence for that. We can\u2019t say for sure what has caused the fall in the number of homicides involving a knife.\n\nThere was little overall change in the number of total offences involving a knife or sharp instrument in London in the last year. And there\u2019s evidence that previous stop and search initiatives in the capital have had a negligible effect on bringing down violent crime.", "lang": "en"}
