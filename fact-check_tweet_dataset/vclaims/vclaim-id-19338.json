The claim is false; the video has circulated online for years in reports about protests after the death of a popular militant Burhan Wani in 2016.\n\nThe one-minute 20 seconds video was posted on a page in this Facebook post on August 7, 2019. It has been viewed about 154,000 times and shared more than 8,700 times since it was posted online.\n\nThe post\u2019s Bengali-language caption translated to English states: \u201cDespite the curfew in Kashmir, lakhs of people have gathered in the jansabha. Inshallah, Kashmir will secure victory.\u201d\n\nA lakh is a unit of measurement in the Indian numbering system equal to one hundred thousand.\n\n\u201cInshallah\u201d is an Arabic word used to express \u201cGod\u2019s will\u201d as described by Collin\u2019s dictionary here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nIn the video, a man can be heard shouting anti-India slogans and words like \u201cAzadi\u201d repeatedly. Azadi is an Urdu word that translates into English as freedom.\n\nA large crowd can be seen and heard repeating sentences like \u201cWhat we want is freedom from India\u201d and \u201cAll we want is freedom.\u201d\n\nThe Indian government on August 5, 2019, issued a presidential order to scrap Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s semi-autonomous status. The state has since been in lockdown, as described in this AFP report.\n\nThe same video and claim have been published repeatedly on Facebook, for example here and here.\n\nThe claim is false; the video actually shows a Muslim cleric, Sarjan Barkati, delivering a speech to a large gathering after the death of Burhan Wani, who was a commander of the Kashmiri separatist group, Hizbul Mujahideen, who died in July, 2016.\n\nA reverse image search using screenshots obtained with the InVid tool found the misleading video clip had been edited from a longer 1:55 video published here on YouTube on September 20, 2016.\n\nThe 2016 video has a caption saying: \u201cSarjan Barkati in pro freedom rally\u201d.\n\nThe footage matches the clip circulating in the misleading posts from 46 seconds onwards.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading posts (L) and YouTube video published in 2016 (R):\n\nAnother video of the same event shot from a different angle, where Barkati can be seen speaking, was published here on YouTube in September 2016.\n\nHere is an AFP report dated July 9, 2016 about protests that broke out after Burhan Wani\u2019s death.", "lang": "en"}
