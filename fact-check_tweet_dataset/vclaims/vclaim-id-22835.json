The caption with the image claims that the sweets were being prepared keeping in view Bharatiya Janta Party's imminent victory in elections. The caption reads: Look at the piles of laddus and imagine the margin by which Modi is going to win. Jai Jai Shriram.\n\nArchived version of the image shared on the Facebook profile of one Kanak Mishra can be accessed here.\n\nThe image has been shared with similar captions on several individual profiles and groups on Facebook.\n\nWhen BOOM ran a reverse image search on the picture, we found that it had been viral earlier too with a different claim.\n\nIn January this year, the image was shared with a caption: JJP in a bad shape in Haryana. Look at JJP's condition. Now BJP will eat their 20 quintals of laddus.\n\nBack then, the post was viral in the context of BJP winning the by-polls in Haryana's Jind on January 28. Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), formed by Dushyant Chautala in December 2018, came second position in the by-polls.\n\nInterestingly, BBC Hindi had done a fact check on the claim back then, calling it fake.\n\nBOOM also found the same image shared from Facebook pages and Twitter handles in August 2018 with entirely different narratives.\n\nWe also came across a 2018 tweet which claims that these laddus were being made in Rohtak for the Maha Kabeer bhandara.\n\nWhile the images shared in the tweet and that in the viral post are not the same, the white tent in the background looks similar.\n\nThough BOOM could not independently establish where the image was from, we could trace it back till June 2018, thus proving that the photo has been on social media for a while now.", "lang": "en"}
