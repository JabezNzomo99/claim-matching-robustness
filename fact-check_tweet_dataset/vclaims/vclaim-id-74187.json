Twenty of our Bravehearts were martyred in Ladakh but they taught a lesson to those who eyed our country,\" PM Modi had said while addressing an all-party meet held on June 19. Former President of the Indian National Congress, Rahul Gandhi, posted a video clip on Twitter and said that while Ladakhis claim that China has taken their land, the PM says otherwise and someone is \"lying\". \"Obviously, someone is lying,\" he wrote.\n\nThe video has over 930,000 views and has been retweeted over 18,000 times.\n\n Following Gandhi's tweet, BJP leader Kapil Mishra retweeted Amit Malviya's tweet where he had shared a video clip that stated that the 'Ladakhi people' who appeared in the Congress leader's clip where either Congress workers or non-residents making false claims on Ladakh.\n\nMen featuring in the video posted by Rahul Gandhi were Congress functionaries and not ordinary Ladakhis. Some of the people featured in Rahul Gandhi's video clip are indeed Congress workers. Journalist Barkha Dutt, in a video report on Ladakh, has referred Namgyal Durbuk as an ex-Congress Councillor from Congress.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343 Also Read: Fact Check: Old Video Shared As Pak-Chinese Soldiers Celebrating After Galwan Valley Clash", "lang": "en"}
