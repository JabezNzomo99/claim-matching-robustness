Aquino III \u201cchanged the definition\u201d of extrajudicial killings (EJKs). He said:\n\nThe claim, a repeat of an earlier statement Cayetano made during the third cycle of the United Nations Universal Periodic Review in Geneva May 8, has no basis. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Was the definition of EJKs changed under the Duterte administration?)\n\nThe Philippines lacks a law defining EJKs, although there are jurisprudence outlining what these are. In 2007, the Supreme Court has defined \u201cextra-legal killings\u201d to include killings of suspected criminals without due process.\n\nCayetano attributed the supposed \u201cchange\u201d in definition to Administrative Order No. 35, signed by former president Benigno Aquino III in 2012.\n\nThe order, intended to create a committee to expedite the resolution of killings, limited the scope of EJKs to political and cause-oriented killings, among others. But since it is an order and not a law, it doesn\u2019t provide a comprehensive definition of EJKs.\n\nTwelve minutes into the interview, Cayetano said Duterte \u201cnever jokes about rape.\u201d He said:\n\nAn earlier compilation of Duterte\u2019s sexist comments, some of them admissions of sexual assault, disproves Cayetano\u2019s claim that the president never made rape a laughing matter. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Has Duterte never disrespected women?)\n\nIn numerous occasions, Duterte\u2019s rape remarks drew laughter from the audience and subsequent flak.\n\nAt the height of the 2016 presidential campaign, Duterte came under fire for saying, as city mayor, he \u201cshould have been first\u201d in raping Australian missionary Jacqueline Hamill, who was gang raped and killed by Davao City prison inmates in 1989.\n\nMore, the president, in another speech, regaled his audience with a story about his confession to a Jesuit priest how he sexually violated a domestic worker.\n\nDuterte again made fun of rape in July, this time aiming at Miss Universe pageant winners, saying he would congratulate a rapist who would even dare knowing he could be executed later.\n\nBeyond anecdotes relating to rape, he promised to claim responsibility for rape committed by government troops assigned to implement martial law in Mindanao.\n\nImmediately after his claim that the president never jokes about rape, Cayetano said Davao City, where Duterte was mayor for more than 22 years, is \u201cone of the safest places\u201d in the country. He said:\n\nPhilippine National Police data from 2010 to 2015 reveal a different story. Davao City ranked fourth among cities with the highest number of index crimes. It also had the most number of murder incidents. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Is Davao City \u2018relatively safe?\u2019)\n\nIndex crimes include murder, homicide, physical injury, theft and rape, among others.\n\nAlso contrary to Cayetano\u2019s claim that Davao City is safe when it comes to rape, PNP Crime Environment data show the number of rape incidents rose by 23.4 percent during Duterte\u2019s last term as city mayor.\n\nDepartment of Justice, Administrative Order No. 35, s. 2012 \n\n\n\nDepartment of Justice, Inter-Agency Committee (IAC) on Extra-Legal Killings, Enforced Disappearance Meet to Adopt Guidelines on Investigation and Prosecution\n\nOfficial Annotations to the Rule on the Privilege of the Writ of Amparo (Download here.)\n\n(Guided by the code of principles of the International Fact-Checking Network at Poynter, VERA Files tracks the false claims, flip-flops, misleading statements of public officials and figures, and debunks them with factual evidence.
