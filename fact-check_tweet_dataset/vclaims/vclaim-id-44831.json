Excerpts from the article include: \"Former President Barack Obama announced late last night that he had filed for divorce from his wife of 27 years, Michelle Obama, after he revealed a secret double life as a homosexual.\"\n\nThe satire piece also includes a ficticious quote from the former US President stating: \"It is with a bit of sadness and a whole lot of relief that I announce that Michelle and I have decided to separate, as I have admitted to her, as I'm doing now to the rest of the world, that I am a homosexual.\"\n\nSocial media users have in the past, and once again with the resurrection of this story believed it to be true.\n\nView the Facebook post here and the archived version here.\n\nView the tweet here and the archived version here.\n\nTwitter users have even posted threads with the full text of Empire News' satire piece.

They further elaborate that the news stories on public figures are for satirization and parody purposes only.\n\nThe website's About section features the disclaimer: \"Empire News is intended for entertainment purposes only.
