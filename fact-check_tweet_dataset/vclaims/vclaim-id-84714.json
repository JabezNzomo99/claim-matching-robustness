The footage, however, was taken last year during a rehearsal in preparation for the presidential inauguration.\n\nThe 24-second video, shared in this Facebook post on April 27, shows two SAA planes flying in formation.\n\nThe video caption partly reads: \u201c4 SAA pilots were granted permission to do a final fly-by over OR Tambo this morning as the last farewell to a once proud and joy of SA (sic).\u201d\n\nThe claim has been duplicated in other posts, including here, here, and here.\n\nAs reported by AFP, South Africa's cash-strapped national carrier is on its last legs after years of mismanagement and debt, as plans for its rescue have been hampered by the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nSAA spokesman Tlali Tlali described the claims as \u201cblatantly misleading\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe video was taken last year as part of practice and rehearsal in preparation for the presidential inauguration fly past which SAA successfully executed,\u201d Tlali said.\n\n\u201cSome conspiracy theorists, motivated by malice, it appears, have turned this video into some propaganda to achieve their own ends. It is not what they claim it is.\u201d\n\nOn May 25, 2019, South Africa inaugurated its sixth democratically-elected president as covered locally here and here. The clip below shows the flypast from the inauguration day.\n\nMeanwhile, the ban on both domestic and international passenger flights during the country\u2019s COVID-19 lockdown remains in place, except for repatriation flights either bringing back South Africans or transporting foreign nationals to their homes, said South Africa\u2019s Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula.", "lang": "en"}
