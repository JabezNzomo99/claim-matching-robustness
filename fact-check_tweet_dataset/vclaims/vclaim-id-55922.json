Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez advocates extending COVID-19 restrictions on businesses \u201cuntil after the November Elections.\u201d There is no evidence Ocasio-Cortez sent the bogus tweet, which was shared \u2014 and later deleted \u2014 by a Florida congressional candidate and a Fox News host.\n\nThis is just the latest bogus tweet aimed at the New York Democrat; we\u2019ve written about two others since she took office in 2019.\n\nThe recent fake tweet is being shared as a screenshot meme on various social media platforms, including Facebook, spreading the falsehood that she posted this message about the restrictions imposed on businesses because of the COVID-19 pandemic: \u201cIt\u2019s vital that Governors maintain restrictions on businesses until after the November Elections because economic recovery will help Trump be re-elected. A few business closures or job losses is a small price to pay to be free from his presidency. #KeepUsClosed\u201d\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Twitter account shows no such post.\n\nSome versions of the falsehood account for that by claiming that she deleted the tweet, but ProPublica\u2019s log of her deleted tweets also shows that she deleted no such tweet. And a screen capture of her Twitter account that day on the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine doesn\u2019t show the tweet, either.\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s account shows that she didn\u2019t tweet anything on May 20, the date given in the phony tweet, but she did retweet four posts referencing her appearance that evening on ABC\u2019s \u201cNightline,\u201d where she was interviewed about the impact of COVID-19 on essential workers. Ocasio-Cortez advocated extending hazard pay for those workers.\n\n\u201cTwo bucks an hour means the world to workers. It means nothing to Jeff Bezos,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said on the show, referring to the billionaire who owns Amazon. \u201cSo, why don\u2019t we just give folks the actual wages that they deserve.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ocasio-Cortez didn\u2019t post the tweet, Florida congressional candidate Jessi Melton and Fox News personality Mark Levin did post the bogus claim. They later deleted their tweets.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

The Democrats seek to destroy our economy, your jobs, and your businesses, hoping Trump will be blamed by the voters. See below. Keep in mind, AOC speaks for Biden. She\u2019s an official part of Biden\u2019s campaign.\u201d Archived from Twitter. 23 Jun 2020.", "lang": "en"}
