Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nWhen we subjected the screenshots of the video to reverse image search technique, a video of Indonesian news channel \u2018Tribun Jateng\u2019 was obtained in the search results. As per the news video, the incident occurred in the settlements of Cianjur & Sukanagara in Indonesia in April 2020.\n\nAnother Indonesian news channel \u2018Metro TV News\u2019 has also reported that the incident occurred in Cianjur town of Indonesia. So, the landslide in the video occured in Indonesia.\n\nEarlier, when the same video was viral as a landslide on Shillong (Meghalaya) highway, \u2018FACTLY\u2019 has debunked the claim and has written a fact-check article.\n\nTo sum it up, video of a landslide in Indonesia is being falsely shared as the one on Goa-Madgaon highway.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
