The most recent source of tension was her attendance at the Olympic closing ceremony in South Korea.\n\nWhile some editorial pages have suggested the couple should resign from their White House posts, no reputable news sources have announced their departure, let alone firing.\n\nAnd the contents of Trump\u2019s will -- and whether the couple has somehow been eliminated from it -- have not been reported by any credible sources, either.\n\nThe headline is a hoax tagged to an unrelated aggregated story to drive page views.\n\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
