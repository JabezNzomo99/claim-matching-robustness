And he failed to mention that his decision to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord was undercutting efforts to address a fundamental threat to the planet. Mr. Trump listed what he cast as accomplishments in addressing air pollution, carbon emissions, hazardous sites and lead exposure \u2014 taking credit for trends that preceded his administration or actions mandated by courts. Left unaddressed were his effort to weaken environmental standards by rolling back regulations and his record of putting former industry executives and lobbyists in key policymaking positions. \u201cOne of the main messages of air pollution, particulate matter is six times lower here than the global average.\u201d It\u2019s true that America\u2019s air is much cleaner than it was five decades ago. But Mr. Trump is including years of progress that took place under his predecessors. Of the six \u201ccriteria\u201d air pollutants tracked by the Environmental Protection Agency, four actually increased in 2017, Mr. Trump\u2019s first year in office: carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and two measures of particulate matter pollution. (It should be noted that data for 2018 is not yet publicly available, while single-year increases for the six metrics have occurred under previous administrations as well.)\n\nIndependent analyses have also found that air quality has declined under Mr. Trump\u2019s watch. The Associated Press reported that there were 15 percent more days with unhealthy air in the United States both in 2017 and 2018 than on average from 2013 to 2016. The American Lung Association found that \u201cozone and short-term particle pollution worsened in many cities\u201d from 2015 to 2017 compared with 2014 to 2016. \u201cEvery single one of the signatories to the Paris climate accord lags behind America in overall emissions reductions.\u201d The United States cut its annual emissions of carbon dioxide by about 800 million to 900 million metric tons from 2000 to 2016, according to estimates from the Paris-based International Energy Agency and the United States Energy Information Administration. That is indeed that a larger overall emissions reduction than any of the signatories to the Paris climate agreement. But the United States is also the second-largest emitter in the world and one of the largest per capita emitters. By more meaningful metrics, the United States lags behind many other countries. In that time period \u2014 before Mr. Trump took office \u2014 the United States reduced total emissions 15.7 percent, according to the International Energy Agency. That rate was below that of more than 20 signatories to the Paris agreement, including advanced economies like the United Kingdom (28.7 percent), Sweden (26.9 percent) and Italy (22.5 percent). In emissions per capita, the United States reduced emissions by about 26.3 percent, behind more than a dozen signatories including Denmark (38.7 percent), Britain (36.1 percent) and Sweden (34.6 percent).", "lang": "en"}
