A public health professor told AFP that the theory was \u2018absurd\u2019.\n\nThe Facebook posts, which we\u2019ve archived here, here and here, claim that drinking warm water in the morning \u2018will resolve a long list of health conditions, including \u2018epilepsy\u2019, \u2018paralysis\u2019 and \u2018all types of cancer in 9 months\u2019.\n\n\u2018Get up early in the morning and drink 2 Glasses of Warm Water when the stomach is empty. Do not eat anything for 45mins after taking the water,\u2019 reads a post from November 1, 2019 in the Facebook group \u2018Glopearl Skincare Tips\u2019, which has been shared more than 130 times.\n\nThe post also claims that drinking cold water is \u2018bad for you\u2019. \u2018Cold drinks are main reason for heart attack. It also creates problems in the liver\u2019, it says.\n\nA similar post on the \u2018Dr Lulu\u2019 Facebook page, which has more than 160,000 followers, gives the same advice. It urges Facebook users, \u2018PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS, IT\u2019S VERY IMPORTANT AND CAN SAVE SOMEONE\u2019S LIFE\u2019.\n\nSome of the Facebook posts, such as this one from January 2017, attribute the claim to \u2018a group of Japanese Doctors\u2019 or \u2018Dr. D. Mensah Asare\u2019.\n\n\u2018Dr. D. Mensah Asare says that the main benefits of warm water are numerous. A group of Japanese Doctors confirmed that warm water is 100% effective in resolving some health problems,\u2019 it says.\n\nAFP ran Google searches on \u2018Dr D. Mensah Asare\u2019 but couldn\u2019t find any proof he really exists, such as a hospital with a doctor by that name.\n\nOne Google result for the mystery doctor leads to a blog post sharing the claims that drinking warm water is \u2018100% effective in curing health problems, including cancer, and mentioning \u2018Dr D. Mensah Asare\u2019.\n\nHowever, a Google reverse image search of the photograph purporting the show the doctor reveals the image is actually that of a Ghanaian entrepreneur.\n\nA public health professor told AFP that water - whether hot or cold - does not \u2018have the power to cure illnesses\u2019.\n\n\u2018Water is vital for life, but of course it doesn\u2019t have the power to cure illnesses,\u2019 said Bruno Falissard, director of the Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health at French research institute Inserm and public health professor at Paris-Saclay university.\n\n\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter if water is hot or cold. It isn\u2019t a cure and it isn\u2019t harmful either. The body can tolerate water between 0 and 40 degrees,\u2019 he told AFP by phone.\n\n\u2018There are no scientific studies on the advantages of hot water\u2019 to cure illnesses and \u2018the rationale behind this idea of hot water therapy is absurd\u2019.\n\nMisinformation about cures for cancer is nothing new. AFP has previous debunked claims that eating a sugar-free diet causes cancer cells to die naturally\u2019 and that women on their periods shouldn\u2019t drink ice water to avoid developing cancer.", "lang": "en"}
