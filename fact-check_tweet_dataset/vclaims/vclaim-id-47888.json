It had also been shared on Facebook.\n\nThis report by Daily Hunt was published on June 4, 2018, and is still available online. However, the news is false. According to a March 2018 report by NDTV, two people were killed in violence that erupted during Ram Navami celebration in West Bengal. Two months hence, several media outlets \u2013 Rajasthan Patrika, Times of India, Deccan Chronicle \u2013 reported that the 11 members of Bajrang Dal were arrested.\n\nA June 5, 2018 report by Newslaundrysaid that news agency ANI was the first to publish a report which was later picked up by varied media outlets. However, ANI later took down the copy where it claimed that 11 Bajrang Dal workers were arrested for the murder of two BJP workers. Speaking to Newslaundry, ANI informed that the story was pulled down owing to an \u201cerror in assessment\u201d. \u201cWe were told that the editorial team mixed up two stories. The arrest of the Bajrang Dal activists was in connection with Ram Navami violence in the state and not the gruesome murders of Bharatiya Janata Party workers,\u201d reported Newslaundry.\n\nIn June this years, the official Twitter and Facebook handles of BJP Madhya Pradesh had shared the same erroneous report carried by Daily Hunt after a BJP worker was killed in West Bengal in violence that erupted during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Alt News had debunked the misinformation here.\n\nA misreport by ANI which was carried by Daily Hunt continues to misinform on social media as the latter is yet to take down the false report.", "lang": "en"}
