Let\u2019s try to analyze the extent of authenticity in this post.\n\n\n\nFact: The cake that was cut by Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh in the video was not on Manmohan Singh\u2019s birthday, but on the occasion of Congress party\u2019s foundation day. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were searched on Google using reverse image technique, photos of Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh cutting a cake were found in a tweet by \u2018ANI\u2019 in December 2018. From that tweet, it is understood that Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh were cutting cake on the occasion of Congress party\u2019s foundation day (December 28). An article published by \u2018NDTV\u2019 regarding this event can be found here.\n\n\n\nTo sum it up, the video of Congress party\u2019s foundation day celebration is being shared as that of Rahul Gandhi cutting Manmohan Singh\u2019s birthday cake.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
