The group had refused to give up the town to regime forces. One canister broke a hole in the roof and the chlorine, which is heavier than air, flowed down into the building, killing at least 34 civilians.\n\nThe \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d leaked internal emails and claimed that the OPCW ignored their criticisms in its final report on the Douma chemical attack. Some observers have analyzed and debunked these criticisms of the OPCW, which also released a statement disputing the claims and the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d label for the two individuals involved.\n\nSpeaking to RT, however, Holmes said the testimony of one of the whistleblowers, identified as \u201cAlex,\u201d was \u201cvery convincing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNative English speaker, he was a senior member of the OPCW,\u201d RT quoted Holmes as saying. \u201cHe was extremely well-qualified for the job. And I cannot think of a reason why he became a whistleblower other than he felt very strongly that the final report had not reflected the findings.\u201d\n\nWhile RT portrayed Holmes as a disinterested former general who was convinced by the testimony he heard, the news agency did not mention that he is one of the directors of the British Syrian Society, an organization founded in 2003 to promote better relations between the United Kingdom and Syria. Its founder and co-chairman is Fawaz Akhras, father-in-law of Syrian President Bashar al Assad. Akhras, a London-based cardiologist, was already affiliated with the regime of Bashar\u2019s father, Hafez al-Assad, working as a medical consultant and liaison for top regime officials when they visited the U.K. His wife, Sahar Akhras, formerly worked at the Syrian embassy in London.\n\nIn March 2012, The Guardian obtained a cache of emails from Akhras to both his son-and-law and his daughter, advising them on how to deal with the anti-regime protests which had been growing in intensity since 2011. He mainly counseled his son-in-law on how to respond to reports of human rights abuses during the regime\u2019s crackdown on protesters, including video aired on British TV showing the torture of children.\n\nThe other co-chairman of the organization is Peter Ford, who served as Britain\u2019s ambassador to Syria from 2003 to 2006. Ford often appears on RT as a guest commentator on Syria and his message is consistently pro-Assad.\n\nOther members of the British Syrian Society have connections to the Assad regime. For example, Director Naji Chaoui is president of the Syrian International Chamber of Commerce and chairman of the board of the Syrian bank Al-Sharq.\n\nHolmes\u2019 affiliation with the British Syrian Society wasn\u2019t the only omission in the RT article. Its headline referred to \u201coutside actors\u201d who allegedly influenced the OPCW. And the article quoted Holmes as saying: \u201cIts (the OPCW's) value is its independence. It cannot be influenced by outside actors.\u201d\n\nThe article doesn\u2019t name any outside actors. Moreover, it fails to mention real examples of an outside actor trying to influence the work of the OPCW: the Russian government.\n\nIn October 2017, Russia used its vote in the U.N. Security Council to veto an extension of the OPCW\u2019s Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), the mission to investigate chemical attacks in the Syrian war. Earlier that year, the JIM published a report that found the Assad regime responsible for a chemical attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun.\n\nIn addition, four Russians working for the GRU (Russian military intelligence) were arrested last year in The Hague and charged with attempting to hack into the headquarters of the OPCW. The men were found with a car full of electronic devices and laptops, and investigators said the group was collecting information about the OPCW office and surrounding buildings.\n\nThe \u201cwhistleblower\u201d story was heavily promoted by WikiLeaks and various Russian state media outlets. The story is connected with a series of leaked internal emails between OPCW personnel about the report on the Douma chemical attack.\n\n\"Alex,\" the first \u201cwhistleblower\u201d to emerge, claimed to have been a part of the OPCW\u2019s Fact-Finding Mission (FFM), which was allowed to conduct an investigation into the Douma incident only after regime forces had taken control of the town and after being delayed in Damascus.\n\nThe OPCW statement on the scandal appears to confirm that \u201cAlex\u201d was indeed a member of the FFM in Syria. However, it says he was left in Damascus and not allowed to travel to the site of the attack because he lacked the proper training.\n\nThe independent investigation site Bellingcat reported that most of the criticisms made by \u201cAlex\u201d concerned not the final report on Douma, but earlier interim reports. Bellingcat noted that when comparing the draft and final reports,the final version appeared to address \u201cmany or all of Alex\u2019s points.\u201d The Al-Bab news site also reported on the complaints of \"Alex,\" pointing out that they confirm evidence of a chlorine attack in Douma.\n\nIan Henderson, who was identified as the other \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d was not a member of the FFM.\n\nHenderson published a report shortly before the release of the FFM\u2019s final report on Douma, mainly disputing the claim that the gas canisters were dropped from the air (a crucial point, given that Syria\u2019s rebels have no air assets). Henderson\u2019s claims were contradicted by three different independent engineering studies commissioned by the OPCW.", "lang": "en"}
