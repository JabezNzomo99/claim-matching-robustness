The brave army of fake profiles has deserted the cause they were supporting so vocally yesterday. There has been some hurried action after the Alt News story on fake profiles defending Rajasthan Chief Minister, Vasundhara Raje and her government over the lynching of Zafar Khan. All the twitter profiles with stolen pictures and fake names reported in the Alt News article have deleted their accounts and disappeared.\n\nAashif Khan (@kaashif752), who had stolen a profile picture of Sandeep Amar, a vice president at an IT company has deleted his account.\n\nThe fake account in the name of Juned Khan(@juned45658) who was using the picture of a professor has also met with the same fate.\n\nThe fake account Aarti Gupta (@aarti563256) who was using a picture of Amina Ahmad from Pakistan has also been deleted.\n\nGanga Singh (@singhganga8365) seems to be suspended by Twitter. This fake account was using the picture of a Telugu actress\n\nDiksha Mishra (@dikshamishhra71) who was caught impersonating @niti_taylor has also disappeared\n\nAdditionally we found that some of the accounts who were also part of this coordinated campaign but were not covered in our article have also been deleted. Anant Srivastav who had lifted a profile picture of Salman Siddiqui has also been deleted.\n\nThe account going by the name of Nikita Meena is temporarily restricted due to unusual activity.\n\nThere is no doubt that it must be very embarrassing for the commander of this army that his troops with fake profiles and stolen pictures were caught tweeting identical messages to defend Rajasthan government. As we said before, this sort of an unethical effort does more harm than good to the cause it intends to support.", "lang": "en"}
