Times Now Airs Fake WhatsApp Forward on Death of 30 Chinese Troops A WhatsApp forward which apparently names at least 30 Chinese PLA soldiers killed during the violent face-off between the Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley, found its way to Times Now\u2019s bulletin and is now being circulated widely. According to the viral message, a Global Times article revealing the names of these 30 PLA soldiers was published on Wednesday at 0:57:25. \u201cA spokesperson for the Western Theatre Command that oversees defences of China's border with India has released the names of 30 Chinese troops killed by Indian action,\u201d the message adds. However, we searched on Google using relevant keywords and found that no such information has been shared by Global Times, on either its website or Twitter account. While it is true that the Global Times\u2019 editor-in-chief did confirm casualties on the Chinese side, names and the number of casualties have not been released officially. It is clear that the message was falsely attributed to Chinese government mouthpiece Global Times and there is no evidence to support its authenticity.\n\nSeveral screenshots of tweets are circulating on social media as actor Sushant Singh Rajput\u2019s last message. The tweets which were allegedly posted a few hours before his death, and subsequently deleted, talk about his mental health and why he is ending his life. Hindi News channel Aaj Tak also carried a story on these tweets. However, the story has now been taken down. However, there are a number of red flags in the tweets which make it evident that the screenshots are fake. For example, in one of the tweets, there are different fonts being used as far as the dateline, name of the Twitter user and text of the tweet are concerned. The second red flag was the dateline itself. The date mentioned in one of the tweets reads \u201814 jun 20\u2019 which is not the format used by Twitter. Also, as per Sushant Singh Rajput\u2019s Twitter profile, his last tweet was on 27 December 2019. While it can be argued that the tweets might have been deleted, it is clear that these screenshots are manipulated and don\u2019t show the late actor\u2019s last tweet.

A day after the \u201cviolent face-off\u201d between Indian and Chinese troops at the Galwan Valley in Eastern Ladakh, claims started abounding on social media that former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had given India\u2019s seat in the United Nations Security Council to China. An archived version can be found here. In a subsequent tweet he said that Nehru \u201cgifted\u201d the seat which was first offered to India and called it an \u201cAmerican bait\u201d. The same claim was shared by many others on the micro-blogging site. Congress leader and former UN Under-Secretary General Shashi Tharoor had said in an interview in 2004 that Nehru \u201cdeclined a US offer\u201d to India to take a permanent seat at the UNSC in 1953, and said China be given the seat instead. Even in his book \u2018Nehru \u2013 The Invention of India\u2019, Tharoor writes that Nehru suggested the seat, held by Taiwan till then, be offered to Beijing instead. Nehru was reportedly known to have said that \u201cthe seat was held with scant credibility by Taiwan.\u201d In an article, historian AG Noorani refers to the 1955 offer made by USSR to India for a permanent seat in the UN. According to Noorani, the Russian offer to India was merely a \u201cfeeler\u201d to test India. This is because while the 1950 offer made by the US was done with an intent to keep China \u2013 another Communist bloc \u2013 from entering the UNSC, the Russian offer was made at a time when the USSR and China\u2019s alliance had reached a certain height.

Not at All A viral post on social media claims that ever since the US dropped nuclear bombs on Japan in 1945, it has become impossible for the American nation to sell even a needle in the country, because Japanese citizens boycott goods made in the United States. The post then calls for Indians to do the same against China. We found that this claim has been viral on social media since 2016, which is what 71 years added to 1945, as mentioned in the viral message, would come to. We looked at the data available on the website of the United States Census Bureau, which showed that in 2016, trade was very much booming between the US and Japan. We also checked the data of the subsequent years, ie, 2017-2020. In 2017, the value of US export of goods to Japan was $67,603.4 million, in 2018 it was $75,149.3 million, in 2019 it was $74,376.5 million and up till April 2020, it was $23,614.7 million. Further, according to data from the website of the United States Trade Representative, as of 2019, Japan is USA\u2019s fourth largest goods trading partner. Therefore, there is clearly no data to back up the claim that Japanese citizens have been boycotting goods manufactured in the US.

No, Image Shared by Malviya Isn\u2019t From Gandhis\u2019 2008 China Visit Days after the \u201cviolent face-off\u201d between Indian and Chinese troops at the Galwan Valley in Eastern Ladakh, the head of the BJP IT cell, Amit Malviya, shared an image claiming that it was from Gandhi family\u2019s visit to China in 2008. While the Gandhis did reportedly visit Beijing in 2008 and signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Communist Party of China (CPC) to enhance party-to-party ties, the photo being shared has no relation to that in any way. An archived version of the Tweet can be accessed here. A reverse image search using Yandex search engine helped us find the same image uploaded on the website of the Chinese Embassy on 21 April 2017. According to the website, the Chinese Embassy had extended an invitation to several India politicians including Rahul, Priyanka Gandhi and her family to attend the China Diaoyutai Food Festival. Among other politicians who attended the event were BJP\u2019s Suresh Prabhu who was the then minister of Railways, CPI (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury, JDU Chief General Secretary KC Tyagi and others. Therefore, it is clear that an image from a 2017 event attended by representatives of several political parties is being used to insinuate that the Gandhi family had a \u201csecret meeting\u201d with the Chinese politicians.
