She\u2019s running against Republican John Adcock, who was appointed to the seat in September.\n\n\"John Adcock wants to join politicians who took thousands from insurance companies and support letting them deny health care coverage,\" a narrator in the ad says.\n\n\"Their plan would get rid of coverage altogether for thousands of families and raise premiums on the rest of us.\"\n\nThe claims are vague, leaving PolitiFact to wonder which plan by legislative Republicans would eliminate coverage for North Carolina families.\n\nThe first quote is a reference to Republicans refusing to expand Medicaid, said Benjamin Woods, Batch\u2019s campaign manager. It\u2019s been well-documented that expanding Medicaid in North Carolina could provide coverage for up to 500,000 people.\n\nSo let\u2019s move on to the second quote. Woods said it refers to legislative Republicans\u2019 \"work to undermine the positive impact of the Affordable Care Act in North Carolina.\"\n\nWoods referenced a Charlotte Observer editorial about a Republican proposal this summer that would allow nonprofit organizations to offer health benefits to their members.\n\nAn alternative to the ACA\n\nHealth benefit plans, which exist in other states but aren\u2019t available in North Carolina, can be cheaper than typical health insurance because they\u2019re not regulated and don\u2019t have to meet financial solvency requirements for sufficient funds to pay customers\u2019 medical bills, The News & Observer reported in June.\n\nThe plans don\u2019t cover mental health benefits or preventive health services, unlike health insurance regulated under the ACA. (Although, in some cases, customers can pay extra for that coverage.)\n\nCritics, including The Charlotte Observer editorial board, fear the nonprofit benefit plans would lure healthy customers away from ACA plans, \"which in turn would force insurers to raise premiums even more to cover the costs of the less healthy folks and elderly who remain on Obamacare.\" The Observer\u2019s editorial continued: \"The result: Obamacare will be gutted. So will its preexisting conditions benefit.\"\n\nThe bill\u2019s intention is indeed to provide healthy North Carolinians an alternative to subsidizing insurance for unhealthy people, said David Anderson, a research associate for Duke University\u2019s Margolis Center for Health Policy.\n\n\"It\u2019s a cynical dodge, but a legal one,\" Anderson said. And it \"would harm a small group of families who have significant medical conditions.\"\n\nThe bill wouldn\u2019t directly eliminate coverage, as the ad suggests. But it could drive up prices for ACA customers, prompting customers with the highest premiums to leave the marketplace altogether.\n\n\"You\u2019d probably start seeing price changes if 10,000 to 20,000 (healthy ACA customers) leave the risk pool,\" Anderson said. Eventually, he said, people with pre-existing conditions and the poor \"will have to make the decision between paying the mortgage and paying for insurance.\"\n\nThe bill, however, never became law. And Adcock hasn\u2019t expressed support for it.\n\nIn an email to PolitiFact, Adcock said he doesn\u2019t know the specifics of the bill. But, \"I know that many Republicans in the State House had many concerns with this bill as written, and I agree with them that the bill in its current form should not pass.\n\n\"I think that if non-profit organizations want to offer health insurance to their members, they should be bound by consumer protections and have to cover all of their members, regardless of pre-existing conditions,\" Adcock continued. \"While I\u2019m open to considering a bill authorizing self-funded health benefit plans for non-profit organizations, I would need to review an extensive and objective analysis of its impacts before I could determine if such a bill is in the best interest of my constituents.\"\n\nBatch\u2019s commercial suggests a plan supported by John Adcock and legislative Republicans \"would get rid of coverage altogether for thousands of families and raise premiums on the rest of us.\" Her campaign manager cited a bill that would have provided an alternative option to the Affordable Care Act. While that bill could ultimately destabilize the ACA marketplace, causing premiums to rise, it doesn\u2019t directly eliminate coverage. It didn\u2019t have enough support to pass and Adcock says he opposes it.
