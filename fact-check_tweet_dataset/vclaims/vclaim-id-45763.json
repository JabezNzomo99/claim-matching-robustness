Unfortunately, a lot of kids and some adults take these ignorant comments seriously. Look, there might be a cautionary lesson in LeBron for kids: This is what happens when you attempt to leave high school a year early to join the NBA. And it\u2019s always unwise to seek political advice from someone who gets paid $100 million a year to bounce a ball. Oh, and LeBron and Kevin? You\u2019re great players but no one voted for you. Millions elected Trump to be their coach. So keep the political commentary to yourself, or as someone once said, shut up and dribble.\n\nThe second clip comes from June 3, 2020, and shows Ingraham defending Drew Brees after the NFL star, a white man, said that he would \u201cnever agree with anybody disrespecting the flag\u201d when he was asked about football players kneeling during the National Anthem in protest of police brutality and racial injustice.\n\nWell he\u2019s allowed to have his view of what kneeling and the flag means to him. I mean, he\u2019s a person. He has some worth, I would imagine. This is beyond football though. This is totalitarian conduct. This is Stalinist. And by the way on the streets of New Orleans they are shouting \u2018F Drew Brees.\u2019 That\u2019s what this moment has done to the beautiful team spirit of the New Orleans Saints\u2026 He\u2019s giving $5 million to charity by the way.\n\nA longer clip of this segment is viewable at The Daily Beast.\n\nWhile Ingraham defended Brees\u2019 remarks, the NFL player later apologized to his teammates, his fans, and the people of New Orleans, writing: \u201cI would like to apologize to my friends, teammates, the City of New Orleans, the black community, NFL community and anyone I hurt with my comments yesterday. In speaking with some of you, it breaks my heart to know the pain I have caused. In an attempt to talk about respect, unity, and solidarity centered around the American flag and the national anthem, I made comments that were insensitive and completely missed the mark on the issues we are facing right now as a country.\u201d\n\nIngraham addressed the controversy stemming from comparisons of her comments on Brees and James in a follow-up segment on June 5, in which she noted a \u201cnuance between the two instances\u201d and said, \u201cEvery American, every American has the God-given right to speak his mind on any issue.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
