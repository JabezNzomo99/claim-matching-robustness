The claim in the posts is false: the photo has been doctored from an AFP photo of a Japanese porn actor.\n\nThe photo was shared in this Facebook post on June 22, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe Indonesian-language caption translates to English as: \u201cProf. Tokuda (84) smiles as he shows the data of fraud committed by the KPU. He says that \u2018Prabowo\u306f\u30c7\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u305b\u3093\u2019 (Prabowo wa Dikku o motte imasen) which means Prabowo is a powerful tiger who is yet to awake.\n\n\u201cHe shows that Prabowo, with 61% of the vote, is the real winner of Indonesia\u2019s election, defeating Jokowi (38%). Furthermore, he also puts the hashtag #PrabowoWithoutDick2019 at the end of his document.\n\n\u201cFor those who don\u2019t know, Prof Tokuda is a democracy expert in Japan. Since he was a child, he has felt guilty because his grandfathers and grandmothers colonised Indonesia in the past. In his old age (84 years old), he wants to help Indonesia so that it won\u2019t be colonised by China. May he live long and stay healthy, Amen.\u201d\n\nKPU refers to Indonesia\u2019s General Elections Commission. Jokowi is the nickname of President Joko Widodo.\n\nPrabowo lost the April 2019 election to Jokowi, according to final results announced by the KPU on May 21. Here is an AFP report about the result.\n\nAn AFP journalist in Tokyo translated the Japanese-language part of the caption, \u201cPrabowo\u306f\u30c7\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u305b\u3093\u201d. It actually means \u201cPrabowo Without Dick\u201d \u2013 the same as the hashtag.\n\nThe same photo and claim were also shared on Facebook in a post archived here, which has since been deleted.\n\nDespite the satirical tone of these posts, neither was shared by pages that identify themselves as satirical. The captions also do not clearly say that the post is satirical. An archived version of a similar Facebook post here shows it was published in a public group for Prabowo supporters.\n\nThe claim is false; the image has been doctored from a photo of a Japanese porn film actor.\n\nA reverse image search on Google and a keyword search found the original photo published here on the AFP Forum website.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the original AFP photo:\n\nThe photo caption states: \u201cA 74-year-old porno video actor Shigeo Tokuda smiles as he shows an advertisement poster of his video at a Tokyo video shop on March 5, 2009. Tokuda might look like an average Japanese grandfather but appearances can be deceiving, he is the country's king of elderly porn, a fast growing niche market in this greying society.
