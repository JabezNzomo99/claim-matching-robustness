It\u2019s actually from the 2015 Conservative party conference.\n\nViewers may have mistaken it for footage from this year\u2019s conference\u2014which began over the weekend and is also taking place in Manchester.\n\nThat incorrect assumption also seemed to have been made in a now-deleted tweet by Labour MP David Lammy, who has since apologised for sharing the video.\n\nThis article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this\u2014and find out how to report Facebook content\u2014here. For the purposes of that scheme, we\u2019ve rated this claim as true as the footage is genuinely of a crowd in Manchester booing Boris Johnson, and the Facebook post did not specifically claim it was from 2019.", "lang": "en"}
