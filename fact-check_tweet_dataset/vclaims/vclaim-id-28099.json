The text of her tweet, \u201cIn Tamil it is called Suraga bird. It took 19 photographers 62 days to capture this video. Share the video of this unusual bird. I recvd this. Am Sharing it further as recvd.\u201d The tweet was shared over 2,000 times and liked more than 6,700 times.\n\nShe also shared the same post on Facebook which was shared more than 450 times and liked over 1,300 times. Many people have shared the same video on social media.\n\nAlt News did a reverse image search on Google of a screenshot from video and found a report by News 18 which states that the bird is the Lyrebird from Australia. This video has been viral on social media since early October and covered by news outlets like ABC Adelaideand The Indian Express.\n\nAccording to the News 18 report, the video was upload by the Facebook page \u2018Four Finger Photography\u2019 on September 30, 2019. Alt News found the page which had shared the same video on September 29, 2019. The description along with the video suggested that it was shot at Adelaide Zoo in Australia. Neither any news reportsnor \u2018Four Finger Photography\u2019 claimed that it took \u201c19 photographers (and) 62 days\u201d to capture the video.\n\nAlt News spoke to Miklos Nagy, the owner of \u2018Four Finger Photography\u2019. Nagy confirmed that it was he who had shot the video at Adelaide Zoo. Two years ago, Adelaide Zoo had uploaded a video of the Lyrebird on their Facebook page. According to Encyclopedia Britannica,\u201cLyrebird, (genus Menura) is either of two species of Australian birds (family Menuridae, order Passeriformes) named for the shape of their tail when spread in courtship display. The name also aptly suggests a musician.\u201d\n\nAlt News also spoke with Tamil Nadu-based bird enthusiasts to authenticate whether the term \u2018Suraga\u2019 is used to describe the Lyrebird in Tamil. M.Yuvan, a bird enthusiast from Madars Naturalist Society, said, \u201cTamil names exist for birds found in Tamil Nadu/Peninsular India. Lyrebird is Australian, therefore, it is unlikely to have a Tamil name.\u201d Another Tamil Nadu-based bird enthusiast, Soundararaj Subbian, currently a member of Coimbatore Nature Society, added, \u201cTo my knowledge, there is no Tamil name for it.\u201d Therefore, it seems extremely unlikely that \u2018Suraga\u2019 is the Tamil equivalent for Lyrebird.\n\nThe video shared by Kiran Bedi is a cropped version of the video posted by \u2018Four Finger Photography\u2019 and is been circulating on social media with a false narrative that \u201cit took 19 photographers and 62 days to shoot this video.\u201d The original video was shot by an Australia-based photographer Miklos Nagy who holds the copyright for \u2018Four Finger Photography\u2019.\n\nIn the past, we have compiled various instances of Kiran Bedi falling for inauthentic posts viral on WhatsApp and sharing them on her social media accounts.", "lang": "en"}
