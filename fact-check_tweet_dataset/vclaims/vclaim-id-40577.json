However, the video has been dubbed over with a fake voice and is at least four years old.\n\nThe Facebook post, published in a Sudanese group on March 27 and shared more than 48,000 times, includes a five-second video of a newborn child being attended to in a hospital bed. \u201cDrink sugar-free tea people, sugar-free tea,\u201d says a voice, attributed to the baby in the caption.\n\nThe post has also been shared here and here with the same claims.\n\nAnother version of the Facebook post, also in Arabic, includes a still image of a different newborn. It has been shared hundreds of times and claims that before the child died, he told everyone to drink sugar-free tea to avoid getting the new coronavirus.\n\nIt has also been shared here.\n\nThe claims are false -- both the video and picture were published years before the emergence of COVID-19.\n\nFirstly, a reverse image search of the clip found this video that was uploaded to YouTube on June 17, 2016. Viewed more than 37,000 times, the footage is of a crying baby. The Arabic caption reads: \u201cThe shape of babies at birth.\u201d\n\nThe background conversation in Turkish includes two voices:\n\nVoice 2 - \u201cYes, even the diaper is wet.\u201d\n\nThe clip used in the misleading post was taken from this video, and an Arabic voice meant to be the baby\u2019s was added to the footage.\n\nDifferent versions of the misleading video also appeared in the search result here, here and here on Youtube.\n\nAccording to this news article from the Moroccan Times published on October 22, 2014, the child seen in the second misleading Facebook post was found dead in a garbage dump in Casablanca, five years before the first reported case of COVID-19 was discovered.\n\nMany Facebook posts here, here, here, here and here claim that drinking tea can help prevent COVID-19.\n\nThis and other reputed cures have been debunked by AFP as experts say there is no known cure or vaccine to combat the novel coronavirus.", "lang": "en"}
