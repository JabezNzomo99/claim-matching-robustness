Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nWhen the photos in the post are subjected to reverse image search, a certain photo among them led us to a YouTube videowith the title \u2018Ranveer Gets Beaten Up Brutally In The Lock Up\u2019 and the video had similar visuals as that are seen in the photos. The video was found to be uploaded by a YouTube channel \u201cIndian Forums\u201d on September 4, 2014. \n\n\n\nThe video mentions the person name as \u2018Shakti Arora\u2019. When searched with that name, it was found that Shakti Arora is an Indian actor. When googled with the keywords \u2018shakti arora ranveer\u2019, the search results were obtained about his TV series \u2018Meri Aashiqui Tum Se Hi\u2019. So, the photos were the ones taken during the shooting of this tv serial.\n\nAs the photos have gone viral with the claim, the \u2018Indian Forums\u2019 channel that has uploaded the video has stated in its website that stills from \u2018Meri Aashiqui Tumse Hi\u2019 are wrongly being used as \u2018Kashmiri Journalist beaten by Indian Army\u2019 and mentions \u2018The stills show Shakti\u2019s character Ranveer being beaten up by cops in a pivotal moment on the show\u2019. \n\n\n\nTo conclude, photos clicked during a TV series shooting are falsely shared as those of Indian Army torturing Kashmiri journalist Fahad Bhat.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Indian Rivers?", "lang": "en"}
