It may actually come from a novel written by editor and novelist Peter De Vries.\n\nHemingway, a Nobel Prize-winning writer, is known for authoring works like \u201cA Farewell to Arms\u201d and \u201cThe Old Man and The Sea.\u201d (RELATED: \u2018Eat A Live Frog\u2019 \u2013 Did Mark Twain Tell People To Do This Every Morning?)\n\nThough Hemingway did discuss his creative process in interviews, there is no evidence that he ever made the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post about writing while intoxicated. The saying also appears nowhere in his collected works or selected letters.\n\n\u201cHe did not say that. That\u2019s absolutely certain,\u201d said Hemingway biographer Dr. Mary Dearborn in an email to the Daily Caller. \u201cHe, along with most writers, made a point of saying he never wrote when drunk.\u201d\n\nThe expression may actually be a variation of a statement from De Vries\u2019 1964 novel \u201cReuben, Reuben,\u201d according to Quote Investigator. De Vries credits one of the book\u2019s character with saying, \u201cSometimes I write drunk and revise sober, and sometimes I write sober and revise drunk.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
