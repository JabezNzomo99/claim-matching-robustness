Scott Walker, whom she hopes to defeat in the November 2014 election.\n\n\"Wisconsin needs government to work with business to train and educate tomorrow\u2019s workers, to build the infrastructure and attract the capital necessary to grow business activity, and to make the investments in communities and quality-of-life that make businesses and workers alike want to call a place \u2018home,\u2019\" Burke wrote.\n\n\"We\u2019re clearly not doing that now.\"\n\n, released March 25, 2014, then cites three statistics, including this one:\n\n\"Wisconsin now ranks among the top 10 states for out-migration.\"\n\nWe have had some rough winters.\n\nAre that many people leaving?\n\nIn making the migration claim, the jobs report refers to the of an annual study done by United Van Lines, the national moving company.\n\n-- United Van Lines tracks only household moves within the 48 contiguous states that are made by its customers.\n\nSo, at best, the study is an indicator of state-to-state movement, and only by those who used one particular company. Yet Burke cites it as an authoritative document.\n\nIn the mover's 2012 study, Wisconsin was among 10 states labeled \"high outbound\" -- meaning, 55 percent or more of the moves handled by United Van Lines in Wisconsin were for people leaving Wisconsin.\n\nBut in the 2013 , released nearly three months before Burke issued her jobs report, only nine states were labeled high outbound and Wisconsin was not one of them.\n\nWisconsin was among 31 states labeled as \"balanced\" -- that is, the difference between the number of United Van Lines customers moving into and out of Wisconsin was negligible.\n\nSo, Burke cites outdated data from a source that is not comprehensive.\n\nBut outmigration is something that is tracked by the U.S. Census Bureau. Is it possible she\u2019s still right?\n\nThe Census Bureau counts state-to-state migration in two ways.\n\nbased on census counts, tax returns and Medicare enrollment are cited by leading demographers such as of the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan policy research group, and , former chief demographer for the State of New York.\n\nThe latest one-year figures -- for July 1, 2012 to July 1, 2013 -- show Wisconsin ranked 12th in terms of states that suffered a net loss of residents to other states:\n\nSo, Burke\u2019s top-10 claim is off, though not by much.\n\nIndeed, Wisconsin makes the top 10 if you consider a slightly longer period of time.\n\nAnother set of the census- and tax return-based data covers April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2013 -- a period that includes the 10 months before Walker took office.\n\nFor the longer period, Wisconsin ranked 10th, with a net loss of more than 28,000 people to other states.\n\nAnother way the Census Bureau measures migration is through a in which residents are asked whether they lived in the same residence one year ago. of the Tax Foundation, which tracks out-migration, favors the survey data.\n\nThe latest survey data indicate that Wisconsin actually posted positive net migration from 2011 to 2012. The estimate is 99,192 people moved into Wisconsin and 97,724 moved out, for a net gain of 1,468.\n\nHowever, like other surveys, this one has a margin of error. In this case, the margin of error means that Wisconsin could have actually posted a slightly larger net gain, or even a small net loss.\n\nBurke said: \"Wisconsin now ranks among the top 10 states for out-migration.\"\n\nHer statement contains an element of truth. In one census estimate, Wisconsin ranked 10th in terms of a net loss of residents from state-to-state migration from roughly 2010 to 2013.\n\nBut the latest one-year census estimate shows Wisconsin ranked 12th in raw numbers, 15th on a percentage basis.\n\nAlso, a one-year measure based on a census survey indicates Wisconsin actually gained more residents than it lost through people moving from one state to another.\n\nGiven that Burke\u2019s claim emphasized where Wisconsin ranks now, it goes too far. We rate it Mostly False.\n\nFollow us on Twitter and Facebook.", "lang": "en"}
