Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be found here.\n\nClaim: Karnataka Congress Minister D K Shiva Kumar tried to burn his black money when raids were conducted at his Delhi house. Fact: It is an artwork done by a Madrid artist, Alejandro Monge. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nUsing the Invid Software, the video posted on Facebook is divided into frames. When the frames are run through Google Reverse Image Search, a link to another similar video, claiming that notes burnt are Euros, is found in the search results. Under that video, in the comments, a user has given the actual details of the artist, who has done this artwork. When you search for the artist, it is found that the notes shown in the video are his artwork. He has done this artwork last year in February.\n\nIn his Instagram account, he posted all other similar fake claims made on his artwork in different countries (Pakistan, Russia and Japan). Also, in India itself, this video has been shared widely with different claims. So, it can be concluded that the burnt notes shown in the video posted on Facebook are no way related to Karnataka Congress Minister.\n\nFinally, the burnt cash does not belong to Karnataka Congress Minister. It is an artwork.", "lang": "en"}
