Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nIn the posted photo, it can be seen that the woman wearing a full-handed jacket was holding the placard with the \u2018Muslim nation\u2019 slogan.\n\nWhen the image was run through Google Reverse Image Search, the exact photo was not found. But, many similar photos from that event were found in the search results. In a photo, on the \u2018UNI\u2019 website, it can be seen that the woman was holding a placard which reads \u2013 \u2018\u0932\u093e\u0920\u0940-\u0917\u094b\u0932\u0940 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902, \u0930\u094b\u091c\u0917\u093e\u0930-\u0930\u094b\u091f\u0940 \u0926\u094b\u2019 (English \u2013 \u2018Not lathis and bullets, give us jobs and roti\u2019). Also, in a photo on \u2018The Print\u2019 website, it can be seen that the woman was holding the \u2018jobs-roti\u2019 placard, not \u2018Muslim nation\u2019 placard.\n\nOn the placards held by people around Priyanka Gandhi, none of them had the slogan regarding making India a \u2018Muslim nation\u2019.\n\nTo sum it up, a photoshopped image is shared as \u2018Remove CAB. Make India a Muslim nation\u2019 placard found at Priyanka Gandhi\u2019s anti-CAA protest.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
