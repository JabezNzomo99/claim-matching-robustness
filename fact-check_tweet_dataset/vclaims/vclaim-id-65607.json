The claim is false; this footage actually shows Muslims praying in front of the Hagia Sophia in May 2014.\n\nThe three-minute eight-second footage was published here on Facebook on July 22, 2020. It has been viewed more than 120 times.\n\nThe post's Indonesian-language caption translates to English as: \u201cSince it was opened, the Morning Prayer at the Hagia Sophia ... This is what the infidels fear if as many people joined the Mass Morning Prayer as the Friday Prayer...\u201d\n\nThe Hagia Sophia, also known as Ayasofya, is located in Istanbul.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced on July 10, 2020 that the Hagia Sophia would reopen as a mosque after a top court revoked the sixth-century Byzantine monument\u2019s status as a museum, AFP reported here.\n\nThe same footage was also shared with a similar claim here, here, here and here on Facebook where it has been watched 42,000 times; as well as on YouTube here and here.\n\nThe same footage was also shared with a similar claim in Malaysian language here and here.\n\nThe claim, however, is false.\n\nA reverse image search and subsequent keyword search on Google found the footage was previously posted here on YouTube on May 31, 2014.\n\nTranslated from Arabic to English, the video title reads: \u201cFor the first time since 79 years\u2026 Thousands of Turkish citizens performing the morning prayer (Al Fajr) in Ayasofya in Istanbul 31/5-2014.\u201d\n\nBelow are side-by-side comparisons of footage in the misleading post (L) and the YouTube video (R):\n\nHurriyet Daily News, an English-language daily newspaper in Turkey, published this report on the same day, headlined: \u201cMuslim group prays in front of Hagia Sophia.\u201d\n\nThe report's first two paragraphs read: \u201cA large group of people, who demand Istanbul\u2019s monumental Hagia Sophia to be turned into a mosque again, gathered in front of the museum in the early hours of May 31, before offering their morning prayer there.\n\n\u201cAnatolia Youth Association (AGD) had made a call for the event that came at a time when several radical groups have been discussing the status of the museum.\u201d\n\nOther Turkish news outlets, Anadolu Agency and Haberler, also reported on the event on May 31, 2014.\n\nOn July 24, 2020, Erdogan led the first Muslim prayers at the Hagia Sophia after it was reconverted into a mosque, AFP reported here.", "lang": "en"}
