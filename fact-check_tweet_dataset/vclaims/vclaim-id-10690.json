It\u2019s worried that mixed signals to investors will mean they demand higher returns, in the form of consumer-funded subsidies.\n\nIt didn\u2019t put a figure on this, saying that the effect would only be seen in three to five years\u2019 time.\n\nThe figure of \u00a3120 per household is not particularly credible. It\u2019s based on analysis which is \u201csimplistic\u201d and \u201carguably anecdotal\u201d according to the company that produced it, which went on to argue that the government should commission more thorough research.\n\nInvestor confidence has taken a knock, according to the industry\n\nThe Committee said that investor confidence had been damaged by a number of government announcements on renewables, including the early closure of the Renewables Obligation to onshore wind, cuts to solar subsidies, and the cancellation of a \u00a31 billion competition for carbon capture and storage technology.\n\nIt pointed to analysis by consultants at EY which said the UK had fallen to 11th in their rankings of \u201cattractiveness\u201d to investors in renewable energy, down from 4th a few years ago. EY said that the recent reductions in support for renewables had \u201cbaffled\u201d investors.\n\nThe Committee said both the substance of the decisions and the way they\u2019d been handled had damaged investor confidence.\n\nIt warned that if projects do go ahead they might be more expensive for consumers than they would have been before the government\u2019s announcements. If investors are less confident in the return their projects will make they may demand higher subsidies to make the risk worth their while:\n\nThe impact of this was expected to become visible in three to five years, further down the project pipeline.\n\n\u00a3120 extra in energy bills per household \u2013 based on \u201csimplistic\u201d analysis\n\nThe committee was told by a company called Octopus Investments that there could be an estimated \u00a33.14 billion in additional costs for financing renewables.\n\nThe Guardian quotes the head of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a charity, as saying that if this cost were shouldered only by domestic energy consumers it \u201cwould add as much as \u00a3120 per year to the average household bill\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why the \u00a33.14 billion in estimated extra financing costs would be paid only by domestic consumers. If subsidies fed into higher prices this would also be borne by heavy industry and other companies.\n\nAnd the original figure is dubious, as freely admitted by Octopus Investments. In its submission to the Committee the company said:\n\nThis analysis involved taking a figure of \u00a3157 billion in capital that was needed by the sector, and assuming that lower investor confidence would mean investors want 2% extra in \u201crisk premiums\u201d.\n\nOctopus Investments said the government should engage consultants to perform a more thorough analysis.", "lang": "en"}
