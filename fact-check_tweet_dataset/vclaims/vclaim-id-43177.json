It was fabricated by a satirical Facebook page.\n\nThe claim that Trump said on Twitter that he would not send coronavirus stimulus checks to Americans who have tweeted \u201c#NotMyPresident\u201d in the last four years has been circulating online since at least March 17.\n\n\u201cYes, I ordered the Treasury Secretary to send checks to Americans!\u201d reads the alleged tweet. \u201cFirst however, we will go through your social media history from the last 4 years and search for any post with #NotMyPresident in it. I wouldn\u2019t think of offending you with a check if I\u2019m not your president! #MAGA.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that Trump ever tweeted the statement. The tweet appears nowhere on his Twitter timelines, and ProPublica\u2019s archive has no record of him deleting it.

The page\u2019s \u201cAbout\u201d section says, \u201cMy goal is to make a fake tweet so realistic, it gets investigated by Snopes.\u201d\n\nThe fake tweet appears to draw inspiration from the economic stimulus package aimed at helping relieve financial burdens to Americans amid the global coronavirus pandemic. That stimulus package includes sending $1,200 checks directly to Americans making less than $75,000.", "lang": "en"}
