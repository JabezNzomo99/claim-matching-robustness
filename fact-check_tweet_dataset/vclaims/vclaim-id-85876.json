But it turned out that he was asked about specific actions, which he previously had said could not be done unless he was \u201cking\u201d or \u201cthe emperor.\u201d Thus we concluded he had flip-flopped.\n\n2: A story too good to check: Paul Ryan and the tale of the brown paper bag\n\nThis column came close to being first and ranks as one of the most widely read Fact Checkers ever. It even attracted attention in Kuwait. We examined a tale that Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told at the Conservative Political Action Conference about a boy who supposedly did not want a government-provided school lunch but \u201cwanted his own lunch, one in a brown-paper bag just like the other kids.\u201d The story quickly collapsed under scrutiny and earned Four Pinocchios.\n\n3: Giuliani\u2019s claim that 93 percent of black murder victims are killed by other blacks\n\n4: No, CBO did not say Obamacare will kill 2 million jobs\n\nThis column helped explain a complex finding in a Congressional Budget Office report that the health-care law, over time, will shrink the workforce by the equivalent of 2 million full-time workers. This was a huge increase from a previous estimate , but it was widely misinterpreted by both the news media and Republican operatives. Some jobs will go away, but the actual number is unclear because of the unknown interaction between part-time and full-time work. Analysts can make a credible case that this is still a negative \u2014 just as advocates for the law can claim the law gives people the option not to work.\n\n5: Ted Cruz\u2019s \u2018biggest lie in politics:\u2019 Is it actually the truth?\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) repeatedly tells audiences that it is the \u201cbiggest lie in politics\u201d that Republicans are \u201cthe party of the rich.\u201d In his speeches, Cruz never really explains why he believes this is the \u201cbiggest lie.\u201d So we looked at the available data on voting patterns, voter perceptions and income growth \u2014 and found his assertion wanting. Without more evidence, Cruz simply can\u2019t make a sweeping statement that saying Republicans are the party of the rich is \u201cthe biggest lie\u201d when decades of economic data show the poor do better under Democrats, that the rich tend to vote Republican, and that most Americans believe Republican policies favor the rich. Needless to say, readers split sharply on the merits of this fact check.\n\n6: Julie Boonstra\u2019s claim her Obamacare plan is \u2018unaffordable\u2019 gets downgraded to Three Pinocchios\n\nOur original February column on an Americans for Prosperity ad featuring a Michigan cancer victim, Julie Boonstra, appears on this list in eighth place. In March, new information came to light about her medical plan under the Affordable Care Act, indicating that rather than the plan being \u201cunaffordable,\u201d as the ad asserted, she actually had saved more than $1,200 a year. So we switched the rating from Two to Three Pinocchios, and the updated ruling resulted in one of the most widely read columns of the year.\n\n7: How did Rand Paul\u2019s son end up on Medicaid?\n\nJulie Boonstra again! This was one of a series of columns that looked at the claims in ads sponsored by the pro-GOP group Americans for Prosperity. All of them had various issues in terms of facts and context. In this case, Michigan resident Julie Boonstra left the impression that she lost her doctor when her insurance was canceled (she did not) and claimed that her new insurance left her with \u201cunaffordable\u201d out-of-pocket costs. But her math did not add up.\n\n9: Obama\u2019s claim that George H.W. Bush gave relief to \u201940 percent\u2019 of undocumented immigrants\n\nA key selling point for Obama\u2019s immigration action is that George H.W. Bush took a similar step that affected 1.5 million people \u2014 roughly the same percentage of illegal immigrants at the time as Obama\u2019s actions. But we demonstrated that virtually all of the Bush administration estimates at the time were significantly lower than 1.5 million. Indeed, the estimate given at the announcement of the policy was just 100,000. This column, which ultimately resulted in an award of Three Pinocchios, was criticized by advocates of the president\u2019s action.\n\n10: Did John McCain flip-flop on the Bergdahl deal?\n\nWe took a detailed look at the question of whether Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) supported a trade of five Taliban fighters for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl back in February, only to turn around and denounce it once the deal was made. McCain may have thought he left himself an out when he said his support was dependent on the details. But the most important detail \u2014 the identity of the prisoners \u2014 was known at the time he indicated his support. McCain earned an upside-down Pinocchio, constituting a flip-flop.", "lang": "en"}
