However, BOOM could not independently verify if the account was genuine.\n\nThe Urdu text accompanying the video translates to the following.\n\n\"Massacre started in Kashmir This video had been sent by a Kashmiri sister. Quaid-e-Azam has ordered army to march towards Kashmir. We are providing diplomatic, moral and political support. Imran Khan says he will respond if Pakistan attacks. Isn't Kashmir Pakistan? Did Tipu Sultan go that way?\"\n\nBOOM broke the video into key frames and performed a reverse image search on a few of its frames, however it did not yield any result.\n\nWe then ran an extensive keyword search in YouTube and found the same video that was uploaded to YouTube in October, last year.\n\nThe video has been described as \"Indian forces bloodbath in Jammu and Kashmir's Kulgam district \u2013 II\"\n\nBOOM then looked for news reports about the incident and were directed to multiple articles from October 2018.\n\nSeven civilians were killed in south Kashmir's Kulgam region when a stray explosive shell went off at an encounter site. Three Jaish-e-Mohammed members were also killed during the gunfight with Indian security forces.\n\nAccording to NDTV, the unexploded shell went off after a house caught fire during the encounter with Indian security forces. People who went in to douse the fire were injured when the shell exploded, NDTV reported citing police.\n\nBelow is an excerpt from NDTV's article on the incident.\n\n\"The police are not sure what kind of explosive led to the tragedy. It could either be a grenade brought by the dead terrorists or mortar shell used by security forces during the operation. Even after the blast, the police didn't visit the spot because of the ongoing clashes in the area.\"\n\nJammu and Kashmir Police tweeted about the same at the time.\n\nIt is however not clear what triggered the explosion. News reports suggest the Indian security forces struggled to keep civilians out of the encounter site.\n\n\"The police said once the firing stopped, local residents went too close to the encounter site before security forces could sanitise the area,\" the Hindustan Times reported.", "lang": "en"}
