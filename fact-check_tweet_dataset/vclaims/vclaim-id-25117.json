Matatus, as the country\u2019s public transport vehicles are known,\n\nThe fallout has seen Nairobi senator Johnson Sakaja and public transport owners\n\nto have the order overturned. They argue that the city has not provided enough alternatives.\n\n\u201cto facilitate further consultation with all affected parties\u201d.\n\nNairobi is one of the most congested cities in the world, Kenyan media\n\nin the debate over the ban.\n\nThe evidence for this was a traffic index run by Serbian website\n\nIts latest data for November 2018 found that \u201con average, Nairobians spend 62.44 minutes in traffic, making it the worst hit in Africa\u201d.\n\nThis is ahead of Cairo in Egypt (51.56 minutes) and the South African cities of Pretoria (49 minutes) and Johannesburg (45.15 minutes).\n\nand found that Nairobi\u2019s \u201csecond-worst\u201d ranking in the world was based on only 10 responses in 2017. In the three years to 2017, there had been 29 responses in total,\n\nMladen Adamovich, the website\u2019s head, said at the time.\n\nAdamovich told Africa Check that only four more contributors had joined up to November 2018, taking the number to 33 contributors.\n\n\u201cThese data are based on perceptions of visitors of this website in the past three years,\u201d he said.\n\nSuch a sample size is too small to draw accurate conclusions about Nairobi\u2019s traffic, experts previously told Africa Check. The sample would also be \u201cnon-random\u201d because only those with an internet connection and interest in the topic were likely to respond.\n\nPeople also tend to overestimate the time spent in traffic. An online survey would thus be a poor way to collect commuter data, Africa Check was told.", "lang": "en"}
