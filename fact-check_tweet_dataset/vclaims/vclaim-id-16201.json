It\u2019s called Gross Value Added (GVA) for smaller areas like cities and regions, which adds up to the whole economy\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\n\u2018The work we put in\u2019 could be measured a few different ways. You could divide output between the number of workers, or between the number of hours worked. The Office for National Statistics publishes statistics on both.\n\nA very basic measure of productivity is to divide an area\u2019s output by the number of people who live there, what\u2019s called \u2018GVA per head\u2018 or \u2018GDP per head\u2019. This can give a rough approximation of productivity across a whole country, but it poses problems when it\u2019s used to compare smaller areas like cities. If someone commutes into a city to work, they raise the city\u2019s output but not its population. That makes the city seem more productive than it actually is.\n\nLabour productivity doesn\u2019t just tell us how hard people are working.\n\nIt\u2019s generally seen to have more to do with things like infrastructure, education, management and technology. As an example, having a computer will make you more productive than having a filing cabinet, even if you put the same amount of effort into your job. As the OECD puts it, \u201cProductivity is about \u2018working smarter\u2019, rather than \u2018working harder\u2019.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s no single answer on how to do this. The slow growth of UK productivity is a \u2018puzzle\u2019 that\u2019s open to debate.\n\nParts of London have high output per head, compared to other NUTS2 regions in Europe\u2026\n\nWe don\u2019t know what data Mr Hammond was basing his claim on and we\u2019ve asked the Treasury to comment. This eye-catching graph from the EU\u2019s statistical agency is a possibility.\n\nIt seems to show that parts of the UK\u2019s capital are vastly more productive than the rest of the European Union, and also vastly more productive than the rest of the UK (the blue dot that stands out is Inner West London).\n\nIt\u2019s not comparing cities or city areas. It\u2019s comparing a kind of statistical area called an \u2018NUTS2 region\u2019.\n\nNUTS2 regions aren\u2019t consistently sized in different countries. In most EU countries they map on to a system of national administrative units. They can have a population anywhere between 800,000 and 3 million people.\n\nSo there are two problems with drawing conclusions about productivity from this graph.\n\nFirst, comparing NUTS2 regions isn\u2019t comparing like-with-like. London is made up of five different regions, whereas cities like Berlin and Paris are only made up of one. Is it useful to compare the innermost part of a city like London with all of Paris and its suburbs?\n\nSecond, commuters make parts of London seem more productive than they would otherwise. Many people travel to work in East and West Inner London (the two blue dots) but don\u2019t live there. Some come from London suburbs, some come from outside of London all together. Commuters increase Inner London\u2019s output compared to the number of residents, boosting its \u2018GVA per head\u2019 and its apparent productivity.\n\nLuxembourg, Brussels and Hamburg also have lots of commuters, so looking at \u2018GVA per head\u2019 makes them seem very productive too.\n\nCommuters don\u2019t distort the picture if you compare output per worker, rather than output per head of population.\n\nOn that measure, London was the 21st most productive city in Europe in 2011, according to estimates from the Centre for Cities.\n\nProductivity is much higher in London than in other UK cities\n\nLabour productivity in London is much higher than in other cities in the UK. On average, an hour worked in London is nearly 30% \u2018more productive\u2019 than the UK average.\n\nThis so-called \u2018productivity gap\u2019 does seem to be relatively large compared to other countries, although we haven\u2019t seen any analysis which is broad enough to substantiate the claim that it\u2019s the biggest in the world at the moment.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics told us that it doesn\u2019t produce international comparisons for the productivity of UK cities, although it may in the future.\n\nThe Centre for Cities recently published a set of estimates that allows us to compare the productivity of different cities in Europe in 2011, as measured by their output per worker.\n\nBack then, the \u2018productivity gap\u2019 between London and other UK cities was relatively large. If we compare the four biggest cities in the UK to those in Germany, France, Netherlands, Spain, and Italy, the gap between the most and least productive was bigger in only one case.\n\nNot all capital cities were the most productive. Berlin, the capital of Germany, produced 28% less per worker than Munich in 2011.\n\nThe situation may have changed since then, and no precise estimate will be definitive. The exact figures would depend on how you defined the city boundaries. Centre for Cities have one definition of \u2018primary urban areas\u2019; Eurostat have another.\n\nAnd there\u2019s some debate about what makes a \u2018second city\u2019. We\u2019ve chosen Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow because they had the 2nd, 3rd and 4th biggest populations in 2011, according to the Centre for Cities. If you have a different view on what makes a \u2018second city\u2019, you can make your own comparison using the same data tool.", "lang": "en"}
