This is a debate over funding a part of government so essential that if funding is not there, almost all of the employees show up anyway. They\u2019re considered essential.\u201d\n\nLawmakers largely agree that the agency must be funded in some way. But with four days until the deadline, the Senate failed to take up the House-passed DHS funding bill that would fund its operations yet still punish the president for his executive actions on immigration.\n\nAs negotiations continue, both Democrats and Republicans have made claims on just how much a shutdown would affect the agency. The claims above are representative of a range of comments \u2014 from warnings that it will endanger national security to skepticism that a shutdown would cripple the agency.\n\nOn the other end of the debate were comments such as Blunt\u2019s and that of Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), who told Politico late in January: \u201cIn other words, it\u2019s not the end of the world if we get to that time because the national security functions will not stop \u2014 whether it\u2019s border security or a lot of other issues. \u2026 Having said so, I think we should always aspire to try to get it done.\u201d\n\nAbout 31,295 DHS employees were placed on furlough during the shutdown, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS). But about 85 percent of its more than 200,000 civilian and military employees were deemed essential to the agency\u2019s operations and continued to work without pay. These \u201cessential\u201d employees were in the agency\u2019s core functions that relate to protection of life and property, including border security programs, immigration and customs enforcement, homeland security investigations, Transportation Security Administration\u2019s passenger screening, military/defense operations, maritime security and safety, cybersecurity and DHS intelligence operations. Some furloughed FEMA employees were recalled to work for emergency response operations.\n\nDHS had a small percentage of furloughs relative to its size, and its core functions relating to national security continued. But the funding lapse shut down many programs, including non-disaster grants, federal law enforcement training, the FEMA Flood Risk Mapping program and the chemical site security regulatory program. The shutdown also disrupted procurement activities, which was a notable impact for a federal agency with the sixth-largest procurement spending, according to the CRS.\n\nJohnson has released statements regarding the impact of some of the programs that were cut during the last shutdown. The non-disaster grants pay for numerous homeland security and public safety initiatives for state and local governments and law enforcement, according to a statement. These grants especially help local and state agencies that have had their budgets cut, and pay for everything from security on the trains and tunnels in New York City, oxygen tanks and masks for firefighter and law enforcement agencies in Denver, and bomb squads in Idaho.\n\nThe CRS also estimated that ripple effects would result, mainly to its workforce retention and morale. For a department with an already low morale, another shutdown would create even more lasting workforce retention problems. And the current limbo doesn\u2019t help, either; DHS spokeswoman Marsha Catron said \u201cthe uncertainty over funding for DHS is a cloud hanging over the heads\u201d of the employees.\n\nDemocratic Policy and Communications Center spokesman Matt House said: \u201cWhether it\u2019s shutting down the domestic nuclear detection office or shutting down the training of first responders to respond to weapons of mass destruction events, it is crystal clear that a shutdown of DHS would negatively affect our national security. \u2026 The only way to ensure our national security is intact is to fully fund the Department of Homeland Security, period.\u201d\n\nEven if the department shuts down and its funding runs out, it would not affect core homeland security and public safety functions that are essential to national security. As shown in the last federal shutdown, the vast majority of employees were deemed essential to protecting property and life, and some employees who were placed on furlough were recalled into work for responding to federal emergencies.\n\nYet some offices within DHS with smaller staff were reduced upwards of 95 percent. Local and state federal programs and initiatives were no longer funded, and the shutdown halted research, procurement and other programs. Those programs may not be traditionally considered \u201cnational security\u201d in the traditional sense of border security and counterterrorism activities but still support important programs on local and state levels. (The E-Verify program, for example, is a key fraud detection program for Citizenship and Immigration Services.) As it goes in heated political debates, the reality is somewhere in the middle.
