In fact, vaccine uptake in Sweden remains high even though vaccination is voluntary, indicating that public confidence in vaccines is strong. Sweden did not reject proposals to implement mandatory vaccination policies because of serious health concerns, but because health care - including vaccination - is always voluntary. Vaccine uptake in Sweden remains high even though vaccination is voluntary, demonstrating that public confidence in vaccines is strong.\n\n\n\n This article, which was published on Red Ice in 2017 and has been trending recently on Facebook, stems from a report by YourNewsWire (now NewsPunch; the original page no longer exists but has been archived), claiming that in May 2017, the Swedish Parliament \u201crejected seven motions [\u2026] that would have enshrined forced vaccinations into law\u201d due to \u201cserious health concerns\u201d. The article\u2019s content has also been reproduced in various forms by other websites such as Defend Democracy Press, Health Nut News and The Event Chronicle, and appears to have originated from a group called the National Health Federation.\n\nThis claim has been debunked by Snopes and France 24, which explained how the reasons behind the rejection were misconstrued. Snopes reported that:\n\n\u201cA spokesperson for the Public Health Agency of Sweden, the Folkhalsomyndigheten, told us via email on 30 March 2018 that only two \u2014 not seven \u2014 motions proposing a mandatory vaccination program were rejected in 2017. They added that the proposals were not rejected because vaccinations would be \u201charmful,\u201d but because \u201call health care in Sweden, including vaccination programs, is voluntary.\u201d\n\nIn fact, vaccination is viewed as an important contributor to public health by the Public Health Agency of Sweden and vaccine uptake in Sweden is high \u2013 suggesting strong confidence in vaccine safety \u2013 as reported here:\n\n\u201cOver 98 per cent of children born in 2012 had been given at least three vaccine doses against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b, and over 97 per cent of children were vaccinated with three doses of the pneumococcus vaccine. The percentage of children who had been vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) amounted to 97.5 per cent.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
