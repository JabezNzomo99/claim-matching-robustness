There is no evidence to support the claim, which has been ascribed to a non-existent US health chief.\n\nOne of the posts, archived here, has been shared hundreds of times on Facebook and claims that \u201cthe US health dept chief J Anthony said that salons have been responsible for almost 50% deaths\u201d, adding that \u201cBarber's salon poses the biggest risk factor for Corona! This threat is going to remain for a long duration (sic)\u201d.\n\nThe same post has been shared here, here, and here.\n\nThat US chief does not exist\n\nThe US health department chief quoted in the post is said to be \u201cJ Anthony\u201d, but multiple searches show that there is nobody with that name and title. The US Secretary for Health and Human Services is Alex Azar and the closest health professional with a similar name is Dr Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).\n\nFauci has been leading the battle against COVID-19 in the US and has stressed the need for social distancing at all times. But AFP found no record of Fauci having made comments linking hair salons and barbers to coronavirus mortality.\n\nThe issue is one of social distancing, as highlighted by New York governor Andrew Cuomo, who shut down salons in his state, saying \u201cthese services cannot be provided while maintaining social distance\u201d.\n\nThe potential to be infected increases with gatherings and for this reason the World Health Organization (WHO) advises against making physical contact with a person or group of people who may have been infected. It advises people to keep a metre apart.\n\n\u201cWhen someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease,\u201d the WHO's site states.\n\nBased on this advice, many countries under lockdown like France and South Africa have shut services such as hair salons and barber shops to curb the spread of COVID-19.\n\nBut, simply put, there is no evidence to show that these businesses globally are responsible for almost half the world\u2019s fatalities from COVID-19 -- which totaled 226,955 as of April 30, 2020, according to an AFP tally.", "lang": "en"}
