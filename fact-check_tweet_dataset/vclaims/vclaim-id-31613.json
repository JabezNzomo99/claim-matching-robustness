This is false; public health experts say this ointment cannot protect from or cure the influenza virus, and the nurses referenced in the posts do not recommend this technique.\n\nA Facebook post popular throughout North America shows a photo of a tube of Equate Triple Antibiotic, a generic ointment recommended for use on minor cuts to avoid infections. Text above the photo suggests that the product can be used to avoid the flu if it is applied inside the nostrils daily.\n\n\u201cWith this horrible flu going around, This is what the nurses at UAMS tell the MM patients to do when they have to go out in public!\u201d the post adds.\n\nUAMS is likely the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. The school\u2019s media representative, Leslie Taylor, told AFP by email that her faculty\u2019s nurses and doctors do not give such advice.\n\n\u201cThis is a hoax,\u201d she said.\n\nNot an ointment for the flu\n\nEquate Triple Antibiotic is a generic drug that combines three antibiotics products: bacitracin zinc, neomycin sulfate, and polymyxin B sulfate.\n\nSalim Abdool Karim, a professor of Global Health at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, told AFP in an email that \u201cnone of these three antibiotics has any impact on the influenza virus,\u201d and are used to treat skin infections.\n\n\u201cOf course, the claim is nonsense,\u201d he added.\n\nJustin Lessler, a professor at John Hopkins University\u2019s Bloomberg School of Public Health who specializes in influenza, told AFP that it and other viruses would be able to enter and infect cells throughout the respiratory system.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason to think a \u2018protective layer\u2019 on the nostrils would have any effect,\u201d Lessler told AFP by email.\n\nAs a general rule, antibiotics are not effective against viruses, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica.", "lang": "en"}
