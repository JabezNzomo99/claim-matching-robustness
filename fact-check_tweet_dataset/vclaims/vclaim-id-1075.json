The claim is false. The audio on the video has been replaced with audio from an incident five years ago in France.\n\nThe posts here , here , here , here and here have been seen more than half a million times.\n\nOne of the posts reads: \u201cHorrific scenes in London here as the anti-#BLM protesters have taken to chanting \u2018We\u2019re racist, and that\u2019s the way we like it\u2019\u201d.\n\nThe video shows protesters hurling objects as they march in London, purportedly during far-right protests in the city over the weekend.\n\nThe audio, however, is from a different incident (here) in which fans of Chelsea football club chanted the slogan as they pushed a black man off the Paris Metro ahead of a football match in 2015.\n\nThe original video led to indignation over racism in sports and drew widespread condemnation.\n\nThe audio in the edited video features a short portion of the audio track from the Paris video (audible at 0:37 on the Guardian link above) which is looped and has the addition of a background beat.\n\nFalse. The video does not show far-right protesters chanting \u201cWe are racist and that\u2019s the way we like it\u201d during recent protests in London. The video uses the audio from an incident in Paris five years ago.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
