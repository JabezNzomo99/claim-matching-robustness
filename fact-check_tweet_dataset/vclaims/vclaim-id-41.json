It has been shared by public figures with verified accounts, examples can be seen here , here and here .\n\nThe image shows text where the words \u201cInstagram\u201d are in bold, suggesting this may have been posted over another word. This can be seen in the first instance of the word \u201cInstagram\u201d where its white background cuts into the previous word. This hints that the post might be a hoax. The word \u201cInstagram\u201d is sometimes not in line with the rest of the sentence and is of varying sizes.\n\nIn some versions, it refers to Channel 13 reporting on it. It is unclear which Channel 13 the claim is referring to.\n\nThere are other versions of this post, such as one about Facebook (see here ). Back in 2012, Facebook responded to these claims saying they were false (see here ).\n\nThe claim says, \u201cDon\u2019t forget tomorrow starts the new Instagram rule where they can use your photos. Don\u2019t forget Deadline today!!!\u201d The image does not refer to a date and only says \u201ctomorrow\u201d. The claim goes on to say: \u201cIt can be used in court cases in litigation against you.\u201d\n\nIn Instagram's help center, they clearly outline: \"We disclose account records solely in accordance with our terms of service and applicable law, including the federal Stored Communications Act (\u201cSCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. Sections 2701-2712.\" There is certain information Instagram shares with others. For example, the company sends information such as child sexual exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. More information on this can be found here .\n\nThe claim says, \u201cEverything you\u2019ve ever posted becomes public from today Even messages that have been deleted or the photos not allowed\u201d and \u201cI do not give Instagram or any entities associated with Instagram permission to use my pictures, information, messages or post, both past and future. With this statement, I give notice to Instagram it is strictly forbidden to disclose, copy, distribute, or take any other action against me based on this profile and/or its contents. The content of this profile is private and confidential information.\u201d\n\nWhen a user signs up for Instagram, they agree to Instagram's Terms of Use. If users do not agree with the Terms of Use, Instagram is able to terminate their account. These can be seen here . Under \"Permissions You Give to Us\", Instagram outlines the following with regard to content ownership:\n\n\u201cWe do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). You can end this license anytime by deleting your content or account.\u201d\n\nA Facebook company spokesperson confirmed with Reuters that the claims in this image are fabricated, saying \u201cthere\u2019s no truth to this post\u201d. Facebook, which owns Instagram, confirmed to Elite Daily on August 21, 2019 that Instagram policy is the \"same as it's always been\" (see here ).\n\nPartly false: sharing this image will not prevent Instagram from using your content, when users agree to Instagram\u2019s terms and conditions, they don\u2019t give ownership to Instagram, but do grant Instagram permission to use their content in certain ways", "lang": "en"}
