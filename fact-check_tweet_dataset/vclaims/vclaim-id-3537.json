It\u2019s quite a blunder, since the DNC\u2019s history began 164 years before 2012, but at least Perez is conceding the error.\n\nTyler said that for January 2018, the DNC is counting its own fundraising ($6 million) and \u201cnearly $1 million\u201d raised by a separate entity, the Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund. The grand total comes to \u201cnearly $7 million.\u201d (The DNC did not say specifically how much the victory fund raised, and that fund has not yet filed a report with the FEC covering January 2018.)\n\nAlthough the group has the word \u201cgrassroots\u201d in its name, the Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund appears to be a vehicle for high-dollar donations from wealthy donors. In its first three months, from October to December, the fund raised $2.6 million from six individuals. The biggest check, for $829,000, came from Cynthia Simon Skjodt of Indiana, the daughter of the late mall tycoon Melvin Simon. Another daughter, Deborah Simon, gave $729,000.\n\n\u201cBecause of its structure, the new Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund appears to be able to solicit more than $540,000 per individual donor per year \u2014 or about $1.1 million per year from married couples,\u201d according to the watchdog group Issue One. \u201cSome couples may be able to donate more than $2 million to this group before the 2018 election. These figures could increase even more \u2014 by hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 if the Democratic National Committee also uses this joint fundraising operation to raise money for its building and recount funds.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time the DNC has used a combined fundraising total for both committees; the practice started soon after the DGVF was established. For December, the DNC gave a preview of its monthly fundraising figures to Politico by including both piles of money. For October, the DNC gave CNN a breakdown of what it raised and what the joint fundraising committee raised on top.\n\nFor the month of January, for example, the DNC said it handled all the fundraising for itself and the DGVF, gathering \u201cnearly $7 million\u201d in total. That\u2019s all well and good. But this kind of reporting makes sense only if the DNC does all the fundraising for both groups every month.\n\nThis elaborate construct may help the DNC chairman save face, but only by sacrificing clarity and hampering voters\u2019 understanding of campaign finance. We were on the fence between Two and Three Pinocchios for this one, but in the end Perez\u2019s revised statement merits Two Pinocchios. The numbers add up, but the spin is misleading.", "lang": "en"}
