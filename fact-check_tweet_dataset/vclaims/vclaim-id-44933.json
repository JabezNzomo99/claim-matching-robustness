Amid this, a video of people punching and kicking a life-sized doll of Trump has gone viral on social media with the claim that this is how Americans are now treating their President.\n\nSeveral Facebook users such as \u201cKrishna Rathi\u201d and \u201cG Singh\u201d have recently posted a one-minute long video clip with a Hindi caption saying, \u201cLook what Americans are doing to Trump, the uncle of Andhbhakts.\u201d\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room has found that the viral video is four years old and has nothing to do with the recent protests in the US. The video montage showing people punching, kicking and slapping a life-sized doll of Trump was uploaded on YouTube days before the US presidential election in 2016.\n\nIn fact, not just Trump, but his rival candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s life-sized doll was also kept in public places to be punched, or kissed, by people.\n\nThe post by Facebook user \u201cG Singh\u201d was shared over 10,000 times till the filing of this story. The archived version can be seen here. Many Facebook users have shared the viral video believing it to be a recent one.\n\nUsing InVID and reverse image search, we found a longer version of the video on YouTube. The six-minute video was uploaded by YouTube channel \u201cKyleLEVO\u201d on October 26, 2016, with the title, \u201cTrump Dummy Knock out extras\u201d.\n\nThe link for the shorter version of the video is also mentioned in the caption. It is titled, \u201cPunching Trump and Hillary in Public\u201d. In the longer video, it can be seen that people are punching the dummies of both Trump and Hillary.\n\nThe caption of the YouTube video reads, \u201cThe presidential election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is coming up Nov. 8th. People dislike both candidates. With Trumps rape allegations and the Hillary email scandal both candidates have problems. So we set up a Trump Dummy and a Hillary Dummy for people to punch.\u201d\n\nFilmmaker Michael Moore has recently courted controversy after sharing this four-year-old video in response to Trump\u2019s tweet, \u201cLIBERATE MICHIGAN!\u201d\n\nTherefore, the viral post claiming that this is a recent reaction to Trump is misleading.", "lang": "en"}
