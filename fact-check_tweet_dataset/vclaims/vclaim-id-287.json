He\u2019s our prime minister! He has the weight of the world on his shoulders!\u201d It goes on: \u201cSeeing this photo of him sat here like this hurts my heart. His sadness and tired out soul really resonates! Don\u2019t you think?\u201d (here)\n\nWhile the posts do not say when and where the photograph was taken, many of those commenting on them clearly believe that it is an image of a beaten down Johnson feeling the strain during the current health crisis.\n\nAny suggestions that is the case are false. The picture actually shows him taking a break during the Conservative Party conference in Bournemouth in 2002 \u2013 a fact confirmed to Reuters by a spokesman for Getty Images, the UK-based agency which owns the copyright of the photo.\n\nWhile UK death rates and new infections have been falling, Johnson\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis has divided public opinion. His government has been criticised over its response to COVID-19, which has so far killed more people in Britain than in any other European country.\n\nJohnson himself spent several days in intensive care in a London hospital in April after becoming infected with the virus. (here)\n\nFalse. The photograph of Boris Johnson with his head in his hands was not taken during the COVID-19 pandemic but almost 18 years earlier at a Conservative Party conference.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
