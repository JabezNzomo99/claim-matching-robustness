The Marxist Internet Archive has no record of Lenin ever saying these words, according to Andy Blunden, an administrator for the site, although Lenin did occasionally use the term \u201ckeystone\u201d in remarks.\n\nThe late Mark G. Field, former professor emeritus at Boston University and expert on Soviet socialized medicine, told The Baltimore Sun in 2013 that he had \u201cvery great doubts\u201d about the authenticity of the quote.\n\n\u201cLenin had more important areas to worry about,\u201d he said. \u201cThe priority for Lenin was industrialization and the ability to produce weapons of defense and attack.\u201d\n\nThe Library of Congress even investigated the quote at one point, according to authors David Blumenthal and James Morone in \u201cThe Heart of Power.\u201d \u201cAs expected, they found nothing like it,\u201d reads the book.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
