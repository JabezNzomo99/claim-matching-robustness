As former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice wrote in her 2011 memoir, \u201cNo Higher Honor,\u201d the administration \u201choped to avoid setting a firm date for departure in order to allow the conditions on the ground dictate our decisions.\u201d The plan was to remove combat troops by 2011 but leave in place 40,000 soldiers for training and logistics. But then Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki reneged on the deal and asked for language that said all forces would leave by then. Bush \u201cswallowed hard\u201d but accepted the arrangement on the assumption it would leave a \u201cfirm foundation\u201d for the next president, Rice wrote.\n\nThe Obama administration also anticipated there would be an extension, and officials began negotiations for a new one as the deadline approached. Vice President Biden, who oversaw Iraq policy, was so convinced a deal could be struck that he was quoted as saying: \u201cMaliki wants us to stick around because he does not see a future in Iraq otherwise. I\u2019ll bet you my vice presidency Maliki will extend the SOFA.\u201d\n\nFor complicated reasons, a deal was not reached. A key sticking point was whether the SOFA could exist as simply a memorandum of understanding (MOU) or needed formal approval by the Iraqi parliament. Maliki was willing to sign an MOU, but administration lawyers concluded that parliamentary approval was needed, in part because parliament had approved the 2008 version. Moreover, there were serious questions about whether an MOU signed by the prime minister would really be binding, especially given Iraq\u2019s independent judiciary.\n\nBut politically it was much more difficult to win parliamentary approval of a SOFA that would have allowed U.S. troops to be prosecuted outside Iraq, under U.S. jurisdiction, for crimes committed in Iraq \u2014 especially because of fierce opposition from a key Shiite parliamentary bloc that backed Maliki. Indeed, his political survival depended on the support of the Sadrist bloc that was dead-set against any presence of U.S. troops. (All other parties in parliament wanted U.S. troops to remain.)\n\nThen-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, in his 2014 memoir \u201cWorthy Fights,\u201d said that he warned Obama that without U.S. troops in place, Iraq \u201ccould become a new haven for terrorists.\u201d But he said that White House was \u201cso eager to rid itself of Iraq that it was willing to withdraw rather than lock in arrangements that would preserve our influence and interests.\u201d Panetta added: \u201cTo my frustration, the White House coordinated the negotiations but never really led them. Officials there seemed content to endorse an agreement if State and Defense could reach one, but without the President\u2019s active advocacy, Maliki was allowed to slip away.\u201d\n\nDuring the third presidential debate, Obama even jabbed at his rival, Mitt Romney, \u201cYou said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day.\u201d This remark flummoxed Romney: \u201cYou and I agreed, I believe, that there should be a status of forces agreement.\u201d Obama replied: \u201cWhat I would not have had done was left 10,000 troops in Iraq that would tie us down.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe needed the invitation of the Iraqi government, and we needed assurances that our personnel would be immune from prosecution if, for example, they were protecting themselves and ended up getting in a firefight with Iraqis, that they wouldn\u2019t be hauled before an Iraqi judicial system,\u201d Obama told reporters. \u201cAnd the Iraqi government, based on its political considerations, in part because Iraqis were tired of a U.S. occupation, declined to provide us those assurances. And on that basis, we left.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the rub: When Obama agreed to send 300 troops back to Iraq, officials announced they had exchanged diplomatic notes with Iraq that would give the troops the equivalent of diplomatic immunity. At the time, officials said this would be adequate, given the limited and \u201ctemporary\u201d mission. The agreement has not been updated, even though U.S. troop levels have now climbed to nearly 5,000. But this is essentially the same MOU that U.S. officials had deemed inadequate for 3,500 troops in 2011.\n\nJames F. Jeffrey, who was U.S. ambassador to Iraq in 2011, said the circumstances had changed. In 2011, U.S. officials thought an executive agreement would have no legal validity. But they opted for one in 2014 because the risk-benefit analysis was different, given that one-third of the country had been lost to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.\n\nWhen that deal fell through, in part because the White House did not press hard enough, Obama eagerly touted it as campaign promise that was kept \u2014 until the rise of the Islamic State forced the administration to send troops back to Iraq. Then suddenly it was the Iraqi government\u2019s fault that the troops were no longer in Iraq. Moreover, the reason for rejecting a deal with Iraq in 2011 \u2014 the lack of an immunity agreement endorsed by parliament \u2014 was quietly forgotten.", "lang": "en"}
