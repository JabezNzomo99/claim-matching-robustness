While many schools across the U.S. closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, there\u2019s no indication they\u2019ll call for repeating the school year.\n\nThe combined forces of the COVID-19 pandemic and the internet have made this April Fool\u2019s Day a treacherous one. Jokes that may have once been good for a laugh among friends now have the potential to mislead social media users at a time when dangerous misinformation on health and public policy is proliferating.\n\nOne prank-generating website has been used to make dozens of false headlines, including many versions of a claim that students will have to repeat the school year:\n\u2022 \u201cCalifornia: Students will repeat their grade for the 2021 school year\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cGovernor announces all children in TN will repeat same grade next year\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cAll Pennsylvania kids to repeat their current grade next year\u201d\n\nAll of these posts, which were shared on Facebook, link back to the prank-generating website that shows this message: \u201cApril Fools!\u201d But if users don\u2019t click through, all they see is what looks like a regular news headline paired with a picture of a public official. In the case of the headlines above, most featured a picture of the governor of the state that was named.\n\nWhile many schools have closed in an effort to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, we haven\u2019t found any indication that students will have to repeat a grade. All of the states mentioned above \u2014 Virginia, California, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Illinois \u2014 have closed schools. Some have suspended testing requirements. But none have recommended repeating the school year.\n\nThe same prank site has created a spate of other bogus headlines, including some that fuel rumors we\u2019ve already debunked.\n\nSo, be wary of alarming headlines shared on social media. Like the fake posts about the school year, they may not be true.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
