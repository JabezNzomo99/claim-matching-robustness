The movie also stars Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP, Manoj Tiwari.\n\nMost recently, the photo was shared by a Facebook user with text in Tamil that said an MLA from Uttar Pradesh was harassing a woman in public but the media will not show this to you.\n\nThe photo posted on November 8, 2018 has been shared over 11,000 times. Despite many of the comments pointing out that it is fake, it has still not been deleted.\n\nClick here to view an archived version of the post.\n\nAnother post in Hindi claims it shows a Dalit woman being assaulted by a BSP politician Bakruddin Ansari and his goons.\n\nThe scene can be viewed at YouTube counter 2:11:56\n\nIn July 2017, Vijeta Malik, a BJP Haryana State Executive member shared the same image and alleged that it was from West Bengal where Hindu women were being assaulted by Muslims in public.", "lang": "en"}
