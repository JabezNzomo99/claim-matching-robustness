It said it could be between 1-3%.\n\nThe estimates that we\u2019ve seen are very uncertain, and several experts including the NCA stressed to us that thoughts don\u2019t always turn into actions.\n\nThis figure was referenced in an interview with Phil Gormley, then deputy director of the National Crime Agency (NCA) and his colleague, which was published in the Mail Online in 2015.\n\nThey said that research suggests at least 1% and maybe up to 3% of adult men may have sexual interest in minors\u2014so the upper end gives a figure of about one in 35.\n\nThey said that of these, about one in three were \u201ctrue paedophiles\u201d\u2014which means being interested in pre-pubescent children defined as those under the age of 12.\n\nAt the time these figures were widely reported as \u201cnew research\u201d from the NCA.\n\nThe Mail also reported that the NCA said \u201cthere are no absolute figures given the furtive nature of this proclivity\u201d.\n\nWe asked the NCA what the estimate was based on. It told us:\n\n\u201cWe are aware of various pieces of academic research which put the proportion of people with a sexual interest in children at between 1-3% of the adult male population. This is open source material (it is not NCA or law enforcement research).\n\nDepending on what you take as your starting point, 1-3% of the adult male population of the UK equates to around 750,000 people. It is really important to understand that people who have a sexual interest in children do not necessarily act on it. Many never will.\u201d\n\nThese things are difficult to measure\n\nThe NSPCC recently looked at the evidence on the topic and concluded that \u201cthere is little weighty, international evidence around the number of people who have a sexual interest in children.\u201d Any estimates are naturally uncertain, and are very difficult to produce.\n\nIt discusses two sources of information about sexual interest in children, and specifically the prevalence of child sexual abuse images:\n\nThe first measure is quite limited in helping us find out how many people have a sexual interest in children. \u2018Obscene publications\u2019 includes things like adult pornography as well.\n\nThe statistics also only tell us how many people have been caught. They don\u2019t tell us how many people have thought about committing a crime.\n\nThe second kind of evidence\u2014anonymous surveys\u2014is also limited in how much it can tell us.\n\nWe sought the views of criminologist Dr Graham Hill at the University of Leeds, who considered it highly unlikely that people would respond honestly to surveys about these issues, partly due to the stigma that\u2019s associated with these kinds of crimes, and partly because of fears about the possible consequences.\n\nStudies we\u2019ve seen also either have small numbers of participants, or they were taken in other countries, or they focus on particular demographics.\n\nThe largest study we\u2019ve seen surveyed men in Germany. It was specific to pre-pubescent children (under the age of 12). About half the men who were asked completed the survey, and about 5.5% of those who did reported some kind of sexual interest in pre-pubescent children (i.e. any report of fantasy, behaviour or child pornography consumption).\n\nThis study said previous research suggested a range of 0.04% to 5% for males\u2019 sexual behaviours involving children and 4% to 13% for child-related sexual fantasies. But again these were based on \u201csmaller-scaled studies\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s open to debate whether men in the UK would report similar things\u2014there could be cultural or social differences resulting from different policies, demographics or ages of consent.\n\nDr Graham Hill pointed out to us that sexual interest in children had been reported in women as well as men.\n\nAnother source of information comes from use of resources that seek to help people with their behaviour. The Lucy Faithfull Foundation (based in the UK and Ireland) has said that in one year over 13,500 people had visited their Stop It Now! Website or called their helpline.\n\nBut again, this doesn\u2019t tell us about people with a sexual interest in children who haven\u2019t sought help this way.\n\nFurther information and confidential advice about child abuse can be found via the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre and the Lucy Faithfull Foundation\u2019s Stop It Now! service.", "lang": "en"}
