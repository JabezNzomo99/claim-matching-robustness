The car crash scene occurs around the seven-minute mark:\n\n\u201cContent\u201d is told entirely through the lens of a social media influencer\u2019s phone. Executive Producer Que Minh Luu told The Guardian:\n\n\u201cThe premise was: how do you take a conventional movie structure and put it on a phone? Then we developed it from there,\u201d says executive producer for the ABC, Que Minh Luu. The show is a comedy about a narcissistic millennial determined to become an online influencer, no matter what it takes \u2013 from keeping the camera rolling during a literal car crash (prescient, it turns out), to performing her first \u201cmukbang\u201d. The high concept is that it unfolds in real time, entirely from the perspective of the protagonist\u2019s smartphone.\n\nCharlotte Nicdao, the actress who plays Lucy (the driver in the viral clip) in the show, tweeted about the clip going viral:\n\nDaley Pearson, the co-director of \u201cContent,\u201d told News.com.au that this clip was created and shared in an attempt to market the show. Pearson also added that this wasn\u2019t the only clip from \u201cContent\u201d the show hoped would go viral:\n\n\u201cIt was a million dollar marketing strategy,\u201d he said with a wink. \u201cBut we only spent $60 of that on a prepaid mobile voucher. \u201cIt was just us on our phones, throwing the show out to the internet in the hope it would spit something back. We\u2019re desperately trying to promote our show about a character desperately trying to go viral by desperately trying to make their show go viral. Pearson said the Content team was surprised that the clip did go viral but also confessed that there were many other clips from the show they tried to seed online. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to tell anyone which ones, they might pop up over the next few weeks.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
