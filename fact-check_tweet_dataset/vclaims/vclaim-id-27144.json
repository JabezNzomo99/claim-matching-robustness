The man replied: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nOther reports and photos show some Venezuelans do cross into Colombia for essentials. A February 5 report by the Reuters news service, said the crossing was quiet that day but that police officials in Cucuta had been hearing from \"migrants\" who were asking where the supplies would be delivered.\n\nThe report, mostly about the stalled convoy, also pointed to the small nearby border town of La Parada, in Colombia, where \"hundreds of people, some in wheelchairs, lined up in the hot sun to buy medicine.\"\n\nThe Reuters report quoted Maria Gomez, a 53-year-old seamstress who traveled from San Cristobol in northern Venezuela to buy medicine:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cheap here, I always come,\u201d she said as a pharmacist handed over the pills. \u201cWe cannot buy drugs in Venezuela, you die before you get them.\u201d\n\nNatanzon\u2019s report insinuated that Venezuelans do not fear a crisis that World Food Program Executive Director David Beasley warned \u201ccould turn into an absolute disaster in unprecedented proportions for the Western Hemisphere.\"\n\nRather, Natanzon said Venezuelans fear \u201cwhat if there\u2019s a war tomorrow,\u201d and cited photos from \u201cthe web\u201d depicting Colombian and U.S. troops on the border and a \u201cmysterious\u201d convoy.\n\nThus it is no surprise Natanzon\u2019s TV story is titled: \u201cManufactured Crisis! Venezuelan \u2018Refugees\u2019 in Colombia Come for Day-Long Shopping Trips!\u201d\n\nContrary to Natanzon\u2019s story, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees reported in November 2018 that 3 million Venezuelans had fled the country since 2015, in an exodus driven by \u201cviolence, hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicines,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\nOne million of those refugees have gone to Columbia.\n\nWith the release of a U.N. human rights report last June, U.N. Human Rights High Commissioner Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein said that 87% of the population of Venezuela was affected by poverty, with extreme poverty hitting 61.2% of the citizenry.\n\nThe U.N. report described \u201cthe acute deterioration of healthcare facilities\u201d in the country, confirming the anecdotal report of shortage in the Reuters article.\n\n\u201cSystemic shortages of key supplies and medicine; doctors leaving the country, unable to make ends meet on meagre salaries given hyperinflation; and the lack of transparency by the Government, which on occasion has reportedly responded to criticism by threatening or even detaining healthcare workers and journalists who are critical of the healthcare situation, all appear to be contributing to the dramatic healthcare crisis in the country,\u201d the report found.\n\nA Lancet Global Health study found that, according to its \u201cconservative estimation,\u201d Venezuela \u201cis in the throes of a humanitarian crisis.\u201d The report said the increase in infant mortality in 2016 compared with 2008 had taken Venezuela back to \u201cthe level observed at the end of the 1990s, wiping out 18 years of expected progress\u2026\u201d\n\nFacing six-digit hyperinflation and a currency whose value has dropped so precipitously artisans are using banknotes as a raw material to make other goods, the United Nations now predicts 5.3 million Venezuelans will have left the country by the end of this year.\n\nAnd while the complexities of Venezuela\u2019s political and economic crisis do no lend themselves to easy analysis, the reality of a growing refugee crisis in the country is undeniable, as confirmed in the UN and Lancet reports.\n\nPolygraph.info therefore finds the conclusion reached in Rossiya 1\u2019s report to be false.", "lang": "en"}
