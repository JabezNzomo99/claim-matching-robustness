The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told the French news agency AFP that at least nine Russian troops were killed in the attack, which it said took place on May 23 in the town of Mayadeen in Deir Ezzor province.\n\nOn May 23, the same day the attack reportedly took place, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman General Sergey Rudskoy held a briefing in Moscow on the situation in Syria.\n\nRodskoy said that the Russian military, together with Syrian government army, had \u201cgained significant success in freeing the key regions of Syria from the remnants of terrorist groups,\u201d listing several provinces \u201cnow under total control of the government forces.\u201d Rudskoy did not cite any Russian or Syrian government troop losses on either that same day or any time in the past.\n\nOver the years, the Russian Defense Ministry and the Kremlin have denied or downplayed casualties in Syria. However, in February, leaks of audio recordings revealed that Russian troops and mercenaries in Syria had suffered heavy losses during an attack they launched against U.S. forces there.\n\nMaxim Borodin, the investigative journalist who first reported on the deaths of Russian troops in Syria, died in April as a result of \u201cfalling out a window,\u201d after telling his lawyer over the phone that his apartment was surrounded by masked men equipped like commandos.\n\nThe Syrian government has called Mayadeen the Islamic State\u2019s \u201clast bastion in the country.\u201d Regime forces entered Mayadeen on October 6, 2017, following overnight Russian airstrikes that reportedly killed 14 people, including three children.\n\nLast December 11, President Vladimir Putin ordered the Defense Ministry to start the withdrawal of Russian forces from Syria. Government media presented Putin\u2019s move as a \u201csuccess of Russian diplomacy\u201d and the creation of \u201cconditions for real de-escalation.\u201d\n\nPolygraph.info was unable to confirm whether or not the shelling incident in Mayadeen last week killed four Russian servicemen, as the Russian Defense Ministry claimed, or at least nine Russian servicemen, as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed. That is why the statement by the Russian Defense Ministry is given an \u201cunclear\u201d verdict. If other details surrounding the incident emerge, that verdict may be updated.", "lang": "en"}
