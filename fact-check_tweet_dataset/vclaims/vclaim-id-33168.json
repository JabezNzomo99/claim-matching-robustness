It states that the Coronavirus, referred to as Wuhan-400 in the book, was predicted in 1981.\n\nA page from the book states that Wuhan-400 is the perfect weapon. It affects only human beings. This post has been shared multiple times.\n\nWhen we fact-checked the claims in this post, we found them to be partially false and misleading. We attempted to compare some of the claims in the book to information about the Coronavirus.\n\nFor example, as listed in the book, the Wuhan-400, was developed in a lab. That\u2019s not true for the Coronavirus. It is believed to have originated in a market in Wuhan as per this report from Reuters.\n\nSecondly, Wuhan-400 has a fatality rate of 100% as per the book. The Coronavirus, on the other hand, has a fatality rate of 2% as per WHO.\n\nFurther, we also found that earlier editions of the book refer to Wuhan-400 as Gorki-400, as per Taiwan News.\n\nWith these sources, it becomes clear that the Coronavirus, specifically, was not predicted in the 1981 book and hence is misleading.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
