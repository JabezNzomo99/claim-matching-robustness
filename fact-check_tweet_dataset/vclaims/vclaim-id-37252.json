Some Nike customers have condemned the company for the partnership.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: Michael Jordan Resigns From The Board At Nike-Takes \u2018Air Jordans\u2019 With Him,\u201d reads the viral Sept. 5 headline on trumpbetrayed.us. The story was republished by other websites, including charlottepost.site, without any indication that it was meant to be satirical.\n\nThe item begins with the claim that Jordan \u201chas walked away from the Board of Directors at Nike, taking his patented \u2018Air Jordan\u2019 line with him.\u201d A fictitious statement from an alleged spokesman says Jordan is a \u201cpatriot\u201d and \u201ccompletely against the hiring of a traitor and is taking his shoes elsewhere.\u201d\n\nBut Jordan doesn\u2019t even sit on the company\u2019s board of directors. Other signs of its dubious nature include the name of the non-existent spokesman, Art Tubolls, a name often used by the publication \u2014 and the claim that there are \u201ctwo pairs\u201d of Air Jordans \u201cfloating on the feet of astronauts in space at this very moment.\u201d\n\nThe same network of websites, America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, published a story this week claiming Nike had ended its deal with Kaepernick over an \u201canti-white rant\u201d (we debunked that as well) and another saying that the U.S. government cancelled an \u201c$80 Million Nike Contract\u201d (also fictional).\n\nThe creator of the websites, Christopher Blair, told the Boston Globe earlier this year that his stories are intended to undermine conservatives by \u201cinjecting them with stupidity to cure their stupidity.\u201d\n\nBut the Jordan piece shows how, even after commenters point out that the piece is false, others continue to share and engage with the content as if real. One day after its publication, the original story\u2019s link had been shared nearly 112,000 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle data.\n\nIn between comments of \u201cfake news,\u201d were repeated words of praise for Jordan\u2019s supposed stand \u2014 some called him a \u201cpatriot\u201d and \u201cclassy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you Mr Jordan for standing behind our country and flag,\u201d another wrote.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\nBaker, Billy. \u201cOne of the country\u2019s biggest publishers of fake news says he did it for our own good.\u201d The Boston Globe. 7 Apr 2018.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: Michael Jordan Resigns From The Board At Nike-Takes \u2018Air Jordans\u2019 With Him.\u201d Trumpbetrayed.us. 5 Sep 2018.", "lang": "en"}
