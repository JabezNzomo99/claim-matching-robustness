Adam Schiff and former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 while making several false or misleading claims. We fact-checked some of the more prominent ones.\n\nTrump: \"You know full well that Vice President Biden used his office and $1 billion dollars of U.S. aid money to coerce Ukraine into firing the prosecutor who was digging into the company paying his son millions of dollars. You know this because Biden bragged about it on video. Biden openly stated: \u2018I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars...I looked at them and said: I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired.\u2019\"\n\nThis is a misleading and incomplete representation of the facts.\n\nBiden as vice president took a lead role in U.S. diplomacy toward Ukraine after a popular revolution in early 2014 led to the ouster of a pro-Russia Ukrainian president. Viktor Shokin became Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor in 2015, after the Ukrainian president went into exile. Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion from Ukraine unless Shokin was fired, in hopes that a new prosecutor would do more to enforce the law.\n\nTrump omits that the U.S. government, many Western leaders and institutions, as well as Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, viewed Shokin as corrupt and ineffective. We\u2019ve also found no evidence that Biden advocated with his son's interests in mind; and it\u2019s not clear that a Ukrainian gas company that Biden\u2019s son worked for was actively under investigation or that a change in prosecutors would have benefited the company. At a January 2018 event sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations, Biden recounted how he told Ukrainian leaders that they would not get $1 billion from the United States unless Shokin was fired. Biden at the event did not mention the company his son worked for or his son, Hunter.\n\n\"Even Joe Biden admitted just days ago in an interview with NPR that it 'looked bad.'\"\n\nThe \"it\" is out of context. From the letter, it appears Trump is saying Biden\u2019s pressure-campaign to oust Shokin looked bad. In reality, Joe Biden in his NPR interview mentioned what his son Hunter had to say about the fallout of joining the Ukrainian company.\n\nThe NPR interviewer brought up that George Kent, a State Department official, testified that he had raised his concern that \"Hunter Biden\u2019s status as a board member could create the perception of a conflict of interest.\"\n\nKent testified in his closed-door deposition that when he raised his concern with a member of Biden\u2019s staff, he was told that they didn\u2019t have the \"bandwidth\" to deal with it while Biden\u2019s son Beau was dying of cancer.\n\nBiden told NPR: \"Well, my son was dying, so I guess that's why he said it, because my son was on his deathbed. But that, that's not the reason why \u2014 they should have told me. And the fact of the matter is, my son testified and did an interview saying if he, looking back on it, made a mistake, he made a mistake although he did nothing wrong. The appearance looked bad and it gave folks like Rudy Giuliani an excuse to come up with a Trumpian kind of defense, why they were violating the Constitution. His, his words speak for themselves.\"\n\n\"Now you are trying to impeach me by falsely accusing me of doing what Joe Biden has admitted he actually did.\"\n\nTrump is trying to compare his actions on Ukraine\u2019s to Biden\u2019s. But the two actions aren\u2019t equal.\n\nBiden was pushing for action that overall U.S. foreign policy supported, as well as the international community.\n\nWhen Biden confronted Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko in 2015, he was delivering a message not only from the United States, but from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union. All three entities were focused on curtailing corruption in Ukraine, and all three were deeply suspicious that Poroshenko\u2019s prosecutor was playing a familiar game of tamping down investigations as a form of political favoritism.\n\nBy all credible accounts, the prosecutor had slow-walked the investigation of the energy company that hired Biden\u2019s son; so, if anything, the prosecutor was doing the Bidens a favor. Getting rid of him would do the opposite.\n\nBy contrast, Trump sought a public announcement from Ukraine that it was investigating the Bidens. Trump was pressing for something that fell outside the recommendations of federal agencies.\n\nThis is an oversimplification.\n\nAt times, Turley has articulated traditionally liberal views, and during his impeachment testimony, he said, \"I am not a supporter of President Trump. I voted against him in 2016 and I have previously voted for Presidents Clinton and Obama.\" Turley added, \"I have been highly critical of President Trump, his policies, and his rhetoric, in dozens of columns.\"\n\nHowever, in recent years, his views have been more heterodox, siding with conservatives in several notable situations \u2013 including Trump\u2019s impeachment, when he was called to testify by the Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nFor instance, Turley was critical of President Barack Obama\u2019s use of executive authority, including working on behalf of House Republicans on a health care lawsuit. He also testified favorably on behalf of one of Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominees, Neil Gorsuch.\n\n\n\n Says he beat Hillary Clinton \"in an Electoral College landslide (306-227).\u2019\u2019\n\nSince the end of World War II, Trump\u2019s percentage of the Electoral College vote is lower than 12 previous results (1948, 1952, 1956, 1964, 1972, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2008 and 2012). By contrast, Trump\u2019s electoral vote haul was bigger than only five elections in the post-World War II era (1960, 1968, 1976, 2000 and 2004).\n\nFor the record, history will record Trump winning 304 electoral votes, because two Texas electors didn\u2019t vote for Trump. They voted for John Kasich and Ron Paul.\n\n\"I have been deprived of basic Constitutional Due Process from the beginning of this impeachment scam \u2026 More due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials.\"\n\nWithout getting into the witch trials of the late 17th century, Trump\u2019s claim is wrong. We\u2019ve fact-checked similar versions four times.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee invited Trump to participate in its impeachment hearings, but the White House rejected both of those invitations.\n\nThe Constitution is vague on the rules for impeachment, saying only that the House \"shall have the sole Power of Impeachment\" and the Senate \"shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.\"\n\nIf due process rights were to apply at all, legal experts told us they would be granted during the Senate\u2019s trial phase, not the House stage. The House\u2019s inquiry is akin to an investigation by the police, a prosecutor or a grand jury \u2014 and due process rights are not granted then, either.\n\nBut even in the Senate, it\u2019s not clear that an impeachment trial would require due process protections, experts told us. That\u2019s because Trump would stand to lose only his position in the White House, rather than his life, liberty or property.\n\nImpeachment \"is nothing more than an illegal, partisan coup.\"\n\nWe have rated a virtually identical claim about a coup as Pants on Fire.\n\nA coup d'\u00e9tat is \"the sudden and irregular (i.e., illegal or extra-legal) removal, or displacement, of the executive authority of an independent government,\" as defined by the The Coup D\u2019etat Project at the University of Illinois\u2019 Cline Center for Democracy.\n\nImpeachment is described in the Constitution as the way to remove a president who has committed \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\"", "lang": "en"}
