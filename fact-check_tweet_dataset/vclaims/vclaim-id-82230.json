Was there such a gap in Commerce leadership that it was left to Clinton to conduct the administration\u2019s economic diplomacy?\n\nThe Commerce Department is sometimes described as the broom closet of the federal bureaucracy, in that it contains a number of unrelated agencies, such as the Census Bureau, the National Weather Service, the Patent and Trademark office, the Economic Development Administration, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and so forth. The notion that the commerce secretary was some sort of globe-trotting promoter of American industry only began to take hold in Clinton\u2019s administration, when Ron Brown became commerce secretary.\n\nThe Commerce Secretary, in the department\u2019s mission statement, \u201cserves as the voice of U.S. business within the President\u2019s Cabinet.\u201d Commerce Department Order 1-1 says \u201cthe historic mission of the Department is \u2018to foster, promote, and develop the foreign and domestic commerce\u2019 of the United States.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the State Department has an economics unit and also is quite involved in international economic issues; the official duties of the Secretary of State includes \u201cpromotes beneficial economic intercourse between the United States and other countries.\u201d\n\nInternational economics is represented in the department at the level of undersecretary of state. The undersecretary of state is expected to engage in economic diplomacy, charged with \u201cimplementing economic growth, energy, agricultural, oceans, environmental, and science and technology policies,\u201d the department\u2019s Web site says. The State Department, for instance, is the lead agency on the APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) conference.\n\nOf course, the real heavy lifting on international economic matters is done by the Treasury Secretary\u2013and international trade negotiations are handled by the U.S. Trade Representative. Former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner might be surprised to learn that if Hillary Clinton \u201chadn\u2019t been doing this economic diplomacy work, nobody would have been doing it,\u201d as her husband put it.\n\nClinton was secretary of state from Jan. 21, 2009, to Feb. 1, 2013 \u2014 essentially 48 months. As we have shown, there was a confirmed commerce secretary for all but 12 months of that period. So that\u2019s a ratio of 3 to 1 when a commerce secretary was in office at the same time as Clinton.\n\nByson may not have had as much of chance to have an impact, but by most accounts Locke did a pretty good job. Here\u2019s what Clinton said when she swore him in as ambassador to China:\n\n\u201cHe helped improve the lives of the people of Washington and of the United States. He was a great job creator in Washington during two national recessions. He has helped to lead our efforts to increase U.S. exports. He has brought the Census in on time and under budget, an unheard of accomplishment. He\u2019s brought comprehensive patent reform legislation closer to passage than it has in decades.\u201d\n\nFormer President Clinton exaggerated when he claimed that for \u201cmuch of the time she was secretary,\u201d there was no commerce secretary. For three out of the four years, there was a Senate-confirmed commerce secretary sitting near Hillary Clinton at Cabinet meetings. Moreover, the secretary of state is supposed to engage in economic diplomacy, whether or not there is a commerce secretary.\n\nYes, there was some turnover in the leadership of the commerce department. But Clinton\u2019s assertion that if not for Hillary Clinton, \u201cnobody would have been doing\u201d economic diplomacy is quite a stretch, given the dominant role of the Treasury Secretary on international economic issues. That comment tipped this rating toward Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
