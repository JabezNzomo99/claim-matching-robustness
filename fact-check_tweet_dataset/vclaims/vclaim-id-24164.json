A local news channel News Britant had reported the incident on April 12 and also uploaded a video showcasing the events. This video was lifted and uploaded on social media with a false narrative. If one notices carefully, the viral clip carries the logo of News Britant.\n\nAccording to the media outlet, a road accident on National Highway 31 led to a skirmish between the police, accompanied by four civic volunteers. and an enraged mob. The report said that two locals lost their lives in an accident. Officials of the local police station in Rajganj were allegedly occupied with providing security cover for TMC politician Abhishek Banerjee\u2019s rally, therefore, delayed reaching the spot on time. When the police finally arrived, a massive crowd of angry locals attacked the civic volunteers, leaving them injured. The frenzied mob also thrashed the police vehicle in a fit of rage.\n\nAlt News contacted Rajganj police station to confirm the reported incident. We were informed that a road accident indeed took place in Fatapukur when a truck rammed against a motorcycle on National Highway 31. Two people lost their lives on the spot.\n\nThe incident had nothing to do with the Lok Sabha polls but was a case of a road accident. West Bengal and the state\u2019s incumbent CM Mamata Banerjee-led government has emerged as a prime target of misinformation in the ongoing elections. The TMC is often targeted using unrelated videos and photographs to portray the party as \u2018terrorist and immigrant sympathisers\u2019.", "lang": "en"}
