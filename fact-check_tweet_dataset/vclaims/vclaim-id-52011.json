The image shows a grim-looking Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan with the Hindi text suggesting that Khan\u2019s wife and his driver have been tested positive for coronavirus. The viral image also stated that Khan\u2019s coronavirus test result was negative.\n\nIndore-based BJP member Gaurav Tiwari tweeted the viral image and inquired if the news is true or not. He asked, \u201cImran Negative?\u201d This has been retweeted over 600 times. (archive link)\n\nSimilarly, Twitter user @seriousfunnyguy also posted the viral image. This user addressed Khan\u2019s wife as Begum and highlighted that Begam and the driver got infected. This was retweeted over 500 times. Readers should note this account is followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and has over 64,000 followers.

Please refrain from spreading Fake News.\u201d\n\nTherefore the claims made in the viral image are false. In the past few weeks, several such screenshots have been circulated to spread misinformation. On April 3, Alt News reported how India Today graphic was morphed with false claims that PM Modi has extended the coronavirus lockdown till May 4.", "lang": "en"}
