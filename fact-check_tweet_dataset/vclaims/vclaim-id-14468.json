Scott Morrisson as 'Malcom', 'President Trunchbull', 'Trundle' or 'Malcolm Morris Trundler', mistaking him for the previous P.M. Malcolm Turnbull? No, that's not true: the confusion story was made up by an Australian satire website that pretends to be the local newspaper of a little backwoods town named Betoota, it is not real, even though it got several thousand engagements on Facebook already.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on December 1, 2018 titled \"President Trump Has A Great Meeting With Man He Thinks Is Named Malcolm\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nDespite a schedule full of watching Fox News and tweeting (almost definitely from the toilet) US President Donald Trump managed to find time to meet with Australia's Prime Minister who according to him is a guy called Malcolm. In his search to meet someone who represents the average Australian, Prime Minister Scott Morrison organised to meet with the billionaire US President at the G20 summit and stated the meeting went well despite the fact Trump referred to him as 'Trunbull' at various points of the conversation.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail, possibly giving the joke away:\n\nTrump did meet with the new Australian Prime Minister at the summit but no reliable sources made any reports of Trump mispronouncing his name or confusing him with his predecessor:\n\n'So far, so good', Trump says of relationship with Australia's latest PM Meeting with Australia's leader at the G20 Summit in Argentina, the US President gets a personal explanation of events that led to him meeting Scott Morrison as Prime Minister - not the man he has been used to meeting at the White House, in New York and at world summits for the last two years.\n\nThe Betoota Advocate is a satirical website (even though it does not come with an explicit satire disclaimer). In December 2017 The New York Times ran a feature about the founders:\n\nSo you should really not believe anything the site says without checking it first...\n\nWe wrote about betootaadvocate.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Idris Elba NOT To Join The Walking Dead As New Black Character That Dies After 1 Season\n\u2022 Fake News: Reserve Bank Did NOT Say Living Standards Won't Improve Until All The Baby Boomers Are Dead\n\u2022 Fake News: Amy Schumer NOT Confirmed As Lead Star In All-Female Remake Of 'Saving Private Ryan'", "lang": "en"}
