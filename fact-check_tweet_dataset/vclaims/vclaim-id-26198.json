The fort is built on a solitary rocky hill called Gopachal which has been carved to build Jain statues, images of which are available on the internet.\n\nPhotographs of the stepwell in the fort are also available on Getty Images.\n\nSeveral other similar images of areas inside the fort were found online.\n\nPhotographs of different structures and statues inside the Gwalior fort were shared on social media as a Jain temple excavated beneath a mosque in Karnataka. A similar claim was shared in November 2018 when a digital artwork was portrayed as temple discovered after the demolition of a mosque in Raichur, Karnataka.", "lang": "en"}
