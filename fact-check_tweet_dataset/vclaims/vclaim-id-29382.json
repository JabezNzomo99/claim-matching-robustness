It has been popularly described as a \u201cKlanbake\u201d for a couple of decades, according to research by journalist Jennifer Mendelsohn and academic Peter Shulman, who traced the origin of the term back to a contemporaneous report on the convention from the New York Daily News. According to JSTOR Daily, hundreds of KKK members attended as delegates.\n\nThe image has been misidentified as Klansmen marching at the convention, but it was actually taken about five months later in Madison, Wisconsin, by Wisconsin State Journal photographer Arthur M. Vinje. It shows a parade of Klansmen en route to the funeral of a slain police officer in December of that year.\n\n\u201cKu Klux Klan (KKK) wearing conic masks and white robes parading down King Street to Schroeder Funeral Home for the funeral of Police officer Herbert Dreger,\u201d reads the caption on the Wisconsin Historical Society\u2019s website. \u201cDreger was shot to death in \u2018Death\u2019s Corner\u2019 (South Murray Street) on December 2, 1924.\u201d\n\nIn the past few years, conservatives have deployed the image in an attempt to discredit Democrats. Conservative political commentator Dinesh D\u2019Souza, for example, tweeted the image in 2017. Shulman subsequently corrected him, pointing to the historical society website.", "lang": "en"}
