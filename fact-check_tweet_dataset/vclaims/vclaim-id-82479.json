Voters just need to show their Aadhaar card in case their names are missing from the electoral rolls. Supposedly, under \u2018section 49A\u2019, voters can ask for a \u2018challenge vote\u2019 in such a case.\n\n2. A \u2018tender vote\u2019 can apparently be cast if a voter finds out that someone else has already voted in her/his name.\n\n3. Repolling will be conducted at every polling booth where more than 14% tender votes are recorded.\n\nVoters just need to show their Aadhaar card in case their names are missing from the electoral rolls. Supposedly, under \u2018section 49A\u2019, voters can ask for a \u2018challenge vote\u2019 in such a case.\n\nAccording to the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961, section 49A is titled Design of Electronic Voting Machines. It does not refer to \u2018challenge vote\u2019 as claimed in the viral message. The section reads: \u201cEvery electronic voting machine (hereinafter referred to as the voting machine) shall have a control unit and a ballotting unit and shall be of such designs as may be approved by the Election Commission.\u201d\n\nA \u2018challenged vote\u2019 refers to a vote by a person whose identity has been challenged by the polling agent. Section 49J of the Rules lays out the procedure for \u2018challenged votes\u2019. If the identity of the voter is held to be in doubt by the polling agent, his vote may be \u2018challenged\u2019 and the matter taken up with the presiding officer, who will then conduct an inquiry. The \u2018challenged\u2019 voter\u2019s name and address is then put in the list of challenged votes in Form 14. There is no reference to \u2018challenge vote\u2019 in section 49A, as claimed.\n\nA \u2018tender vote\u2019 can apparently be cast if a voter finds out that someone else has already voted in her/his name.\n\nSection 49P of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961 states that \u201cIf a person representing himself to be a particular elector seeks to vote after another person has already voted as such elector\u201d, he/she will be given a tendered ballot paper for voting provided he/she has satisfactorily answered questions relating to his/her identity \u201cas the presiding officer may ask\u201d.\n\nSimply put, if a voter finds out that someone has already cast the vote in his/her name, the aggrieved voter can still cast his/her vote. Such a vote is called a \u2018tendered vote\u2019. Tendered votes are considered only in cases where the victory margin is narrow, and are not usually counted in case of victory by huge margins.\n\nRepolling will be conducted at every polling booth where more than 14% tender votes are recorded.\n\nAlt News could not find a single reference, in either the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961 or the Handbook For Polling Agent, to the claim that repolling is mandatory at every polling booth where the percentage of tender votes recorded is over 14%.\n\nThe figure of 14% is a figment of imagination. While it is true that repolling may be conducted at polling booths where a certain proportion of bogus votes have been cast, this decision is at the discretion of the Election Commission. The same was clarified via a tweet by former Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Dr. S Y Quraishi.\n\nIt may be reiterated that the claim that repolling is to be conducted at every polling booth where more than 14% tender votes are cast, is false. However, it is true that repolling may be conducted if the ECI decides so.\n\nVoters may note that registration is mandatory, and that it is not possible to vote unless the respective voter\u2019s name is present in the electoral roll. Voters may follow this link to check if their names are present in the electoral roll. If the name of the voter is present in the roll but he/she does not have a voter ID card, any of the official identity documents such as Aadhaar, Passport, Driving License, PAN card etc. may need to be produced at the time of voting.
