It is being claimed that this person is the Mumbai police commissioner. Actor Jaywant Wadkar was among those who shared the clip.\n\nThe video has been massively circulated on Facebook. A few Twitter users have also shared it using the caption \u2013 \u201cMumbai Police commissioner. Total Mumbai under terrorist attack. Please be careful. All railway stations. All bars and cinema halls. Auditoriums. All public places. Please forward to all groups. Jay Hind. Jay Maharashtra.\u201d\n\nAlt News has received several verification requests on its mobile app as well.\n\nThe current police commissioner of Mumbai is Sanjay Barve, and he looks visibly different from the man in the video.\n\nWho is the man in the video?\n\nThe person starring in the video is a man named Hemant Mahajan. We found his identity upon reverse-searching one of the frames of the video on Yandex. Mahajan is a retired Brigadier of the Indian army and comments on national security issues.\n\nHe has a YouTube channel and has appeared as a guest on several TV news channels. In many of his videos, he can be seen seated in front of the same background as in the viral video.\n\nA Twitter user had uploaded the same video widespread on social media and identified Mahajan.\n\nIn conclusion, the man in the video, alerting people of terrorist attacks, is not the commissioner of Mumbai police but a retired army officer Hemant Mahajan.", "lang": "en"}
