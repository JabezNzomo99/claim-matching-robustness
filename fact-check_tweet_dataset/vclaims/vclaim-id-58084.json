The footage includes superimposed text that claims the hospital is the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, a state-run facility in the Pakistani city of Karachi. The claim is false; the video in fact shows a hospital in the Indian city of Mumbai; Abbasi Shaheed Hospital also refuted the claim and said that they do not admit COVID-19 patients in general.\n\nThe one-minute 37-second video has been viewed more than 1,700 times after it was published on Facebook here on April 27, 2020.\n\nThe footage shows a man and woman, both wearing surgical masks, making claims in Hindi about a hospital using a COVID-19 isolation ward to treat non-related ailments.\n\nAt the 20-second mark, the man states that his wife has HIV and tuberculosis and was \u201cadmitted to corona ward\u201d and that hospital staff \u201care saying that they do not have ventilators.\u201d He adds: \u201cPlease someone should help me. Please.\u201d\n\nThe woman then states: \u201cWell you can see that an HIV patient has been admitted to the corona ward, pneumonia patients have also been admitted to the corona ward and the heart patients as well. So you can imagine how Shatabdi hospital is playing with the lives of the public.\u201d\n\nThe post\u2019s caption read: \u201cAll Patients are transfered [sic] in Corona Ward. HIV, Heart etc.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe same video was also shared alongside a similar claim that the hospital is in Pakistan on Facebook here and here and on Twitter here.\n\nThe woman speaking in the video names the hospital as Shatabdi Hospital, a facility in Mumbai. In the clip, she speaks Hindi, the most widely spoken language in India, and not Urdu, the lingua franca in Pakistan.\n\nA search also found another video that the same woman published on YouTube that details allegedly grim conditions for COVID-19 patients at Shatabdi Hospital. The video was published on April 9, 2020 and is titled \u201cCONDITION OF MUMBAI SHATABDI HOSPITAL TREATING COVID-19 PATIENTS\u201d.\n\n\u201cI request all of you do not bring your patient to Shatabdi hospital, because other than death they will not give anything,\u201d she says at the video\u2019s two-minute mark.\n\nAt the three-minute 50-second mark, the woman also claims that a pneumonia patient was put into a COVID-19 isolation area and asks \u201cwill our administration take responsibility for her or will our Mr. Modi?\u201d \u2013 a reference to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the YouTube video:\n\nAbbasi Shaheed Hospital, the Karachi hospital named in the misleading posts, refuted the claim that the video shows its facility.\n\n\u201cThe video circulating on social media was wrongly attributed to his hospital. We don't have any diagnostic facility of coronavirus and subsequently there is no admission of coronavirus patients at the hospital,\" Dr. Nadeem Rajput, the hospital\u2019s medical superintendent, told AFP by phone on May 4, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
