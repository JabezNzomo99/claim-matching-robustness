The posts also urge the general public to voice opposition to the decision to remove the officer from her post. The claim is misleading; the head of Sri Lanka\u2019s Forest Conservation Department said that no such transfer order was ever issued; the officer named in the posts also denied the claim.\n\nThe post about the forest officer, Devanee Jayathilaka, was published here on February 21, 2020. It was shared more than 10,000 times before being deleted.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe Sinhala text superimposed on the image translates to English as: \u201cDevanee, who spoke for the heritage of both the born and unborn has been given a transfer\u2026If her wrongdoing was standing up for you and me/ You and I have an obligation to stand up for her\u2026./Take immediate steps to cancel Devanee\u2019s transfer/Let\u2019s create a trend in the country to fulfill obligations.\u201d\n\nIn early February 2020, a video surfaced online that showed Jayathilaka, who is an officer in Sri Lanka\u2019s Gampaha district, refusing to comply with an order that would have allowed the construction of a playground on protected government land. The exchange between Jayathilaka and State Minister Sanath Nishantha, who pushed for the construction, quickly went viral on social media and in the mainstream media in Sri Lanka.\n\nA similar claim that Jayathilaka was subsequently removed from her position was also shared on Facebook here, here, here, here and here.\n\n\u201cI have not been issued any such transfer order,\u201d Jayathilaka told AFP during an interview at her office on February 25, 2020. \u201cThis is not the first instance that I have spoken against unlawful interventions and I realise if we fulfil our job dutifully, the law always supports us.\u201d\n\nForest Conservation Department director general W.A.C. Weragoda also refuted claims that Jayathilaka was ever transferred.\n\n\u201cThere is no truth or basis to the transfer claims. No such transfer order has been issued to Ms. Devanee,\u201d he told AFP on March 3, 2020.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s cabinet spokesman, Information Minister Bandula Gunawardena, said last month that President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the entire government support Jayathilaka and her principled objection, according to this report published by Sri Lankan newspaper the Daily News.\n\n\u201cThe present government headed by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa is dedicated to safeguarding government officials,\u201d Gunawardena said at a cabinet briefing on February 13, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
