They are also less than half that of 2004/05 (36 deaths) when IPCC records began.\n\nAlthough the deaths occurred during or following police custody, the cause is not defined; they could be a result of other incidents such as a long term health condition rather than a direct result of being taken into custody.\n\nThe latest statistics from the IPCC were released just hours before Home Secretary Theresa May announced an independent review of deaths in police custody. The review will include an investigation into the restraint methods used by police officers.\n\nAlternative figures on the number of deaths in police custody are published by Inquest by calendar year rather than financial year and use a slightly different definition to the IPCC. The most recent complete years of data agree with IPCC that the number of deaths has increased; they suggest 20 deaths occurred in custody in 2014, up from 17 in 2013.", "lang": "en"}
