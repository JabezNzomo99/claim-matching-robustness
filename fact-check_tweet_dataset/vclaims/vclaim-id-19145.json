However, EKSU has said that it was a long-standing tradition of the institution, and that the management upwardly reviewed it after the public outburst and it would be effective from its next convocation ceremony.\n\nPerhaps because of their outright meagreness, the prize awards stated in a letter received by two best graduating students of Ekiti State University (EKSU), a school that says it aims to produce \u201cgraduates adequately equipped to handle contemporary socioeconomic and environmental challenges\u201d, has earned the backslash of the Nigerian netizens.\n\nThis prize money was stated in a letter signed by Dr S.O. Afolabi on behalf of the school\u2019s registrar, Akin Arogundade, and dated June 13, 2018.\n\nThe letters were addressed to Messrs Uwagwu Oluwadamilare Samuel of the Department of Crop Production and Bamisaye Tosin Tope of the Department of Civil Engineering, both of whom graduated as their respective departmental best in the 2017/2018 academic session.\n\nWhile the former received the Prof M.A. Faluyi Prize Award, a prize valued at two thousand naira (an equivalent of $6.5) for his heroics, the latter was awarded the Ado-Ekiti Patriotic Front Prize Award, valued at hundred naira (equivalent of $0.326).\n\nAlthough, it has been over a year since the letter was issued, Nigerians on different online fora, from Twitter to Facebook were not economical with showing their angst at the reward system in Nigerian schools.\n\n\u201cHow can we rewire the education system in Nigeria when the best graduating student is awarded a sum of two thousand naira? Nigeria is indeed rushing to deliver itself,\u201d came the question asked by a user on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t people do Yahoo Yahoo, when we don\u2019t show them that Education is important,\u201d read another tweet.\n\n\u201cThis is Nigeria where nonsense is regarded than useful things,\u201d quipped a Facebook user.\n\nDubawa contacted Mr Uwagwu Oluwadamilare Samuel. He confirmed to us that truly he received two thousand naira for being the \u201cbest graduating student in my department\u201d.\n\nMr Samuel declined to comment on how he felt when he received the prize.\n\n\u201cWell, that was the prize. I can\u2019t say why it was meagre. It\u2019s just what I got,\u201d he told Dubawa.\n\nAs for Mr Bamisaye Tosin Tope, he\u2019s yet to respond to Dubawa\u2019s message to confirm the letter. However, he \u201cloved\u201d and commented with \u201csmiles\u201d on a Facebook post he was tagged by a user, Moran Cee Onyemaechi, who claimed he \u201cchatted [with] the recipient and he confirmed it!\u201d\n\nIn the University of Ibadan, all first class graduates are at liberty to have their Masters studies for free. This is according to the university\u2019s 2015/2016 session best graduating student of the Department of Statistics, Mr Odewole Olaolu Joseph.\n\n\u201cFor [being] the best graduating student, I got nothing. [The] only reward I got was just the access to come back for Masters without paying, with a monthly stipend of 25k.\n\n\u201cAnd if anyone who had a First Class isn\u2019t interested in coming back for MSc at the department, [that means there\u2019s] no reward,\u201d revealed Mr Olaolu.\n\nOn another hand, Mr Emeka Donald Ayo, one of the two 2017/2018 session best graduating student of Local Government and Developmental Studies in Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, told Dubawa he received a \u201cHP laptop and letter of recommendation\u201d for having the highest Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) in his faculty.\n\nThis was given to all other best graduating students in the university\u2019s other 13 faculties, and also to his departmental mate with whom he had a tied CGPA, Mr Donald said. The overall best graduating student, he added, was given money by different companies.\n\nCOMPARING PRACTISE IN NIGERIAN UNIVERSITIES TO THE WORLD\u2026\n\nBeing a yearly academic awardee while in college, Ely Jay Gomez Enaje, graduated as the 2015 most outstanding student in Agricultural Technology at Bicol University, Philippines.\n\nThe Filipino informed Dubawa that she \u201cwas recognised during the recognition [ceremony] for outstanding students who excelled in their class\u201d with \u201cmedal and certificate\u201d.\n\nAlso, earlier this year, India\u2019s University of Mysore awarded its Best Graduating Master\u2019s Student, Mrs Emelife Chinelo Stella, a Nigerian, with 20 medals and five cash prizes during its convocation.\n\nSimilarly, graduating best in the 2012/2013 academic session (with a CGPA of 4.86) at Usmanu DanFodiyo University, Sokoto (UDUS), where she had her first degree in Applied Chemistry, Mrs Chinelo compared Nigeria\u2019s reward system to India\u2019s in an interview with Premium Times.\n\n\u201cBoth are supposed to be laudable,\u201d the said of the two countries. \u201cHowever, India celebrates academic excellence the way it should. Every convocation ceremony in Nigeria, there is a best graduating student but no one ever talks about them except in really rare cases but that\u2019s not same with India, as you have seen clearly.\u201d\n\nBUT WHY IS THE PRIZE MONEY THAT MEAGRE?\n\nMajority of those irked by the amount in question questioned how educational excellence is less gratifying while such ventures as entertainment receive number spinning bumper rewards. They mostly call out reality shows like Big Brother Naija whose 2018 winner, Miracle Igbokwe, went home with nothing less than 45 million naira ($146,580). In this year\u2019s edition, the prize has been said to increase to 60 million naira.\n\nWe tried getting answers on why the amount in question is meagre but calls, text and WhatsApp messages sent to the school\u2019s Registrar, Mr Akin Arogundade, were met with silence. A mail, to which the Registrar was copied too, requesting clarity on the prize monies from the school also hasn\u2019t been replied.\n\n\u201cTHE PRIDE IN ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT SHOULD BE SELF-FULFILMENT\u201d, SAYS REGISTRAR\n\nThe Registrar/Chief Executive of Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN), Prof. Josiah Olusegun Ajiboye, told Dubawa that strive for excellence should not be prize driven. Rather, he explained, it should be for self pride.\n\n\u201cApart from the external reward, the intrinsic value of education should satisfy anybody. You do not wait until someone gives you a prize. The pride in academic achievement should be self fulfilment.\u201d\n\nMr Josiah added that \u201cscholarship and quick job offers should accompany such excellence.\u201d\n\nBusinessDay contacted the Registrar of the university, Akin Arogundade, on Monday, July 8, 2019, to verify the authenticity of the viral letter that contains N100. Although Arogundade did not explicitly state that the letter was issued by EKSU, he simply said the management has reacted to the letter and upwardly reviewed the said value of the award prize.\n\n\u201cThat award was instituted in the university more than 30 years ago,\u201d Arogundade told BusinessDay on phone. \u201cI am sure you know the value of N100 then.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the time the award was made, it was a good money compared to the present economic reality,\u201d the statement issued by Bode Olofinmuagun, EKSU Head of Directorate of Information and Corporate Affairs, read. \u201cIt is in the realization of this development that the Senate of the university has reviewed the value of the prizes in this category to a minimum of N50,000 for corporate bodies and N100,000 for university prizes.\u201d\n\nThis fact-check was done in collaboration with a Dubawa Fact-checking Fellow working for BusinessDay, the leading medium for up-to-date news and insightful analysis of business, policy and the economy in Nigeria.", "lang": "en"}
