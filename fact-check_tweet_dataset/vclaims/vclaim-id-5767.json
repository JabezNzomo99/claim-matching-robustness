This claim is false.\n\nExamples of posts sharing the image can be seen here and here .\n\nIn the photo, a bearded man wearing a turban is seen posing with a young girl, who appears to be wearing a wedding dress.\n\nText alongside the image reads: \u201cNo, that\u2019s not his daughter...that\u2019s his wife! Yet the world is silent...\u201d\n\nAccording to several Turkish news articles ( here, here , here and here ), the photograph actually shows a teacher and student at a kindergarten in the Turkish city of Elazig.\n\nThe articles explain that children are made to wear wedding dresses to celebrate the fact they are starting to read the Koran.\n\nThe images made headlines in Turkey, where the role of religion in public life is a sensitive topic. The country has a secular constitution, but President Tayyip Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted AK Party have introduced huge changes in the past two decades by championing religious education, building thousands of mosques and lifting a ban on wearing Muslim headscarves in public ( here ).\n\nNone of the articles, however, suggests that the girl in the picture is a child bride.\n\nA photo of the same event posted on social media provides further context and helps to verify the location ( here ).\n\nIn the photo, a portrait ( tinyurl.com/y3y6hspx ) of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk (1881-1938) the father of the secular Turkish republic ( here ), can be seen hanging on the wall.\n\nThe child in the photograph is much younger than the legal marriage age in Turkey, which is 18, or 17 with the consent of a parent or legal guardian.\n\nFalse. The photograph shows a kindergarten teacher and student, not a man and his child bride.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
