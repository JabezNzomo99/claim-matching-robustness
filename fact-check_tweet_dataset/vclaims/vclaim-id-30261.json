It is being widely shared on social media that the real-life culprit\u2019s name (\u2018Nadeem Khan\u2019) has been changed into a Hindu name (\u2018Rajesh/Rakesh\u2019) in the movie. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: The culprit\u2019s name has been changed into a Hindu name (\u2018Rajesh/Rakesh\u2019) in \u2018Chhapaak\u2019 movie. Fact: In \u2018Chhapaak\u2019 movie, the culprit\u2019s name has not been changed into a Hindu name. The name of the culprit is \u2018Basheer\u2019, not \u2018Rajesh/Rakesh\u2019, in the movie. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nIn the judgement of the Delhi High Court, it can be seen that two people were convicted of attacking Lakshmi with the acid. While one is \u2018Naeem Khan\u2019 alias \u2018Guddu\u2019, the other is a woman named \u2018Rakhi\u2019. It is being claimed that the name of \u2018Naeem Khan\u2019 has been changed into a Hindu name in the movie. Let\u2019s try to find whether the name was actually changed.\n\nAs the posts and tweets claiming the name change went viral, people from various media agencies who watched the movie screening of \u2018Chhapaak\u2019 have clarified that the name of the culprit has not been changed into a Hindu name. It can be found that various news agencies have published articles that the name of the culprit in the movie is \u2018Basheer\u2019, whereas the name of Malti\u2019s (Lakshmi\u2019s name in the movie) boyfriend is \u2018Rajesh\u2019. The articles can be read here, here and here. Also, in the reviews of \u2018Chhapaak\u2019 movie, it can be read that the name of the culprit has not been changed into a Hindu name.\n\nThe news agency, \u2018Swarajya\u2019, which has written an article (archived) claiming that the name has been changed into a Hindu name, has also now changed its title.\n\nTo sum it up, the culprit\u2019s name has not been changed into a Hindu name in the \u2018Chhapaak\u2019 movie.\n\nDid you watch our video on the 10 Most Ridiculous Fake News of the Year 2019?", "lang": "en"}
