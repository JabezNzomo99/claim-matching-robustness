No such policy is being proposed.\n\nRFID stands for radio-frequency identification, which is a type of tagging technology, already used by retailers to track their inventory, to measure timings in sporting events and for pet microchips.\n\nIt is possible to inject people with RFID implants, but this is by no means a government initiative. For example, in Sweden, several thousand people are believed to have chosen to have the implants, though the government has nothing to do with the trend.\n\nClues that this letter is fake\n\nThe letter is addressed \u2018Dear Citizen\u2019 and is dated 9 June 2020, suggesting it was sent out to a large number of people recently, yet there have been no reports of this. A quick web search shows the story hasn\u2019t been covered by media outlets\u2014something you would expect to happen if such a story were true. Letters that the Prime Minister has actually sent to the public are published on the government\u2019s website\u2014and this letter is not among them.\n\nThe image of the letter is incredibly blurry, which doesn\u2019t prove it is fake, but can be an indication that an image may not be what it seems.\n\nAlso, the signature does not match Boris Johnson\u2019s signature on previous letters.", "lang": "en"}
