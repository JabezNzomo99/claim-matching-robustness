Michelle Lujan Grisham over her support of a law that attempts to keep guns away from people who might be dangerous.\n\n\"In a move some would call \u2018stunningly ironic\u2019 Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) has had the firearms of her guards and household seized,\" says a Feb. 9 Facebook post by the Farmington Tribune. \"This comes only days after pushing her party's \u2018red flag\u2019 law through the Senate.\"\n\nWe don\u2019t call this statement ironic. We call it false.\n\nThere is no evidence that guns were seized from Lujan Grisham\u2019s home. And the state police officers who protect her remain armed, her spokesman Tripp Stelnicki told PolitiFact.\n\nThe story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe Farmington Tribune Facebook page doesn\u2019t shed much light on its intentions. Some news reports have characterized the Facebook page as satire, but nothing on the site states that.\n\nThis false story was inspired by Lujan Grisham\u2019s support of the proposed Extreme Risk Firearm Protection Order Act that passed the state Senate on Feb. 7. It passed the House on Feb. 13. Lujan Grisham, who applauded its passage, is expected to sign the bill.\n\nAbout 17 states have similar \"red flag\" or extreme risk laws. The laws allow police to petition a court to order the temporary removal of firearms from a person who may be dangerous, or to block the person from obtaining a firearm. After a set amount of time, the firearm is either returned to the person or the court order is extended.\n\nThere is no evidence that guns were seized from Lujan Grisham\u2019s home or from her security detail after passage of the law. We rate this statement False.", "lang": "en"}
