It may actually come from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.\n\nA diplomat and writer active during the Italian Renaissance, Machiavelli is widely considered the \u201cfather of modern political theory.\u201d He is perhaps best known for his political treatise \u201cThe Prince,\u201d in which he expounded his political philosophy.\n\nThough Machiavelli discussed a variety of political subjects in his writings, there is no evidence that he authored the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. The Caller found no record of the statement in \u201cThe Prince,\u201d or in any collections of his other works.\n\n\u201cI can confirm that Machiavelli never wrote anything remotely along these lines,\u201d Ross King, author of \u201cMachiavelli: Philosopher of Power,\u201d told the Caller in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s directly contrary to his political philosophy, which is concerned with preserving the \u2018status quo\u2019 (an expression he never would have used \u2014 which makes the quote even more untenable).\u201d\n\nThe expression may actually have originated with Gingrich, according to \u201cMachiavelli for Mayors\u201d author Ian Chadwick. Gingrich is quoted by The Los Angeles Times in 1991 as making this statement in response to criticism from other members of Congress.", "lang": "en"}
