The quote originated in a satirical tweet.\n\nAuthor Don Winslow on Aug. 2 sent out a series of tweets, purportedly quotes from Trump, that all began with the phrase \u201cIf you elect Joe Biden.\u201d While most people appeared to correctly perceive them as satirical, one particular quote has been widely shared on Facebook as if it were real.\n\n\u201cIf you elect Joe Biden, there will be no hand sanitizer,\u201d one such Facebook user credited Trump with saying. \u201cI have spoken to the hand sanitizer people and they have assured me that they will only produce hand sanitizer for a Donald Trump administration.\u201d\n\nThere is no record of Trump ever making the statement. Searching his Twitter accounts \u2013 @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS \u2013 and ProPublica\u2019s archive of his deleted tweets didn\u2019t turn up any matches. It also does not appear in Factbase, an online database that collects Trump\u2019s public statements.\n\nWinslow later tweeted to clarify that the quote was satirical and meant to \u201chighlight the ridiculousness of Donald Trump\u2019s tweets.\u201d The Facebook post gives no such disclaimer.\n\n\u201cI posted ten or so SATIRICAL comments to highlight the ridiculousness of Donald Trump\u2019s tweets,\u201d Winslow tweeted. \u201cBut the best part is the hundreds of people writing to me and asking when/where did Trump say that! Meaning he regularly says such INSANE STUFF that my SILLY JOKES were believed.\u201d\n\nDaniel Dale, a CNN reporter, also pointed out to Twitter users that Winslow was \u201ctweeting out a series of invented satirical quotes.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
