If it doesn\u2019t go through, I\u2019ll resign.\"\n\nExcept, of course, Pelosi never said that.\n\nThe Belgian magazine \"Le Mensonge\" doesn\u2019t exist. The word itself means a lie in French.\n\nA search of the Nexis news database brought up nothing to back up the site\u2019s claim.\n\nThis is another example of a material moving from a so-called satire site to a website with no satire disclaimer. The original bunk was dated Dec. 9.\n\nThis claim is Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
