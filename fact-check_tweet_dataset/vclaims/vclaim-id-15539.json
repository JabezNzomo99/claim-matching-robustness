Ilhan Omar tweeted \u201cthey reap what they sow\u201d in response to the fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.\n\nIt also showed a tweet of Fox News purportedly sharing the story. \u201cThis was taken down,\u201d the image claimed. \u201cRetweet the hell out of it before they take it down again.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence Omar said this about the fire at Notre Dame. The Twitter account that shared the claim is not actually associated with Fox News.\n\nCriticism of Omar has persisted since her election in November, and in light of the April 15 fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, some have tried to cast her as unsympathetic to the tragedy because of her religion. Omar is one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress.\n\nThere is no evidence, however, that Omar ever tweeted \u201cthey reap what they sow.\u201d Were the tweet deleted, there would have likely been screenshots of the tweet with a different time stamp or number of interactions.\n\nThere is also no evidence of such a Fox News article or headline anywhere online.\n\nThe Twitter account sharing the information, @USFoxNews, has been suspended from Twitter. It was not a legitimate account of Fox News, as confirmed to The Daily Caller by a spokesperson with the network. Within the aforementioned tweet, the account misspelled the name of the cathedral, referring to it as \u201cNorte Dame,\u201d and failed to capitalize the word \u201cTwitter.\u201d\n\nOmar did make a public statement about the fire at Notre Dame on her Twitter, saying, \u201cArt and architecture have a unique ability to help us connect across our differences and bring people together in important ways. Thinking of the people of Paris and praying for every first responder trying to save this wonder.\u201d\n\nInvestigators believe the fire was an accident and not an act of terror.", "lang": "en"}
