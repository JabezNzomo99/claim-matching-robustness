The claim is that the woman was beaten up by the Policemen. Let\u2019s try to check the veracity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: The woman in the picture was beaten up by the Policemen Fact: The woman was first groped by two men in UP\u2019s Mainpuri, and was then beaten by a crowd for protesting against it. So, the claim that the woman was beaten up by the Policemen is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image in the collage is cropped and subjected to Google reverse image search technique, a search result thus obtained lead us to an article of \u2018India Times\u2019 that carried both the images seen in the collage. As per the article, the woman was beaten up by a crowd in UP\u2019s Mainpuri after she has spoken against two men who groped her. This incident took place in 2016. In the article, it was also reported that the woman has said to the Police, who arrived after she made a call to them, that she would shoot herself if they wouldn\u2019t arrest the men who groped her. So, the Policemen seen in the photo might be the ones who arrived after she has made a call to the Police.\n\nThe video clip of the woman being beaten up by the crowd can be seen in the \u2018Aaj Tak\u2019 news video that reported about the incident.\n\nTo conclude, these images are not of the crime against a woman by the Policemen.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
