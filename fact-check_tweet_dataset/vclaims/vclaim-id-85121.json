After a 41-year-old factory worker was accused of raping a 12-year-old girl, he asked the judge to replace his male court-appoined attorney with a female one. The judge went through the list of a half-dozen women practicing law in the county and picked Clinton.\n\nOn the recording, Clinton describes it as a \u201cterrible case\u201d and \u201cfascinating.\u201d In her autobiography, \u201cLiving History,\u201d she wrote, \u201cI told [prosecutor] Mahlon [Gibson] I really don\u2019t feel comfortable taking on such a client, but Mahlon gently reminded me that I couldn\u2019t very well refuse the judge\u2019s request.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the prosecution\u2019s case fell apart for a number of reasons, including investigators mishandling evidence of bloody underwear, so in a plea agreement the charges were reduced from first-degree rape to unlawful fondling of a minor under the age of 14. Until the Newsday report, the victim, Kathy Shelton, did not realize that Clinton had been the lawyer on the other side. She has since attacked Clinton for putting \u201cme through hell.\u201d (Follow this link for more on the Shelton case.)\n\nIn the recorded interview, Clinton is heard laughing or giggling four times when discussing the case with unusual candor; the reporter is also heard laughing, and sometimes Clinton is responding to him.\n\nHere are the four instances:\n\u2022 \u201cOf course he [the defendant] claimed he didn\u2019t [rape]. All this stuff. He took a lie detector test. I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs.\u201d (Both Clinton and the reporter laugh.)\n\u2022 \u201cSo I got an order to see the evidence and the prosecutor didn\u2019t want me to see the evidence. I had to go to Maupin Cummings [the judge] and convince Maupin that yes indeed I had a right to see the evidence before it was presented. (Clinton laughs lightly between \u201cevidence\u201d and \u201cbefore.\u201d)\n\u2022 \u201cI handed it [a biography of her expert witness] to Mahlon Gibson, and I said, \u2018Well this guy\u2019s ready to come up from New York to prevent this miscarriage of justice.\u2019\u201d (Clinton laughs, as does the reporter.)\n\u2022 \u201cSo [Judge] Maupin had to, you know, under law he was supposed to determine whether the plea was factually supported. Maupin asked me to leave the room while he examined my client so that he could find out if it was factually supported. I said \u2018Judge I can\u2019t leave the room I\u2019m his lawyer!\u2019 he said \u2018I know but I don\u2019t want to talk about this in front of you.'\u201d (Reporter says, \u201cOh God, really?\u201d And they both laugh.)\n\nClinton\u2019s recollections may strike some listeners as callous or cynical about the legal process, especially because she implies her client was guilty.\n\n[Update: Reed in an interview published Oct. 12 denied that Clinton was laughing at Shelton. \u201cAs far as her laughing, God knows she was not laughing over the notion that this rapist was going to go free,\" said Reed. \u201cI challenge any fair-minded reader of that transcript to make a case that Hillary Rodham was a coldblooded lawyer who was laughing over the plight of the 12-year-old rape victim.\"]\n\nHillary Clinton has long been a defender of her husband. Carl Bernstein\u2019s 2008 book \u201cA Woman in Charge\u201d says that Hillary Clinton was involved in a pre-1992 effort to obtain signed statements from women denying they had affairs with Clinton, including Flowers. \u201cThere can be no question that Hillary was Bill\u2019s fiercest defender in preventing his other women from causing trouble,\u201d Bernstein wrote.\n\nBut her opponents have said that Hillary Clinton has gone too far in defending her husband, specifically on the \u201cToday\u201d show on Jan. 27, 1998, a week after the president was accused of having an affair with Lewinsky.\n\n\u201cI mean, look at the very people who are involved in this, they have popped up in other settings,\u201d Clinton told Matt Lauer. \u201cThis is the great story here, for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it, is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.\u201d\n\nThis is a famous statement by Hillary Clinton, which came after she referenced what she believed were false attacks by Republican foes: \u201cHaving seen so many of these accusations come and go, having seen people profit, you know, like Jerry Falwell, with videos, accusing my husband of committing murder, of drug running, seeing some of the things that are written and said about him, my attitude is, you know, we\u2019ve been there before, we have seen this before, and I am just going to wait patiently until the truth comes out.\u201d\n\nThis interview, by many accounts, was certainly pivotal to saving Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, as his wife forcefully backed him. But although some describe this as a political attack on Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones, by Hillary Clinton\u2019s account, at the time her husband had not yet admitted the Lewinsky affair to her. That did not happen until Aug. 15, 1998, according to her memoir:\n\n\u201cHe told me for the first time that the situation was much more serious than he had previously acknowledged. He now realized he would have to testify that there had been an inappropriate intimacy\u2026.. I could hardly breathe. Gulping for air, I started crying and yelling at him\u2026I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing. Up until now I only thought that he\u2019d been foolish for paying attention to the young woman and was convinced that he was being railroaded. I couldn\u2019t believe he would do anything to endanger our marriage and our family. I was dumbfounded, heartbroken and outraged that I\u2019d believed him at all.\u201d\n\nMoreover, at the time of the interview, Lewinsky also denied there had been a relationship. Her attorney had submitted an affidavit on Jan. 12 from her saying she \u201cnever had a sexual relationship with the president.\u201d Lewinsky did not begin to testify before the independent prosecutor about the full extent of the relationship until July 27, six months after the \u201cToday\u201d interview. Lewinsky testified for 15 days, after which the president finally confessed to his wife.\n\nWhen Clinton ran for the Senate, she was asked during a debate whether she misled Americans during the Lauer interview two years earlier. \u201cObviously I didn\u2019t mislead anyone,\u201d Clinton replied. \u201cI didn\u2019t know the truth. And there\u2019s a great deal of pain associated with that and my husband has certainly acknowledged that and made it clear that he did mislead the country as well as his family.\u201d\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nCheck out our guide to all Trump and Clinton fact checks\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter", "lang": "en"}
