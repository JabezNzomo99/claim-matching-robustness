The location of the person handling @GurmeetKaur2020 is marked as \u2018Khalistan\u2019 and the bio reads, \u201d Free Khalistan is my Dream. Standing against Indian Oppression.\u201d\n\nSoon after, many Pakistani social media users began tweeting the Republic TV clip (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n\nA few Facebook users have also shared the clip.\n\nIndian journalist Rohini Singh was among those who retweeted the alleged Republic TV broadcast.\n\nA simple Google reverse image search is enough to reveal that the viral Republic TV clip is photoshopped. Alt News was redirected by Google to a May 2017 article by Newslaundrythat had used the original clip from the channel\u2019s broadcast two years ago.\n\nIf one compares the viral clip with the one uploaded by Newslaundry, it is clear that apart from the text in the middle and \u2018breaking news\u2019 added above it, everything else is identical.\n\nThe Republic TV broadcast was about its viewership. The channel had also put out a tweet of the \u201861% viewership\u2019 it enjoyed from May 13 to 19, 2017 between 9 to 11 pm.\n\nSince the Pulwama terror attack and the India-Pakistan tensions that followed, Pakistani media and social media have been circulating misinformation to undermine India\u2019s retaliation. Similarly, the Indian media and social media ecosystems have returned the favour by sharing fake news targetting their neighbour from across the border.", "lang": "en"}
