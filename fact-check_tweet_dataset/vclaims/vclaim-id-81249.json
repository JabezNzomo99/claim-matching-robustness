Is it any wonder that voters in Idaho might be confused? Let\u2019s try to untangle this.\n\nThe Club for Growth, which is backing Smith, accurately cites fact checks from The Fact Checker and FactCheck.org that criticized Simpson for suggesting that he opposed the Wall Street bailout. Instead, one of his ads had cited a relatively minor action \u2013 a failed procedural vote to direct a committee to terminate half of the funding for the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) and develop a repayment plan for the money that had been spent. We awarded Two Pinocchios for his misleading campaign advertising, saying \u201che should not emphasize the vote to end TARP without acknowledging that he voted for the program in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe Club for Growth uses footage of Simpson saying \u201cI voted for the $700 billion bailout\u201d to undercut his attacks on Smith. (The clip does not include his explanation that it was necessary to free up bank credit.) The ad represents the fact checks accurately, but it then it goes on to suggest that this means that all of Simpson\u2019s attacks on Smith are lies. We have not rated any other claims made by Simpson in the race.\n\nIn response to Club for Growth\u2019s attack, the Simpson campaign began running an ad that depicts Smith as a puppet with a growing nose. It cites The Fact Checker\u2019s awarding of a single Pinocchio to a Club for Growth ad that we said \u201csticks relatively close to the facts,\u201d though we called into question an assertion that Simpson had worked with Democrats to boost the size of President Obama\u2019s stimulus bill. So the Simpson team is certainly trying to get a lot of mileage out of a relatively positive fact check. The Fact Checker did not \u201cliken\u201d Club for Growth to Pinocchio.\n\nThe most interesting aspect of the ad is that it repeats the claim that earned Simpson Two Pinocchios, but it precedes it with this line: \u201cMike Simpson protected us from a meltdown of the U.S. banking system.\u201d\n\nSarah Nelson, a Simpson campaign adviser, said the campaign was responding to the Fact Checker\u2019s admonition that Simpson needed to admit he voted for the bailout. \u201cWhen we were putting this ad together we took your fact check into full consideration and your assessment that we needed to include both votes when we talked about TARP,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s again why we talk about and cite both votes in our ad.\u201d\n\nViewers might think the ad is talking about two different things\u2014saving the financial system and canceling a \u201cbailout\u201d\u2014but we can\u2019t complain when ad makers respond to our fact checks.\n\nIn neither case do these ads warrant a Pinocchio rating or a Geppetto. We want to remind readers that we rate statements on a case by case basis, so a single rating does not mean that a politician or an organization is a Pinocchio. Meanwhile, the voters in Idaho might consider muting their televisions when the political ads start running.", "lang": "en"}
