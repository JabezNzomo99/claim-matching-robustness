He\u2019s not going to be fair. He will collude, if you please, with the White House, at least the White House\u2019s attorneys, to decide how he will go forward. Why would the speaker of the House step into that without trying to determine exactly what the majority leader plans to do? So I applaud her for this. In fact, I was one of the ones arguing that this ought to be the case. And until we can get some assurances from the majority leader that he is going to allow for a fair and impartial trial to take place, we would be crazy to walk in there knowing he set up a kangaroo court. BERMAN: How long are you willing to wait? CLYBURN: As long as it takes. Even if he doesn\u2019t come around to committing to a fair trial, keep those articles here. So keep it as long as it takes. If you know and he\u2019s told you what he\u2019s going to do, let\u2019s give him a fair trial and hang him. It\u2019s the reverse of that.\n\nClyburn was referencing comments made by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who had publicly said he didn\u2019t plan to approach impeachment hearings with impartiality, stating: \u201cThe House made a partisan political decision to impeach. I would anticipate we will have a largely partisan outcome in the Senate. I\u2019m not impartial about this at all.\u201d\n\nAnother way to understand Clyburn\u2019s quote would be if he said, \u201cMcConnell is telegraphing what he\u2019s going to do, and it\u2019s like [McConnell is saying] \u2018Let\u2019s give him a fair trial and hang him,\u2019 except it\u2019s the reverse of that.\u201d\n\nBecause Clyburn was not literally calling for Trump to be hanged but was instead likening the potential trial in the Senate to an already-made decision by jurors to exonerate an accused person regardless of the evidence presented, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
