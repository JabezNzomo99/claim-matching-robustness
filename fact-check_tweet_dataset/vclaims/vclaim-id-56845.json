Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is fake.\n\nThe post shared on Twitter reads: \u201cWhen the mosquitoes come out everyone,WEAR BUG SPRAY OUTSIDE.I might be wrong,but I personally think that if a mosquito sucks the blood of a person with #coronavirus and then bites you,the virus could spread to you.Im not smart,but just do it to be safe.\u201d The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nAs per World Health Organization (WHO), \u201c\u201dTo date, there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.\u201d\n\nAccording to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \u201cThe virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person; between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet), through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, these droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs, COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.\u201d\n\nVishvas News spoke to Dr. Nikhil Modi who is a Pulmonologist at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, New Delhi, and who is directly treating coronavirus-affected patients. He said: \u201cCOVID-19 cannot be transmitted by mosquitoes. It is a respiratory virus. Mosquitoes do not spread coronavirus. But, one should avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes so precautions should be taken.\u201d\n\nThe post is shared on Twitter by a user named Nate.
