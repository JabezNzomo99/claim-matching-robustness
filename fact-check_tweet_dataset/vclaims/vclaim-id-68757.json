At the bottom of the website, in its \"about\" section, it has a disclaimer that says, \"This website is an entertainment website, news are created by users. These are humourous news, fantasy, fictional, that should not be seriously taken or as a source of information.\"\n\nThis website is identical to other fake news sites we have fact-checked, such as www.breakingnews365.net and www.breakingnews247.net. All these sites have identical home pages that allow users to create their own fake news articles, enticing users to come up with \"catchy titles\" that \"make your friends curious.\"\n\nEven if you did not scroll to the bottom of the page to see the disclaimer, there are other ways to figure out that the article is false.\n\nIf you are a grandparent and you are not picking up your grandkids every weekend, you have not been jailed or fined. That\u2019s one way to tell.\n\nAnother way to check is to go on the website GovTrack.us. They have compiled a database with all of the bills considered, voted on and enacted.\n\nUsing this database, we searched all bills enacted during Obama\u2019s administration related to grandparents. There was no law that mandated grandparents to pick up their grandchildren every weekend.\n\nThe unknown author of this article made up the statement that said Obama signed a law that grandparents have to spend time with their grandchildren on the weekend, so we rate the statement as Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
