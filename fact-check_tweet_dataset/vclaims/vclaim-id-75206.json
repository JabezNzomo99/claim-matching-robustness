Trump said this was in retaliation for this week's gruesome chemical weapons attack against civilians, which killed 70 people, several of them children. Singling out Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Trump had earlier said \"something should happen.\" But the US President's quick military action stands against his earlier statements before his rise to presidency where he urged the then President Barack Obama to not get involved in Syria.\n\nHere is a quick fact check from factcheck.org on the history of Trump's own statements on Syria.\n\n2) Union Information and Broadcasting minister Venkaiah Naidu said that while food is a personal choice, one should avoid consuming what is restricted in the Constitution. \"Aapko jo khana hain voh khao...par jo samvidhan main prohibited hain usko mat khaon (One can eat his food of choice, but avoid eating that food which is prohibited as per our Constitution),\" he told reporters in Hyderabad.\n\nBut is Naidu correct in saying that the constitution restricts consumption of certain types of food. This tall claim calls for a fact check.\n\n3) On 28th March, English news channel Times Now put out the above tweet quoting activist Ashoke Pandit, where they claimed he said that \u2018Hindu Population is less than 2% in J&K\u2019. A 2 minutes audio clip of Ashoke Pandit was also included in the tweet.\n\nBut was this ever said by Ashoke Pandit and is such a claim true. BOOM looks at the population demographics and brings you this fact check.\n\nAre Hindus Less Than 2% In Jammu And Kashmir?: A FactCheck\n\n4) Is the United Nations (UN) planning universal biometric identification for all of humanity by 2030?\n\nSounds unbelievable but if you go beyond a cursory search for biometrics, many such obscure articles and YouTube videos from unverified sources crop up. BOOM decided to investigate the claims and we will present our fact check soon.", "lang": "en"}
