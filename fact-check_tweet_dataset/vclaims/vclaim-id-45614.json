The incident has triggered strong reactions from all quarters. In a statement, Kerala Chief Minister Pinayari Vijayan asserted that the culprits will not be spared.\n\nAmid this outrage, a photo of a man along with the elephant's picture has gone viral on social media. According to the post, the man killed the pregnant elephant.\n\nSeveral Facebook users have posted the man's photograph demanding severe punishment against him for killing the elephant.\n\nIndia Today Anti-fake news war room (AFWA) found the viral claim to be false. The man seen in the viral post was a victim of a mob lynching incident in Kerala that took his life in 2018.\n\nThe archived version of the Facebook posts are saved here and here.\n\nSeveral Facebook users have posted similar content in Bengali.\n\nWith the help of a reverse image search on the man's photo in the viral post, we found that several mainstream news websites had published stories on this man in 2018.\n\nAs per the news reports published by The Indian Express, this man, Madhu, 27, who belonged from a tribal community, was beaten to death by a mob at Attappady in Palakkad district of Kerala, on suspicion of stealing food.\n\nHe was tied up for several hours and beaten by sticks and then handed over to the local police. The man died on his way to the hospital.\n\nHence, the claim made in the viral post is found to be untrue. The man shown in the viral image has no connection to the killing of the pregnant elephant in Kerala.\n\nRead | Kerala elephant died after explosion in mouth, wildlife boss says can't rule out unintentional feeding\n\nWatch | Kerala: Forest officials take one person in custody over pregnant elephant's killing", "lang": "en"}
