Social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle data shows Filipino Facebook page called \"4:30pm ko to ginawa\" got the most number of engagements, with over 2,100 shares and 300 comments.\n\nThe page shared the link on October 1, 2019, and several users were still sharing it as of writing. Facebook Claim Check, the social media network\u2019s tool that identifies suspicious posts spread across the platform, flagged the link for fact checking.\n\nThe facts: The source of information cited in the article, secretnews.fr, is a French satirical website but thewatchdogweb.com treated it as an official source. Norway has not legalized marriage between humans and animals.\n\nSecretnews.fr published two satirical articles about the topic \u2013 first in November 2016, then in February 2018. The first post said marriages between humans and animals will soon be legalized, and the second one featured Tr\u00fcdlosmek marrying her dog on Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nIn its About Me section, secretnews.fr wrote: \u201cSecretNews.fr is a free and independent collaborative parodic media gathering several contributors. Most of the information on this site is probably false, published for a satirical and humorous purpose and can not be considered authentic.\u201d\n\nThe Norwegian paper mentioned in the article, Dagens N\u00e6ringsliv, also did not publish anything about the matter. An archived version of its webpage on March 10, 2017 shows no mention of Tr\u00fcdlosmek or legalized marriages between humans and animals. The name Barbar\u00e4 Tr\u00fcdlosmek was also never mentioned in any of its published articles.\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
