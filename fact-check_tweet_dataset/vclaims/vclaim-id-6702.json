Credible independent analysis found that the metadata in the leaked emails seems to corroborate their authenticity.\n\nThere is also evidence of regular Russian army forces operating in Donbas, including video and photos from Russian soldiers and pro-Russian sources showing Russian soldiers and equipment operated exclusively by the Russian military in Donbas. Polygraph.info documented proof of Russia sending tanks into Donbas.\n\nThe Minsk II Accords, which set forth an ill-observed ceasefire between Ukrainian and pro-Russian forces in February 2015, mentions a rocket artillery system, the Tornado-S, which is used only by the Russian military.\n\nThe citizen journalist site Bellingcat traced a Russian BUK anti-aircraft missile launcher, which likely shot down Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 in July 2014, going from the Russian border into Donbas and back. The site identified the vehicle by its unit within the Russian military.\n\nA comprehensive report on Russian military operations in Donbas was compiled by the Atlantic Council in October 2015.\n\nAnd a Ukrainian research think-tank, InformNapalm, has created a database detailing Russian military deployment in the Donbas region\n\nNATO, the U.S., Germany and other Western governments have repeatedly called upon Moscow to withdraw its troops from Ukraine and end support for separatists.\n\nOn February 18, 2017, Putin issued an executive order recognizing civil registration documents issued by the \u201cgovernment\u201d of the Donbas. The region also declared the Russian Ruble as a state currency.", "lang": "en"}
