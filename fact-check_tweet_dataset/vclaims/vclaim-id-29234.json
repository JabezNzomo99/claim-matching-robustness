He loves the country, not the position.\" (Translated from Hindi text - \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u0905\u092a\u0928\u093e \u0918\u0930 \u092d\u0930\u0928\u093e \u0939\u094b\u0924\u093e \u0924\u094b \u0935\u0939 \u0967\u0969 \u0938\u093e\u0932 \u0917\u0941\u091c\u0930\u093e\u0924 \u0915\u093e CM \u0930\u0939 \u0915\u0930 \u092d\u0930 \u0932\u0947\u0924\u093e| \u0909\u0938\u0947 \u0916\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0938\u0940 \u0938\u0947 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902, \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0938\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u092e \u0939\u0948 \u0967\u0966\u0966 % \u0938\u0924\u094d\u092f )\n\nThe photoshopped image received 300 shares and attracted comments with many agreeing with the placard.\n\nThe logo of the Bharatiya Janata Party has been superimposed on the woman's jacket.\n\nA Google reverse image search led us to the original image.\n\nThe picture is part of a campaign against stereotypes on campus, that happened at the University of Mary Washington in Virginia. A blog by the name One Beauty Of Islam had posted all the pictures from the campaign and had written that, 'Mary Washington's Islamic Student Association was inspired to launch a campaign against stereotyping and judging.'\n\nThe original image has, \"I'm a Muslim but I'm not Arab\" written on it. The placard also has, \"DON'T STEREOTYPE ME UMW INA CAMPAIGN\" written in block letters.\n\nOriginal image from the 2012 campaign\n\nBOOM found that the same text has been on social media since 2017.", "lang": "en"}
