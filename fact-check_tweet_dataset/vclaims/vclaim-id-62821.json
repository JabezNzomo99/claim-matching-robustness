In the background, one can see a CRPF personnel signalling him to move away. The right hand of the boy in the picture has been circled in the image.\n\nA caption with the viral image reads 'This Little boy Holds a stone in his hand after seeing how his Grandfather was killed by Forces in Kashmir...Can anybody guess who is going to be his Target and why he picked up the stone????? Is an inevitable question? That is needed to be answered'.\n\nYou can view the post here and its archived versions can be checked here and here.\n\nThe image is viral from several Twitter handles too.\n\nAlso read Video Showing Tear Gas Training Peddled As Atrocity By Indian Army\n\nBOOM compared several pictures of the same incident clicked from different angles and found that what is being identified as a stone in the child's hand is actually a portion of a rock seen in the background.\n\nWe went through several news reports on the incident to get a clearer image. We could not find many pictures of the incident as there were no photojournalists present at the encounter site at the time of the incident.\n\n\"It was not an operational encounter and there was no photojournalist present at the place,\" CRPF spokesperson Junaid Khan told Outlook. \n\n\n\nWe noticed that in the images on social media where the boy is sitting on his grandfather's body, trying to wake him up, there are three rocks jutting out from the ground by the road.\n\nBOOM then checked the other image where the boy is seen walking towards the CRPF personnel, his hands are swinging. The left hand is ahead of him while the right hand is parallel to his body.\n\nThe boy's clenched fist blends in with the edges of one of the rocks that lies ahead of him creating an illusion.\n\nBOOM compared both the images and found that it is an illusion of a stone in the boy's hand that has been misidentified as a stone.

The report does not mention a 'stone in the boy's hand'.\n\nAccording to news reports a 60-year-old civilian, who, along with his grandson was passing through the area in his car, got stuck between the exchange of fire. The old man had suffered two bullet injuries and died on the spot. Social media is now rife with claims that bullets from police, and not militants, claimed the life of the old man. The victim's family have now released videos claiming that the old man was dragged out of his car before being shot at point-blank range. However, BOOM could not independently verify the claim.", "lang": "en"}
