If the state is such in 5 hours, what will be the torture in 5 years.\u201d In the last sentence, he hinted at Congress\u2019s victory in the recent Rajasthan elections.\n\nThe Rajasthan police tweeted that the video posted in the tweet was from Ranchi, Jharkhand. They warned @Ashok6510 and asked him to delete the tweet. He took down the tweet but its screenshot can be viewed below and an archive link can be accessed here.\n\nThe same video has also been shared by other individual users on social media.\n\nThe video was of a June 2018 incident from Ranchi, Jharkhand\n\nThe video tweeted by @Ashok6510 actually pertained to an unrelated incident from June 2018 that occurred in Ranchi, Jharkhand.\n\nThe incident was reported by several media organisations. According to a Firstpost report, \u201c\u2026communal clashes occurred on 10 June when a crowd at the jam-packed Eid-bazaar in Hindpiri\u2019s Main Road, got into a fight with a group of people holding a bike rally celebrating four years of Modi government. One of the bikes, reportedly hit a woman, triggering clashes in the area.\u201d\n\n\u201cLater that evening, two clerics were attacked on their way back from a Madrassa in Nagri, on the outskirts of the capital and were allegedly forced to chant the name of a certain \u2018god\u2019, further inflaming communal passions,\u201d added the report.\n\nA rumour of banned meat found in a temple fueled the tension further, leading to stone-pelting between members of two communities.\n\nA video of the abovestated clashes in Jharkhand was tweeted by @Ashok6510 as communal violence in Rajasthan. The state police had called out this claim and termed it fake news. @Ashok6510 later replied to Rajasthan police that he has deleted his tweet.\n\nHowever, despite taking down his tweet, @Ashok6510retweeted the OpIndia article discrediting Rajasthan police\u2019s statement. He has also retweeted other tweets that targeted Rajasthan Police.\n\nOpIndia cited two Dainik Bhaskar reports \u2013 1 and 2 \u2013 of a similar incident from December. This was picked up by other social media users as well. The media outlet later, however, missed the tweet by @Ashok6510 where he stated that he had deleted his original tweet. A Twitter user also posted a screencast of @Ashok6510\u2019s tweet.\n\nOpIndia later added an \u2018update\u2019 to its story, stating that while the video shared by @Ashok6510 was \u201cwrong\u201d, the narrative was correct. OpIndia blamed the Rajasthan police for not attaching the entire tweet by @Ashok6510, \u201cin the absence of which a real incident was being tagged as fake news\u201d.\n\nThe update does little to substantiate OpIndia\u2019s report as the media outlet itself did not \u2018fact-check\u2019 the video attached to the tweet, only the narrative.\n\nResults of the recent assembly elections have given rise to misinformation claiming violence in states where Congress came out victorious. Recently, a video from Gujarat was shared as an incident of rioting after the party won in Rajasthan. Many other such false claims (1, 2) suggested Pakistani flags and pro-Pakistan slogans were raised at Congress rallies. While Rajasthan police have been trying to prevent the spread of misinformation, OpIndia came out in support of a handle circulating fake news. The cycle of disinformation gains further momentum when media outlets themselves attempt to discredit the truth.", "lang": "en"}
