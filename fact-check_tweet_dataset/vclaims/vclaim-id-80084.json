And then if you look at African American women and Latinas, even less, and for doing the same work. You look at the fact that we have a real battle in this country around minimum wage and the need to increase minimum wage. We should understand minimum wage is a minimum standard of living, but federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, which averages $15,000 a year, and the majority of women are minimum wage workers.\"\n\nOne aspect of Harris\u2019 answer was problematic -- the part where she said that gender, racial and ethnic pay differences are comparisons for \"doing the same work.\" As we have often noted, wage gaps are not calculated on an apples-to-apples basis comparing the same jobs. Instead, they reflect overall pay for all jobs held by men and women, meaning that gender-based patterns of job selection -- whether due to discrimination or voluntary choices -- play a role in creating the pay gap.\n\nBut here we\u2019ll focus on a separate part of Harris\u2019 response -- the part where she said that \"the majority of women are minimum wage workers.\" This is incorrect.\n\nAccording to 2017 data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1,824,000 Americans were paid the minimum wage or less. (Sub-minimum-wage workers exist because there are a few exceptions to the federal minimum wage law, such as for students and tipped workers.) Of that pool of minimum wage workers, 678,000 were men and 1,146,000 were women.\n\nDuring 2017, the economy as a whole employed approximately 72 million women, meaning that 1.6% of all female workers were paid at or below the minimum wage. So it\u2019s incorrect to say that \"the majority of women are minimum wage workers.\"\n\nWhen we contacted the Harris campaign, spokesman Ian Sams described it as a \"slip of the tongue on live TV. She meant that a majority of minimum wage workers are women.\"\n\nThat statement would accurate. Using the numbers we cited above, women accounted for nearly 63% of minimum wage workers -- a clear majority. In fact, we previously rated a similar statement True.\n\nAs evidence that it was an accident, Sams sent us several other examples of Harris using the talking point more accurately.\n\nStill, PolitiFact\u2019s policy is to rate the statement made in the high-profile setting because the comment was seen by a large number of people.\n\nHarris said, \"The majority of women are minimum wage workers.\" That\u2019s not correct; minimum wage workers actually account for a tiny fraction of all working women. Harris said she meant to say that a majority of minimum wage workers are women, and that\u2019s the case -- 63% are women.\n\nWe rate her statement at the CNN town hall False.", "lang": "en"}
