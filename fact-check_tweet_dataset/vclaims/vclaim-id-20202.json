A viral meme is making that claim but it is not really true. Even though their situations aren't 100% comparable both of them got cut from their shows for what they did and both shows went on without them.\n\nThe claim was made in an image post (archived here) on Facebook where it was published on February 20, 2019.\n\nThe text that went with the image read:\n\nHere is the image contained in the post:\n\u2022 Smollett was not fired after faking a racist hate hoax\n\nAt the time the image was posted (February 20, 2019) Smollett indeed hadn't been fired yet. But two days later the producers of the show he was playing in announced he was being cut from the last episodes:\n\nJussie Smollett's character has been removed from the final two episodes of the upcoming season of Fox's \"Empire,\" the show's executives said Friday. \"The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our EMPIRE family for the past five years and we care about him deeply.\n\nSo that part of the image wasn't wrong at the time of posting (even though it is now, but that can't be held against it).\n\nRoseanne Barr's show Roseanne was indeed cancelled over a racist tweet she made (and later apologized for):\n\nHowever the show continued with the same cast and characters (minus Roseanne) under a new name (\"The Conners\") and with storylines carried over from Roseanne:\n\nThat show has not been cancelled yet (although there hasn't been word about renewal for a second season yet).\n\nOf course both incidents can't be compared on an equal basis: Roseanne was the titular character of the show and Smollett was just part of a larger cast. And Roseanne basically ran her mouth on Twitter while Smollett was charged with a felony after evidence of his actions was discovered:\n\nBut both of them were written out of the shows they were playing in and both shows continued (in one form or another) without them. No real evidence of privilege or getting away with things.", "lang": "en"}
