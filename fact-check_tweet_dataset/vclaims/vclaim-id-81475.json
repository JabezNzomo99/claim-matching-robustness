The image has gone viral with what appears to show the words shav vahini \u2018\u0936\u0935 \u0935\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0928\u0940\u2019 (hearse) written on it.\n\nThe image was sent to us by one of our readers alerting us about the photoshopped image going viral.\n\nWhen we searched for the image with the same text, we found that many had shared the same on Facebook as well as Twitter. The posts accused the Congress party of being grossly insensitive.\n\nA simple Google reverse image search showed a report by News18 about Digvijaya Singh not being a part of the poster on the truck. The image in the report does not show \u2018\u0936\u0935 \u0935\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0928\u0940\u2019 written on the truck.\n\nA closer look at both the images show that the location of the truck is the same and the truck has been parked at the same spot. The only difference in both the images is that they are taken from different angles. Also, the stole with the party symbol hanging from the side mirror of the truck is similar in both the images.\n\nThere is also a vent in the space where \u2018\u0936\u0935 \u0935\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0928\u0940\u2019 has been imposed, which is not at all visible in the photoshopped image.\n\nJan Jagran Yatra was launched by the Congress in Madhya Pradesh to counter the \"Jan Ashirwad Yatra\" by the Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. The Yatra by the Congress Party will take the same route as that of the \"Jan Ashirwad Yatra\". The state Congress working president Jitu Patwari is leading the yatra which will cover all the places covered by the CM's campaign.\n\nThe Jan Jagran Yatra is part of the Pol Khol Abhiyan as the state assembly elections are scheduled for November this year.", "lang": "en"}
