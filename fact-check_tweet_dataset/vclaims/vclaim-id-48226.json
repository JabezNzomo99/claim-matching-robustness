The claim is false; Malaysian immigration authorities said the video was taken during an annual safety drill in December 2019; the video corresponded with photos of the drill published in December 2019 by police and local officials.\n\nThe one-minute two-second video was published here on YouTube on April 9, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe video\u2019s Malay-language title translates to English as: \"Malaysian Workers in Singapore Rage To Return to malaysia!\u201d\n\nThe video description translates to English as: \u201cHappening at CIQ JB. The situation is out of control. Malaysian workers in Singapore are trying to return to Malaysia in droves.\u201d\n\n\u201cCIQ JB\u201d refers to a customs, immigration and quarantine (CIQ) office in the Malaysian city of Johor Bahru, which is often abbreviated as JB. The office is known as the Sultan Iskandar Building and is also a port of entry along the Malaysia-Singapore border.\n\nOn April 7, 2020, Singapore imposed a month-long lockdown, dubbed a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d, in a bid to curb the spread of COVID-19.\n\nWeeks earlier on March 17, 2020, Malaysia issued its own \u201cMovement Control Order\u201d banning citizens from travelling abroad. The move was expected to affect at least 300,000 Malaysian nationals who cross into Singapore daily and make up a substantial part of the city-state's workforce.\n\nThe video was also viewed more than 2,500 times after it was shared here on Twitter, and here and here on YouTube alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false. On April 10, 2020, Malaysia\u2019s Immigration Department shared the video alongside this statement on Facebook refuting the claim.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cImmigration Officials Deny Viral Video Linking to The Storming of Malaysians in Johor. Following the viral video, the purported incident of stampeding Malaysians that happened in the Sultan Iskandar Building (BSI) is not true. In a media statement, the Immigration Department of Malaysia (JIM) explained that the video was the atmosphere during a fire drill at BSI that was held on December 18, 2019.\n\n\u201cJIM seriously views the act of spreading the video done by irresponsible parties that intend to create anxiety among the society.\"\n\nThe Immigration Department also issued another statement on Facebook here on April 10, 2020, along with photos that it said showed \u201cthe situation during late night at April 9, 2020,\u201d at the Sultan Iskandar Building.\n\nAFP conducted a series of keyword searches on the Malaysian Immigration Department\u2019s social media channels and found this Instagram post published on December 19, 2019, about an \u201cevacuation exercise\u201d at the Sultan Iskandar Building.\n\nIt reads, in part: \u201cThe evacuation exercise program is an annual activity conducted to make sure relevant government agencies are always in a state of preparedness to face any possibilities.\u201d\n\nA further keyword search on Facebook found photo albums on the accounts of the Immigration Office\u2019s corporate communications team here and South Johor Bahru Police here, including photos of the safety drill, both dated December 19, 2019.\n\nSingapore\u2019s Immigration and Checkpoint Authority also issued this advisory on its Facebook page on December 17, 2019 about the planned safety drill, advising travellers to use an alternative port of entry for the duration of the exercise.", "lang": "en"}
