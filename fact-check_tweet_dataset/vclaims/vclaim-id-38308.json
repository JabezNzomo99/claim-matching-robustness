No, this is misleading. Videos falsely claims that doctors are recommending carbon filter masks as a way to protect families, although the FDA and CDC both concluded that they are not effective for children and are not recommended for home use. The videos are used to sell the masks to people concerned about the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe claim originated from a post (archived here) where it was published on Facebook by Leafy Clover on February 8, 2020. The text before the video reads:\n\nUsers on Facebook saw this post with the embedded video:\n\nCertain masks can prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus - but only in limited ways if used properly in certain environments. The video being pushed by Leafy Clover falsely claims that, \"Doctors recommend carbon filter face masks\" like the ones being sold by a company called Leafy Clover, on sale for $13.97 each. The video, complete with ominous music and alarming hospital scenes, claims the new masks are in \"high demand\" and people who want to safeguard their families should order \"while supplies last!\"\n\nLeafy Clover is not, of course, the only company seeking to capitalize on coronavirus fears. But its video is gaining traction on Facebook, where it has received nearly three million views.\n\nStill, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say only health care workers or people in close proximity to someone who is infected need to wear a facemask. In those cases, they recommend the N95 Respirator, which when worn tightly and properly fitted and sealed has the ability to filter out 95% of airborne particles.\n\nHere are the CDC's guidelines for helping prevent contacting or spreading the virus:\n\nExperts seem to agree wearing a cheap or ill-fitting mask is unnecessary and could lead to a false sense of security, as well as to more face-touching, which could spread germs. For how to dispose of appropriate masks after use, read here.\n\nOn Saturday, reports said the first U.S. death from the novel coronavirus was reported in Washington state, with quick travel restrictions and warnings following from President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Pence is in charge of the administration's coronavirus response:\n\nOther fact checks by Lead Stories concerning coronavirus misinformation include:\n\u2022 Fact Check: San Diego Lab Says It Has Created Coronavirus Vaccine In Three Hours\n\u2022 Fact Check: CDC Did NOT Recommend Men Shave Their Beards To Protect Against Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: Florida Man NOT Arrested For Robbery Using Cough As A Weapon\n\u2022 Fact Check: Lysol Products Can Kill Older Strains Of Coronavirus, But Tests Have NOT Scientifically Proven They Kill Novel Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: Hair Weaves And Lace Front Wigs Made In China NOT Likely To Contain Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: Scientists Did NOT Discover That Cocaine Kills Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: NO Evidence Coronavirus Is Bioweapon Leaked From Wuhan Lab\n\u2022 Fake News: Six Coronavirus Cases NOT Confirmed In Wichita, Kansas (Or Several Other U.S. Cities)\n\u2022 Fake News: 20 Million Chinese Did NOT Convert To Islam, And It Was NOT Proven That Coronavirus Epidemic Did Not Afflict Muslims\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Evidence To Support Claim From Bioweapons Expert Who Says Coronavirus Is Biological Warfare Weapon\n\u2022 Fake News: Popping Bubble Wrap Does NOT Expose People To Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fake News: Data From Windy.com Does NOT Show Massive Release Of Sulfur Dioxide Gas Near Wuhan\n\u2022 Fake News: Latest Research Published By Chinese Scientists Did NOT Say Coronavirus Will Render Most Male Patients Infertile\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Proof That High-Rise Buildings Have Become Human Incinerators To Combat Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fake News: Residential Building NOT In Wuhan, NOT Set Ablaze To Control Coronavirus Spread", "lang": "en"}
