The two viruses are not the same.\n\nFacebook users are spreading a photo of a vaccine for canine coronavirus to wrongly suggest that a vaccine exists for the novel coronavirus now infecting humans around the world.\n\n\u201cNow this was 2001 tell me why 19 years later they say there is no vaccine,\u201d text in the viral image reads.\n\nThe image was shared in various corners of Facebook, including in a group dedicated to the QAnon conspiracy theory. One user\u2019s popular post claimed that a \u201cCORONA VIRUS VACCINE EXIST SINCE 2001\u2033 and \u201cWE ARE BEING PLAYED BY THOSE ON THE TOP.\u201d\n\nBut the vaccine label in the photo clearly states \u201cCanine Coronavirus Vaccine.\u201d\n\nLike other instances of misinformation that have appeared since the outbreak began, the posts advance a false claim that centers on the term \u201ccoronavirus.\u201d The term refers to a family of viruses, but they\u2019re not all the same.\n\nThe novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 which causes COVID-19 \u2014 was first reported in China in late 2019.\n\nThe product in the viral photo is Nobivac 1-Cv, a vaccine sold by a subsidiary of Merck & Co. It protects dogs from the canine coronavirus, or CCV, a virus that typically causes a mild gastroenteritis, or inflammation in the intestines, in infected dogs. It was first identified in 1971.\n\nAs we wrote when debunking similar posts dealing with a vaccine for cows, experts say it is not safe for humans to attempt to vaccinate themselves with animal vaccines.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
