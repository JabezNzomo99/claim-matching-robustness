He added, \u201cof course there\u2019s a range of possible scenarios around those directions, which could possibly include a technical recession\u201d.\n\nIn the same month, the Treasury said: \u201cBritain\u2019s economy would be tipped into a year-long recession, with at least 500,000 jobs lost and GDP around 3.6% lower, following a vote to leave the EU, new Treasury analysis launched today by the Prime Minister and Chancellor shows.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecession\u201d is a general term for a decline in economic growth over a period of at least a few months. A technical recession is two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth.\n\nGDP has actually grown in every quarter since the Brexit vote in June 2016. From July to September 2016, it grew by 0.5% compared to the previous quarter. In the full year since June 2016, GDP grew by 1.7%. Other EU economies have grown faster over that period.\n\nGDP has since grown by an estimated 0.4% from July to September this year.\n\nThere were also 317,000 more people in employment from June to August this year, compared with the same period in 2016.\n\nUnemployment was at 4.9% in June 2016, rising to 5% in July. It has since steadily fallen to 4.3%, which is the lowest level since 1975.", "lang": "en"}
