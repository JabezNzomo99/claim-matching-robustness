A reverse image search reveals the images were taken in the aftermath of Typhoon Urduja which hit parts of central Visayas, including Boracay, in December 2017. This was a year and a half into President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s term.\n\nThe earliest copy of the photo showing a sewer and some sacks unearthed on the island\u2019s sandy shore is a February 2018 post by FB page Hidden Truth PH. It bore the caption, \u201cThis photo was taken last December of 2017 (Typhoon Urduja).\u201d\n\nThe other image featuring a muddy beachfront filled with trash was taken by a netizen also during Urduja. It was used by Philstar.com and News5 in their Dec. 18, 2017 reports.\n\nThe two pictures were part of a collage uploaded on July 2 and 3, juxtaposing the island under \u201cdisente (decent) time,\u201d or during the past administration, with its state during \u201cbastos (rude) time\u201d or during Duterte\u2019s leadership.\n\nThe earliest traceable copies online of the \u201cbastos time\u201d photos were uploaded by the DDS Drei Natabio page on April 14. In its caption, the post claimed the images showing a spotless shore of Boracay were taken during the quarantine period amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe \u201cdisente time\u201d label appears to have taken off from a statement made by actress Sharon Cuneta in her June 29 Instagram Live video, where she said if Vice President Leni Robredo took over after Duterte, it \u201cmight restore decency for most of us.\u201d Robredo is a party-mate of Aquino.\n\nThree other misleading \u201cdisente-bastos time\u201d comparisons were fact-checked by VERA Files this week.
