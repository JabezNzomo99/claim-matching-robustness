Versions of the story have been circulating online since the early 2000s.\n\nObama, the 44th president, met with Native American leaders on numerous occasions during his tenure in the Oval Office. (RELATED: Did Obama Award The Presidential Medal Of Freedom To Clinton, Cosby, Weiner And Weinstein?)\n\nThe Facebook post, which features a picture from Obama\u2019s 2008 visit with the Crow Nation in Montana, alleges that upstate New York tribal leaders bestowed upon Obama a disparaging Native American name after he gave a speech to a \u201cmajor gathering of the American Indian Nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cA reporter later asked the group of chiefs how they came to select the new name,\u201d reads the Facebook post. \u201cThey explained that \u2018Walking Eagle\u2019 is the name given to a bird so full of sh*t it can no longer fly.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that Obama ever received that name from Native American tribal leaders. An internet search turned up no credible sources reporting the events described in the Facebook post. There does not appear to be any federally-recognized tribal organization named \u201cAmerican Indian Nation\u201d either, according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs website.\n\nOther political figures, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former President George W. Bush and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, have been the subject of similar internet stories over the years.\n\nObama did receive a Native American name in 2008, but it was not derogatory in nature. The Crow Nation dubbed him \u201cOne Who Helps People Throughout the Land\u201d during an adoption ceremony into the tribe, according to The New York Times.", "lang": "en"}
