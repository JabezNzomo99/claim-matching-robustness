No, that's not true, he didn't say that. A twisted quote appeared in the headline of an article on a website that habitually takes bits and pieces of real news and then adds fake facts in their own headlines to make them more clickbait-worthy.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by YourNewsWire on June 22, 2018 titled \"Pope Francis: US Must Open Borders To 'As Many Migrants As Possible'\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nPope Francis has called for open borders in the United States, urging authorities to take in as many refugees as they can, and has provided the examples of Germany and Sweden as models for the US to follow. \"Each country must do this with the virtue of government, which is prudence, and take in as many refugees as it can, as many as it can integrate, educate, give jobs to,\" the Pope told reporters aboard his papal plane after a trip to Geneva, Switzerland. Pope Francis praised both Germany and Sweden for being model societies and \"most generous\" in taking in migrants, and said all governments should follow their example and take in as many refugees as their countries can handle.\n\nAs the introduction of the article makes clear (and the original New York Times article it refers to as well) the Pope was talking about \"refugees\", not \"migrants\". Calling for countries to help as many people fleeing war and persecution as possible is quite different from calling for the opening of all borders and letting anyone in who wants to come.\n\nThe summary of the article on social media also mentioned \"unchecked immigration\" along with the nations of Germany and Sweden, all of which the Pope never mentioned.\n\nThe only context in which the Pope praised countries for being \"most generous\" in the New York Times article was this one:\n\nYourNewsWire has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt. Their Facebook page \"The People's Voice\" recently lost its verification checkmark according to a report from MMFA.\n\nThe Terms of Use of the site also make it clear they don't really stand behind the accuracy of any of their reporting:\n\nThe site was profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.\n\nWe wrote about yournewswire.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Pope Francis Did NOT Give Pedophile Priest Diplomatic Immunity To Avoid Prison\n\u2022 Fake News: IG Report Did NOT Say Hillary Clinton Ran Child Sex Ring\n\u2022 Fake News: President Macron Did NOT Knowingly Grant ISIS Chief Political Asylum In France\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Evidence Anthony Bourdain Was Killed By Clinton Operatives\n\u2022 Fake News: Melinda Gates Did NOT Say We Must Discriminate Against All White People", "lang": "en"}
