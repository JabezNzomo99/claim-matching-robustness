Joe Biden Doesn't Understand the Threat. To Stop China, You Have to Stop Joe Biden.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook).\n\nWe are going to focus on the first part of that caption.\n\nWhen asked to back up the claim, America First Action spokesperson Kelly Sadler pointed to a January 30, 2020, report from the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank.\n\nThe report argues the United States\u2019 trade deficit with China has cost Americans millions of jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. It estimates 88,900 Wisconsin jobs were displaced due to the \"goods trade deficit with China\" from 2001 to 2018.\n\nThe report claims the growing trade deficit over the 17-year period \"was responsible for the loss of 3.7 million U.S. jobs,\" including 2.8 million manufacturing jobs.\n\nThe deficit is substantial. In 2019 alone, the U.S. imported $345 billion more in goods from China than it exported.\n\nAnd the manufacturing climate has certainly changed in the last two decades.\n\nAn analysis of Census data by PolitiFact found that the U.S. lost more than 60,000 factories from 2001 to 2017.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Federal Reserve Economic data shows the number of employees in manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin decreased from about 584,400 in January 2001 to around 483,400 in January 2020.\n\nSo Wisconsin did lose about 100,000 manufacturing jobs since 2001, but is it reasonable to attribute that all to China?\n\nChina has had a significant negative effect on Wisconsin\u2019s manufacturing workforce, but that doesn\u2019t mean it is the only factor in job loss.\n\nDavid Hummels, a professor of economics at Purdue University, said trade deficits do not \"cause\" job losses. Instead, he pointed to specialization, saying trade can cause particular sectors of the economy to expand or contract.\n\nHe noted people tend to buy things that have a lower cost and higher quality. Since production in certain industries tends to be cheaper in China, U.S.-based manufacturers are sometimes left out of the competition.\n\nHummels also said that while some changes in unemployment can be attributed to China, technological changes also influence employment rates.\n\nMichael Hicks, a professor of economics at Ball State University, echoed this idea. Hicks noted Wisconsin\u2019s factory employment rate rose after 2010, even as the U.S.\u2019s trade deficit with China continued to increase.\n\nHicks led a 2017 study that found productivity increases had resulted in 88 percent of job losses in manufacturing in the United States. The study estimated trade accounted for just 13.4% of losses between 2000 and 2010.\n\nWhile Wisconsin\u2019s factory employment shrank from 2001 to 2018, non-factory employment rose by more than 400,000, he noted in an email.\n\n\"If you are going to blame China for the lost factory jobs, you need to also credit them with the gain of 409,000 non-factory jobs,\" he said.\n\nKurt Bauer, president of industry trade group Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, attributed the loss of Wisconsin manufacturing jobs to trade, as well as demographics, in a fall 2019 magazine column\n\nBauer claimed that 81% of WMC members said they are having trouble finding workers \"because there are simply fewer people of working age in Wisconsin.\"\n\n\"I would argue that demographics may be impacting job numbers just as much as economic factors,\" he wrote in the column.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say China had no role, of course.\n\n\"It is reasonable to say that trade with China, along with changes in mechanization and automation, led to a pretty sharp contraction in manufacturing employment in the U.S. since 2000,\" said Hummels, the professor from Purdue.\n\nAmerica First Action on Facebook said China has cost Wisconsin almost 90,000 jobs.\n\nThe state has in fact lost around 90,000 manufacturing jobs since the early 2000s. While this shift in the number of jobs can be partially attributed to the trade deficit with China, experts say that is not the only factor.\n\nOur definition of Mostly False is \"the statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\"", "lang": "en"}
