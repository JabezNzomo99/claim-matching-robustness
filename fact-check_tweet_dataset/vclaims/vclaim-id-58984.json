It was titled, \u201cKilalanin Ang Mga Nasuhulan Na Congressman Ng ABS-CBN, Php 200M Pala Ang Suhol Para Paboran Ang Kapamilya (Get to know the congressmen bribed by ABS-CBN. The bribe was P200 million to vote in favor of the network.)\n\nThe video uploaded by PH BREAKING NEWS was a clip from a live stream by blogger \u201cBanat By\u201d on July 12. House Deputy Speaker Luis Raymund Villafuerte and Carlos Munda, another blogger, were also in the live stream. The alleged bribe was mentioned twice in the video posted by PH BREAKING NEWS.\n\nIt was first brought up by Munda at the 2:27 mark. In passing, Munda said he thinks it's possible for ABS-CBN to give bribes since it's a big company. He then went on to ask Villafuerte a question about Malaca\u00f1ang's involvement in the issue.\n\nThe next mention of the bribe was around the 6-minute mark when Munda read a comment from one of their listeners asking if Congress is investigating ACT-CIS representative Eric Yap\u2019s allegation that an \u201cemissary of ABS-CBN\u201d tried to bribe him with P200 million to vote for the renewal of the network\u2019s franchise.\n\nVillafuerte responded, \u201cI think discussion po 'yan ni Congressman [Jose Antonio Sy-] Alvarado. Pero (But) I think it\u2019s a matter that has to be discussed also at the right time.\u201d No other mention of the alleged bribe was made afterwards.\n\nYap, who made the claim about a bribery a day before lawmakers rejected ABS-CBN\u2019s franchise renewal, has also clarified that he allegedly received the phone call two weeks prior but he chose not to disclose it at that time because even he wasn\u2019t sure that the person on the other line was really from ABS-CBN.\n\n\u201cDid I release this to the media? No, because I am not sure if the person is really ABS-CBN\u2019s emissary, and it is unfair that ABS-CBN\u2019s name is placed in jeopardy and also unfair to the proceedings of the joint committee that is discussing the franchise issue,\u201d the Inquirer quoted Yap as saying.", "lang": "en"}
