But is the situation that grim that even the world\u2019s biggest business tycoons are despondent and now thinking only in terms of life and death?\n\nIf a post going viral on social media is to be believed, English teacher-turned-billionaire Jack Ma of Alibaba Group has said that 2020 is not the year of thinking about your dreams or plans, but just to ensure that you stay alive. The so-called quote, along with Ma\u2019s picture, is being widely shared on Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral quote has nothing to do with Ma. There is no record that the Chinese business magnate has said something like that.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nThe quote, viral on Facebook and Twitter, reads: \u201cFor people in business, 2020 is really just a year for staying alive. Don\u2019t even talk about your dreams or plans. Just make sure you stay alive. If you can stay alive, then you would have made a profit already.\u201d It is attributed to \u201cJack Ma, Alibaba Group\u201d.\n\nFormer Indian MP Shahid Siddiqui and Pakistan-based political party PTI\u2019s central information secretary Ahmed Jawad were among people who fell for the viral claim and shared it.\n\nSearching Google using keywords from the statement attributed to Ma, we found that the same claim was being shared in some other countries too. A fact-check organisation from Indonesia has debunked it through an official quote from Alibaba Group.\n\nDian Safitri, Alibaba Group\u2019s director of corporate affairs for Indonesia, clarified to Indonesian fact-checker \u201cTempFakta Cek Team\u201d that the quote about 2020 being just a year for staying alive did not come from Ma. Dian said, \u201cThere is no record that Jack Ma ever delivered the message.\u201d\n\nSearching the Internet for any statement from Ma on the coronavirus crisis, we came across a tweet by Alibaba Group where he can be seen speaking about the need for international cooperation in fighting the pandemic.\n\nLast month, while attending a webinar with medical practitioners from Africa and China, Ma had said, \u201cThe virus does not distinguish between race and people. The virus does not need a passport. The virus tells us no matter how strong a country appears to be, we are all weak and fragile in front of this disaster.\u201d\n\nOne can listen to his full statement here.\n\nJack Ma joined Twitter only on March 16. In his first tweet, he posted pictures of the first shipment of masks and coronavirus test kits to the United States from Shanghai.\n\nThe Jack Ma Foundation is shipping medical supplies to more than 150 countries. The donations for this cause are being made jointly by Jack Ma Foundation and Alibaba Foundation.\n\nViral quote attributed to Ratan Tata too\n\nThe same quote was earlier attributed to industrialist and philanthropist Ratan Tata too. It went so viral that Tata himself issued a denial. Aaj Tak had also debunked the claim.", "lang": "en"}
