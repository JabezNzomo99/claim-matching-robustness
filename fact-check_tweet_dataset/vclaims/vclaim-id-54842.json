A day later, he said he was being \u201csarcastic.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no clear indication in his remarks that Trump was joking, either in his initial comment or when he returned to the topic later in the briefing. But we\u2019ll leave it for readers to judge.\n\nAt the briefing, William Bryan, who leads the science and technology directorate at the Department of Homeland Security, addressed the media about recent DHS research on how well the coronavirus survives on nonporous surfaces in heat, humidity and sunlight. Bryan said the \u201cvirus dies the quickest in the presence of direct sunlight\u201d and also talked about the testing of disinfectants that quickly kill the virus on surfaces.\n\nTrump then spoke about the powers of sunlight and disinfectant, turning at times to address Bryan.\n\nTrump, April 23: A question that probably some of you are thinking of if you\u2019re totally into that world, which I find to be very interesting. So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous, whether it\u2019s ultraviolet or just very powerful light, and I think you said that hasn\u2019t been checked, but you\u2019re going to test it. And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you\u2019re going to test that too. Sounds interesting, right? And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it\u2019d be interesting to check that. So that you\u2019re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me. So, we\u2019ll see, but the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute. That\u2019s pretty powerful.\n\nHere, Bryan responded to a reporter\u2019s question about injecting a cleaner into the body, and Trump backtracked on his previous speculation about an \u201cinjection\u201d:\n\nABC News chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl, April 23: The president mentioned the idea of a cleaner, bleach and isopropyl alcohol emerging. There\u2019s no scenario where that could be injected into a person, is there? Bryan: No, I\u2019m here to talk about the finds that we had in the study. We don\u2019t do that within that lab at our labs. Trump: It wouldn\u2019t be through injection. We\u2019re talking about through almost a cleaning, sterilization of an area. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn\u2019t work. But it certainly has a big effect if it\u2019s on a stationary object.\n\nLater in the briefing, Trump suggested applying \u201clight and heat to cure,\u201d and Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, responded to Trump\u2019s question by saying she hasn\u2019t heard of heat or light \u201cas a treatment.\u201d\n\nTrump, April 23: I would like you to speak to the medical doctors to see if there\u2019s any way that you can apply light and heat to cure. You know \u2014 if you could. And maybe you can, maybe you can\u2019t. Again, I say, maybe you can, maybe you can\u2019t. I\u2019m not a doctor. But I\u2019m like a person that has a good you know what. Deborah, have you ever heard of that? The heat and the light, relative to certain viruses, yes, but relative to this virus? Birx: Not as a treatment. I mean, certainly fever is a good thing. When you have a fever, it helps your body respond. But not as \u2014 I\u2019ve not seen heat or light \u2026 Trump: I think it\u2019s a great thing to look at. I mean, you know. Okay?\n\nThe Day After the Briefing\n\nThe following morning, after numerous press reports cited experts calling the injection or ingestion of disinfectants dangerous, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany issued a statement claiming Trump\u2019s words had been taken \u201cout of context.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has repeatedly said that Americans should consult with medical doctors regarding coronavirus treatment, a point that he emphasized again during yesterday\u2019s briefing,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cLeave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines.\u201d\n\nThat morning, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams also issued this warning via Twitter, \u201cA reminder to all Americans- PLEASE always talk to your health provider first before administering any treatment/ medication to yourself or a loved one. Your safety is paramount, and doctors and nurses are have years of training to recommend what\u2019s safe and effective.\u201d\n\nLater in the day, Trump claimed his comments the previous day were \u201csarcastic.\u201d\n\nReporter, April 24: Can you clarify your comments about injections of disinfectant? Trump: No, I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you, just to see what would happen. Now, disinfectant, or doing this, maybe on the hands, would work. And I was asking the question of the gentleman who was there yesterday \u2014 Bill \u2014 because when they say that something will last three or four hours or six hours, but if the sun is out or if they use disinfectant, it goes away in less than a minute. Did you hear about this yesterday? But I was asking a sarcastic \u2014 and a very sarcastic question \u2014 to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside. But it does kill it and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to the reporters. Okay. Reporter: But you were asking your medical experts to look into it. Trump: Uh, no, no, no, no. Reporter: Were you being sarcastic with them? Trump: To look into whether or not sun and disinfectant on the hands, but whether or not sun can help us because, I mean, he came in yesterday and he said they\u2019ve done a big study. This is a study. This isn\u2019t where he hasn\u2019t done it. This is where they\u2019ve come in with a final report that sun has a massive impact, negatively, on this vir\u2013 in other words, it does not live well with humidity, and it doesn\u2019t live well with sun \u2014 sunlight \u2014 heat. It doesn\u2019t live well with heat and sun and disinfectant. And that\u2019s what I brought out. And I thought it was clear. Okay. Anything else?\n\nAlthough Trump said he told Bryan \u201cto look into whether or not sun and disinfectant on the hands \u2026 can help us,\u201d that is not what the video shows. At the briefing, Trump didn\u2019t say anything to Bryan about hands.\n\nTurning to Bryan, Trump said at the briefing, \u201cAnd then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it\u2019d be interesting to check that.\u201d\n\nAgain, we didn\u2019t detect any sarcasm \u2013 and we aren\u2019t alone in that \u2013 but since sarcasm is subjective, we\u2019ll leave it to readers to make up their own minds about the president\u2019s intent.\n\nFactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
