Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Photo of a road in bad condition in BJP governed Varanasi. Fact: It is an old photo which was taken in New Delhi. The photo is not related to Varanasi (UP). Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nIt was found that the same photo with a similar claim is on the internet at least from October 2018. But, when the image was run through Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found to be uploaded by multiple users in the context of Delhi in January 2020. Some of those posts can be found here and here.\n\nWhen searched with relevant keywords, other photos related to the same location were found to be posted by a user in July 2018. The same shops and surroundings can be found in the photos. The user mentions that the photos were taken at Ratiya Marg, Sangam Vihar in New Delhi. Also, the shop address in one of the photos mentions that it is in New Delhi. The same can be also confirmed on Google Maps.\n\nTo sum it up, an old photo of a road in New Delhi which is in a bad condition is falsely shared as Varanasi (UP) road, which is ruled by the BJP.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
