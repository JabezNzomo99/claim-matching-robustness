Trey Gowdy, a Republican from South Carolina. \"But pay attention folks, there\u2019s much more going on here than meets the eye.\"\n\nThe missive questions why, when President Donald Trump is up for re-election, the \"stock market tumbles, companies are laying off employees, everything is closed and canceled, CEO\u2019s of giant companies are resigning and indictments are coming.\"\n\n\"There is something larger going on here driving this sudden outbreak right after Trump beats an impeachment,\" it says. \"Especially the fact that it (corona virus) originated in China who we are in a global trade war with brought on by Trump.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

We have enough going on in our country right now without propagating misinformation.\"\n\nGowdy has spoken publicly about the coronavirus, including recently saying that China needs to be held accountable for the global pandemic. But he didn\u2019t float the conspiracy theory that social media posts are claiming.", "lang": "en"}
