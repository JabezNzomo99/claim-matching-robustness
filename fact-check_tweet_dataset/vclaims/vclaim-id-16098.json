The same applies to 23% of its doctors and 17% of all doctors and nurses (\u2018clinical staff\u2019).\n\nAn article from the Health Service Journal had similar findings earlier this year, and also reported nearly a quarter of research staff at Great Ormond Street were citizens of other EU countries. We haven\u2019t been able to back this up, so we\u2019re getting in touch with the publication.\n\nHow does this compare nationally?\n\nIn June 2016 5% of all NHS FTE staff in England were from the EU, or almost 56,000 people. In London it was much higher at 11% or just over 19,000.\n\nHowever, all these figures come with a health warning.\n\nNHS staff report their own nationality and this can range from the country of their birth to the country they have most cultural affinity with. NHS Digital, which publishes the information, also warns that nearly 100,000 NHS staff records don\u2019t contain useful data on nationality because staff either aren\u2019t asked to provide it or choose not to.\n\nWe received more recent data from NHS Digital on the proportion of staff at Great Ormond Street Hospital who reported they were from other EU countries.\n\nIn June 2016 14% of all staff at the hospital were from other EU countries. This is the proportion of individual people employed rather than FTE however. The same was true for 23% of doctors and 18% of all clinical staff (doctors, nurses and health visitors).", "lang": "en"}
