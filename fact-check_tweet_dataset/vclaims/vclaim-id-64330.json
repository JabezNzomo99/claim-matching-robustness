Scott Walker put property tax relief near the top of his bragging list.\n\n \n\n \"We\u2019ve seen property taxes go down for the first time in 12 years on a median valued home,\" Walker said during the WISN-TV debate at the Marquette University Law School.\n\n \n\n Is his claim on the money?\n\n \n\n Walker\u2019s office pointed to the annual estimates from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Those reports show an upward trend in the property tax bill for a median-valued home, from 2000 to 2010. Some years it was close to flat; the year-to-year increases ranged from a tiny 0.1 percent to 4.6 percent.\n\n \n\n This leads us to 2011, the first year under Walker and his budget\u2019s tight limits on local property tax increases. Those caps included a virtual freeze on the ability of local governments to increase the tax levy.\n\n \n\n In preliminary estimates during the budget process, the Fiscal Bureau projected the median residential bill would go up. But Walker\u2019s administration -- using actual figures reported by schools and municipal governments -- announced in April 2012 that the bill for a median-priced home in 2011 saw a 0.4 percent drop.\n\n \n\n \n\n To be sure, that doesn\u2019t mean every homeowner\u2019s bill went down, just that a median-valued home would see a small drop. The approach is simply a way of roughly measuring year-to-year changes.\n\n \n\n While Walker\u2019s claim appears on target, the overall amount of property taxes collected in the state will likely go up a bit, not down.\n\n \n\n The reason: Walker is using a typical residential home, not looking at the total of all residential collections, and his figures does not include commercial and agricultural property.\n\n \n\n The Fiscal Bureau is still checking the administration\u2019s math and fine-tuning the numbers, but so far the data clearly supports a decrease, said Fred Ammerman, the Fiscal Bureau\u2019s property tax program supervisor.\n\n \n\n So, the fact the numbers are not final adds a note of caution to the mix.\n\n \n\n But the figure Walker cited is a commonly used benchmark that last dropped from 1999 to 2000. And he made it clear he was talking about just residential property.\n\n \n\n We rate Walker\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
