Since then it\u2019s either flatlined, risen slightly, or returned to roughly the same value\u2014it depends on what you include.\n\nReally there are three questions that need answering here. First, what\u2019s happened to the total budget for the Scottish government? Second, what\u2019s happened to the bits of the budget that the Scottish government actually has control over? Third, how much public money gets spent on Scotland overall?\n\nThe Scottish government\u2019s overall budget is roughly the same now as it was in 2010-11, when the Coalition government took power in Westminster.\n\nIts value rose again between 2013-14 and 2014-15. Since then the total annual budget has been worth roughly the same as it was in 2010-11, after accounting for inflation.\n\nBut the Scottish government doesn\u2019t have direct control over where all this money is spent. It makes direct choices about the money that\u2019s spent by government departments (what\u2019s called \u2018DEL\u2019), but there are other bits of spending that it doesn\u2019t have the same control over, like welfare payments and pension schemes (called \u2018AME\u2019).\n\nThe Scottish government\u2019s \u2018discretionary budget\u2019\u2014the bit it actually has control over\u2014is smaller than it was in 2010/11.\n\nHow much smaller you say it is depends on what you include in the \u2018discretionary\u2019 budget.\n\nThe Scottish government says that decisions made in Westminster have cut its discretionary spending budget by 7.4% between 2010-11 and 2017-18.\n\nThe Fraser of Allander Institute, an economic think tank based in the University of Strathclyde, counts the \u2018discretionary budget\u2019 differently. It says that the Scottish government\u2019s discretionary budget from Westminster has fallen by about 5% over the same period.\n\nThat\u2019s because the institute also includes the revenue from non-domestic rates\u2014a kind of tax on businesses\u2014and money that\u2019s been given to it by Westminster to lend to Scottish businesses (which will eventually have to be paid back).\n\nThat\u2019s not quite the end of the story. Constitutional reforms have given the Scottish government new powers to borrow money. Once this and some financial adjustments have been taken into account, the Scottish government says it saw a 5.8% reduction in its spending power from 2010-11 to 2017-18. The Fraser of Allander Institute prefers a figure of 3.8% on that basis.\n\nThe Scottish government\u2019s budget doesn\u2019t include all the money that\u2019s notionally spent on Scottish people.\n\nThe government\u2019s estimate for all public expenditure in Scotland includes much more than the Scottish government\u2019s budget. It also counts things like Scotland\u2019s notional share of UK defence spending, or interest payments on the national debt.\n\nOverall, the government estimates that the real value of public spending per person in Scotland was about 4% lower in 2015-16 than in 2010-11.", "lang": "en"}
