{"title": "\u2018Our Only Hope Remains Up In The Sky\u2019 \u2013 Did Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte Say This About Coronavirus?", "subtitle": "", "author": "checkyourfact.com", "date": "2020-03-25T01:49:19.000Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-61186", "url": "http://checkyourfact.com/2020/03/24/fact-check-giuseppe-conte-coronavirus-lost-control-only-hope-sky/", "vclaim": "An image shared on Facebook claims Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Italy has \u201clost control\u201d of the new coronavirus and the country\u2019s \u201conly hope remains up in the Sky, God rescue your people.\u201d\n\nThere is no record of Conte making the statement. The Brazilian president \u2013 not Conte \u2013 is pictured in the post.\n\nAt press time, Italy has reported over 69,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 6,820 deaths, surpassing China as the country with the highest death toll, according to the Johns Hopkins University live map. The New York Times and others have labeled the country as the new epicenter of the global coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe have lost control, we have killed the epidemic physically and mentally,\u201d a viral March 22 post credits Conte with saying. \u201cCan\u2019t understand what more we can do, all solutions are exhausted on ground. Our only hope remains up in the Sky, God rescue your people.\u201d\n\nBut there is no evidence that Conte ever actually said these words. No credible source could be found to corroborate the quote, and it appears nowhere on his social media accounts. Its message seemingly contradicts the tone of statements Conte has previously made about the pandemic.\n\n\u201c159 years ago the unification of Italy was proclaimed. Since then, our country has faced a thousand difficulties, world wars, the fascist regime,\u201d reads a translated tweet from Conte. \u201cBut the Italians, with pride and determination, have always been able to get up and start again. With your head held high.\u201d\n\nThe photo, taken by Sergio Lima for the news website Poder360, actually shows Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro during an emotional speech at a worship service in December 2019. He teared up when recalling his experience getting stabbed and almost killed in a September 2019 attack, according to a translation of the Poder360 article.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
