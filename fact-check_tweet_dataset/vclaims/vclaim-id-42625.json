In fact, Mudiay tweeted March 12 that he tested negative.\n\n\u201cFirstly, thanks to everyone for the positive words. Yesterday I got tested for the Covid-19 virus. By God\u2019s grace it came out negative,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cDespite my teammates and I taking necessary precautions, it didn\u2019t turn out as expected. To my guys @spidadmitchell @rudygobert27, God speed.\u201d\n\nThe Jazz tested all its traveling players and personnel as a precaution after Gobert reportedly touched teammates and their belongings in the locker room, according to CBS Sports. On March 12, guard Donovan Mitchell confirmed that he too had tested positive for COVID-19. Mitchell was the only other person in the Jazz\u2019s traveling party to test positive, per The Athletic reporter Shams Charania.\n\n\u201cSources: Donovan Mitchell was the only Jazz player/personnel to test positive for coronavirus out of 58 tests administered on Wednesday night,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cRemaining tests came back negative.\u201d\n\nAt least seven NBA players have tested positive for COVID-19, including Brooklyn Nets player Kevin Durant and Detroit Pistons player Christian Wood, according to the Los Angeles Times. The Los Angeles Lakers players were tested for the virus outside their practice facility on March 18, per CBS Sports, and results have not yet come in at the time of publication.\n\nThe Utah Jazz did not respond to a request for comment.", "lang": "en"}
