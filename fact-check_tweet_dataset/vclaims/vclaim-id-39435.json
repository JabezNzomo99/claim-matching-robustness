Both posts garnered at least 1,700 reactions, 1,200 comments, and 400 shares combined as of October 19.\n\n\"I categorically deny issuing these statements,\" Alejano told Rappler. The congressman also said he \"cannot imagine himself joking [about it] or saying it.\"\n\nA Google search of the quotes leads to web entries containing parts of the quotes and Facebook pages that have shared the memes. There are also no news reports containing the quotes.\n\nIn July, there was also a fabricated quote attributed to the lawmaker. The quote reads, \"Wala tayong mapapala sa mga OFW, nabayaran na ang kaluluwa nila kay Duterte.\" Alejano called it \"fake news.\"\n\n\"I also hope that while we are in the heat of the upcoming elections, let us not play dirty. Politics is not dirty. People who use negative propaganda against political opponents are the ones making politics dirty,\" said Alejano to Rappler.\n\nMga Balitang Pinas also posted a photo supposedly of Typhoon Ompong (Mangkhut) relief operations when, in fact, the photo was taken in 2015 during relief operations for Typhoon Lando (Koppu). \u2013 Miguel Imperial/Rappler.com\n\nIf you suspect a Facebook page, group, account, a website, or an article is spreading false information, let Rappler know by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
