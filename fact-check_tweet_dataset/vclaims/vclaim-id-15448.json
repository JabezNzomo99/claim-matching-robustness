The report further claims that Gandhi was addressing an election rally in Bundi, Rajasthan, when he made the statement. Archived version of the Facebook post can be accessed here.\n\nThe clip has been shared on Facebook with a caption which reads, \"Vaishya brothers, look, how this pappu (Rahul Gandhi) who called Modiji a thief has now called the entire baniya community a thief. He himself has garnered unfathomable fortune by loot and thinks everyone in this country is a thief. Just wait and watch how baniyas of India will teach him a lesson him a lesson this time.\"\n\nBOOM tried to look for the news reports carrying the statement made by Rahul Gandhi on the particular community. However, we could not find any. The fact that the newspaper's name doesn't find a mention anywhere in the report makes the claim all the more fishy.\n\nInterestingly, a similar newspaper clipping with the same statement attributed to Bharatiya Janta Party President Amit Shah was shared on Facebook on December 10, 2018.\n\nThe post with the exact same statement attributed to Shah had gone viral in December last year.\n\nBarring few words here and there, the lede of both the supposed new reports are similar.\n\nThe version wherein the statement is attributed to Shah reads: Ahead of the Rajasthan Vidhan Sabha campaigning, BJP national president Amit Shah, while making a controversial statement, compared the baniya community with thieves and racketeers. At a BJP election rally held in Bundi, Rajasthan, the BJP president said stealing is a habit of the people of baniya community and businessmen. They don't only avoid paying taxes but are also the main reason for the state of farmers in the country as these are the communities which keep all the profit in their pockets.\n\nIn the version with Rahul Gandhi in it, the words BJP and Amit Shah have been replaced with Congress and Rahul Gandhi.", "lang": "en"}
