He\u2019s running for State Superintendent of Public Instruction against State Asm. Tony Thurmond, also a Democrat, whose campaign produced the ad. The incumbent, Tom Torlakson, will be termed out in January after serving two four-year terms.\n\nHere\u2019s what the ad claims, as a photo of President Trump standing next to DeVos appears on the screen and then zooms in on DeVos.\n\n\"Tuck is backed by Donald Trump\u2019s education advisor and financed by the same billionaires behind Betsy DeVos.\"\n\nBoth Tuck and DeVos support charter schools. Meanwhile, Thurmond is a strong advocate for public schools.\n\nTuck has said he supports nonprofit charter schools in areas with few quality public school alternatives, though he wants to implement some changes. According to his website, he wants to make for-profit charter schools illegal, require greater school transparency and open charter schools to all students.\n\nBut we wanted to know whether DeVos really supports Tuck in the race, as the ad suggests.\n\nDeVos\u2019 office did not respond to our requests for comment.\n\nWe asked Thurmond\u2019s campaign about the claim. Instead of providing evidence that DeVos supports Tuck, they said he\u2019s backed by Bill Evers.\n\nEvers is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution who specializes in education policy. He was also \"head of the \u2018agency action team\u2019 for the U.S. Department of Education in the Trump transition from early September 2016 through January 2017,\" according to his biography.\n\nIn June, Evers posted a pro-Tuck campaign ad on Facebook and supported Tuck four years ago in his run for the same office. He\u2019s not, however, on the long list of supporters on Tuck\u2019s website. A spokesman for Tuck's campaign said Evers probably supports Tuck but hasn't made any financial contributions.\n\nTuck's website includes a news article by the Independent Voter Network website that refers to Evers as a supporter of Tuck.\n\nEvers did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, the ad never mentions Evers\u2019 name or shows his photo. Its primary focus is on DeVos.\n\nA spokesman for the Tuck campaign called the claim \"a false and misleading attack by Tony Thurmond.\" He pointed to examples of Tuck criticizing DeVos.\n\n\"I\u2019d rate Betsy DeVos extremely low. I think she is not qualified really for that job,\" Tuck said in a video posted in March by the news website gvwire.com.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been very clear: My agenda is strongly against the Trump/DeVos agenda,\" he added at a campaign forum in May.\n\nState Asm. Tony Thurmond, a candidate for California schools chief, left the strong impression in a recent ad that his opponent, Marshall Tuck, \"is backed\" by U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.\n\nThe ad zooms in on a photo of DeVos as it says Tuck \"is backed by Donald Trump\u2019s education advisor.\"\n\nBut Tuck has criticized DeVos and the Thurmond campaign offered no evidence she supports Tuck. They did say that Bill Evers, who advised Trump on education during his transition, supports Tuck. But he\u2019s not mentioned by name or shown in the ad, and Tuck doesn\u2019t list him as a supporter on his website.\n\nIn the end, we agreed the ad is misleading. It gives the impression DeVos supports Tuck. But there\u2019s zero evidence to back that up.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n\nFALSE: Attack ad\u2019s claim Tony Thurmond was \u2018sued by the ACLU\u2019", "lang": "en"}
