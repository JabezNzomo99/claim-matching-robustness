Most recently, during a rally in Pensacola, Fla., Trump assured his supporters that there is \u201c1,000 years\u201d worth of coal buried in the ground, insisting that miners are \u201cback to work\u201d tapping into the reserves. But Trump\u2019s estimate of the coal supply seemed too good to be true, especially because he paused briefly while searching for the figure. Still, his estimate was met with applause.\n\nDuring the rally in Pensacola, Trump assured his supporters that there is enough coal to last 1,000 years. And although the United States has the second-largest recoverable coal reserves in the world, according to the Energy Information Administration, the total amount of coal is hard to measure. That\u2019s because coal is buried in the ground.\n\nTo address the measuring challenges, coal is broken into several categories: recoverable coal reserves, which refers to coal that can be feasibly mined with today\u2019s technology; demonstrated reserve base, which refers to 100 percent of the measured coal that could be mined; and total reserve, which is the best estimate of all the coal in the ground.\n\nThe EIA\u2019s best estimate of the total reserves is 3.9 trillion short tons, while the reserve base and recoverable reserves are far smaller, at 477 billion and 255 billion short tons, respectively. The Energy Information Administration said in 2015 that the United States had about 283 years of reserves left, based on that year\u2019s production figures. Based on the average annual amount of coal produced since 2010, 0.95 billion short tons, the country\u2019s estimated recoverable coal reserves would last a little more than 250 years. That\u2019s about 750 years less than Trump estimated. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump claims West Virginia is exporting \u201cclean coal\u201d to China. But this is wrong for two reasons. One, in 2015 and 2016, West Virginia exported virtually no coal to China. Two, there is no such thing as \u201cclean coal.\u201d Electricity-generating plants can mitigate some of the effects of burning coal by capturing carbon dioxide and burying it, but that doesn\u2019t make the coal itself cleaner. And more important, the bulk of the exports of coal to China involve metallurgical coal, which is used to make steel, not generate electricity.\n\nTrump claims \u201cthings are changing\u2019 in West Virginia thanks to his administration\u2019s policies. But again Trump is trying to take credit for things outside his control. Market forces and external factors, such as China imposing regulations on mining its domestic coal supply, coupled with an increased demand for coking coal, have contributed to a price surge, making it cheaper to import coal from the United States.\n\nTrump takes credit for West Virginia\u2019s economic gains, but it\u2019s undeserved. For one, when the first quarter ended March 31, 2017, Trump was just two months into his presidency. While he was quick to do away with several regulations on energy production, many of the new policies have yet to take effect. The state\u2019s recent growth is due to increased mining production and a rise in prices for coal and natural gas.\n\nAccording to the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis, mining grew by 26.4 percent in West Virginia in the first quarter of 2017, and \u201cdata from EIA shows gains in the extraction of coal, natural gas, and petroleum bolstered mining in the state.\u201d The increase in extraction coincided with an increase in the price of metallurgical coal and natural gas. In the first quarter of 2017, the price of metallurgical coal exports was $153 per short ton, up from $76 in the third quarter of 2016. For the first nine months of 2017, the price of natural gas was $3 per million British thermal units on average, up from a 2016 average of just under $2.50 per million BTUs.\n\nHe referred to new mines opening, but the projects he referred to are for a specific type of coal that is used to produce steel, not electricity. The Paris deal focuses on carbon emissions from electricity-generating coal, not metallurgical coal. Demands in metallurgical coal aren\u2019t affected by the Paris agreement or U.S. federal policies; international market prices and fluctuations have led to the recent increase in demand. Moreover, the specific factory he refers to had plans to open since September 2016, two months before the presidential election.\n\nFrom January to May, the United States gained 33,000 jobs in \u201cmining and coal,\u201d according to preliminary data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a few thousand short of Pruitt\u2019s claim of 50,000 new jobs. But that\u2019s not the biggest problem with his figures. Most of the gain in \u201cmining\u201d jobs had nothing to do with coal. Most of the new jobs were in a subcategory called \u201csupport activities for mining,\u201d which accounted for more than 30,000 of the jobs since January.", "lang": "en"}
