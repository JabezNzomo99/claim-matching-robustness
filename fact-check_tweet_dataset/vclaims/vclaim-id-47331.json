The claim is false; the video was published in October 2019 in news reports about a bus accident in Meghalaya, India.\n\nThis video has been viewed more than 200,000 times since it was posted on Facebook on June 20, 2020.\n\nThe one-minute 41-second video shows a group of wounded soldiers lying on the ground, some of them appear unconscious.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t lose heart, the ambulance is coming,\u201d a man's voice can be heard saying in Hindi at the 35-second mark.\n\nThe Urdu-language caption of the Facebook post translates as: \u201dIndian soldiers get beating from China. Hue and cry of the wounded, video has come up.\u201d\n\nThe footage was also posted here, here, here and here on Facebook and here and here on Twitter along with similar claims.\n\nThe video was shared online in June 2020, when heightened tensions on the China-India border near Indian-administered Ladakh led to a deadly clash on June 15.

BSF jawans were returning to their base at Silchar via Jagrod from Meghalaya on Wednesday.\u201d\n\nHere is a news report on the Meghalaya accident published by the United News of India news agency on October 31, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
