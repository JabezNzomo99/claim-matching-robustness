Ami Bera for the region\u2019s 7th District Congressional seat.\n\n\"We can look to Colorado ... and look at the horrific results,\" Jones said during a debate this week between the two candidates in Sacramento. \"If you look at the increased incidents of emergency room visits by young people. If you look at the increased incidents of driving while under the influence of marijuana. All voters have to do is see what happened in Colorado to predict what\u2019s going to happen here.\"\n\nScott Jones makes his claim about marijuana at about the 10:20 minute mark in the video above.\n\nCalifornia voters in November will decide on Proposition 64, which would legalize recreational pot for those 21 and older. Both Jones and Bera oppose the measure.\n\nSeveral other states will also vote on legalizing recreational or medicinal marijuana on Election Day.\n\nColorado voted to legalize marijuana in 2012 and the law went into effect in 2014.\n\nWe wondered if Jones was right? Did Colorado see a spike in ER trips by young people and more cases of driving while stoned after it legalized pot?\n\nThe first part of Jones\u2019 statement appears to be correct. Several studies document a rise in trips to Colorado emergency rooms by young people.\n\nAs reported in the Denver Post in July, a study in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics found \"Colorado\u2019s laws on labeling and child-resistant packaging have been unable to stop an increase of young kids ending up in the emergency room after accidentally consuming marijuana.\" The study found \"... cases for pediatric marijuana increased significantly and at a higher rate than the rest of the United States.\"\n\nExamining Jones\u2019 claim about an increase in incidents of driving while under the influence of marijuana was more complex.\n\nThere\u2019s not much data yet on the topic because the state only started tracking marijuana-related traffic incidents in 2014, according to a Colorado State Patrol spokesman quoted in the Denver Post last year.\n\nJones\u2019 campaign manager pointed us to a Colorado State Patrol report showing mixed results. It says the percentage of DUIs in the state where marijuana or marijuana in combination with alcohol or other drugs was the perceived impairing substance increased from 12 percent in 2014 to 15 percent in 2015.\n\nThe same report, however, shows the raw number of citations for DUIs involving marijuana or marijuana in combination with other drugs dropped slightly during the same two years, from 674 to 665.\n\nA separate Colorado study pointed to by Jones\u2019 campaign reported there\u2019s been an increase in the percentage of drivers testing positive for marijuana involved in fatal traffic accidents.\n\nMaking things more cloudy, however, that report includes a note from the Colorado State Patrol that \"marijuana citations\" are defined as those where marijuana was present \"based on officer opinion only,\" noting there\u2019s \"no toxicological confirmation.\"\n\nRadley Balko, who blogs about criminal justice for the Washington Post, wrote in 2014 that a spike in the number of drivers who are tested and found to have traces of marijuana in their system would not be a surprise in Colorado, nor would it mean marijuana necessarily contributed to a traffic accident.\n\n\"All that a positive test tells us is that the driver has smoked pot at some point in the past few days or weeks,\" Balko wrote, noting the drug can linger in a person\u2019s system for days after its effects wear off.\n\n\"It makes sense that loosening restrictions on pot would result in a higher percentage of drivers involved in fatal traffic accidents having smoked the drug at some point over the past few days or weeks,\" Balko added.\n\nScott Jones said Colorado saw \"increased incidents of emergency room visits by young people\" and \"increased incidents of driving while under the influence of marijuana\" following the state\u2019s legalization of recreational marijuana.\n\nStudies show the state indeed experienced a spike in ER visits by young people related to marijuana.\n\nLess clear is how marijuana-related traffic incidents have changed since the state legalized the drug. Studies have limited data and show mixed results. Further complicating the matter, marijuana can remain in a driver\u2019s system days after the effect of the drug has worn off, making it difficult to determine whether the drug was the primary factor in an accident.\n\nJones\u2019 statement on the ER visits is accurate. But there\u2019s not enough convincing data to prove the second portion of his claim.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
