{"title": "Russian Lawmakers: U.S. Bill on North Korea a Bid to Take Control of Russia\u2019s Seaports", "subtitle": "Russian lawmakers have harshly criticized revised U.S. legislation on North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, claiming it is a bid to \u201ccontrol\u201d Russia\u2019s Far East seaports. In reality, the legislation sets the groundwork for monitoring and imposing sanctions on states violating a United Nation Security Council resolution on North Korea.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "May 12, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-2032", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-usa-northkorea-sanctions-seaports/28482991.html", "vclaim": "On May 4, the U.S. House of Representatives passed revised legislation outlining the American response to new threats posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear aspirations. H.R.1644, the Korean Interdiction and Modernization of Sanctions Act, sets out enhanced measures for identifying and inspecting foreign seaports and airports that \u201cknowingly\u201d violate the UN Security Council resolution on North Korea. These include two ports in China, eleven in Iran, four in Syria and three in Russia.\n\nThe Syrian ports targeted for enhanced inspection include Banias, Latakia, and Tartus. Russian military bases are located at the latter two ports.\n\nRegarding Russia, the bill requires monitoring of the three major Pacific seaports Nakhodka, Vanino, and Vladivostok, which are in the country\u2019s Far East and close to China and North Korea.\n\nRussian lawmakers reacted fiercely to the passage of the U.S. legislation, characterizing it as an American attempt to take control of Russia\u2019s ports.\n\nVictor Ozerov, chairman of the Defense and Security Committee of the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia\u2019s parliament, said the U.S. bill is \u201cabsurd\u201d and that Russia, as a sovereign nation, will never allow anybody into its territory without permission.\n\n\u201cThis legislation proposes a flagrant violation of international law,\u201d said Alexei Pushkov, a member of the Federation Council\u2019s Defense and Security Committee and head of the council\u2019s Commission on Information Policy. \u201cI can\u2019t recall anything like it. It\u2019s the kind of legislative action of wartime; it seems to me absolutely beyond common sense.\"\n\nA source in the U.S. Congress told Polygraph.info that the Russian lawmakers\u2019 perception of the U.S. bill is \u201cwrong.\u201d In reality, the bill would sanction ports and port operators that fail to comply with UN Security Council resolutions, the source said.\n\nRussia\u2019s Interfax news agency, which quoted the criticism of the U.S. legislation by Ozerov and Pushkov, subsequently posted an article which also quoted an unnamed U.S. Congressional source as denying that \u201ccontrolling\u201d Russian ports was part of the U.S. legislation.\n\nStill, the second Interfax article quoted Konstantin Kosachev, head of the Federation Council\u2019s International Affairs Committee, who charged that the U.S. legislation is inconsistent with international law.\n\n\u201cThe Americans, by hook or crook, are trying to assert the supremacy of their own law over international law, which is in general a major threat to international law and the main problem of international relations today,\" Kosachev said.", "lang": "en"}
