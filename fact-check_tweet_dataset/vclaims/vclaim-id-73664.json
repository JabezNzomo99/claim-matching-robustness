Video of the Muslim Delegates Assembly (at the one hour, 10 minute, and 48 second mark) and the LGBTQ Caucus Meeting (at the 1 minute 55 second mark) show that at each meeting the individual leading the group in the pledge left out the phrase. The video does not show any other participants during that time, meaning video evidence exists for only two participants. During the general convention, however, \u201cunder God\u201d appeared each of the four times the Pledge of Allegiance was said.\n\nOther conservative media personalities were more accurate in their complaints: Charlie Kirk, for example, tweeted that \u201cThe words \u2018under God\u2019 were omitted from the Pledge of Allegience [sic] at least twice during the DNC.\u201d However, broader claims that the DNC removed \u201cGod\u201d from the Pledge of Allegiance give the incorrect impression that the elision occurred on a wider scale than the two individuals who opted not to say it.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
