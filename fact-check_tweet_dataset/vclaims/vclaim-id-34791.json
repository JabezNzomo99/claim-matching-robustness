RMIT ABC Fact Check investigates.\n\nThe April 2, 2019 federal budget refers to Commonwealth spending of $100 billion on transport infrastructure over the next decade.\n\nThe budget does not provide a complete breakdown of how the spending will be spread across individual years or specific projects.\n\nThis federal figure is not comparable to the $107 billion of spending on state infrastructure referred to by Mr Pallas, for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst, the 10-year, $100 billion federal infrastructure spend relates only to land transport infrastructure projects.\n\nIt does not include infrastructure spending by the Commonwealth in areas such as defence, nor does it include infrastructure spending undertaken by federal government corporations like the National Broadband Network.\n\nOn the other hand, the $107 billion Victorian infrastructure agenda referred to by Mr Pallas covers infrastructure projects across all areas of the State Government, including transport, the environment, law and order, health, education, and government corporations such as Victoria's various water authorities.\n\nSecond, the timeframes used are not comparable. The $107 billion figure referred to by Mr Pallas covers the total value of all projects that are currently underway and planned.\n\nSome projects on the list have been underway for several years. According to the May budget papers, Victoria's $107 billion infrastructure program includes spending of almost $29 billion that was to be undertaken before June 30, 2019.\n\nOther projects are not due to be completed for many years, including one that is not expected to be finished until 2053.\n\nIn contrast, the federal infrastructure spending referred to by Mr Pallas is limited to grants for land transport projects over the ten years from July 1, 2019.\n\nThird, many of the projects that make up Victoria's $107 billion infrastructure program involve a contribution from the Commonwealth. These federal contributions \u2014 worth almost $7 billion according to analysis by Fact Check \u2014 have been included in the Victorian total.\n\nThe comparison used by Mr Pallas therefore involves a degree of double counting.\n\nThese significant problems aside, Mr Pallas accurately points out that infrastructure spending in Victoria has increased dramatically in recent years. This, however, is a separate issue, and not the subject of this fact check.\n\nThe state's infrastructure agenda, or \"capital program\", as it is formally known, is detailed in Budget Paper Number 4 of the May 27 state budget.\n\nAs the Department of Treasury and Finance explains, this provides an estimate of the value of all newly-announced infrastructure projects, as well as projects already underway.\n\nThe budget paper lists projects administered by government departments, including transport, health and education, and projects run by \"public non-financial corporations\", including 19 water companies, Victorian Rail Track and Victorian Ports Corporation.\n\nIn this year's budget, government departments listed $28.9 billion in new infrastructure projects and $32.7 billion in existing projects, a total of $61.7 billion.\n\nPublic non-financial corporations listed $10.3 billion in new projects and $35.2 billion in existing projects, a total of $45.5 billion.\n\nAll up, these projects are worth $107 billion.\n\nAlmost $47 billion is being spent under the auspices of the Department of Transport, including $13.3 billion for the removal of rail level crossings, $15.6 billion for the North East Link road project and $6.3 billion for West Gate Tunnel project.\n\nA further $27.4 billion is being spent by Victorian Rail Track. That includes $10.9 billion for the Melbourne Metro Tunnel and $2.2 billion for high-capacity trains.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is investing $5.6 billion, the Department of Justice and Community Safety $3.6 billion and the Department of Education and Training $3.5 billion.\n\nWhat about the Commonwealth?\n\nIn his budget speech, Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced that \"the Coalition Government is boosting our infrastructure spending to $100 billion over the decade\".\n\nThe budget document, Building Our Future: Delivering the Right Infrastructure for a Growing Nation, refers specifically to \"transport infrastructure\" in relation to the $100 billion figure.\n\n\"The Australian Government is investing $100 billion over 10 years from 2019-20 in transport infrastructure across Australia to manage our growing population and get Australians home sooner and safer,\" it says.\n\n\"This includes an additional $23 billion for new projects and initiatives through the 2019-20 Budget to bust congestion, better connect our regions, improve safety on our roads, and meet our national freight challenge.\"\n\nIt remains unclear how the $100 billion will be spread across individual years and projects across the decade, given the budget generally uses a four-year rather than 10-year time frame.\n\nA spokesman for Federal Infrastructure Minister Michael McCormack confirmed that the $100 million figure relates to infrastructure payments to the states for land transport projects over 10 years.\n\n\"The Commonwealth Government's infrastructure package is a rolling pipeline of $100 billion for land transport infrastructure over ten years,\" the spokesman said.\n\n\"Discussions are entered into on specific funding allocations for individual projects and payments are made on milestones.\"\n\nThe budget does, however, outline $28.3 billion worth of \"new priorities for the infrastructure investment pipeline\".\n\nIncluded is $4 billion for a national urban congestion fund, $4.5 billion for roads of strategic importance, $3.5 billion for stage 1 of the North-South rail link in NSW and $2 billion for Victoria's Melbourne to Geelong Fast Rail.\n\nA further $22.1 billion of spending from 2019-20 onwards on \"current major projects\" is also set out, including $5 billion for the Melbourne Airport Rail Link and $1.75 billion for Melbourne's North East Rail Link.\n\nAs previously noted, the infrastructure spending referred to by Mr Pallas represents the total value of capital projects that are underway or planned for the future.\n\nIncluded are hundreds of transport, hospital, school, environment, water, and law and order projects being managed by various government departments, authorities and publicly-owned corporations such as various water authorities and VicTrack (which owns Victoria's transport land, assets and infrastructure).\n\nSome of the projects included have been underway for many years. Some will be finished in the relatively near future. Others involve long timelines.\n\nMelbourne's $15.6 billion North East Link road project is not expected to be completed until 2027.\n\nThe project with the longest timeline, known as the \"Melbourne Strategic Assessment\", is designed to manage the impact on Melbourne's suburban growth on plants and animals. It is not due to be completed for 34 years, until 2053.\n\nMr Pallas referred to infrastructure spending by the Commonwealth over the next decade. The federal budget papers do not provide sufficient detail to verify the Coalition's claim that it is \"investing $100 billion over 10 years\" on transport infrastructure from 2019-20.\n\nThis aside, Victoria's entire capital program is not directly comparable. Unlike the federal spending figure, it is not confined to spending on transport infrastructure over a decade.\n\nAs one expert, Grattan Institute researcher James Ha, put it, \"We are comparing spending on different baskets of projects, transport versus all capital works. That is a problem. We are looking at totally different timelines that are not sensible to compare.\"\n\nRMIT Emeritus Professor David Hayward told Fact Check: \"The Commonwealth spend that is referred to by the Victorian Treasurer is for Commonwealth grants to the states for infrastructure, not their total capital spending including on assets the Commonwealth will own in areas like defence, which is particularly important for states like South Australia.\n\nAccording to the 2019-20 Budget Paper Number 1, Commonwealth capital investment in defence assets is expected to amount to $34.4 billion over the four-year budget period.\n\nCapital spending such as this not included in the $100 billion figure used as a basis for comparison by Mr Pallas.\n\nAs Victoria's Department of Treasury and Finance explained in the budget, the state's capital program is funded from a number of sources, including from Commonwealth grants, the private sector, public borrowing and Victoria's \"Delivering for All Victorians Infrastructure Fund\", which was established using contributions from state insurers such as the Transport Accident Commission and WorkSafe.\n\nThe total also includes some local government funding and contributions from fund-raising activities (for example through schools), and (sometimes substantial) private sector contributions made through, for example, public private partnerships.\n\nThe figure of $107 billion cited by Mr Pallas includes substantial contributions from the Commonwealth.\n\nFor example, Melbourne's North East Link, connecting Melbourne's Eastern Freeway to the M80 ring road, is expected to involve a capital investment of $15.6 billion (with total costs of $15.8 billion).\n\nIn the 2018-19 federal budget, the Commonwealth allocated $1.75 billion towards the project, which is currently seeking tenders for early construction works.\n\nThe two governments have also announced they will jointly fund another big project, the railway from Melbourne's central business district to the airport. The state and federal governments have committed up to $5 billion each for the project, which is still in the planning phase.\n\nThe full anticipated cost is not included in the Victorian budget's $107 billion figure.\n\nFact Check undertook an analysis of the state's capital program. It found the Commonwealth is contributing at least $5 billion towards Victoria's $107 billion infrastructure agenda, or almost $7 billion including the North East Link commitment.\n\nThe following graph shows projects identified in this year's Victorian budget that involve a contribution from the Commonwealth.\n\nWhat the experts say\n\nProfessor Hayward said the claim was misleading as it was comparing different timeframes, did not include all federal infrastructure spending and involved some double counting as the Victorian figures \"include Commonwealth capital grants\".\n\nHowever, he pointed out federal capital grants to Victoria were a relatively small proportion of the total.\n\n\"These (federal capital grants) account for only a small proportion of total Victorian infrastructure spending,\" Professor Hayward said.\n\n\"In 2019-20, they will only be $567 million out of a total capital spend in the budget of $9.3 billion. This compares to over $5 billion of capital spending in Victoria that will come from private companies contracted to do public private partnerships.\"\n\nThe Grattan Institute's Mr Ha said the claim did not involve a like-for-like comparison between federal and state infrastructure spending.\n\n\"The $100 billion the Commonwealth has announced is specifically for transport infrastructure,\" Mr Ha said.\n\nLowy Institute Senior Fellow John Edwards said a better comparison might be to a comparable jurisdiction, for example NSW.\n\n\"Infrastructure spending is mostly executed by the states, especially for roads and rail etcetera, which are under state control, sometimes with explicit and tied Commonwealth funding and sometimes without.\"\n\u2022 Department of Infrastructure, Regional Develop and Cities, Building Our Future:\n\u2022 Delivering the Right Infrastructure for a Growing Nation, Federal Budget, 2019-20\n\u2022 Investing in our community: Congestion busting infrastructure now and for the future, Federal Budget 2019-20", "lang": "en"}
