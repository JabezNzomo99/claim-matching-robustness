But it's not from CBO.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-01T15:30:52Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85990", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2013/11/13/sebelliuss-claim-that-insurance-premiums-are-16-percent-lower-than-cbo-projected/", "vclaim": "It turns out this is not a CBO projection at all, but something HHS calculated itself. First, HHS turned an estimate for a 2016 family premium into an individual premium, and then it backdated from a CBO estimate for 2016 to estimate what it would have been in 2014. So it is several steps removed from CBO\u2019s own work. (CBO declined to comment.)\n\nThe most comprehensive effort that CBO did to estimate premiums was in a 2009 letter to then-Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.) though that focused on the Senate version being debated at the time, and it has not been updated. That report estimated average family premiums would be $15,200 in 2016, compared to $13,100 if the Affordable Care Act had not been enacted. As we noted last week, the most important part of that report was not the dollar figures but the potential positive and negative impact of the law on premiums. Still, that report did indicate that premiums, on average, were expected to increase because of mandates in the law.\n\nA footnote to the 2012 CBO report says: \u201cThe analysis presents average expected costs in 2016 for a family of four with two adults and two children. Serving as an illustration, the analysis includes simplifying assumptions and therefore does not incorporate all features of the ACA nor all of the differences between employment-based and exchange coverage.\u201d\n\nWhy did the CBO select 2016 as the basis for an estimated premium? In part, that\u2019s because insurers\u2019 experience for 2014 will have an important influence on their premiums in future years. ASPE provides an explanation as to how it turned CBO\u2019s family premium into an individual premium (using assumptions in the letter to Bayh), and then backdated it to 2014, but it\u2019s really just a guesstimate of an estimate. ASPE has no real way of knowing the assumptions that went into CBO\u2019s thinking for the increase between 2014 and 2016\u2014or whether that would have been changed with the passage of time.\n\nHHS officials say that their methodology is transparent and based on health insurance spending increases from the Office of the Actuary and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In effect, officials say that the analysis is conservative and that the true savings are likely higher than estimated in the report.\n\n\u201cWe are clear in all studies that we are using an ASPE-derived number that is based on the CBO\u2019s projection of 2016 premiums,\u201d said HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters. \u201cWe clearly lay out our methodology and the assumptions we used to arrive at this number. In fact, our methodology led to a conservative estimate of the projection, and the ASPE-derived number for 2014 is lower than the CBO 2016 number. We believe this was the best way to give consumers an indication of how premiums compare to a non-partisan projection.\u201d\n\nHHS has incorrectly labeled a number with the CBO imprimatur, even though it is using the figure in a way that was not intended. While we understand Sebelius cannot speak with footnotes, a check of news reports finds that this figure has often been reported as a CBO estimate. HHS\u2019s news releases have done little to clarify the matter, using phrasing such as \u201c16 percent below projections based off of Congressional Budget Office estimates.\u201d\n\nFor many people in the individual market, insurance premiums (before subsidies) are going to go up because the law mandates a much more robust package of benefits. At a personal level, the question is going to be how much more does someone need to pay next year versus last year \u2014 and how much more are they going to get for their money. Few are really going to care whether the rates were lower than projected, even if the projections actually are valid.\n\nStill, determining the Pinocchio rating was difficult. The logic used by HHS analysts may be sound, but the shorthand used by administration political figures (\u201cCBO\u201d) has been misleading \u2014 and led some reporters to believe this was indeed a CBO estimate. It is a credit to the CBO that its estimates are so admired, but it is a discredit to politicians who try to ride on its coattails. Readers should be wary when someone cites a CBO estimate.
