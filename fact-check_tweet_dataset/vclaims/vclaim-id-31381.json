The popularity of his work, much of which is still read today, has resulted in him being frequently credited with quotes, genuine and apocryphal.\n\nThe Folger Shakespeare Library puts this saying about heartache in the latter category, listing the quote as \u201ccommonly misattributed\u201d on its website. (RELATED: Did Shakespeare Say, \u2018The Earth Has Music For Those Who Listen\u2019?)\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation searched the Shakespeare Quartos Archive, an online database of all his plays, as well his collected poetry, but found no record of the statement in either. According to the Folger Shakespeare Library, the only instance of Shakespeare using the word \u201cheartache\u201d (spelled \u201cheart-ache\u201d) appears in the titular character\u2019s \u201cTo be, or not to be\u201d soliloquy in \u201cHamlet.\u201d\n\nPaul Bruda, author of \u201cShakespeare Early and Late: A Textbook,\u201d also confirmed in an email to the DCNF that the quote did not belong to Shakespeare.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
