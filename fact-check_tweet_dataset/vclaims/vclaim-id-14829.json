A sequel is not in \u201cactive development,\u201d according to a spokeswoman for Warner Brothers.\n\nWhile \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d has now become a Broadway musical, there is no indication that it will be getting a sequel anytime soon.\n\nThe 1988 film, starring Michael Keaton as the title character, was directed by Tim Burton. Rumors of a sequel have persisted for years, so much so that an IMDB page has been created for it. However, despite fan\u2019s best hopes, the movie trailer is fake.\n\nWarner Brothers, whose logo is featured in the trailer, did not respond to The Daily Caller\u2019s request for comment, however, a spokeswoman for the company, Candice McDonough, told USA Today in April that the project was not in active development.\n\nInstead of scenes for a sequel, the trailer posted by Horror Vibes is simply a well-made compilation of video clips from television shows and commercials. The clips of a couple running through a park, kissing and then getting engaged, for example, were taken from an Extra Gum commercial. No indication was given, either in the post or the video, that the trailer was fan-made and not official.\n\nWhen asked recently if a \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d sequel would be made, Burton said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I doubt it.\u201d\n\nHe told Collider back in 2016 that a sequel would need to be made under the \u201cright circumstances.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it\u2019s one of those films where it has to be right. It\u2019s not a kind of a movie that cries out [for a sequel], it\u2019s not the Beetlejuice trilogy,\u201d Burton said. \u201cSo it\u2019s something that if the elements are right \u2013 because I do love the character and Michael\u2019s amazing as that character, so yeah we\u2019ll see. But there\u2019s nothing concrete yet.\u201d\n\nSimilar claims of a sequel have originated through fake movie posters, which have also been debunked.\n\nAt the time of publication, the Horror Vibes trailer had been viewed 1.7 million times.", "lang": "en"}
