This protest is also taking us to a society where everybody will be included. So we aren\u2019t compromising our ideology, I want to reiterate this. We are not compromising out ideology but changing our strategy.\u201d\n\nThe video was also tweeted by BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra who took it up a notch and claimed that Khanum disclosed the strategy to develop an \u2018Islamic Caliphate\u2019. \u201cHindus will be required only till the time an Islamic society is not created.

Many of them reposted the video first tweeted by @EthnicLinkGuru.\n\nCLIPPED VIDEO TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT\n\nThe complete speech delivered by journalist Arfa Khanum at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) was uploaded by The Wire on January 24, 2020. It is titled as, \u201cThe language of anti-CAA movement shouldn\u2019t be Muslim but secular.\u201dKhanum is a senior editor at The Wire.\n\nNearly half-way into her speech, the journalist congratulates the women of AMU who shaped the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). At 14:42, Khanum says, \u201cHowever, it is important to understand how we want to protest.\u201d She expresses solidarity with those who feel that their Muslimness is being attacked however urges the audience that the protests need to have an \u2018inclusive\u2019 shape and should not turn into a \u2018Muslim-only\u2019 agitation.\n\n\u201cIf only Muslims protest in this country. If only 20 crore people protest, will the rest of the 100 crore want to be a part if you raise religious slogans? \u2026What I want to say is make the protests more inclusive\u2026You are a Muslim, there are no doubts about that and I have no objection to accepting the fact that you are being attacked. But understand that these protests are for India\u2019s secularism and its Constitution,\u201d she says.\n\nThe part of her speech that has been clipped and presented on social media starts from 17:15 minutes. In fact, this portion, even when heard independently, does not translate to Khanum promoting the establishment of an \u2018Islamic Caliphate/ society\u2019. \u201cThis protest is also taking us to a society where everybody will be included. So we aren\u2019t compromising our ideology, I want to reiterate this. We are not compromising out ideology but changing our strategy,\u201d she states. Here, the word \u2018strategy\u2019 implies adhering to a form of protest where religious slogans are shunned and a secular movement is embraced.\n\n\u201cOn January 12th, I was invited to AMU to speak on a program on the CAA. Activist Medha Patkar, historian Prof Irfan Habib, and student activist Ayesha Renne were my co-panellists. Many students were insisting that they wanted to protest as Muslims because the attack is on their Muslim identity. To counter that, I argued that although in an ideal society, everyone should be welcome to join the protests with their own beliefs and slogans, including religious ones if they feel motivated by them, we are far from being an ideal society, and this is a larger fight to save the Indian Constitution and its secular character. Hence, we should allow only secular slogans in the protests. Since these protests should eventually take us toward a society that is truly inclusive, the protests too should be inclusive,\u201d said Khanum speaking with Alt News.\n\nThe journalist has expressed similar views in the past as well. In a December 30 tweet thread, she wrote, \u201cWhile it\u2019s perfectly fine for Muslims to draw strength from their religious beliefs, it\u2019ll end up alienating a lot of non-Muslim allies\u2026we live in an extremely polarised polity that runs high on propaganda. Here optics matter. Religious slogans on secular protests are bad optics.\u201d\n\nThat Khanum was advocating for inclusive and secular protests was also explained by journalist Marya Shakil.\n\nA speech delivered by Arfa Khanum at Aligarh Muslim University was clipped and misrepresented on social media by BJP officer-bearers and supporters of the party. They claimed that the journalist was promoting the establishment of Islamic society and urging protesters to maintain a pretence of support to non-Muslims until such a society is created. However, Khanum was stating the complete opposite. She urged protesters to not use religious slogans to maintain the secular character of the movement.", "lang": "en"}
