As some shoppers viewed this new policy as a sort of violation of their rights, they took to social media to vent their frustrations.\n\nOne Facebook user named \u201cSharon\u201d reportedly posted a message to Costco\u2019s official Facebook page, reading: \u201cI will not shop at Costco until you remove your mandatory mask rule!\u201d This message wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary. Costco\u2019s alleged response, however, was not something that you typically see from an established brand:\n\nCostco reportedly replied: \u201cThank you for taking such a brave stand, Sharon. We look forward to the documentary they will make about you some day.\u201d When another social media user jumped in to defend \u201cSharon,\u201d Costco allegedly replied with another curt response, writing: \u201cWe\u2019ve chosen not to refund you.\u201d\n\nThis exchange, however, did not originate with the official Costco Wholesale page. This exchange actually comes from comedian Ben Palmer, who has a penchant for imitating brands online.\n\nIn 2018, for instance, Palmer created a fake Facebook page for the City of Atlanta and facetiously announced that the city was going to destroy a Confederate monument on Stone Mountain. Palmer\u2019s website has several additional examples showing the comedian impersonating official entities ranging from Home Depot to pastor Joel Osteen\u2019s Lakewood Church.\n\nThe fake Costco exchange was originally posted to Palmer\u2019s fake customer service Facebook page \u201cHope This Helps.\u201d Palmer also posted a video of himself reading Costco\u2019s alleged responses to his Facebook page:", "lang": "en"}
