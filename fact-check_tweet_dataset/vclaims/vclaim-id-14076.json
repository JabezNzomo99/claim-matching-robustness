The theme for this year\u2019s World Malaria Day was \u2018zero malaria starts with me\u2019, a campaign the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said \u201caims to keep malaria high on the political agenda, mobilize additional resources, and empower communities to take ownership of malaria prevention and care\u201d.\n\nToday, we explore perhaps \u2018a malaria myth\u2019; that malaria is a disease which cannot be eliminated and which we must endure, especially in the Nigerian society. But first \u2013\n\nMalaria is a household name in Nigeria. It is a life-threatening infectious disease that is caused by Plasmodium parasites in the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes which acts as a vector for the disease. Although this is a highly preventable and curable disease, it affected 219 million worldwide, in 2017, and 435,000 in this same year died as a result of the disease. Over the past years, global efforts have been made to curb the incidence of malaria.\n\nA study estimated that one in four of the global cases of malaria occurred in Nigeria. Indeed the World Malaria Report indicated that Nigeria, along with four other countries account for nearly half of the global malaria cases. Among these five countries, Nigeria has the highest cases; with 25%, 11% in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 5% in Mozambique, 4% in India and 4% in Uganda.\n\nFor a disease that causes thousands of deaths in a year, especially in low- and middle-income countries of the world, elimination will be groundbreaking. According to the WHO, elimination is possible if a high-burden country [like Nigeria] works to enhance malaria prevention and treatment measures.\n\nWHAT IS THE CAUSE OF THE HIGH PREVALENCE OF MALARIA IN NIGERIA?\n\nThere are numerous speculations on this, and the government of Nigeria is not helping matters by providing a full report that studies the cause of the high rate of malaria in Nigeria. Nevertheless, it is generally believed that the cause of the high rates of malaria can be attributed to the living conditions of extremely poor people, poor sanitation that provides ideal conditions for mosquito breeding grounds and very limited access to insecticide-treated bed nets for most Nigerians. Also, the government\u2019s reluctance to fund preventive programs and initiatives to fight malaria can be a good cause of the high rates.\n\nIn most debates, people cite the case of the United States of America and other western countries that successfully eliminated malaria. In the US, the elimination of malaria was largely fostered by the introduction of a then new drug, chloroquine. However, efforts were also made in advancing strategies of larviciding (an insecticide that targets the larval life stage of an insect), improving drainage and housing with screens. Also the strengthened healthcare delivery systems further helped to ensure that malaria would not be a disease that would burden the US any longer.\n\nOur not-so distant sister country in Asia, Sri Lanka, and our sister African countries, Lesotho, Mauritius, La Reunion and Seychelles have all been certified as malaria-free by the WHO. Even India, an equally populous country with a high malaria rate, is making headway in this area. The World Malaria Report revealed that India has made significant progress with malaria as 3 Million fewer cases were seen from the most recent indices. This is a notable 24% decrease from the 2016 figures.\n\nIndia has also already drawn a strategic plan of action to eliminate malaria and attain malaria-free status by 2030. The key strategies which are contained in the plan include: \u201cstrengthening malaria surveillance, establishing a mechanism for early detection and prevention of outbreaks of malaria, promoting the prevention of malaria by the use of Long Lasting Impregnated Nets (LLINs), effective indoor residual spray and augmenting the manpower and capacities for effective implementation in the next five years\u201d.\n\nWHAT CAN NIGERIA DO?\n\nHere\u2019s what we recommend: government commitment to actually implement well-researched preventive strategies. Also, more funding should be allocated to research and development. Most recently, news of a landmark program of a malaria vaccine in the works in Malawi has already brought hope to the cause in Africa, but again Nigeria is not at the forefront of this vaccine development despite its burden with this disease.\n\nWHAT CAN YOU \u2013 YES, YOU \u2013 DO?\n\nMany of us can contribute to lessen the malaria prevalence by starting with ourselves. Bite preventions are pivotal to this. To avoid bites, seemingly common practices such as using insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying (IRS) are highly encouraged. All you need to do is to spray your house with insecticide as a study notes that it \u201creduces chances of mosquito bites, hence potentially lowering the occurrence of malaria, where mosquito-feeding habits are indoors\u201d.\n\nIf you cannot afford insecticides, eliminating mosquito breeding grounds are crucial. For example, draining pools of water, levelling land, developing drainage systems and properly managing your waste can reduce the likelihood of mosquitoes breeding in your environment. Further, reducing vegetation where mosquitoes thrive contributes to malaria prevention. These strategies can be employed by all, not just at the individual level, but also at the community level.", "lang": "en"}
