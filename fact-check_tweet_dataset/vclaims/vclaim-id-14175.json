That\u2019s a defensible number, because there are two ways a GDP figure for the year can be calculated. But it starts to get misleading the way he frames it \u2014 that it\u2019s the best result in 14 years and that the news media wrongly reported it as 2.9 percent.\n\nThe problem for Trump is that he had hoped to beat 3 percent growth. So 2.9 percent would be a bit of a bummer, especially because President Barack Obama achieved that result in 2015. (Let\u2019s not forget that during the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump promised \u201cto grow the economy 4% per year\u201d in his Contract with the American Voter.) [Update: With the March 28 revision, Trump slipped just behind Obama\u2019s best year, with a rate of 2.85 percent compared to Obama\u2019s 2.88 percent. The official rate goes to one decimal, so effectively they remain tied. The July 26 revision confirmed 2.9 percent growth in 2018.]\n\nBut the White House Council of Economic Advisers came to the rescue by offering a calculation that compared the fourth quarter of 2018 with the fourth quarter of 2017. This calculation, known as 4Q/4Q, comes to 3.1 percent, allowing Trump to claim victory. (Update: the March 28 revision brought the 4Q/4Q figure to 3.0, or more precisely 2.97. New Update: The July 26 revision brought the number down to 2.5 percent.)\n\nIn key ways, 4Q/4Q makes more sense as a measure of annual growth than the traditional calculation. \u201cThe annual-average-to-annual-average growth rates reflect what happened in the preceding year as well as what happened during the year in question,\u201d the CEA said in a technical note explaining its preference for 4Q/4Q. \u201cIn contrast, the fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter growth rates reflect only what happened during the specified year.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think most economists prefer four-quarter changes to annual averages,\u201d Furman said. \u201cAs I\u2019ve written before, the problem with annual average is that the annual average for 2018 reflects data on quarterly growth in 2017 and 2018. So it doesn\u2019t tell you what is actually happening in a given year or, say, as a result of the tax cuts.\u201d\n\nHe noted, for instance, that annual average growth was reasonably high in 2008 (even though the economy imploded) because it included data from 2007, when the economy was good, and annual growth was reasonably low in 2009 (despite the economy starting to recover that year). The Commerce Department\u2019s method of calculating GDP shows the GDP sagging just -0.1 percent in 2008 and -2.5 percent in 2009, compared with -2.8 percent in 2008 and +0.2 percent in 2009 under the 4Q/4Q method.\n\nBut while 4Q/4Q corresponds to an annual calendar, it does not tell you when a president had his peak growth rate \u2014 or his nadir. Trump faulted Obama for being the first president to never break 3 percent on an annual basis \u2014 that\u2019s under the year-over-year measure used by the Commerce Department \u2014 but under that method he simply has tied Obama. Trump also has not exceeded 3 percent.\n\nNow that Trump is citing 4Q/4Q, that means the relevant comparison would not just be 4Q/4Q but other quarter-over-quarter calculations. The economy under Obama hit its peak in 1Q/1Q 2015, when it grew 3.8 percent. Obama exceeded 3.1 percent on two other occasions, as well. (His best result for 4Q/4Q was 2.7 percent, in 2014.) Obama\u2019s nadir was reached in 2Q/2Q 2009, when the growth rate was -3.9 percent.\n\nYet Trump is telling audiences \u201cthis hasn\u2019t been done in 14 years, maybe more than that, but 14 years.\u201d That\u2019s because he\u2019s going all the way back to Q4/Q4 2005, when that particular quarter-to-quarter measure reached 3.1 percent. The chart below shows how stronger periods of sustained growth for a period of a year were reached in 2015 and 2010.\n\nTrump is being misleading on several levels here. He accuses the news media of trying to manipulate the data, when all reporters did was report a widely used number issued by the Commerce Department. That\u2019s simply false. He then claims he hit a number that had not been reached for 14 years, when, in fact, economic growth in the past decade three times exceeded 3.1 percent using quarter-over-quarter metrics. Trump is simply fixated with the data that corresponds to the annual calendar. But it\u2019s really the best economic year-over-year growth in four years, not 14. (Update: the March 28 revision to 3.0 means Trump tied himself -- it is the same result as 3Q/3Q 2018. New Update: The July 26 revision means that this is actually one of Trump\u2019s most mediocre periods.)\n\nTrump\u2019s CEA offers a compelling case that 4Q/4Q is a better gauge for measuring GDP growth within a calendar year, and it acknowledges that the 2.9 percent growth rate is the measure for year-over-year growth. But such nuances appear to have been missed by the president. If he just stuck to the numbers, without the braggadocio and press bashing, he\u2019d be on more solid ground. The economy is doing well enough that there\u2019s little need to spin the data further.", "lang": "en"}
