The claim is false; the images are AFP photos showing the aftermath of a 2005 earthquake which killed tens of thousands of people in Pakistan.\n\nThis misleading Facebook post was published February 27, 2019 and has been shared hundreds of times.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption says in Hindi: \u201cYou have seen a lot of photos from Pulwama, now see the state of Pakistan today.\u201d\n\nIt contains three images which show destroyed buildings and dead bodies in the rubble.\n\nThe misleading claim has also been posted on Twitter here.\n\n\"Pulwama\" refers to a suicide attack in the Pulwama district of Indian-administered Kashmir which killed 41 Indian paramilitary troops on February 14.\n\nHere is an AFP report on the attack.\n\nIndian media reports published multiple photos of the Pulwama attack at the time, for example here, here, and here.\n\nOn February 26, 2019, India said it had carried out airstrikes on suspected militant bases inside Pakistan. Here is an AFP report on the strikes.\n\nThe images in the misleading posts do not show Pakistan on February 27, 2019 -- they are all AFP photographs from 2005.\n\nThe three photos actually show the aftermath of an earthquake which struck near the town of Muzaffarabad in Pakistani Kashmir on October 8, 2005, killing tens of thousands of people.\n\nHere is a BBC report on the 2005 Kashmir earthquake.\n\nThe main image used in the misleading post is an AFP photo taken in Balakot, Pakistan, on October 10, 2005.
