The majority of people surveyed by ONS indicated being majority happy with their lives. However, statistically, Northern Ireland has some of the highest rates of mental health illness in the UK and some research has found quality of life to be low here. Most citizens are happy but there exists serious issues which detract from well-being.\n\nNorthern Ireland is the happiest region in the UK, according to the results of a \u2018happiness survey\u2019 released by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) in February 2016.\n\nOn a scale from 0-10, Northern Ireland rated an average of 7.8 for happiness, whilst the average across the United Kingdom was 7.5. Within Northern Ireland, Mid Antrim topped with an average of 8.21, and Belfast rated with the lowest average of 7.23.\n\nONS asked a four question survey, door to door; 158,000 persons participated. Interviewees were asked to rate these questions, from 0 to 10 (low: 0-4; medium: 5-6; high: 7-8; very high: 9-10):\n\u2022 Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?\n\u2022 Overall, to what extent do you feel the things you do in your life are worthwhile?\n\u2022 Overall, how happy did you feel yesterday?\n\u2022 Overall, how anxious are you?\n\nThis research was subjective, as it was up to the participant to self-define \u2018satisfied\u2019, \u2018worthwhile\u2019, \u2018happy\u2019 and \u2018anxious\u2019.\n\nThe results indicate that as a population, we perceive ourselves to be happy. However, other surveys have found that there are particular issues in Northern Ireland in regard to quality of life and mental health.\n\nIn 2014, a report commissioned by the Northern Ireland executive (page 140)stated that Northern Ireland has a 25 percent higher overall prevalence of mental health problems than England. One in five citizens will have a mental health problem at some stage in their life.\n\nAnd in 2015, a quality of life survey conducted by uSwitch.com reported that Northern Ireland was among the ten worst areas to live in, in the UK. The survey took into account 26 various factors including cost of living, salaries and crime rates. It also considered lifestyle factors such as hours of sunshine and typical working hours.\n\nSo, while we subjectively self-report a general state of happiness, other objective criteria highlight issues that affect our mental health and well-being.\n\nImage: (c) See-Ming LEE used by license CC BY-SA 2.0\n\nFactCheckNI is Northern Ireland\u2019s first and only dedicated independent fact-checking service and a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s Code of Principles.
