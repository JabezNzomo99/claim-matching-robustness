We'll explain.\n\nThe federal government creates a budget every year. When it spends more money than it takes in, it runs a deficit. When tax revenues run higher than expenses, that's a budget surplus. At the end of the Clinton administration, there were several years of budget surpluses.\n\nBut those surpluses were not enough to compensate for the previous deficit years. So the government still carried what's called the national debt.\n\nHere, we wanted to look at Emanuel's claim that during the past eight years we've added $4 trillion to the national debt. Is it that much?\n\nTurns out, it's even more than that.\n\nEmanuel didn't mention the Bush administration specifically, but that's what most people think of when they think of the last eight years. So we decided to check the national debt from when Bush took office to when he left.\n\nWhen Bush took office, the national debt was $5.73 trillion. When he left, it was $10.7 trillion. That's a difference of $4.97 trillion, almost $1 trillion more than what Emanuel said.\n\nBut the debt has shot up significantly during the past few months, mostly due to the economic meltdown of 2008 and the government's efforts to shore up the federal banking system.\n\nAs recently as Sept. 18, 2008, Emanuel would have been correct with the $4 trillion number.\n\nYou can check out all these numbers for yourself via the Treasury Department's debt history search application .\n\nSo what does the Truth-O-Meter say when someone is off by $1 trillion? As we've said with our policy on statistical claims , \"to assess the truth for a numbers claim, the biggest factor is the underlying message.\" So even though he is off by about 20 percent, the fact that the number has been surging lately supports his point that the debt increased greatly under Bush. So we rate his statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
