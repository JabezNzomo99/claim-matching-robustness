Especially here in America where anyone can buy the drug of their choice almost anywhere. I hope we find a Rodrigo Duterte to solve these growing problem that affects numerous american household.\"\n\nAmerican entertainment news website TMZ, which the two websites used as their source, made no mention of the Philippine president in its Sept. 20, 2016 report on Jolie's divorce.\n\nFactnews.club's fake report was published four days after Duterte admitted that the only \"sin\" he is guilty of is \"extra-judicial killings.\" The government's war on drugs has been marked by killings of small-time drug peddlers and users during police operations.\n\nThe fake report have reached over 258,000 people, and was shared by the pages Hi Duterte and PinoyArtikulo.", "lang": "en"}
