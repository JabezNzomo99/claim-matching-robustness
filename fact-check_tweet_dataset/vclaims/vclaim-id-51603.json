The claim is false; an APWU spokesman said the image is not from the union, and a San Francisco-based graphic designer said she created it.\n\nThe August 13, 2020 tweet shows a list of items crossed off in red: SNOW RAIN HEAT NIGHT FASCISM,\" then says, \"Nothing stops the mail.\u201d It includes a United States Postal Service logo and a URL leading to the legitimate APWU website.\n\nThe user who posted the image included the caption: \u201cAbsolutely baller content from the postal workers union.\u201d\n\nAsked if the flyer was real, a spokesman for the postal union confirmed to AFP by email: \u201cThe answer is: NOPE. While we might agree with the message, our lawyers would have killed us if we stole the USPS logo.\u201d\n\nAnd San-Francisco-based graphic designer and small business owner Robin Winters told AFP via Twitter that she created the image on August 10, 2020, saying it was intended as a political cartoon.\n\n\u201cI made that meme!\u201d she said, adding: \u201cMy company wouldn't exist without USPS.\u201d\n\nWhile it may have been intended as political commentary, many users appear to have reshared it as official content from the postal workers union, including Mike Madrid, co-founder of a group run by dissident Republicans who have targeted Trump with slick TV ads.\n\nThe Lincoln Project\u2019s Madrid retweeted the image with the message: \u201cI\u2019ve never pushed out a union message before but damn...they\u2019ve nailed it.\u201d\n\nMore examples of users who appear to have reshared the image as official content are available on Twitter here and here, on Facebook here and in an online article here.\n\nMail-in ballots are a safer alternative to in-person voting for Americans fearful of the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 170,000 people in the US, the highest toll of any country.\n\nWith the appointment of Postmaster General General Louis DeJoy, a frequent Republican donor, by the USPS Board of Governors and new cost-cutting policies came anxieties that the mail will be slower come election time.\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed that mail-in voting for the presidential election will result in widespread fraud, although there is no evidence to support such claims, which AFP Fact Check has previously addressed. Trump even suggested delaying the November 3 election, something which has virtually no chance of being accepted.\n\nCritics, including Barack Obama, say Trump is trying to undermine the postal service to win the election.", "lang": "en"}
