The claim is false; a closer analysis of the video shows a police officer firing tear gas; police confirmed officers had fired tear gas at the station.\n\nThe video was published in this Facebook post on August 11, 2019, where it has been viewed more than 76,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe traditional Chinese caption translates to English as: \u201cOnline information about the clashes at Kwai Fong station just now: It's been confirmed that police fired rubber bullets, not CS canisters, at Kwai Fong station.\n\n\u201cThe smoke on the scene was a result of protesters using fire extinguishers targeting police. Police were firing rubber bullets at the time\u201d.\n\nThe video was filmed in Hong Kong\u2019s Kwai Fong MTR station.\n\nThe video was shared the same day that thousands of pro-democracy protesters rallied for the tenth weekend in a row in Hong Kong. This AFP report gives details on the situation in Kwai Fong station on August 11.\n\nThe report states in part: \u201cProtesters also faced off against police in the Kwai Fong train station, with the demonstrators using fire extinguishers and a water hose against riot officers who fired tear gas into the terminal.\u201d\n\nThe same video was shared here and here on Facebook and here on Twitter with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim that police did not fire tear gas is false; an analysis of the video shows a police officer firing tear gas; police said they had fired tear gas at the station.\n\nThe video in the misleading posts includes the watermark for Sing the Press (STP), a Hong Kong news portal. STP published the video here on Facebook on August 11.\n\nThe traditional Chinese language text included in the bottom left hand corner of the video translates to English as: \u201cPolice fired tear gas inside Kwai Fong station\u201d.\n\nThe 14 second video in the misleading posts shows a group of riot police entering Kwai Fong station. A group of protesters standing on the opposite side of the ticket barrier can be seen using a fire extinguisher, before one officer runs towards them and fires tear gas. The other officers follow the first officer, before they all move away from the ticket barrier.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the sequence in the video with the officer holding the tear gas gun circled in red by AFP:\n\nBelow is a magnified screenshot comparison of the officer holding the tear gas gun in the STP video (L) next to this AFP image of a tear gas gun used during the protest on August 11 (R):\n\nImmediately after the incident, Hong Kong police told local media that they had not used tear gas at Kwai Fong station on August 11, Hong Kong TV i-Cable News reported here on August 12.\n\nThe Cantonese-language news report states, in part: \u201cPolice told us last night they had only fired rubber bullets, but not tear gas, inside the station, and that the smoke was caused by the fire extinguishers used by protesters.\n\n\u201cWe asked again and police admitted having used both rubber bullets and tear gas. They said tear gas had not been fired when they responded to us last night.\n\n\u201cChecking our record, we made the inquiry about 9:30 pm last night, which was about 20 minutes after police fired inside the station.\u201d\n\nOn August 12, 2019 Hong Kong Police Force said officers used both rubber bullets and tear gas at Kwai Fong station on August 11, 2019 in this police press conference streamed live on its official Facebook page.\n\nThe comments in Cantonese by Senior Superintendent Kong Wing-cheung of Media Liaison and Communication, Police Public Relations Branch, can be heard at the 57 minutes and two seconds mark of the video.\n\nHis comments translate to English as: \u201cAround 9:30 pm last night, members of the Emergency Unit New Territories South started a dispersal operation at the Kwai Chung Police Station.\n\n\u201cDuring the operation, officers passed by Kwai Fong MTR station, inside which at the time, as seen in various videos, was a large group of protesters.\n\n\u201cSome violent protesters targeted officers using slings and steel balls. They also lit smoke-producing material inside the station, so smoke was seen there. I must say their behaviours posed danger to other people at the station.\n\n\u201cThe situation was very urgent so our officers, following their assessment, fired one shot of tear gas at the station. This I admit, we have fired one shot of tear gas.\n\n\u201cWe assessed firstly, the urgency of the situation and secondly, the fact that Kwai Fong MTR station, unlike other MTR stations, is not underground but semi-open.\n\n\u201cIn order to resolve the crisis, our colleagues fired one shot of tear gas. Upon seeing the situation appeared to be under control and that there was no more attack, we did not fire a second shot.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
