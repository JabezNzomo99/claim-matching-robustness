Ilhan Omar said, \u201cWhen we win in November, we will eliminate Social Security entitlements for seniors.\u201d\n\nThere is no record of Omar making the comments attributed to her in the article. The story was lifted from a parody news website.\n\nThe Facebook post links to an article, titled \u201cOmar: \u2018When We Win in November, We Will Eliminate Social Security Entitlements for Seniors,'\u201d published by the website CPJ News on July 10. Omar made the vow to do away with such benefits during a rally for Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the article alleges.\n\nOmar tweeted an endorsement for Sanders in October 2019, before he suspended his presidential campaign in April. She has since expressed support for former Vice President Joe Biden, tweeting the she \u201cwill vote for him and help him defeat Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese old people haven\u2019t earned these entitlements!\u201d the CPJ News article quotes Omar as saying during a Sanders rally. \u201cWe need more funding for our infrastructure and education centers and the biggest government expense is social security entitlements for senior citizens. We will have these phased out completely by 2024. We need to look toward the future generations and provide them welfare benefits, not the past of these older generations.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no evidence Omar called to \u201celiminate Social Security entitlements for seniors.\u201d Searching news reports and her congressional website didn\u2019t turn up any instance of Omar making the comments attributed to her in the article. The statements also don\u2019t appear on her social media pages.\n\nOmar has advocated for expanding some federal entitlement programs during her congressional tenure. (RELATED: Did Democrats Introduce A Bill To \u2018Euthanize Seniors\u2019 To Save Social Security?)\n\n\u201cWe should expand Medicaid, UI and SNAP, but we must deliver universal funds now!\u201d she stated in a March 19 tweet thread about a coronavirus economic relief package she proposed. \u201cUniversal programs ensure that every American has a stake in our policies \u2013 that\u2019s why programs like Social Security are so successful.\u201d\n\nThe CPJ News article lifts word-for-word from a story published by Bustatroll.org, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d Yet, while Bustatroll.org disclaims that \u201ceverything on this website is fiction,\u201d CPJ News fails to make clear the content is satirical, portraying it as fact.\n\nThe reposting of parody news stories without clearly identifying that the content is satirical is a common way misinformation spreads online. In January, the Daily Caller debunked a viral article claiming President Donald Trump signed an executive order instituting term limits for Congress that originated on the satire website Daily World Update.", "lang": "en"}
