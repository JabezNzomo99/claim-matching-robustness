It has been shared over 7600 times so far. As can be seen, floating lanterns dominate the skyline over what is purportedly the famous ghats of Varanasi. The image has also been shared on Twitter.\n\nAlt News found that the image in question is photoshopped. We first reverse-searched the image on both Google and Yandex, but this yielded no result. Then, we cropped the portion of the image containing the floating lanterns and reverse-searched it on Yandex.\n\nWe found the identical image posted on Flickr, titled \u2018Thailand Day 09, Yi Peng Khom Loi Festival 2013, Maejo University, Chiang Mai\u2019.\n\nThe two images have been juxtaposed and placed below for comparison. Notice the similarities (marked in green and yellow).\n\nA lantern-filled skyline was superimposed on a photograph of Varanasi ghats. We found a similar image of the ghats (same location) taken from a different angle.\n\nIt may thus be noted that the image shared on social media, claimed to be of the Varanasi ghats, is photoshopped.", "lang": "en"}
