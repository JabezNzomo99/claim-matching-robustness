The channel claimed that the virus was more dangerous than the novel coronavirus and was next in line to kill people. However, this claim by the channel is false and misleading. There is no truth to the claim that the virus, named \u2018Tiranga virus\u2019 thus far, can be compared to coronavirus, can kill humans or even be transmitted to humans. On 13 May, Hindi news channel TV9 Bharatvarsh aired a news report about a virus that has been reported by tomato farmers in Maharashtra. The report said that this virus, named \u2018Tiranga virus\u2019, was more dangerous than the prevailing coronavirus and that it was being said that this was a new version of coronavirus which was mixed in vegetables. Now Red Virus after Corona? So is this how it all ends? \u00f0\u009f\u008c\u009d #TirangaVirus pic.twitter.com/dKWk4oT46Z \u2014 Anamika (@MiishNottyAna) May 15, 2020 Below is a screenshot from the news package, which says: \u201cThe entry of a virus more dangerous than coronavirus?\u201d Police Notice to Ex-MLA in Bulandshahr Shared With False Context\n\nThe Quint spoke to renowned Indian virologist Dr Jacob T. John and former head of the Indian Council for Medical Research's Centre for Advanced Research in Virology regarding this virus, who rubbished the claims made by TV9 Bharatvarsh. \u201cPlant viruses do not infect humans. The receptors that the virus needs for entry into human cells is very different from plant viruses. Animal viruses, yes, but not plant viruses. There is absolutely no reason to fear.\u201d Dr John said, speaking to The Quint He further stressed that even if one were to consume the infected or diseased tomato, there would be no effect on humans whatsoever. \u201cAll the time we eat a lot of vegetables. Many of them are infected with viruses. So you can guarantee that a tomato virus will not affect human beings. Even if you eat the infected tomatoes, no sickness will come,\u201d he further added. The Quint also reached out to Dr Shahid Jameel, an Indian virologist and the chief executive officer of Wellcome Trust DBT India Alliance, who also reiterated that plant viruses don\u2019t affect humans. \u201cThere\u2019s not ever been a single case of a plant virus affecting humans or animals. It\u2019s complete rubbish. There is no potential of any plant virus causing disease in humans and vice versa. Animal viruses don\u2019t cause any disease in plants either,\u201d Dr Jameel stated. Can Camphora 1M Provide Prevention and Treatment for COVID-19?\n\nThe former Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Prithviraj Chavan has also called out TV9 Bharatvarsh, saying that their \u201cirresponsible reporting\u201d must be punished. A report about \u00e2\u0080\u009c#Tiranga_virus in tomatoes\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Maharashtra was broadcasted by a Hindi News Channel on 13 May. Prices crashed immediately and tomato farmers have suffered huge losses. Such irresponsible reporting must be punished. Govt must compensate farmers.

Centre must issue an SOP & a Code for reportage. Any #CORONA related sensitive news must be put out only with prior approval from ICMR or Central Govt. (2/2) \u2014 Prithviraj Chavan (@prithvrj) May 17, 2020 We also found some agricultural news portals who called out the report as fake and misleading. A website called Agri News Network also said that Dr BNS Murthy, Horticulture Commissioner, Department of Agriculture Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), had taken note of the report and said that \u201cthe second part of the story that eating such fruits would cause much more complications than that of Corona virus is absurd. As of date no plant virus affecting plants has affected human beings as they lack the receptors for such an infection.\u201d We also looked up \u2018Tiranga virus\u2019 on Google and found a report by The Indian Express, dated 2 May, which said that tomato growers in Maharashtra had complained about an unidentified disease that was causing tomatoes to ripen early. The report quotes a farmer in the state\u2019s Satara district, Ajit Korade, who said this early ripening of the tomatoes was forcing farmers to junk the fruit and that spraying fungicides had had no effect. Korade also told The Indian Express that he would have to abandon the crop if the disease persisted and spread.\n\nAccording to the report, an entomologist Ankush Chormale has asked for state agricultural universities and the Agriculture department to contain the disease, warning that it would wipe out the crop. It can be seen that there is no mention of either coronavirus or the possibility of the disease spreading to humans in the report. A follow-up report by The Indian Express on 14 May also did not mention any such possibility and said that samples of affected tomato plants had been sent to the Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Horticulture Research to identify the virus that was affecting the crop. The report simply said that the virus was causing distress to farmers as they were losing their crop and that no known treatment had had any effect. A report by The Hindu Business Line from 12 May also spoke about the virus but only about its effects on the tomato crop and said that samples had been sent for examination. The report further said that \u201ca scientist at the Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth said an analysis of the tomato samples is underway but conclusions have not been reached.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
