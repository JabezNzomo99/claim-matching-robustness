This claim is false; the video has circulated online since March 2019 in reports about a blaze in Kaifeng.\n\nThe video was published here on Facebook on April 24, 2020.\n\nIt has been viewed more than 5,200 times.\n\nThe four-minute 39-second footage shows a fire burning a multi-storey building. Several voices can be heard throughout the video, shouting \u201cfire\u201d in Mandarin.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s caption, written in traditional Chinese, translates to English as: \u201cLast night in Kaifeng, Henan, flames in a residential area were spreading fast.\u201d\n\nThe video was also published here and here on Facebook in March and April 2020, alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video actually shows a fire that erupted in Kaifeng more than one year ago.\n\nA reverse image search of keyframes extracted from the video and a subsequent keyword search found a shorter version of the clip published here on the Weibo account of Chinese state-run newspaper Global Times on March 16, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of Global Times\u2019 Weibo post:\n\nBelow are two sets of screenshot comparison between the video in the misleading post (L) and the Global Times video (R):\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: \u201c[High-rise residential building on fire / Spread from the third to 17th floor within two minutes / \u201cFlame pillar\u201d only extinguished after 40 minutes] On the evening of March 14, a fire broke out at a high-rise residential building in Yuanhong Jinjiang residential area, Binhe Road, Yuwangtai district, Kaifeng city, Henan province.\n\n\u201cThe blaze started between two third-floor units and later shot up over the building, reaching the 17th floor in about two minutes. @Kaifeng Fire Service reported that the fire was successfully put out after more than 40 minutes, with no casualties. The cause of the fire is under investigation.\u201d\n\nA further keyword search on the WeChat account of Kaifeng Fire Service found this March 15, 2019, report about the March 14 fire at the same location, and this April 7, 2019, report on the investigation.\n\nThe title of the April 7, 2019, report states: \u201cNotice on investigation of a fire at building 4, Yuanhong Jinjiang residential area, Yuwangtai district, Kaifeng city\u201d.\n\nThe article reads, in part: \u201cThe fire started west of a north-facing terrace that belonged to unit 2, second floor, building 4, where combustible materials were stored.
