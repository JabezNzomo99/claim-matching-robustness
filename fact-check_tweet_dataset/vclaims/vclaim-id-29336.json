Yes, if you believe\n\nby many of the country\u2019s reputable publications.\n\nThis was for fashion purposes,\n\n, with the convenience of wigs and their ability to transform a person\u2019s look \u201cin seconds\u201d said to be behind the trend.\n\nBut is the eye-raising statistic accurate?\n\nThe reports all cited a study by the\n\nThe survey of 1,100 women aged 18 to 35 found that \u201cno fewer than eight out of 10 Nigerian women\u201d wore wigs daily.\n\nAccording to the reports, the survey found that\n\nof respondents owned wigs and preferred them to sew-in weaves. Those who did not wear wigs (\n\n) said they were heavy.\n\nowned one to three wigs and\n\nowned six or more, so they could wear different wigs on different days.\n\nAfrica Check contacted Anita Eboigbe, the agency reporter who conducted the survey. She said the research was done in December 2018 and January 2019.\n\n\u201cI conducted the survey in Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no team involved in carrying out the survey. I practically carried out the survey myself.\u201d\n\nThis was as part of a larger topic \u201ca friend\u201d was working on, Eboigbe said. \u201cNigerian ladies and wigs (which is the focus of my study) was more or less a subset of what my colleague was working on.\u201d\n\nEboigbe did not give details on how the survey was structured.\n\nThe study should have considered at least two or three states in each of Nigeria\u2019s six geopolitical zones, said Tunde Akinoladokun, a retired statistician.\n\n\u201cThe result of the survey should not be generalised to all Nigerian women. She also didn\u2019t consider women in rural areas. Women who aren't working should have been included in the survey.\u201d\n\nof economics at the\n\nagreed the sample used should have been more widespread.\n\n\u201cFor the fact that she only considered three states, I would say it is a study of major cities in Nigeria. We can't use the study to judge Nigerian women in general.\u201d\n\nThe study should also have considered income levels in other states, Adebayo added.\n\nTo generalise the result, the researcher would have needed to interview women across states, ages, income brackets and other key criteria, said Emmanuella Akarawak, a data analyst at the\n\nEboigbe said the headlines did not reflect the findings of the survey, which was still ongoing.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t cast the headline though, my editors did,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what I always ensure is that whenever I write a story the body is a true picture of my intentions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know the headline should have included the states I mentioned, but that isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d\n\nConclusion: Data doesn't support claim that eight in 10 Nigerian women wear wigs daily.\n\nA survey widely reported in the media claimed 81.8% of women in Nigeria wore wigs daily. Some 1,100 women aged 18 to 35 in Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt were interviewed.\n\nBut experts said survey results from only working class women in the three cities couldn\u2019t be said to apply to all the women in Nigeria.\n\nAn expert said the researcher would have had to interview women across states, ages, income brackets and other key criteria to get a broader result.\n\nWe therefore rate the claim as reported in the media as misleading.\n\nBut she did say she had \u201cfocused on working-class women in the three states\u201d.But the survey as reported could not apply to all of Nigeria, statisticians told Africa Check.", "lang": "en"}
