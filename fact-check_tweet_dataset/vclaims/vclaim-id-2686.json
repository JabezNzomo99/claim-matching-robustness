That\u2019s lower than the rate in 1970, which was 7.9 per 100,000 inhabitants, and it\u2019s lower than the peak rate of 10.2 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1980. Overall, the rate in 2015 was lower than any other time between 1965 and 2009.\n\nTrump has been making the bogus claim for at least two weeks now, most recently in an Oct. 26 speech in Charlotte, North Carolina, where he talked about his plan to provide a \u201cnew deal for black America.\u201d\n\nTrump, Oct. 26: The problem is not the presence of police, but the absence of police. We need really a great group of people to keep you safe, to keep us all safe, to keep us all safe. You know the murder rate in the United States, I don\u2019t know if you know this because the press never talks about it, is the highest it\u2019s been, think of this, in 45 years. Nobody knows that. The murder rate, highest it\u2019s been in 45 years.\n\nTrump made the same false claim five days prior to that at a campaign event in Fletcher, North Carolina.\n\nAnd even before that, at a campaign event in Panama City, Florida, on Oct. 11, Trump asked the crowd: \u201cAnd by the way, do you know, it was just announced that murder is the highest it\u2019s been in our country in 45 years? You\u2019ve heard that right?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not even true based on raw numbers.\n\nThere were 15,696 murders in 2015, according to FBI estimates. That was fewer than the estimated number of murders in 1970 (16,000) and every year after that until 1999.\n\nThe murder rate in 2015 is actually the highest since 2009, when it was 5 per 100,000 people. That\u2019s six years ago, not 45.\n\nSo what is Trump talking about?\n\nAccording to the FBI, the 2015 murder rate was 10 percent higher than it was in 2014 \u2014 the highest one-year increase \u201cin nearly half a century,\u201d according to the New York Times.\n\nThat one-year increase may be what Trump meant to say. In fact, he came close to using the actual statistic in the second presidential debate on Oct. 9, when he said, \u201cWe have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years.\u201d It\u2019s the one-year increase nationwide.\n\nBut even then, he\u2019s wrong to say that \u201cthe press never talks about it,\u201d since the Times wrote about it.\n\nWhen the FBI released its latest annual report on U.S. crime statistics on Sept. 26, the Times said this in the opening sentence: \u201cThe country\u2019s murder rate jumped more last year than it had in nearly half a century, newly released federal crime data showed, although the number of homicides remained far below the levels of the 1980s and \u201990s.\u201d\n\nThe Times quoted Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s too early to call this an end to the crime drop, but we are facing a one-year rise in murders that is quite substantial \u2014 the largest in about half a century.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not at all the same thing as saying that \u201cthe murder rate in the United States is the highest it\u2019s been in 45 years,\u201d as Trump has wrongly said now on more than one occasion.", "lang": "en"}
