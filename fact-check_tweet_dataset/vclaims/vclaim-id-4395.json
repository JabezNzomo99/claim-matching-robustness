On Tuesday morning, President Trump jumped on the story, tweeting it out to his over 50 million followers.\n\n\"Just out that the Obama Administration granted citizenship, during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation, to 2,500 Iranians - including to government officials,\" Mr. Trump tweeted. \"How big (and bad) is that?\"\n\nIs there any truth to the claim?\n\nFox News noted in its story that there's no evidence to support Zolnour's claim. Zolnour is a hard-liner, and was using the claim as a cudgel against his more moderate foes in Tehran. His point was that allies of the comparatively moderate Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, were benefiting from a secret deal with the U.S. that runs counter to Iranian interests.\n\nBut former Obama staffers are saying that there is zero truth to Zolnour's claim. \"The allegation is absurd and entirely false. It shouldn't be lost on anyone that this is a case of Donald Trump parroting Fox News, which is peddling the claims of an Iranian hardliner,\" Jeff Prescott, the former senior director on President Obama's National Security Council, told CBS News.", "lang": "en"}
