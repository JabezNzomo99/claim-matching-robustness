Early in her speech, she praised Sanders for putting economic and social justice issues \"front and center, where they belong.\"\n\nClinton gave Sanders a nod again when she laid out her plans to invest in the nation\u2019s bridges and highways, cut the cost of college tuition and make it easier for small businesses to get loans. She promised it all would be paid for.\n\n\"And here's how: Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes,\" Clinton said. \"Not because we resent success. Because when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent, that's where the money is.\"\n\nClinton\u2019s claim about who\u2019s been getting most of the gains comes -- almost -- straight from Sanders.\n\nOn the opening night of the convention, he offered a slightly toned down version saying \"the top 1 percent in recent years has earned 85 percent of all new income.\"\n\nThe problem is, when we looked into that, we found that the numbers are out of date.\n\nUniversity of California Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez is the go-to source on income inequality. According to Saez\u2019s latest data, the top 1 percent took in 52 percent of all income in 2015.\n\nAs recently as 2012, the fraction was close to 90 percent, but here\u2019s how things have changed since then:\n\nWhen we reached out to the Clinton campaign, they cited a fact-check we wrote in 2015. But as we\u2019ve noted, the trend has changed. Inequality still exists, but not at the level the country was seeing before.\n\nAs Saez explained in his most recent report, \"In 2014 and especially in 2015, the incomes of bottom 99 percent families have finally started recovering in earnest from the losses of the Great Recession.\"\n\nClinton said that \"more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent.\" That statistic was approximately correct a few years ago, but today, one of the nation\u2019s leading authorities on income distribution says a more accurate figure is that 52 percent of all income flows to the top 1 percent.\n\nThat still reveals a great deal of inequality, but not at the scale Clinton said.", "lang": "en"}
