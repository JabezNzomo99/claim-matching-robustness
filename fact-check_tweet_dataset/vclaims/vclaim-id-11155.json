UK Government ministers have been there in Europe arguing for tariffs on imported Chinese rebar steel, that will help sell steel in Cardiff, tariffs on other steel products coming in. You are completely wrong.\"\n\nSince Tata Steel announced its decision to sell its remaining steel plants in the UK, many have been quick to blame the decline of the British steel industry on China\u2019s \u2018dumping\u2019 of cheap exports on the European market, and say the government has failed to act against it.\n\nBritain has objected to the European Commission\u2019s proposals to raise the duty imposed on Chinese steel imports. That\u2019s been indicated by the Business Secretary and a Council memo, although we don\u2019t know the precise position taken by the government at the European Council.\n\nThe Commission currently imposes a number of \u2018anti-dumping duties\u2019 which vary depending on the product, and the government has supported the imposition of a \u201cduty that is [set at the rate] required to correct the harm.\u201d\n\nChina is being accused of dumping its steel products on the EU, selling them for less than they are worth. That makes it harder for steel producers here to compete. Anti-dumping duties raise the price of imported steel to help protect local producers.\n\nThe EU is responsible for setting these duties on behalf of all member states, including the UK.\n\nThe EU has been investigating accusations that China is dumping steel in the European market since 2008, and has imposed an anti-dumping duty set by the \u201clesser duty rule\u201d.\n\nThis rule means that duties can\u2019t exceed the level needed to repair the harm done to European industry by the unfair dumping practices. In other words, the duties aren\u2019t supposed to give an industry an advantage, only repair any damage done.\n\nThe rate is currently set at between 9% and 13% for rebar steel and 13% to 25% for cold-rolled steel which is what Ms Wood was referring to. The duties will vary for other types.\n\nEU duties are lower than US equivalents\n\nThe duties currently imposed by the EU upon Chinese steel imports are lower than those set in some other countries.\n\nLeanne Wood is correct to say that the United States imposed an anti-dumping duty of about 265% in March, although this applies specifically to cold-rolled steel from China. This rate was confirmed in May.\n\nThe US applied anti-dumping duties of between 6% and 31% to steel originating from British factories at the same time.\n\nEuropean Commission plans to raise duties haven\u2019t been supported by Britain\n\nIn 2013, the European Commission submitted plans intended to discourage what it called certain \u201cunfair trading practices\u201d. These would allow the EU to impose higher import duties in cases where it believes a government is subsidising exports in a way that undermines a raw materials industry in Europe, such as steel.\n\nBritain has been accused by both trade bodies and other European officials of blocking these reforms.\n\nWe don\u2019t know the precise position taken by British ministers in European Council discussions\u2014these usually take place in private. We do know that the UK signed up to a memo sent to the committee tasked with overseeing the reforms, calling for the status quo to be maintained.\n\nThis would have kept in place limits on the tariffs the EU can impose through the lesser duty rule\u2019.\n\nBusiness Secretary Sajid Javid has also said the government doesn\u2019t wish to see \u201cdisproportionate\u201d duties introduced, arguing that this could have a negative impact on companies which use, rather than manufacture, steel in the UK.\n\nBritish objections to the reform of anti-dumping measures are nothing new. The EU dropped a similar attempt to change European law on the matter in 2008, with then-EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson stating that he didn\u2019t want \u201cto bring forward proposals prematurely that would exacerbate differences among member states\u201d.\n\nOne analysis by the Swedish Board of Trade of votes at the Council showed that the Ministers from the previous Labour government voted strongly against the reforms, while other steel-producing nations such as France, Italy and Spain voted overwhelmingly in favour.\n\nBritain is not (yet) calling for a reduction in anti-dumping duties\n\nWhile the UK might have objected to proposals to reform the lesser duty rule, it can point to other efforts it has made to protect the UK steel industry from dumping.\n\nIn February Mr Javid was a signatory to a letter calling from the Commission to make \u201cfull and timely use of the full range of EU trade policy instruments to tackle unfair trade, including anti subsidy measures, to ensure a global level playing field.\u201d\n\nThe Business Secretary also told Parliament that he believed that \u201cthe tools that are required are already there but they just seem to be slow when they are being used [by the Commission].\u201d\n\nHe also called for the application of \u201cthe duty that is required to correct the harm that is being done to the domestic market\u201d. Critics point out that the current lesser duty rule isn\u2019t able to deliver on this promise. In one example the Commission\u2019s estimated dumping rate is up to 66%, but the duties are only up to 13%.\n\nWhile the UK government isn\u2019t currently calling for lower duties to be imposed on Chinese imports, this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Leanne Wood is wrong.\n\nBritain is thought to be a supporter of China\u2019s quest to be granted \u2018Market Economy Status\u2019 by the EU, a move which if it were successful, could result in a lowering of anti-dumping duties.\n\nWe originally said that the rates on Chinese steel ranged from 9% to 16%, depending on the type of steel. There are actually cases with larger rates than these. We\u2019ve updated the piece to cover these cases and specify the types of steel being talked about.", "lang": "en"}
