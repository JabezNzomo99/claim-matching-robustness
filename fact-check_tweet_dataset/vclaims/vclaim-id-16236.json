Unemployment is way up here. He\u2019s hired more employees, more people, than anyone I know in the world.\"\n\nWashington never said this.\n\nThe quote actually comes from a March 5 New York Post article where Charles Evers, the brother of late civil rights activist Medgar Evers, discusses his endorsement of Trump.\n\nFurthermore, Washington\u2019s spokesman told the BBC that the story was completed fabricated.\n\nAmericanPoliticNews wrote a story claiming that Denzel Washington has thrown his support behind Trump, with the headline, \"Denzel Washington Switches to Trump Shocks Hollywood, Speaks Out Against Obama.\"\n\nThe story is completely fabricated and uses a quote from another story and attributes it to Washington.
