At 33:29 mins, in the extended video of the rally uploaded by Gujarat Congress on their YouTube Channel, when Alpesh Thakor had asked people to raise slogans in support of Gandhi, they actually said, \u201cRahul Gandhi Zindabad\u201d.\n\nIn 2017, ABP News had fact-checked the same edited video, when it had gone viral on social media during the Gujarat Assembly election. Despite several media outlets debunking the video, it continues to circulate on social media. With the general election around the corner, social media users should be circumspect about viral images and videos, which may be propagated by supporters of political parties to mislead voters.", "lang": "en"}
