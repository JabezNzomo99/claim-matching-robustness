Here is a fact check of this claim.\n\nClaim: Trump: \u201c Who do you like the most?\u201d. Kid: \u201cModi\u201d Fact: If one searches with the key word \u2018Trump with Little Kid\u2019 on YouTube, a video published by Fox10 news channel can be seen. The video that is going viral on Facebook is the same video, but the audio has been modified. In the original video, Trump can be seen asking the Kid if he wants to go back to his parents or stay with Trump to which the Kid answers Trump. Hence the video that is being shared on Facebook is not the original one, but the one with modified audio.\n\nFinally, the Kid did not say Modi.", "lang": "en"}
