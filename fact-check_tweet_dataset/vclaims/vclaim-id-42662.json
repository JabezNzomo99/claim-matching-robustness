Lacson only said his team found 'no pork' during their preliminary study.", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Nov 13, 2019 1:00 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-42662", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/lacson-declares-2020-budget-truly-pork-free", "vclaim": "The facts: Senator Lacson only said that his team found \"no pork\" during their preliminary study of the General Appropriations Bill submitted by the House of Representatives to the Senate. The Mindanation.com article failed to mention that the Senate is still reviewing it and that it's still too early to tell whether or not there is pork in the budget.\n\nLacson said these \u201cunclear\u201d items amount to P20 billion, which came from the National Expenditure Program (NEP) submitted by Malaca\u00f1ang. This went through the House but was not scrutinized because of its speedy passage in September.\n\n\u201cMaski hindi nagalaw ng HOR ('yung NEP), may mga napansin din kami na may mga hindi malinaw kung saan dadalhin ang pondo. Hindi malinaw. Naka-park ito kung saan-saan,\u201d Lacson said. (Even though the House did not touch the NEP, we noticed questionable items in the budget where it\u2019s not clear where the funds will be used. It\u2019s not clear. It\u2019s parked in different agencies.)\n\nTwo days later, on November 5, Lacson was on another interview with DZBB where he said: \"Hindi pa natin masabi (kung may pork) kasi hindi natin nakikita ang implementation (ng ibang line items) at hindi pa tapos ang deliberations sa Senado,\" he said. (We can't say for sure yet if there is pork because we still can't see the implementation of some of the unclear line items and the Senate deliberations are still ongoing.)\n\nAlthough the senator said his team found no pork during their first look, he also clarified a day after on November 4 that the P20-billion lump sum funds they found can be considered pork based on a 2013 Supreme Court ruling that declared the pork barrel system unconstitutional.\n\nMindanation.com has not published an update to their story to include Lacson\u2019s recent statements as of writing. What they published separately on November 5, however, was an article on Senator Bong Go assuring the public of a \u201cpork-free\u201d national budget. There was no mention of Lacson in this article.", "lang": "en"}
