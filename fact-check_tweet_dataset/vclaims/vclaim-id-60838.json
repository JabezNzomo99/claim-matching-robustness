PolitiFact Florida decided to take a closer look.\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t as clear cut as you might imagine.\n\nMost policy analysts watching Common Core agree that its implementation carries expenses. The National Conference of State Legislatures of what to expect: one-time transition costs such as new instructional materials, tests, technology and teacher training, and ongoing maintenance and updates.\n\n\"When taking into account all of the things that need to be updated and the fact that it\u2019s difficult for state education agencies to change their practice (move away from \u2018business as usual\u2019), I think it will be extremely challenging to keep costs flat,\" said Anne Hyslop, an education analyst for the New America Foundation.\n\nIndeed, the Florida Department of Education created a spreadsheet in February detailing more than $100 million in Common Core projects the state had embarked upon.\n\nThe items included $24 million for the creation of student tutorial lessons, $4.7 million to generate math assessments and lesson study toolkits, and $25.5 million for a database of test questions for teachers to use. Funding for the vast majority of these projects came from a federal Race to the Top grant that Florida won, in part, for agreeing to adopt the Common Core.\n\nDuring the spring 2013 legislative session, Florida lawmakers noted that testing for the new standards would require computers, and they adopted a law barring the state from using Common Core-affiliated tests until all schools had the needed technology in place. The noted that the State Board of Education requested $442 million for the improvements, a number later revised downward to $100 million.\n\nSo the Common Core price tag is well documented.\n\n\"It costs something,\" said Patrick Murphy, research director for the Public Policy Institute of California. \"The question is, does it cost extra money than we were going to spend?\"\n\nMurphy noted Stewart\u2019s use of the word \"additional,\" and said that makes all the difference.\n\n\"It is not impossible to conceive of a scenario where existing funds that may have been slated for, say, \u2018general\u2019 professional development will be used to focus on the (Common Core). If I was running a school district, that is what I would do,\" he said.\n\nIn a titled \"Putting a Price Tag on the Common Core,\" Murphy and colleagues put forth three models under which states might implement Common Core -- \"Bare Bones,\" \"Business as Usual\" and \"Balanced.\" In two of the three possibilities, the group projected Florida to carry millions in added costs.\n\nFlorida Department of Education officials did not have any reports that separated costs out in such a way.\n\nState officials noted, though, that adoption of the standards cost nothing, and that much of the implementation, such as training and textbook purchases, would have been funded in some form even if the state weren\u2019t using the standards.\n\n\"The purchase of materials for the new standards was embedded in our regular instructional materials purchase cycle so did not result in additional purchases or increased costs unless school districts chose to do so,\" DOE spokeswoman Tiffany Cowie said in an email.\n\nAs another example, the state\u2019s move to improve school technology could be attributed to a 2011 legislative mandate to have , or an even earlier press to .\n\n\"This process began before Florida\u2019s standards were adopted and will continue regardless of Florida\u2019s new standards,\" Cowie said.\n\nAlso, Florida has paid about $30.59 per student annually for FCAT testing in recent years. It has not selected a Common Core test, so it has no estimate for the potential cost differences.\n\n\"If the department chooses PARCC, no additional cost will be incurred, as the creation of the test is free to all participating PARCC states,\" Cowie said. \"If another test is selected, there will be costs associated with the procurement of a new test.\"\n\nFrom the department\u2019s view, then, much of the money would have been spent on similar projects anyway, with or without the new standards.\n\nStewart said implementation of the Common Core would not incur additional expenses. Some of the money spent on Common Core is money the state would have spent anyway on curriculum and testing. But experts said it\u2019s unlikely that implementing the new standards cost the state no additional money. Another wrinkle: The state received a federal grant to help pay for Common Core implementation.", "lang": "en"}
