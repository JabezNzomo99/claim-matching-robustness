But Pepsi forgot two little words on the pledge, \u201cUnder God.\u201d Pepsi said they did not want to offend anyone. If this is true then we do not want to offend anyone at the Pepsi corporate office. If we do not buy any Pepsi product then they will not receive any of our monies. Our money after all does have the words \u201cUnder God\u201d on it. Please pass this word to everyone you know. Tell your Sunday School class tomorrow and tell your Pastors so that they can tell the whole congregation. Christians stand up and let your voices be heard. We want the words \u201cunder God\u201d to be read by every person who buys a can. To drink or not to drink? Coca-Cola has a new patriotic can coming out with pictures of the Empire State Building and the Pledge of Allegiance on them. But Coke forgot two little words on the pledge, \u201cUnder God.\u201d Coke said they did not want to offend anyone. If this is true then we do not want to offend anyone at the Coke corporate office. If we do not buy any Coke products then they will not receive any of our monies. Our money, after all, does have the words \u201cUnder God\u201d on it. If you agree with this policy, please pass this word to everyone you know. Coke doesn\u2019t have the right to rewrite the Pledge Of Allegiance!! If you do not agree, just erase or delete this message.\n\nAlthough there once was at least some element of truth to the item quoted above about the omission of the words \u201cunder God\u201d from the Pledge of Allegiance on a soda can, the information it contains is long outdated and never had anything to do with Pepsi or Coca-Cola. Neither of those companies is producing, or has it ever produced, redesigned cans bearing any portion of the Pledge of Allegiance or an image of the Empire State Building. This issue concerns a special patriotic can design briefly produced by back in November 2001, a can which was marketed for a limited time and has been off store shelves for well over fourteen years (since\n\nThe brouhaha began in mid-November 2001, when the soft drink company, in response to the terrorist attacks on America a few months earlier, introduced a new can design featuring the Statue of Liberty with the words \u201cONE INDIVISIBLE\u201d from the Pledge of Allegiance displayed above it:\n\nDr Pepper did not print the entire Pledge of Allegiance on its cans while leaving out the words \u2018under God\u2019; it invoked the Pledge of Allegiance by using a mere three words from the pledge. However, because the three words chose to use were the ones surrounding the phrase \u2018under God\u2019 (which was not itself part of the original pledge as written by in 1892 but was added to the pledge by an act of Congress in 1954), the new patriotic can design prompted calls for boycotts from some religious groups and news media who maintained that had \u201comitted \u2018under God'\u201d from its version of the Pledge (because the words fall where used ellipses) and publicized the issue by encouraging a campaign of sending and letters of complaint to the company:\n\nDr Pepper has designed a new patriotic can featuring the Statue of Liberty and the Pledge of Allegiance, but they left out the phrase \u201cunder God\u201d from the Pledge of Allegiance. When asked why, replied: \u201cWe felt \u2018One best represented the message we were trying to get across.\u201d Dr Pepper has also used the excuse that wasn\u2019t enough room on the can for the words \u201cUnder God\u201d. The real reason is that the company didn\u2019t want to risk offending anyone who doesn\u2019t believe in God. Bad timing. After the events of 9/11, that\u2019s just not politically correct anymore! I really do like Diet Dr Pepper, but I\u2019m joining the ranks of those who won\u2019t be buying another one until new cans are printed that include the whole Pledge of Allegiance. I don\u2019t want them to simply yank the cans off the shelves, I want new cans printed with the words, \u201cunder God\u201d on the can! And if enough people demand this, we\u2019ll get it. Walt Disney, AT&T, and all chose to ignore boycott efforts; and now those companies are reaping the financial consequences of their decisions.\n\n\n\nAt one time, Dr Pepper addressed the issue on their web site, saying:\n\nIn recent days, several news media outlets in the country have reported on a special edition can that was created to show support for the patriotic fervor that has been sweeping America since the tragic events of 2001, and to show the world that we are a united nation of people who place a high value upon freedom. Much of the information being circulated on this subject is incomplete or inaccurate. Here are the facts: The can, released last November, features an image of the Statue of Liberty along with the words \u201cOne Indivisible.\u201d The special packaging was designed to reflect our pride in this country\u2019s determination to stand together as one. The Statue of Liberty and Pledge of Allegiance were chosen as two of the greatest symbols of American freedom. Due to space limitations on the can, only a few of the from the Pledge of Allegiance could be used. The available area for graphics limited the amount of verbiage on the can. Of the in the Pledge of Allegiance, only three were included. More than were not included. We at Dr Pepper/Seven Up strongly believe that the message on these cans is a resoundingly patriotic, bipartisan message that we are a united nation. More than 41 million special edition cans were ordered by bottlers in portions of a dozen states. Because the limited edition patriotic can is to be retired in February, you will soon see regular packaging graphics for at your local retail stores.\n\nAlthough 18 million Dr Pepper cans bearing the new design had been produced by February 2002, the company said it had received only \u201cfour complaints from Dubuque\u201d and negative comments nationwide,\u201d and the issue seemed to have largely disappeared along with the cans by March 2002. However, when a United States Court of Appeals handed down a decision regarding the constitutionality of the words \u201cunder God\u201d in the Pledge of Allegiance in June 2002, it breathed new life into the controversy even though the notorious cans had been off store shelves for months. Messages like the following then began circulating much more widely than the ones sent out during the initial wave of controversy:\n\nWe called on God on 9-11 so what\u2019s wrong with him now? For those who have not heard, the bottlers/manufacturers of and their other products, have started a \u201cnew\u201d can campaign. They are putting patriotic scenes on them. One, is the Empire State Bldg. with the pledge of allegiance\u2026but\u2026they left off the words\u2026\u201dunder God\u201d. They felt it might \u201coffend\u201d some. I don\u2019t know about you, but as a Christian, their position offends me! I am boycotting their products! They said they didn\u2019t \u201chave room\u201d for those words, but yet they had room for \u201cindivisible\u201d on the can! Please pass this along to others and see if we can get a message out to if having \u201cunder God\u201d on cans offends them, then they don\u2019t need our money with \u201cin God we trust\u201d on it! PLEASE PASS THIS INFORMATION ON TO YOUR FRIENDS!\n\nSomehow along the way this message morphed into the versions quoted at the head of this page, which inaccurately attribute the \u201cPledge\u201d can design to Pepsi. and Pepsi are two completely different companies: Pepsi is a product of the Pepsico corporation; is a product of (which was spun off from in 2008). Although has been produced and distributed by Pepsi bottlers in some parts of the U.S., the company has never been owned by PepsiCo, as the erroneously reported.\n\nPepsiCo eventually had to issue their own rumor alert regarding this issue:\n\nIn February 2003 we began seeing the call to boycott the soda bottler who had omitted \u201cUnder God\u201d from its patriotic cans aimed at Coca-Cola. It was the same wording as the summons to arms against Pepsi that had circulated a year earlier but with \u201cCoke\u201d replacing \u201cPepsi\u201d in the text. It too was false, as Coca-Cola had had no more to do with the short-lived cans than had Pepsi.\n\nWriting to any company now and threatening to boycott them until they \u201cput \u2018under God\u2019 back on their cans\u201d is pointless. The patriotic \u201cPledge\u201d can was produced only between November 2001 and February 2002, it was sold only in parts of twelve states, it has long since been retired, and it has not been available in stores since that one time.\n\nAn interesting contrast was provided by Time magazine\u2019s 2001 cover, which used the same words in its headline but prompted very few complaints:", "lang": "en"}
