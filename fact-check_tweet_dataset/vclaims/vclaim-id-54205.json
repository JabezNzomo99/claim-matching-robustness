No, this is not true. First, a video making the claim that masks -- from N95 to cloth ones -- don't work relies on dated studies. Second, while much debate does exist over face coverings reducing the spread of the virus, most scientists and medical officials -- including the U.S. surgeon general on July 20, 2020 -- say they are necessary to arrest the pandemic.\n\nThe claim can be found in a video (archived here) published by the RT online network on July 15, 2020, titled \"Why Face Masks Don't Work, According To Science,\" which opened:\n\nClick below to watch the video on YouTube:\n\nThe 12:36-minute video from Truth In Media W/ Ben Swann was posted by the RT (formerly Russia Today) online network, which claims over 10 billion viewers on YouTube and has been flagged by YouTube as partially or fully funded by Russia.\n\nThe video actually conflicts with the quickly developing science surrounding a virus and disease that has killed more than 140,000 people in the U.S. and nearly 607,000 worldwide as of July 20. The video, for example, relies on studies \"done over the past decade -- one in 2009, 2010, 2012, 2016, 2017, 2019, and yes, even this year in 2020.\" All of these were done prior to the spread of the current pandemic, and all focused in influenza or other viruses or diseases -- not the novel coronavirus. Or it cites studies that deal exclusively with healthcare workers using cloth versus surgical masks, not regular people out in public during a pandemic.\n\nThe video was also reposted by InfoWars and on Swann's Facebook page, among other places.\n\nSimply put, Swann focuses on a few studies that indicate face masks are not only unnecessary but dangerous to wear during an outbreak. He neglects volumes of research suggesting just the opposite. And one study from 2015 that Swann cites as evidence against masks was updated March 30 to address the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nConsider the conclusions of this study from April 10, 2020, about a month after the World Health Organization declared a pandemic:\n\nSwann takes particular aim at Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's order that businesses require masks -- or risk fines or worse, effectively calling Whitmer's order nonsense. But, on June 16, Health Affairs published this in its study abstract about states that have and have not required face masks:\n\nAnother study updated June 15, 2020, found similar results when comparing mortality rates in countries that did or did not require lockdowns, face masks and other measures:\n\nTwo days after Swann's report, the Police Tube channel (\"Youtube account for crazy videos\") ran a rebuttal on YouTube, saying:\n\nHere is that video:\n\nThe director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Robert Redfield, urged universal adoption of mask-wearing to help reverse the growing number of cases and deaths attributed to the virus and the disease it causes. A July 14, 2020, statement from the CDC says:\n\nAmericans are increasingly adopting the use of cloth face masks to slow the spread of COVID-19, and the latest science may convince even more to do so. In an editorial published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), CDC reviewed the latest science and affirms that cloth face coverings are a critical tool in the fight against COVID-19 that could reduce the spread of the disease, particularly when used universally within communities. There is increasing evidence that cloth face coverings help prevent people who have COVID-19 from spreading the virus to others. \"We are not defenseless against COVID-19,\" said CDC Director Dr. Robert R. Redfield. \"Cloth face coverings are one of the most powerful weapons we have to slow and stop the spread of the virus - particularly when used universally within a community setting. All Americans have a responsibility to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.\"\n\nAnd just on July 20, 2020, Surgeon General Jerome Adams pleaded with \"Fox & Friends\" viewers to wear a mask, stressing that doing so would help in reversing course on the pandemic and was not an attempt to infringe on people's individual rights -- the crux of the debate being fought in American right now (He also acknowledges missteps along the way in battling COVID-19, including mixed messages on masks):\n\nHere is video on YouTube of Adams making a public plea posted by The Hill soon after the \"Fox & Friends\" appearance:\n\nEven President Trump, who had refused to wear a mask, said July 20 in a tweet that it was \"patriotic\" to wear one:\n\nSwann wraps up the video with these two rhetorical questions:\n\nAccording to the most recent science, the answer is no.\n\nLead Stories has previously debunked similar claims that masks don't work.
