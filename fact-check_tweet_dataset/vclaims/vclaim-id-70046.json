Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of Special Frontier Force personnel dancing after reclaiming the land under Chinese occupation in the Eastern Ladakh. Fact: As per the recent update by the Ministry of Defence, the Indian forces have thwarted the intrusion of People Liberation Army (PLA) of China in Eastern Ladakh on the night of 29/30 August 2020. But the posted video is on the internet at least since 27 August 2020. So, the video is not related to the mentioned incident. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image Search, no specific results were found in the search results. But a flag similar to the Tibetan flag can be seen in the video. So, when searched with the keywords, an extended version of the same video was found on YouTube. The video was posted on 27 August 2020. Also, many others have posted the same video on Facebook on 27 August 2020. But, as per the recent update by the Ministry of Defence, the Indian forces have thwarted the intrusion of People Liberation Army (PLA) of China in Eastern Ladakh on the night of 29/30 August 2020. Hence this video is on the internet much before the incident occurred.\n\nAlso, it has been reported by multiple news agencies that some key heights along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) were captured by a unit of Special Frontier Force (SFF). More details regarding the Special Frontier Force can be read here.\n\nTo sum it up, this video of army personnel dancing is not related to the 29/30 August 2020 clash in Eastern Ladakh.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
