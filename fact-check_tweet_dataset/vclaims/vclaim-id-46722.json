Ralph Northam plans to \u201cCut off electric\u2026 telephones\u2026 faxes\u2026 cellular phones & cellular data, Internet, so #Virginia residents cannot reveal what is happening once gun confiscation begins to take place.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis needs to go viral\u2026..for the sake of the people in Virginia,\u201d reads the caption. \u201cThis is the MO, have alternate comm\u2019s in place and plans for rally points.\u201d\n\nThe claim originated on a website known for spreading conspiracy theories and hoaxes. Both the Governor\u2019s office and the Virginia National Guard have debunked the notion that Northam plans to confiscate firearms by force.\n\nReports circulating on the internet in recent weeks have claimed Northam, the Democratic governor of Virginia, plans to confiscate certain firearms by force. The claims come after legislators introduced several gun control measures in the Virginia state legislature in recent months.\n\nVirginia Senate Bill 16, introduced in November, proposes a ban on the possession, transport and sale of assault weapons. It expands the state\u2019s definition of assault weapons to include, among other types of guns, semi-automatic rifles and shotguns with revolving cylinders, according to the bill.\n\nOne image posted on Facebook Dec. 16 features a screen grab of a tweet from @Cindyseestruth, warning Virginia residents that Northam is going to take extreme measures to confiscate those firearms. It has been shared more than 9,500 times.\n\n\u201cWARNING\u2026 VIRGINIA GOV RALPH NORTHAM SET TO.. Cut off electric\u2026 telephones\u2026 faxes\u2026 cellular phones & cellular data, Internet, so #Virginia residents cannot reveal what is happening once gun confiscation begins to take place,\u201d reads the screen grabbed tweet. \u201c#PrepareYourselves.\u201d\n\nThe claim originated in an article posted by the Hal Turner Radio Show, a website run by the Southern Poverty Law Center-designated white supremacist Hal Turner. He\u2019s known for peddling conspiracy theories and hoaxes on his site, making the claim immediately suspect.\n\n\u201cVirginia Governor Reportedly Orders Plans To Cut Electric, Phones, Internet For Gun Confiscations!\u201d reads the article\u2019s headline.\n\n\u201cThe source is a staffer in Virginia state government who asked for, and was given anonymity for fear of losing their job,\u201d Turner told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an email.\n\nA number of Twitter bots, including @Cindyseestruth, have reportedly helped promulgate the story on the site, according to data from Hoaxy, a website that tracks bot activity.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that Northam plans to cut off the state\u2019s electricity or suppress communication capabilities to enforce the proposed gun control legislation. Both the governor\u2019s office and the Virginia State National Guard have refuted the notion that he plans to confiscate guns by force.\n\n\u201cIn this case, the governor\u2019s assault weapons ban will include a grandfather clause for individuals who already own assault weapons, with the requirement they register their weapons before the end of a designated grace period,\u201d said Alena Yarmosky, the press secretary for Northam\u2019s office, in an interview with The Virginia Mercury.\n\nYarmosky also told PolitiFact that the claim was \u201cabsolutely false,\u201d adding, \u201cPeople who spread lies like this should be ashamed of themselves.\u201d\n\nThe Virginia National Guard, who Turner claims will carry out the confiscation plan, also tweeted that they have received no such requests from the governor to enforce state gun control legislation.\n\n\u201cWe have not received any requests from the Governor, or anyone on his staff, about serving in a law enforcement role related to any proposed legislation,\u201d reads the tweet.\n\nStatements from both the Governor\u2019s office and the Virginia National Guard contradict Turner\u2019s unreliable sourcing. The DCNF rates the claim as false.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
