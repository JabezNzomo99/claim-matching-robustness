It says you should not call the phone number on their ID card, but ask them to wait outside while you search for the company\u2019s phone number on the internet. Do not let them into your property if you have concerns.\n\nAge UK recommends putting up a sign on your door or window to deter cold callers, setting passwords with utility companies to be used by anyone sent to your home and finding out if you have a nominated neighbour scheme to help make sure callers are safe.", "lang": "en"}
