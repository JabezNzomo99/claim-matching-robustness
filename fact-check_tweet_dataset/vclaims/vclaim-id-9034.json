I COULD WATCH THIS ALL DAY! The truth is I watched this several times, as it only lasts about 5 seconds. And, you do NOT have to turn up the volume. Just watch and enjoy. Praise Allah!\n\nThe claims attached to this video are wrong on many accounts. There\u2019s no evidence that the person depicted in this footage is a terrorist, suicide bomber, or a member of ISIS; he\u2019s actually riding a hoverboard (i.e., self-balancing scooter board), and not a skateboard; and the explosion at the end of the clip is an added digital effect.\n\nThe original video (tagged as having been shot in Dubai) features a man riding a hoverboard who simply loses his balance and is sent sprawling to the pavement (without exploding or bursting into flame):\n\nAdding an explosion effect at the end of a video is a common tactic employed by online jokesters.
