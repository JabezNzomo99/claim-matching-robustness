(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the 2019 coronavirus has infected more than 81,000 people in 37 countries. The vast majority of the 2,761 deaths have occurred in China.\n\nThe Chinese government has ordered for the swift cremation of patients who die after contracting the coronavirus. But the Facebook post does not show sulfur dioxide resulting from cremation.\n\nTwitter user @inteldotwav first connected cremations in China with heightened levels of sulfur dioxide near Wuhan. In a Feb. 8 thread, the user posted a screenshot of a map from Windy.com, a website that tracks global wind and weather patterns. It has more than 12,200 retweets.\n\nOne of the possible reasons for the influx of sulfur dioxide, @inteldotwav said, is that \"dead bodies are being burned on the outskirts of the city.\" Several tabloids uncritically reported the false claim and later retracted their stories after fact-checkers debunked them.\n\nRELATED: Hoaxes about the coronavirus are now trying to prove human extermination\n\nThere are a few things wrong with the sulfur dioxide conspiracy theory.\n\nFirst, Windy.com provides air quality projections \u2014 not real-time atmospheric conditions.\n\nSecond, China\u2019s National Environmental Monitoring Center has addressed the image in the Facebook post. The state-run Xinhua News Agency reported that environmental officials had recorded sulfur dioxide levels several times lower than what Windy.com showed.\n\nThird, while the gas can be produced by burning organic matter, sulfur dioxide mostly comes from burning coal and oil. And there are several coal power plants and oil refineries near Wuhan.\n\nThe Facebook post is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
