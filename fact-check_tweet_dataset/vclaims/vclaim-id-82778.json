{"title": "Senate Majority PAC\u2019s nonsensical attack ad in Louisiana", "subtitle": "Democrats strain to connect a lawmaker to the Kochs without mentioning he fought them on the issue highlighted in the ad.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2016-02-02T18:59:57Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-82778", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/04/08/senate-majority-pacs-nonsensical-attack-ad-in-louisiana/", "vclaim": "This ad from the Senate Majority PAC, which is run by former aides to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), is an example of a very deceptive technique: stringing together a variety of true (or semi-true) statements in an effort to completely mislead viewers.\n\nThis ad is a particularly egregious example, and yet it managed to fool television stations in Louisiana. The National Republican Senatorial Committee sent a letter to 34 television affiliate demanding that they \u201cstop airing this advertisement immediately.\u201d But the television stations refused, saying the material appeared factual.\n\nHere at The Fact Checker, we view such ads with greater skepticism. An Obama campaign film, for instance, earned Pinocchios in 2012 for stringing together quotes about his mother\u2019s health situation that, while correct, when combined together skirted close to the edge of falsehood.\n\n\u201cBut the out-of-state billionaire Koch brothers funded the fight to let flood insurance premiums soar, helping the insurance companies\u2026\u201d\n\nBut, indeed, Bloomberg\u2019s fellow billionaires, David and Charles Koch, have backed the group Americans for Prosperity, which has unleashed a torrent of ads attacking Democrats for supporting the Affordable Care Act. AFP promotes limited government, and so it has also taken stands against what it views as wasteful spending and government intrusion in the economy.\n\nIn that policy role, AFP and other conservative groups fought against an effort to roll back changes in a law regarding flood insurance that had passed Congress with overwhelming margins in 2012. The 2012 law cut federal subsidies for flood insurance, which sent insurance rates soaring and angered constituents in Louisiana. (AFP argued that taxpayers should not be on the hook for insuring private property.)\n\nSo what\u2019s wrong with this claim? While factual, it fails to mention that one of the key lawmakers who fought against AFP\u2014and prevailed\u2014was Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.). His amendment in the House, crafted with Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) and Rep. Steven Palazzo (R-Miss.), formed the core of the legislative solution. President Obama in March signed the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act into law.\n\nThis is a false claim. AFP did oppose an omnibus bill concerning Hurricane Sandy, but not because it opposed disaster relief but because, as AFP put it, \u201cWashington politicians are using this tragedy to secure billions in spending for their own pet projects like fisheries in Alaska, new cars for Homeland Security or tree planting on private property.\u201d AFP said the spending should be balanced with other spending cuts.\n\nAs far as we can tell, the Sandy bill did not have hurricane relief for Louisiana families. Previously, Senate Majority PAC has made this claim without any specific reference to Louisiana. This part of the ad cites no source and Senate Majority PAC did not respond to repeated queries about this ad. Thus we can only assume the ad makers simply invented the connection to Louisiana.\n\n\u201cNow they\u2019re spending millions to buy a Senate seat for Bill Cassidy so he can fight for them.\u201d\n\nThis is where the ad veers off the rails. Having noted that the Kochs opposed flood legislation\u2014without mentioning that Cassidy was one of their chief opponents\u2014Senate Majority PAC claims Cassidy would be in their pocket to do further damage to the flood victims of the state. This is nonsensical. It\u2019s almost as if Senate Majority PAC claimed that 1 plus 1 equals 5.\n\nIf anything, Cassidy could run an ad saying that he took on the Kochs\u2014even though they are backing him\u2013and beat them. But the opposite can\u2019t be true.\n\nTelevision stations in Louisiana should be ashamed of falling for such an obvious gambit. Individual lines may be true, but the net effect is highly misleading. Surely, the standards for political advertising in Louisiana need to be higher if residents are going to have a civil political debate.\n\nThis is the third time in a month that the Fact Checker has given Four Pinocchios to an ad sponsored by Senate Majority PAC. That\u2019s a pretty dreadful track record, and does little for the organization\u2019s credibility more than six months before the midterm elections.", "lang": "en"}
