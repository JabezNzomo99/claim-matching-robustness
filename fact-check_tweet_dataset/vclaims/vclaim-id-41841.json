The claim was also shared on Twitter, including by Lord Sugar.\n\nWe\u2019ve also been asked to check this by lots of readers.\n\nProfessor Honjo released a statement on 27 April saying: \u201cIn the wake of the pain, economic loss, and unprecedented global suffering caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, I am greatly saddened that my name and that of Kyoto University have been used to spread false accusations and misinformation.\u201d\n\nReports of this misinformation appeared as early as 22 April. In interviews and public statements made in the days before, at no point did Professor Honjo suggest the new coronavirus was unnatural.\n\nThe false posts also claim incorrectly that Professor Honjo worked in the \u201cWuhan laboratory in China\u201d for four years. Professor Honjo is currently the Deputy Director-General and Distinguished Professor at the Kyoto University Institute for Advanced Study (KUIAS). His biography on the KUIAS website shows no evidence that he spent four years teaching in Wuhan or China.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen no credible evidence that Covid-19 was man-made.", "lang": "en"}
