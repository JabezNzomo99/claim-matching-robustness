This is Timeless.\u201d\n\nRetired teacher Catherine O\u2019Meara actually wrote the poem in March.\n\nThe post claims that the poem about social distancing was originally written in 1869 by Kathleen O\u2019Meara and later reprinted during the Spanish flu pandemic that started in 1918. Kathleen O\u2019Meara, also known by her pen name Grace Ramsey, was a 19th century French-Irish biographer and novelist.\n\nThe poem has circulated widely on Facebook and Instagram with that attribution in recent weeks due to its reflections on social distancing practices, which have been implemented during the current coronavirus pandemic. It begins with the line \u201cAnd people stayed home\u201d and goes on to describe ways of passing time in self-isolation, including reading, exercising and making art.\n\nBut, contrary to the post\u2019s claims, Kathleen O\u2019Meara didn\u2019t write the poem in 1869 or any other year.

It was published on her website The Daily Round in March and has since been shared by author Deepak Chopra and model Bella Hadid, among others.\n\n\u201cI post stuff like that all the time,\u201d OprahMag.com quotes Catherine O\u2019Meara as saying. \u201cI usually don\u2019t get a lot of response. But this found its niche.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
