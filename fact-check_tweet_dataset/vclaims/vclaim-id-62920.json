The doctor who denied the officer with sleeping medications was Dr. Prakash, which corresponds with the Daily Pakistan report.\n\n\u201cThe incident took place about two weeks ago. A policeman of a counter terrorism department visited the hospital with the complaint of sleeplessness anxiety and other such issues. The doctors on duty examined him and found no sign of any cardiac disease and cleared him off. But the policeman insisted on dispensing him with some sedative medicine or injection. The doctors convinced him that there was no such need and he must be thankful that he had no disease and was doing fine,\u201d Dr. Khan said. \u201cThe next day he came and asked about Dr Prakash with whom he had an argument the previous day. When told by staff that Dr Prakash was not on duty, the policeman pulled a pistol and fired upon Dr Fahad, who was on duty. The Dr sustained two bullets on his foot. He is out of danger now.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Karachi\u2019s senior police official Raja Umar Khatab provided a statement to AFP on June 26 about the police officer accused of the shooting, saying: \u201cPolice has arrested the accused and charged him with attempted murder in the First Information Report.\u201d\n\nAFP could not independently verify the second photo of a blood splattered floor.", "lang": "en"}
