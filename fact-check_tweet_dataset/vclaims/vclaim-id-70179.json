We opened that stock exchange the next day; people were shocked. A great group of people \u2014 the head of the New York Stock Exchange is just a fantastic guy \u2014 Dick (Grasso). And he opened it up.\"\n\nLater that day, Trump kept his promise to hold a rally in Murphysboro, Ill. He repeated the anecdote in that address:\n\n\"With what happened early today, that horrible, horrible attack in Pittsburgh, I was saying maybe I should cancel both this and that (the speech in Indianapolis). And then I said to myself, I remember Dick Grasso, a friend of mine, great guy. He headed up the New York Stock Exchange on Sept. 11. And the New York Stock Exchange was open the following day. He said \u2014 and what they had to do to open it, you wouldn't believe. We won't even talk to you about it, but he got that exchange open. We can't make these sick, demented, evil people important.\"\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange didn\u2019t open on the morning of the attacks, which hit the World Trade Center a few blocks away.\n\nThe exchange building wasn't directly damaged, the Associated Press reported at the time, but \"the surrounding neighborhood was littered with debris.\"\n\nThe stock exchange didn\u2019t open again until Sept. 17, 2001. Even a week after the attacks, conditions were hardly normal.\n\nAt that point \"rescue workers continued to search for survivors amid smoldering rubble,\" the AP reported, and \"the smell of smoke still (hung) in the air \u2014 even permeating the NYSE trading floor.\"\n\nAs he rang the opening bell on Sept. 17, Grasso said, \"Today, America goes back to business. We do it as a signal to those criminals who inflicted this heinous crime on America and all Americans, they have lost.\"\n\nAccording to the New York Times, \"traders took subways instead of limousines, trudged on foot from the Staten Island Ferry, and began lining up at 7:30 outside the exchange to have their bags searched and ID tags checked.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.\n\nTrump said he didn't cancel a political rally because after the 9/11 attacks, \"the New York Stock Exchange was open the following day.\" It wasn\u2019t; the exchange didn\u2019t open until a week later, on Sept. 17. We rate the statement False.", "lang": "en"}
