No, that's not true: the story was made up in 2015 by a Canadian entertainment website that makes a living by publishing fictional stories often involving weird crimes, bizarre sex acts or strange accidents. It is not real. Since then the story has been copied by a variety of unreliable websites with some of them adding more (digitally manipulated) images to it.\n\nThe story originated from an article (archived here) where it was published byWorld News Daily Report on July 28, 2015 under the title \"5-meter Tall Human Skeleton Unearthed In Australia\". It opened:\n\nAlice Springs | What could be the largest human skeleton ever discovered has been unearthed by a team of archeologists from the University of Adelaide at the Uluru archeological site near Ayers rock in Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, reports the Adelaide Herald this morning. The gigantic hominid specimen that measures an incredible 5.3 meters tall (17 foot and 4 inches) was discovered near the ancient ruins of the only megalithic civilization ever discovered in Australia, which makes the discovery twice as puzzling admits professor Hans Zimmer of the University of Adelaide. \"The discovery of the Uluru archeological site last year already took us by surprise, but this new find is just jaw-dropping\" he admits, visibly dumbfounded. \"Theoretically, a five-meter-tall hominid cannot exist. How did this occur? How is this possible. Although this discovery is fascinating, we are left with more questions than answers\" he concedes.\n\nThere is no newspaper currently in publication (or in 2015) named the Adelaide Herald so there is no sourcing for this report.\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a humor website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories.

Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes worldnewsdailyreport.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
