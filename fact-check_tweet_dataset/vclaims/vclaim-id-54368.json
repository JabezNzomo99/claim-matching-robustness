He was admitted in the isolation unit at Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital, Mumbai. The next day, Abhishek Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai and Aaradhya Bachchan also tested positive. In the backdrop of this, a two-minute video of Amitabh thanking the staff of Nanavati Hospital has gone viral. It has been shared by several media outlets and social media users with the claim that it\u2019s a recent video.\n\nIt was also posted by Aaj Tak with the same claim. This video has over nine lakh views on YouTube.\n\nSome other media outlets that shared the viral video include \u2014 MOJO, Outlook, Yahoo India, One India and Amar Ujala. Facebook pages Bollywood Now and Bollywood Bliss shared the viral video as well. The video gained over 7 lakh views cumulatively.\n\nSimilarly, YouTube channel Movie Telly and Sahitya Tak uploaded the viral video drawing over two-lakh views each.\n\nAlt News performed a keyword search on Twitter and found that Mumbai-based journalist Faridoon Shahryar had posted the viral video on April 23. In the video, Amitabh extended his gratitude to the staff of Nanavati Hospital for their work during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\nIn the video, Amitabh talks about a billboard in Surat that he saw on Twitter. The billboard said that temples were closed because Gods are in hospitals wearing white coats. On April 23, YouTube channel of Gujarat-based ABP Asmita had uploaded a bulletin on the viral video.\n\nThe billboard in question was also shown by ABP Asmita.\n\nAdditionally, Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital clarified the same on Facebook and Twitter. As per the hospital\u2019s statement, in April 2020 Amitabh Bachchan had donated PPE kits when Nanavati Hospital had created a dedicated COVID-19 facility.\n\nThus, media outlets and several other social media users shared an over two-month-old video of Amitabh Bachchan, misleading viewers to believe that the actor shot the video after he tested positive for coronavirus.", "lang": "en"}
