It compares this to two men who it says were sentenced to eight months in jail for throwing bacon at a mosque.\n\nIt is true that Emdadur Choudhury was fined \u00a350 for offences under the Public Order Act after he burnt three poppies on Remembrance Day 2011 as part of a counter-protest. He was also ordered to pay a \u00a315 victim surcharge.\n\nIt was widely reported at the time that, according to his defence, Mr Choudhury received \u00a3792 pounds in monthly government benefits on top of \u00a3480 in monthly wages. It\u2019s not clear whether he paid the fine himself, as in several interviews afterwards he claimed that radical preacher Anjem Choudhury had offered to pay.\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear if Mr Choudhury \u201claughed\u201d at his sentencing in court, but the same article in the Mail says he laughed following his trial when asked if he\u2019d do it again.\n\nThen-Prime Minister David Cameron implied he felt Choudhury\u2019s sentence was too lenient. At the time, the maximum fine for this was an \u00a31000.\n\nThe post also says that two men who \u201cthrew bacon at [a] mosque\u201d were sentenced to eight months in jail. This is also a real case, although that account does not fully describe what they were accused of.\n\nThe two men, Mateusz Pawlikowski and Piotr Czak-Zukowski, were both sentenced to two eight-month sentences for criminal damage and a racial/religious public order offence. These were to run concurrently, meaning the two sentences are served simultaneously. The men were said to have entered the mosque and thrown bacon at an attendee, as well as around the venue and in worshipper\u2019s shoes. They also verbally abused the man.", "lang": "en"}
