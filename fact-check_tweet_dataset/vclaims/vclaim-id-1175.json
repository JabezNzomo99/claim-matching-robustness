This false claim has been circulating since 2015.\n\nExamples of recent posts are visible here , here and here .\n\nThe photo, which is part of the Wisconsin Historical Society archive here , actually shows members of the KKK parading in Madison, Wisconsin on December 2, 1924 for the funeral of a Police officer that was killed.\n\nThis false claim has been circulating since 2015 ( here , here , here ) and debunked multiple times since ( here , here and here )\n\nThe 1924 Democratic National Convention, held at Madison Square Garden in New York from June 24 to July 9, is the longest political convention in American history. It is true that the Ku Klux Klan played a part in it, but at the time the KKK had influence in both the Republican and the Democratic parties.\n\nBy 1925, the KKK had as many as 4 million members and considerable political power in some states ( here ). Historian Linda Gordon has written about the KKK\u2019s presence in politics in the 1920s ( here ). In her book The Second Coming of the KKK, she noted that KKK used politics and elections \u201cto make war\", and that their political presence was \u201cpretty much equally divided between Democrats and Republicans\u201d. ( bit.ly/3faOyNC )\n\nThe New York Times described the KKK as the \u201cmost powerful bloc in the Democratic Party\u201d during the 1924 convention but explained it was also \u201cfiercely opposed\u201d ( here ).\n\nUnrelated to the photograph in the claim, on July 4, 1924 and coinciding with the DNC the KKK organized a massive rally in New Jersey against New York Governor Al Smith, who was considered the strongest candidate for the democratic nomination.\n\nThe New York Times reported at the time that \u201ctwenty thousand members of the Ku Klux Klan and their relatives\u201d celebrated Independence Day with \u201cdemonstrations against Governor Smith of New York and his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for presidency.\u201d ( here ).\n\nFalse. Photo does not show 1924 DNC but a KKK parade in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
