Key to her defense of the law is her assertion that there were \u201c\u201ca lot of cases\u201d of Russian adoptees suffering abuse.\n\nThe former figure skater\u2019s comments to the sports Web site covered a number of related issues, which we will get to later in this story, but the crux of her complaint is the complicated issue of abuse, which draws a \u201cMisleading\u201d verdict:\n\nCLAIM #1: There were \u201ca lot of cases\u201d of Russian adoptees in the U.S. suffering abuse\n\nMore than 60,000 Russian children were adopted in the United States between 1991 and the Russian adoption ban of 2012.\n\nIn the last decade, U.S. media reported on twenty instances of children adopted from Russia who were abused. In each case, the perpetrators were prosecuted in U.S. courts.\n\nShortly after the Russian adoption ban, the Associated Press wire service investigated the problem in the U.S. and found disturbing instances of intercountry adoptees who were abused, swapped among families and a few who died.\n\nThe AP found \u201cinconsistent laws, incomplete data and lack of a central authority\u201d plagued the system.\n\nThe data on abuse of internationally adopted children in the U.S is incomplete. What is available indicates a low incidence of abuse of Russian adoptees \u2013 especially when compared with the number of children in Russia who are orphans.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Administration for Children and Families collects data nationally on all cases of child abuse but does not put adoptees in a separate category.\n\n\u200bThe same is true of the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect, which has been operating since 1972 and is used by organizations like \u201cPrevent Child Abuse America,\u201d whose communications director, Zach Hiner, told Polygraph.info the archive is \u201ca wealth of information about child abuse and neglect that contains information dating back to 1988.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. State Department does have some numbers. In its \u201cAnnual Adoption Report\u201d in 2009, the agency reported that U.S. families adopted 12,753 children from overseas, 1,588 of whom were from Russia.\n\nIntercountry adoptions accounted for 4.9% of the 255,418 children who entered foster care in the U.S. in 2009. Adoptions of Russians were 0.6% of the total number.\n\nTwo-year-old Chase Harrison (born Dmitry Yakovlev) died from heatstroke in a car in Fairfax County, Virginia, in July 2008, after being strapped to his car seat for 9 hours. The Russian adoption ban is named after him.\n\nIn a statement to Polygraph.info, the U.S. State Department said it \u201ccondemns the abuse or abandonment of any child\u201d and that \u201cU.S. child protection laws and services apply to all children, regardless of citizenship, country of origin, or dual-nationality.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tiny percent,\u201d Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, an expert on intercountry adoptions, told Polygraph.info, referring to incidents of abuse of adopted children in the U.S. She conceded that precise data is hard to get, but added: \u201cOverall, adopted kids, both domestic and international, are subject to parental abuse at much lower rates than kids raised by their biological parents, as shown by the social science.\u201d\n\nRyan Hanlon, vice president of education and research at the National Council for Adoption in Washington, DC told Polygraph.info that instances of abuse should not be dismissed. However, he disagrees with Rodnina\u2019s characterization that abuse is a problem in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe outcomes of adopted children are absolutely better. Russian children adopted to the U.S. are thriving compared to their counterparts,\" Hanlon said.\n\nThe \u201cDmitry Yakovlev\u201d law in Russia had little to do with abuse in the U.S. The law was adopted in retaliation for the Magnitsky Act in the U.S., a December 2012 law that froze the assets of Russian officials accused of being involved in the death of a Russian lawyer who said he had uncovered a large tax fraud scheme in Russia.\n\nOn the other hand, the situation has been grim for hundreds of thousands of children in Russia. In 2004, 734,200 children in Russia lacked any parental care. By 2009, 130,000 Russian children remained in institutions. The Russian government agency Ministry of Education and Science reported 108,700 were the victims of violence, out of which 1,600 died and 2,400 were severely injured, at a time when inter-country adoptions outnumbered domestic adoptions.\n\n\u201cProfound neglect is as or more harmful as abuse, and virtually all kids in institutions are subject to profound neglect.\u201d said Bartholet, the Harvard professor.\n\nIn 2011, about a year before the Russian adoption ban, 654,355 children were still living without any parental care in Russia, more than eight in 10 of them because one or both parents were alive but unable to provide care for their children.\n\nCLAIM #2: Americans \u201cwouldn\u2019t report to us\u201d on the Russian adoptees\n\nRussia itself does not comply with the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoptions, which governs information sharing in intercountry adoption cases and protection of children from abuse.\n\nThe convention is currently ratified by 96 states. The United States signed on the new international law in 1994 and ratified it in 2008. Russia did not sign the Hague Adoption Convention until 2000, and still has not ratified it.\n\nNevertheless, in July 2011, Russia and the United States signed an accord which mandated closer monitoring of American families who adopt Russian children, \u201cto strengthen procedural safeguards in the adoption process,\u201d according to the State Department.\n\n\u201cWe were deeply disappointed by Russia\u2019s decision to then prohibit U.S. citizens from adopting Russian children as of January 1, 2013 and to terminate the U.S.\u2013Russia Adoption Agreement,\u201d the State Department told Polygraph.info.\n\nWhile Rodnina complains of a lack of accountability in the U.S., Criminal Law 155 of the Russian Criminal Code prohibits the release of information about adopted children after adoption takes effect.\n\nIn the absence of a ratified agreement between the two countries, there was no protocol for reporting on adopted children in a government-regulated fashion.\n\nTo put things in perspective, Russian statistics, also do not track fully adopted children nationally either.\n\nIn 2013, Russia\u2019s then Ombudsman for Children Protection, Pavel Astakhov, told the newspaper Novaya Gazeta that Russia did not have such a list and had not been keeping track of the Russian children permanently adopted abroad.\n\nFollowing the Russian adoption ban, advocates in the U.S. addressed concerns about the patchwork of U.S. laws governing adoption. Hanlon of the national adoption council said the process has become more transparent since the U.S. joined the Hague Convention. Still, he said adopted children in the U.S. receive \u201cthe same rights and privileges as native children and are not treated differently in families.\u201d\n\nCLAIM #3: Russian adoptees \u201close their citizenship\u201d when they move to the United States\n\nThis claim by Rodnina is demonstratively false. According to Russian federal law, a child born in Russia with a valid birth certificate stating his or her place of birth, cannot lose his or her citizenship by acquiring citizenship in a new country.\n\nThe U.S. State Department confirms that although \u201cadopted children of United States citizens \u2026 acquire U.S. citizenship automatically,\u201d there is no requirement to renounce their citizenship of origin.\n\nNotably, Rodnina\u2019s own daughter, Alyona Minkosvki, an American journalist reporting on national politics who grew up in Los Angeles, has a U.S. passport, considers herself an American and did not visit Russia once until reaching legal age. Rodnina said of this: \u201cSo what? Alyona has been living in America since 1990. She speaks English. She has Russian citizenship, too.\u201d\n\nIn the past 20 years, intercountry adoptions have declined across-the-board. In the last year, Ryan Hanlon, vice president of education and research at the National Council for Adoption in Washington, DC, tells Polygraph.info the number of adoptions in the U.S. fell by 12%, with intercountry adoptions down 80% in all \u2013 to their lowest level since 1973.\n\nHe puts the blame in the U.S. on the State Department.\n\n\u201cThe State Department is not interested in children\u2019s welfare,\u201d he added, failing \u201cin creating partnerships and working collaboratively with the adoption community, the advocates and other countries.\u201d\n\nThe State Department's Special Advisor on Children's Issues Suzanne Lawrence was unavailable to respond by publication time.\n\nStill, Hanlon said Russia failed its own youth in imposing the ban in 2012.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in Russian with the adoption ban in 2012 was a tragedy. It wasn\u2019t done in the name of children\u2019s welfare. It was a political act. The victims of that political act are the children of Russia,\u201d he said.\n\n(Editor's Note: An earlier version of this story quoted an AP reporter by name when the quote was from the 2013 story and not an interview.
