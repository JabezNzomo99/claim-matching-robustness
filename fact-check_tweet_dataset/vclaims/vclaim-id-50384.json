The claim came from a Twitter handle mimicking the BBC Breaking News account that has since been suspended.\n\nThe false claim that the British actor widely known for his role in the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d franchise tested positive has circulated on Twitter and Facebook since Tuesday, with this particular post saying, \u201cHe becomes the first confirmed famous person to have the virus. We wish a speedy recovery!\u201d\n\nThe Twitter account @BBCNewsTonight spread the claim in a viral March 10 tweet that was later retweeted by multiple verified handles. Inspection of the account revealed it had no affiliation with the British outlet, despite closely resembling the verified BBC Breaking News account.\n\nThe handle, which lacked a blue verification check mark and had less than 200 followers, has since been suspended.
