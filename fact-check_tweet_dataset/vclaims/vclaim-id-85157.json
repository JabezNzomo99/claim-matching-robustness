We delved into this topic repeatedly in 2015 but got sidetracked by the 2016 campaign. We welcome any suggestions from readers.\n\nIn this case, we are not trying to single out McCarthy. As regular readers know, we don\u2019t try to play gotcha\u2014 and his spokesman, Matt Sparks, said the congressman misspoke and meant to say \u201c500 cures and treatments.\u201d It\u2019s an inaccurate shorthand others have used, as well. For instance, a group called Vote For Cures says on its Twitter page: \u201c10,000 diseases, only 500 cures.\u201d\n\nThis statistic is generally cited in the context of a bipartisan bill known as the 21st Century Cures Act, a package of bills which seeks speed up approval of new drugs and medical devices. Lawmakers had expected to negotiate a final deal between the House and Senate in the lame-duck session of Congress, but the unexpected election of Donald Trump as president may derail those plans. Democrats may be wary of easing regulations in the Food and Drug Administration in a Trump administration, even if the law meant more funding for the FDA and National Institutes of Health, Stat News reported.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee has pushed the bill and especially highlighted the 10,000 diseases/500 treatments language. A group known as Faster Cures, affiliated with the Milken Institute, also pushes this line on its website: \u201c10,000 diseases. Only 500 treatments. We have work to do.\u201d\n\nMargaret Anderson, the executive director of Faster Cures, said the group hired an economist to go through a data set maintained by Orphanet and counted 9,235 \u201corphan diseases,\u201d meaning rare diseases that affect fewer than 6 out of 10,000 patients. (The European Union and Japan have even more restrictive definitions.) That\u2019s how they came up with \u201c10,000 diseases,\u201d though she acknowledged it was not a \u201cperfect science.\u201d\n\nThere are other estimates, as well. The German government lists 30,000 diseases, of which it says 7,000 are rare, though we could not determine how that figure was calculated. Anderson noted that the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (known as ICD-10) has nearly 70,000 codes, which would be an upper-bound estimate.\n\nThis brings us to the \u201c500 cures.\u201d As we noted, McCarthy apparently meant to say \u201ccures and treatments.\u201d But treatments is really only the right term. Anderson said she thinks only one disease can be cured once a person is ill: hepatitis C. (Vaccines have prevented transmission of some other diseases.) Other diseases can only be treated or managed, preferably through new drug therapy. The FDA law blog says that, as of 2015, \u201csince 1983, FDA has approved about 552 orphan drugs.\u201d\n\nAnderson said the organization was promoting 10,000 diseases/500 treatments because it was an easy way to explain the number of rare diseases that needs to tackled. \u201cIt underscores the work that needs to be done,\u201d she said.\n\nSometimes advocacy groups run into credibility problems when they hype the statistics. As long as lawmakers avoid saying \u201ccures,\u201d that does not seem to be the case here. The focus is really on rare diseases, but a credible case can be made that there are at least 10,000 diseases in the world, though there is likely more. And there are a bit over 500 treatments. So, as far as round numbers go, 10,000 diseases/500 treatments works as a talking point.", "lang": "en"}
