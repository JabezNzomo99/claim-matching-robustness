While the PM is bowing in front of a Gandhi statue in the first image, the second image is that of him paying homage to Hindutva ideologue Veer Savarkar and not Godse.\n\nThe archived versions of the posts can be seen here and here.\n\nWith a reverse image search, we found the same image in question uploaded on Twitter by the Prime Minister himself on December 30, 2018, from his official handle.\n\nThe caption to the image reads, \"Among those imprisoned at Cellular Jail was the great Veer Savarkar. I visited the cell where the indomitable Veer Savarkar was lodged. Rigorous imprisonment did not dampen Veer Savarkar's spirits and he continued to speak and write about a free India from jail too.\"\n\nAmong those imprisoned at Cellular Jail was the great Veer Savarkar. I visited the cell where the indomitable Veer Savarkar was lodged. Rigorous imprisonment did not dampen Veer Savarkar\u2019s spirits and he continued to speak and write about a free India from jail too. pic.twitter.com/dbsyzuVUjA \u2014 Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) December 30, 2018\n\nWe also found news reports by media houses on the PM's visit to the historic Cellular Jail in Andaman and Nicobar Islands where Savarkar spent ten years in captivity during pre-independent India.\n\nThe reports have carried images similar to the viral photograph where PM Modi can be seen sitting on the floor with hands folded in front of Savarkar's photograph.\n\nPMO India's official YouTube channel had also uploaded a 46:46 seconds video of the PM's Cellular jail visit with the title \"PM Modi visits Cellular Jail in Port Blair in Andaman & Nicobar\".\n\nModi's visit to the cell where the viral image was shot can be seen from 12:22 minutes to 19:19 minutes in the video.\n\nAn image comparison of Godse and Savarkar can be seen here. On the left is the real image of Godse and on the right is Savarkar's picture - the one used in the viral claim.\n\nThis proves that the image in question is that of PM Modi paying tribute to Savarkar during his 2018 visit to Cellular Jail in Port Blair.", "lang": "en"}
