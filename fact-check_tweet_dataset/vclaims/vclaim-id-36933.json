Vishvas News investigated and found that blowing a balloon daily is just an exercise, it cannot cure any disease as mentioned in the claim completely. The viral claim is false.\n\nThe viral post has been shared by a Facebook page \u2018LiveHealthylife.\u2019 The post claims that blowing a balloon for 10 minutes daily can cure mouth cancer, lungs cancer, heart attack, blockage, and breathing problems. The post has around 34000 shares, 2900 reactions, and 52 comments.\n\nWe started our investigation by looking at the comments on the viral video. Some users asked for the reference of such a claim whereas others said it is just an exercise.\n\nWe contacted some renowned doctors to enquire on the claim and they said:\n\nDr. Manish Sharma, MD, New Delhi: Blowing up balloons can be used as a simple exercise for lungs. However, it cannot cure a disease like any form of cancer or heart attack.\n\nDr. Ish Munjal, General Physician, Jaipur: Blowing balloons is an exercise for improving lung function and capacity. However, there is no research that suggests that it can cure cancer or any other disease completely.\n\nDr. Manish Singhal, Oncologist, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital: This cannot cure a disease completely, this is just an exercise.\n\nAs per a journal of Lung, Pulmonary & Respiratory Research, regular practice of ballooning exercise can improve the respiratory status to a greater extent among patients with lower respiratory disorders. The exercise can improve respiratory disorders. Nowhere in the report, it has been mentioned that blowing up balloons can cure mouth cancer, lung cancer, or a heart disease completely.\n\nAs per a research report on ScienceDaily, University of Colorado Cancer Center mentions about a device that requires blowing up a balloon and the profile of the organic compounds in the person\u2019s breath would tell if they are at risk for developing or having lung cancer, which then could lead to further, focused test. Nowhere in the report it has been mentioned that blowing a balloon can cure cancer.\n\nThere is no research that suggests that blowing a balloon can cure mouth cancer, lung cancer, heart attack, blockage, or breathlessness. It is just an exercise.\n\nWe used StalkScan to scan the profile of the Facebook page \u2018LiveHealthylife.\u2019 Many posts on the page were found to be misleading.\n\nPost claiming blowing a balloon for 10 minutes daily can cure mouth cancer, lungs cancer, heart attack, blockage, and breathlessness is misleading. It can be used as an exercise but cannot cure a disease completely.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right. If you have a doubt on any news that could impact you, society or the nation, let us know.
