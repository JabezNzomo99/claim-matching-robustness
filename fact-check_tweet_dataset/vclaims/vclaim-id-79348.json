A spokesperson for the Indiana Pacers, where Bird now works, has said the quote is \u201ctotally false.\u201d\n\nMany professional athletes have kneeled during the national anthem or engaged in other forms of peaceful protest against police brutality and racial injustice in recent months. For instance, the NBA postponed the three playoff games scheduled for Aug. 26 after the Milwaukee Bucks decided to not play their game against the Orlando Magic to protest the Aug. 23 police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, according to NPR.\n\nA viral Facebook post claims former Boston Celtics player Bird criticized such acts, saying, \u201cBack in my day, the game had fundamentals and honored the commander in chief. Now its (sic) a bunch of radical fundamentalists who dishonor the flag and cross and only care about looking flashy. Just shut up and play the damn game.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Daily Caller News Foundation didn\u2019t find any credible media reports about Bird saying the quote. Bird also does not appear to have social media accounts, further adding to the post\u2019s dubiousness. (RELATED: Did The NBA Tell Trump To \u2018Resign Or We\u2019ll Never Play Again\u2019?)\n\nA spokesperson for the Indiana Pacers, where Bird is currently employed as advisor to the president of basketball operations, told Carlos Diaz of Indiana-based NBC affiliate WTHR that the quote is \u201ctotally false.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a false meme circulating on social media which features a supposed quote from Larry Bird concerning today\u2019s NBA players,\u201d Diaz tweeted. \u201cI contacted the Indiana Pacers on behalf of WTHR asking if this statement is actually from Larry Bird. The Pacers\u2019 response: \u2018Totally false.'\u201d\n\nThe quote appears to contradict a stance Bird took as a player. After winning the NBA title with the Boston Celtics in 1984, Bird skipped the team visit to the White House to meet President Ronald Reagan, reportedly saying, \u201cIf the president wants to see me, he knows where to find me.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
