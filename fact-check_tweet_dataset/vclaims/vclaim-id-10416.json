It\u2019s more important to look at the deficit as a percentage of the gross domestic product. It is estimated to be 4.6 percent of GDP in both 2019 and 2020, whereas in the June report it would not have hit that level until 2025.\n\nRyan\u2019s excuse is that the retirement of the baby-boom generation was going to put pressure on the government\u2019s finances and that this has been known for a long time. What he does not explain is why it was necessary to make the deficit situation even worse just as the full force of baby-boom retirements takes effect.\n\nMoreover, while Ryan pins the blame on \u201centitlements\u201d \u2014 Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the like \u2014 a major issue is that revenue is much less than the CBO has projected in the past. As an example, in 2009, the CBO projected that the deficit in 2019 would be $235 billion, or 1.1 percent of GDP; now it is projected to be $981 billion, or 4.6 percent of GDP.\n\nHere, Ryan says that tax revenue will continue to rise despite the tax cuts. That\u2019s correct in raw dollars, vs. a baseline. But it belies the fact that the new tax law greatly reduced revenue, despite claims that it would pay for itself. In June, for instance, the CBO said that tax revenue would account for 18.3 percent of GDP in 2025; now it says it would be 17.5 percent in 2025.\n\nWe choose 2025 because after 2025, the revenue estimates start to veer into possible fantasy. The CBO bases its estimates on current law, and the tax law has individual tax cuts expiring in 2025, even though Republicans say they assume the cuts will be extended by a future Congress. When one looks at the \u201calternative scenario\u201d offered by the CBO, which assumes that the tax cuts will stay in place, individual tax revenue grows at a slower pace. (Ryan\u2019s staff notes that tax revenue in 2025 would be 17.5 percent of GDP, higher than a 50-year average of 17.4 percent calculated by the CBO.)\n\nRevenue does not keep up with mandatory spending, but another big reason for the increase in the deficit is the additional interest that will need to be paid on the new debt issued by the U.S. Treasury. Interest on the debt is anticipated to cost $915 billion in 2028, or 3.1 percent of GDP. (Extending the tax cuts would bring the debt service to $952 billion.) By contrast, the defense budget would be smaller in 2028 \u2014 $769 billion, or 2.6 percent of GDP.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, opposed by Ryan, did restrain growth in Medicare, which led to political attacks; similarly, Democrats continue to run attack ads against \u2018Social Security privatization\u201d even though the ill-fated George W. Bush plan to add private accounts to the retirement plan died in 2005. The House in 2017 passed a repeal of Obamacare that also would have overhauled Medicaid, but the plan died in the Senate.\n\nBut the revenue side of the picture cannot be ignored. Even if revenue would hit a 50-year average as a percentage of GDP, mandatory spending in the past was a much smaller share of the U.S. economy, according to the historical tables maintained by the White House budget office. In 1968, when tax revenue was 17 percent of GDP, mandatory spending was 6.4 percent; in 1978 and 1988, tax revenue was about 17.5 percent and mandatory spending was about 9.6 percent.\n\nSince then, tax revenue has hovered around 17 or 18 percent of GDP, but mandatory spending has continued its forward march: 10.1 percent of GDP in 1998, 11.4 percent in 2008 and anticipated to be 13.3 percent in 2018 and 15.4 percent in 2028. Congress has not been able to grapple with the spending \u2014 and keeps taking steps to undermine the revenue flow as well.", "lang": "en"}
