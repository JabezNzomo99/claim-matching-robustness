Tests on a sick passenger came back negative\n\nRumours that Nigeria has been hit by another Ebola outbreak have been circulating on Whatsapp and other social media over the past few days, with some online posts claiming there had been a confirmed case of the deadly virus in Lagos. But while a sick female airline passenger was initially feared to have potentially carried the disease from the Democratic Republic of Congo, officials say she tested negative. Health authorities say there is no need to panic and that the risk of Ebola arriving in the country remains low.\n\nConcerns over a potential outbreak began rising after this alert began circulating among Nigerian medical professionals on Whatsapp.\n\nThe message -- we\u2019ve been unable as yet to determine its origin -- soon began circulating on Whatsapp in general. Many people were unsure of whether to believe the rumours. Some online posts, including one on Facebook which we\u2019ve archived here, claimed outright that there had been an Ebola outbreak in Lagos.\n\nOfficials confirmed that a passenger was indeed screened for Ebola this week after arriving at Lagos\u2019 airport. She had been vomiting and had a fever, which can be symptoms of Ebola. And she was arriving from DR Congo, where a major Ebola epidemic has left at least 1,400 people dead since last August.\n\nAhmad Sa'eid, the national chairman in charge of aviation health, said the woman had travelled from DR Congo \u201cfor a church programme in Nigeria\u201d.\n\n\u201cShe was acutely ill, febrile and had [an] episode of vomiting. Her travel history made her a contact suspect for Ebola, and she was promptly isolated,\u201d Sa\u2019eid said via email.\n\nHe added that the woman was taken to the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Lagos -- where medical tests showed that she was NOT carrying Ebola.\n\n\u201cResults came out this pm, and is NEGATIVE for Ebola. The subject is well now, and has been discharged from hospital,\u201d Sa\u2019eid said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s health ministry also said there was no case of Ebola in the country.\n\nAbdullaziz Abdullahi, permanent secretary at the ministry, said that since the outbreak in DR Congo, \u201cheightened surveillance has been ongoing at the various ports of entry by officials of the Port Health Services division of the ministry to prevent importation into Nigeria\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo this effect, every sick passenger has been properly screened and I can say categorically that none of the patients screened tested positive for Ebola or any deadly disease,\u201d Abdullahi said.\n\nNigerian officials are stressing the need for screening at transport hubs as the last Ebola outbreak recorded in Nigeria, in August 2014, came after a passenger arrived the same Lagos airport with the deadly virus. This led to 20 confirmed cases and eight deaths.\n\nAlong with the current resurgence of Ebola in DR Congo, Ugandan officials confirmed last week that three members of a family had tested positive for the virus and one of them, a five-year-old boy, has died. The family had travelled to DR Congo to take care of the children\u2019s grandfather, who also died of Ebola.\n\nKenya has experienced a similar scare to Nigeria in recent days. As reported by AFP, a woman initially feared to be carrying Ebola ultimately tested negative.\n\nRisk of another outbreak in Nigeria is low, officials say\n\nBut health officials at the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control have stressed that \u201cbased on available data, the overall risk of importation of EVD (Ebola Virus Disease) to Nigeria remains low\u201d, an assessment that is in line with that of the World Health Organization.\n\nAmong other factors limiting the risk, \u201cthere are no direct commercial flights and no known direct trade routes to Nigeria from Uganda,\u201d the NCDC said via a statement.\n\nLike the health ministry, the NCDC said that screenings were in place at airports, adding that \u201cemergency operations centres\u201d are up and running at major points of entry in Lagos, Kano, Abuja and Port Harcourt.\n\nWhat can I do to help prevent Ebola?\n\nThe NCDC offers a few pieces of advice to general members of the public:\n\u2022 Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, or hand sanitizers when soap and water are not available.\n\u2022 Avoid physical contact with anyone who has possible symptoms of an infection with an unknown diagnosis.\n\u2022 Make sure fruits and vegetables are properly washed and peeled before you eat them.\n\nDespite the outbreak in DR Congo, the World Health Organization is not currently advising against travel to the country. However, it does advise people to seek medical advice before travelling and to practise good hygiene.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of Ebola and how does it spread?\n\nSymptoms of Ebola include fever, weakness, muscle pain, headache and a sore throat. These are usually followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash and, in some cases, bleeding.\n\nPeople are only infectious after they have developed symptoms. The virus spreads among humans through close contact with the blood, body fluids, secretions or organs of an infected person, or objects contaminated by such fluids.", "lang": "en"}
