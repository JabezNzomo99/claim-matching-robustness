But the fine print of his proposal would make it harder for them to escape violence and poverty in their home countries.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2019-01-23T08:00:29.666Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-44068", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/23/president-trump-spins-asylum-restrictions-humanitarian-relief/", "vclaim": "\u201cWe want to save lives. We want children to be safe. The children are being decimated. And I\u2019m not talking about necessarily children in our country. I\u2019m talking about wonderful children that are coming up from other places, whether it\u2019s Honduras or Guatemala, or El Salvador or Mexico, or other places. And we have to take care of those children also. We can\u2019t let them die on the way up.\u201d\n\nThe same report says: \u201cThe violence experienced by the population of the NTCA [Northern Triangle of Central America] is not unlike that of individuals living through war. Citizens are murdered with impunity, kidnappings and extortion are daily occurrences. Non-state actors perpetuate insecurity and forcibly recruit individuals into their ranks, and use sexual violence as a tool of intimidation and control. This generalized and pervasive threat of violence contributes to an increasingly dire reality for the citizens of these countries.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees says governments should not return refugees to the places where they face threats. \u201cThe principle of nonrefoulement is so fundamental that no reservations or derogations may be made to it,\u201d the U.N. agreement says. \u201cIt provides that no one shall expel or return (\u2018refouler\u2019) a refugee against his or her will, in any manner whatsoever, to a territory where he or she fears threats to life or freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese treaties are not directly enforceable in U.S. law, but some of the obligations they contain have been implemented through domestic implementing legislation,\u201d the rule proposal says. \u201cFor example, the United States has implemented the non-refoulement provisions of these treaties \u2014 i.e., provisions prohibiting the return of an individual to a country where he or she would face persecution or torture \u2014 through the withholding of removal provisions.\u201d\n\nHaving a process to request asylum from outside the United States is not a new idea. What makes Trump\u2019s proposal unique is that he would do this while simultaneously barring asylum claims from Central American children who present themselves in the United States. (According to the Daily Beast, Central American minors at the border would still be able to seek Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, but that system is already backlogged and requires children to \u201cprove in family court that they were abandoned or abused by a parent.\u201d)\n\nThat provision could bar many asylum claims. The bill does not define what it means to be a \u201cqualified\u201d parent or guardian. For context, border officials encountered 58,600 unaccompanied minors in fiscal 2018, most of them from Central America. In addition, thousands more Central American minors at the border were traveling with parents or legal guardians. There\u2019s no breakdown, but the total for all children and adults encountered as family units was 161,113 in fiscal 2018.\n\nAs a provision of the TVPRA, unaccompanied children from noncontiguous countries such as El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras remain in the United States while their cases are evaluated. Trump\u2019s proposal would change that, allowing U.S. officials to return children from those three countries promptly unless an \u201cimmigration officer determines that it is more probable than not that the unaccompanied alien child will be trafficked on return to his or her country\u201d or determines that the child could qualify for asylum.", "lang": "en"}
