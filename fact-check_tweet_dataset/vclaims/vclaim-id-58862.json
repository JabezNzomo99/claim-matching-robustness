The claim is false; the video actually shows a by-election victory parade in Singapore in 2012.\n\nThe video was published here on Facebook on June 24, 2020. It has been viewed more than 11,000 times.\n\nThe three minute 46-second video shows an open-top truck travelling slowly along a crowded street. A group of people standing in the back of the truck can be seen reaching to shake hands with people surrounding the vehicle.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s caption states: \u201cEarly this morning WP go round greeting their supporters lining the road to shake hands putting COVID-19 away as if life returned to normal. It shows the citizens support to WP in Aljunied GRC.\u201d\n\n\u201cWP\u201d refers to The Workers' Party, a political party in Singapore and \u201cAljunied GRC\u201d is Aljunied Group Representation Constituency, a five-member group representation constituency in the north-eastern and eastern region of Singapore.\n\nSingapore went to the polls on July 10, 2020 that saw the ruling People's Action Party retain power, but with a significantly reduced majority, after the opposition Workers' Party picked up 10 seats -- its best ever showing at an election.\n\nThe claim in the Facebook post, however, is false.\n\nAt the video's three-minute 30-second and three-minute 32-second marks, a blue placard can be seen on the side of a truck. It reads \u201cVote Workers\u2019 Party\u201d alongside a photo of a man.\n\nA subsequent keyword and reverse image search found the video shows Png Eng Huat, a member of the opposition Workers' Party who was elected MP after winning the 2012 Hougang by-election. Here is an AFP report about the 2012 vote.\n\nA further keyword search found two videos published here and here on YouTube on May 27, 2012, that appear to have been taken from a similar angle of the same scene.\n\nThe YouTube videos show the same spectacled man and placard on the side of the truck.\n\nBelow are screenshot comparisons of the video in the misleading post (L) and the 2012 YouTube videos (R), with the identical elements circled in red by AFP:\n\nThis Google Maps image of Hougang corresponds with the background seen in the video.\n\nThe misleading post was also debunked by Reuters here.", "lang": "en"}
