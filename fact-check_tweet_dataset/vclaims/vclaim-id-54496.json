Some may argue that this group is merely flashing an \u201cOK\u201d symbol, but this argument doesn\u2019t really hold up, especially when you consider that the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated the Proud Boys as a hate group that espouses white supremacist ideals, and that white supremacists have adopted the \u201cOK\u201d hand gesture as a symbol of hate.\n\nThis photograph was taken around the time of the Dorchester Conference, Oregon\u2019s oldest Republican political conference, in March 2018. The Willamette Week reported that Stone, who was scheduled to speak at the event, hired members of the Proud Boys to be his private security.\n\nRoger Stone\u2014the former political adviser to Richard Nixon and President Donald Trump\u2014appeared without incident at the state\u2019s oldest Republican conference last weekend. But an organizer of the Dorchester Conference in Salem says Stone was so worried for his safety that he enlisted a right-wing group as private security. Patrick Sheehan, a Dorchester board member who booked Stone, says Stone reached out to the Proud Boys\u2014a group notorious for its participation in Portland street brawls\u2014after reading about violent political clashes in Oregon. \u201cHe was worried about getting killed,\u201d Sheehan says. \u201cHe gets death threats constantly.\u201d Photos of Stone drinking with a handful of Proud Boys circulated across social media over the weekend, outraging Democrats.\n\nThe photograph of \u201cStone drinking with a handful of Proud Boys\u201d mentioned in the Willamette Week article was originally posted by InfoWars host Alex Jones on Twitter on March 3, 2020. The image was captioned: \u201cInfoWars Roger Stone joined the @proudboysUSA in Salem Oregon tonight. I joined them in spirit!\u201d\n\nThis is a genuine image of Stone with members of the Proud Boys in March 2018. Although the meaning behind the \u201cOK\u201d hand gesture is a bit murky \u2014 it was, and is still, widely used as a harmless symbol for approval or consent \u2014 this symbol has been adopted by white supremacists as a symbol of hate.\n\nHere\u2019s the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s explanation of the \u201cOK\u201d hand gesture as a symbol of hate:\n\nIn 2017, the \u201cokay\u201d hand gesture acquired a new and different significance thanks to a hoax by members of the website 4chan to falsely promote the gesture as a hate symbol, claiming that the gesture represented the letters \u201cwp,\u201d for \u201cwhite power.\u201d The \u201cokay\u201d gesture hoax was merely the latest in a series of similar 4chan hoaxes using various innocuous symbols; in each case, the hoaxers hoped that the media and liberals would overreact by condemning a common image as white supremacist. In the case of the \u201cokay\u201d gesture, the hoax was so successful the symbol became a popular trolling tactic on the part of right-leaning individuals, who would often post photos to social media of themselves posing while making the \u201cokay\u201d gesture. Ironically, some white supremacists themselves soon also participated in such trolling tactics, lending an actual credence to those who labeled the trolling gesture as racist in nature. By 2019, at least some white supremacists seem to have abandoned the ironic or satiric intent behind the original trolling campaign and used the symbol as a sincere expression of white supremacy, such as when Australian white supremacist Brenton Tarrant flashed the symbol during a March 2019 courtroom appearance soon after his arrest for allegedly murdering 50 people in a shooting spree at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.\n\nAnd here\u2019s how Southern Poverty Law Center described the Proud Boys:\n\nEstablished in the midst of the 2016 presidential election by VICE Media co-founder Gavin McInnes, the Proud Boys are self-described \u201cwestern chauvinists\u201d who adamantly deny any connection to the racist \u201calt-right,\u201d insisting they are simply a fraternal group spreading an \u201canti-political correctness\u201d and \u201canti-white guilt\u201d agenda. Their disavowals of bigotry are belied by their actions: rank-and-file Proud Boys and leaders regularly spout white nationalist memes and maintain affiliations with known extremists. They are known for anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric. Proud Boys have appeared alongside other hate groups at extremist gatherings like the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville. Indeed, former Proud Boys member Jason Kessler helped to organize the event, which brought together Klansmen, antisemites, Southern racists, and militias. Kessler was only \u201cexpelled\u201d from the group after the violence and near-universal condemnation of the Charlottesville rally-goers. Other hardcore members of the so-called \u201calt-right\u201d have argued that the \u201cwestern chauvinist\u201d label is just a \u201cPR cuck term\u201d McInnes crafted to gain mainstream acceptance. \u201cLet\u2019s not bullshit,\u201d Brian Brathovd, aka Caeralus Rex, told his co-hosts on the antisemitic The Daily Shoah \u2014 one of the most popular alt-right podcasts. If the Proud Boys \u201cwere pressed on the issue, I guarantee you that like 90% of them would tell you something along the lines of \u2018Hitler was right. Gas the Jews.\u2019\u201d", "lang": "en"}
