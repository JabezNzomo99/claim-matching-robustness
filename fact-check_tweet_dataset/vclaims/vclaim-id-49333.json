Aside from the fact that 5G has nothing to do with the new coronavirus (as we have written many times), Leicester has had 5G coverage since at least November 2019, some months before Covid-19 was first detected in the UK, and long before the city was put into a more restrictive lockdown for the second time.\n\nOther cities, like Hull, Leeds and Newcastle, first got 5G more recently than Leicester, from at least December 2019, and these places aren\u2019t currently going back into lockdown.\n\n5G has been available in cities like London, Cardiff and Edinburgh since May 2019.\n\nOn 29 June 2020, Matt Hancock announced that because the number of Covid-19 cases had continued to rise in Leicester, while they had generally decreased in the rest of England, that the city and some surrounding areas would not be subject to the imminent relaxation of lockdown restrictions planned for the rest of England, and that some previously relaxed restrictions would be re-imposed.\n\nAmong the measures were that non-essential shops were asked to close from 30 June, and bars, restaurants and hairdressers would not be allowed to open from 4 July.\n\nThese measures will be reviewed on 18 July.\n\n5G has nothing to do with Covid-19\n\n5G has nothing to do with the symptoms of Covid-19. Covid-19 is a disease caused by a virus, called SARS-CoV-2. Scientists have been studying the disease and its cause for several months now, and have sequenced the genetic material of the virus.\n\nAnd as we\u2019ve written about before, there is no evidence that 5G is harmful to humans.\n\nLike the previous generations of wireless network technology before it (4G, 3G and 2G), 5G mobile data is transmitted over radio waves. Radio waves are found at the low-frequency end of the spectrum and\u2014alongside microwaves, visible light and heat\u2014are what\u2019s known as \u201cnon-ionising\u201d radiation. This means that these waves cannot damage the DNA inside cells, which is how waves with higher frequencies (such as x-rays, gamma rays and ultraviolet light) are thought to cause cancer.", "lang": "en"}
