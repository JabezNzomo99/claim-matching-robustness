According to media reports, he interacted with them and arranged for their travel. Soon after, two images from the interaction started circulating on social media. In both the pictures, a woman is being highlighted to claim, \u201cWhere do you find labourers who travel in Innova?\u201d The claim implies that the whole affairs was a photo-op and this woman was not a labourer but brought to the spot in a car.\n\nThe images were also shared on a Facebook group with the same claim.\n\nAlt News was requested by several users on its official Android application to fact check the claim.\n\nWith a reverse search of the image on Google, we found a set of images tweeted by the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee President Ajay Kumar Lallu on May 16, the day Rahul Gandhi met migrant workers. In three of the four images, the woman, who is being highlighted in the images shared on social media, can be seen. Ajay Lallu said that Rahul Gandhi met migrant labourers who were walking towards Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh in Delhi\u2019s Ashram area. \u201c[He] stayed there for some time to understand their pain. All of these people were sent to their homes. (translated),\u201d reads Ajay Kumar Lallu\u2019s tweet. In two of the pictures, one can see that some people are sitting inside the car.\n\nSeveral media outlets reported on Rahul Gandhi\u2019s meeting with migrants. On May 16, news agency ANI also tweeted images of the meeting. While the first showed Gandhi interacting with migrants, the rest of the three images showed migrants travelling in a car. In the second picture from the left, the same woman in a green sari can be spotted. In the tweet posted below, ANI has quoted a statement from a labourer saying, \u201cComing from Haryana, have to go to Jhansi\u201d. It further stated that Congress party volunteers had later arranged vehicles for the migrants to take them to their homes.\n\nA video report posted by Jansatta said that Rahul Gandhi had arranged cars for 25 migrants labourers to drop them home. At 1:45 minutes in Jansatt\u2019s video report, the same woman can be seen getting inside the car. Further, migrant labourers can be heard saying that Rahul Gandhi came to meet them sometime back and that he booked a car for them which will take them to their homes. The migrants also said that they were given food, water and masks.\n\nTherefore, images of some migrant labourers, for whom cars were arranged to drop them home, was shared with misleading claims on social media.", "lang": "en"}
