Greg Abbott, the Republican who in 2014 launched the legal challenge joined by more than 20 other states when he was still the attorney general of Texas, told Sean Hannity of Fox News: \"I think we will win all the way for one simple reason, and that is: The man you just had on the screen, Barack Obama, is our star witness.\"\n\nAbbott added in the Feb. 17, 2015, interview: \"22 times Barack Obama said he did not have the authority to implement this type of measure. And then the day after he signed this into law, he said, quote, \u2018I just changed the law.\u2019 Those words alone show that he violated the Constitution and violated federal law.\"\n\nWe learned of Abbott\u2019s quotation of Obama and his \"22 times\" count from a , which also noted the president\u2019s exact wording , \"I just took an action to change the law,\" and that Obama made that comment five days after the adminstration\u2019s action was announced, not the next day.\n\nWe looked into Abbott\u2019s count of 22 and his quotation, ultimately finding his statement close to completely so.\n\nBut we started by revisiting recent history.\n\nIn November 2014, Obama to forswear the deportation of unauthorized residents meeting certain conditions, telling the American people: \"If you\u2019ve been in America for more than five years; if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents; if you register, pass a criminal background check, and you\u2019re willing to pay your fair share of taxes \u2014 you\u2019ll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation. You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law.\"\n\nShortly before Obama detailed his 2014 moves, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., the Democratic president\u2019s statement that his position hadn\u2019t changed on using executive authority to address immigration. Notably, the administration in June 2012 demonstrated a willingness to apply its discretionary powers by issuing a \"deferred action\" directive that immigration officials not deport young immigrants who had not otherwise run afoul of the law. The move potentially shielded hundreds of thousands of residents under age 30. Critics called the move an abuse of authority. Proponents said it was in keeping with the yet-to-pass DREAM Act providing a path to citizenship for children brought to the U.S. by immigrants not legally permitted to live here.\n\nFast-forward to Dec. 3, 2014; that\u2019s when Texas and other states were challenging the latest Obama move in federal court. And that day included a version of the Obama quotation we\u2019re looking into: \"What you\u2019re not paying attention to is, I just took an action to change the law.\" Speaking to reporters, Abbott commented: \"The president\u2019s job is to execute the laws, not de facto make law by suspending parts of laws that are passed by Congress.\"\n\nWe asked Abbott to elaborate on his claim to Fox News and didn\u2019t hear back.\n\nBut we recognized he\u2019d echoed another Texan\u2019s criticism. In December 2014, U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, drew a from us after saying Obama had previously \"said over 20 times he did not have the legal authority\" to act as he did on immigration. McCaul had relied by House Speaker John Boehner, which we found partly flawed, making McCaul\u2019s count too high. In the end, still, we confirmed nearly 15 instances from 2010 into 2014 of Obama saying he couldn\u2019t do more to spare immigrants from deportation absent congressional action.\n\nAsked about McCaul's claim at the time, White House spokesman Eric Schultz responded by email, pointing out a from the federal Office of Legal Counsel stating the president\u2019s actions fit within the government\u2019s discretionary powers. , in the Justice Department, is responsible for providing authoritative legal advice to the president and executive-branch agencies.\n\nIt\u2019s a challenge to characterize the president\u2019s remarks. For instance, Abbott\u2019s legal filing included Obama\u2019s Sept. 28, 2011, response to a law student\u2019s request that he do his part to enable students who immigrated to the U.S. with their parents to become legal residents.\n\nAs noted in the legal filing, Obama replied: \"I just have to continue to say this notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true. We are doing everything we can administratively. But the fact of the matter is there are laws on the books that I have to enforce.\" The legal filing ends the quotation there, yet and said he retained enforcement discretion. \"Now, what we can do is to prioritize enforcement,\" the president said, \"since there are limited enforcement resources, and say we\u2019re not going to go chasing after this young man or anybody else who\u2019s been acting responsibly and would otherwise qualify for legal status,\" if laws were changed.\n\nWe counted 15 Obama quotations--not 22--in the Texas-led legal filing supportive of Abbott\u2019s point, with nearly all of them previously tick-tocked in our check of McCaul. For more analysis of relevant details, see our rundown here.\n\nDid Obama say he personally \u2018changed the law?\u2019\n\nNext, we searched the White House website and isolated what Obama said in a Chicago speech Nov. 25, 2014 after at least one audience member interrupted his remarks to urge a complete end to deportations.\n\nHere\u2019s what Obama replied, according to the :\n\n\"I've heard you. But you\u2019ve got to listen to me, too. All right? (Applause.) And I understand you may disagree. I understand you may disagree. But we've got to be able to talk honestly about these issues. All right?\n\nNow, you're absolutely right that there have been significant numbers of deportations. That's true. But what you're not paying attention to is the fact that I just took action to change the law. (Applause.) So that's point, number one.\"\n\nObama went on: \"Point number two, the way the change in the law works is that we're reprioritizing how we enforce our immigration laws generally. So not everybody qualifies for being able to sign up and register, but the change in priorities applies to everybody.\"\n\nAbbott said that 22 times, Obama \"said he did not have the authority to implement this type of\" anti-deportation \"measure. And then the day after he signed this into law, he said, quote, \u2018I just changed the law.\u2019\"\n\nLike McCaul, Abbott overstates the number of confirmed instances of Obama indicating he couldn\u2019t independently do more to prevent deportations. He also left out some of what Obama said about changing the law and was slightly off on the president\u2019s timing. With these clarifications, though, Abbott\u2019s statement is spot-on.\n\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
