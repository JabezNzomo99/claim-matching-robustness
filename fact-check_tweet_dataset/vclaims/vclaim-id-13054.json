As with any counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.\u201d\n\nIn an unusual declassified report released in January, the CIA, the FBI and the National Security Agency had announced that they had \u201chigh confidence\u201d that \u201cRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election\u201d and that \u201cPutin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\u201d Comey\u2019s statement was the first official confirmation that activities of people associated with the Trump campaign also were being investigated.\n\nMoreover, Comey firmly rejected Trump\u2019s tweeted claim on March 4 that former president Barack Obama had ordered wiretaps of him in the Trump Tower. \u201cI have no information that supports those tweets, and we have looked carefully inside the FBI,\u201d Comey said. \u201cThe Department of Justice has asked me to share with you that the answer is the same for the Department of Justice and all its components. The department has no information that supports those tweets.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, NSA Director Michael S. Rogers dismissed the White House suggestion that Obama asked British intelligence to spy on Trump \u2014 a claim already angrily rejected by Britain. Rogers confirmed that such a request would be a violation of U.S. law and that such a claim by Trump \u201cclearly frustrates a key ally of ours.\u201d\n\nThis was a strange claim, especially because if you watch the video, Rogers makes clear that, when asked about whether Russian cyber-actors changed vote tallies in Michigan and other states, he replied: \u201cI would highlight we are a foreign intelligence organization, not a domestic intelligence organization. So it would be fair to say, we are probably not the best organization to provide a more complete answer.\u201d\n\nIndeed, when later asked about the presidential tweet, Comey said it did not reflect what he and Rogers had said: \u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t our intention to say that today.\u201d\n\nBut this was also false. Comey was specifically talking about the Jan. 6 document issued by the intelligence agencies \u2014 a document that the Trump White House has largely ignored, except to suggest it was fake. Former director of national intelligence James Clapper later issued a statement saying it was \u201cin the best interest of all Americans\u201d to investigate possible Trump-Russia ties.\n\nComey was very careful not to discuss individuals, such as fired national security adviser Michael Flynn. He noted that the listeners were not to draw any unwarranted conclusions from his refusal to comment. But apparently his warning fell on deaf ears at the White House.\n\nThe president\u2019s tweets throughout the day were misleading, inaccurate or simply false. The gravity of the disclosures might have called for a more restrained response, as the White House\u2019s well of credibility is only so deep. But the president chose another approach \u2014 which clearly backfired, tweet after tweet.", "lang": "en"}
