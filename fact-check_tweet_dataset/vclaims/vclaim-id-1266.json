This claim is false. The FBI did not report this.\n\nExamples of the claim are visible here , here and here .\n\nThe claim comes weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump took to Twitter to criticize Democratic leaders, alleging without evidence that \u201cAntifa and other far left militant groups can take over a city without barely a wimpier (sic).\u201d ( here ).\n\nThe Washington Post recently reported that Attorney General William Barr had formed a task force to investigate \u201canti-government extremists,\u201d including \u201cthose who self identify as Antifa.\u201d ( here ).\n\nLast month, FBI Director Christopher Wray also delivered remarks during a virtual press conference in which he updated the public in regard to \u201ccoordination efforts related to the civil unrest\u201d following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25 ( here ).\n\nDuring the press conference, Wray referred to Antifa as \u201canarchists\u201d and stated that outside agitators were \u201cexploiting this situation to pursue violent, extremist agendas.\u201d\n\nThe FBI told Reuters in a statement via email: \u201cOur focus is not on membership in particular groups but on individuals who commit violence and criminal activity that constitutes a federal crime or poses a threat to national security.\n\n\u201cThe FBI has not made any such statements about the occupations of people who are attracted to particular ideologies,\u201d the statement specified.\n\nThe posts on social mischaracterize what the FBI has reported about Antifa\u2019s members and activities.\n\nIn recent months Trump has called for the U.S. government to designate Antifa as a terrorist organization, a move that legal experts say would be hard to execute.\n\nIt is not clear how many, if any, of the protesters participating in demonstrations across the country since May are from Antifa, which experts note is not an organization but rather an amorphous movement ( here ).\n\nFalse. The FBI did not report on the most common occupation of suspected members of Antifa.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
