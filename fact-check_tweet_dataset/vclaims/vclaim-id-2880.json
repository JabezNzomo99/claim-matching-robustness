Several provisions of the tax bills would benefit wealthy individuals like Trump.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that the president has claimed that a tax overhaul wouldn\u2019t be good for him, or the wealthy, despite analyses of the tax plans that show most of the benefits accruing to the top income earners. But we can\u2019t say exactly how the plans would impact Trump, since he has broken decades of political precedent by refusing to release his tax returns. A Democratic effort in the House to force the release of Trump\u2019s tax returns failed this week.\n\nTrump made his latest unsubstantiated claim about the impact on the tax plans in a speech in Missouri on Nov. 29.\n\nThe statistical odds alone are that Trump or his \u201cvery wealthy friends\u201d will come out ahead. According to the Tax Policy Center\u2019s analysis of the House bill, 76.5 percent of those earning more than $1 million would get a tax cut in 2018 and 70.6 percent of them get a cut in 2027, compared with current law. Under the Senate bill, more than 80 percent of millionaires get a tax cut in both 2019 and 2027, with the average cut at more than $46,000 in the latter year.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation\u2019s analyses found that more than 50 percent of the tax relief goes to those earning at least $200,000 in 2027 under the House bill, or 2025 under the Senate bill.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin acknowledged that the wealthy would have to benefit from these tax overhauls, since they pay most of the federal income taxes. Mnuchin told Politico in October: \u201cSo when you\u2019re cutting taxes across the board, it\u2019s very hard not to give tax cuts to the wealthy with tax cuts to the middle class. The math, given how much you are collecting, is just hard to do.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how Trump may be affected by some of the major tax provisions:\n\nEstate tax. The clearest benefit for the Trump family would be the tax bills\u2019 changes to the estate tax, which falls on estates worth more than $5.49 million (nearly $11 million for a couple). The House bill would repeal the estate tax entirely in 2024. As we\u2019ve written before, that would save Trump\u2019s estate $564 million, according to a Bloomberg estimate, based on a net worth of $3 billion. Trump has said his net worth is $10 billion, and if so, the savings to his estate from a repeal of the tax would be $1.9 billion.\n\nThe Senate bill would also lead to substantial savings for Trump\u2019s estate, but less than the House bill. The Senate legislation wouldn\u2019t eliminate the tax but would double the exemption thresholds, making the tax liable for estates worth more than $11.2 million, or $22.4 million for a couple. (Like many individual income tax provisions in the Senate bill, this is set to expire in 2025. But Republicans say they will extend the tax provisions at some point.)\n\nSee this chart from the Tax Policy Center on the major provisions of the two bills.\n\nPass-through taxes. The tax bills aim to lower the tax rate on some pass-through business income \u2014 these are taxes paid by sole proprietorships, LLCs, partnerships and S corporations. Such entities don\u2019t pay corporate taxes; instead the owners or investors pay taxes on the business earnings through their individual income tax returns. On a 2005 tax return, which was obtained by DCReport.org in March, Trump reported more than $100 million in such pass-through income (reported as business income, or rental real estate, partnership and S corporation income on form 1040).\n\nRight now, the top rate on pass-through income is the top individual income tax rate of 39.6 percent, which falls on income above $470,700 for a married couple. The House bill cuts the top rate to 25 percent for \u201cpassive\u201d income, such as rental income and businesses in which the taxpayer isn\u2019t materially involved, and 35.22 percent for \u201cactive\u201d income, such as income from businesses where the taxpayer regularly works. The Senate bill is more complicated, with a 38.5 percent top rate after a 17.4 percent deduction. That deduction is limited to 50 percent of paid wages for the business entity.\n\nAlternative minimum tax. Both bills repeal the AMT, which was designed to ensure that wealthy taxpayers pay a minimum tax. On that 2005 return, Trump paid $31 million in taxes due to the AMT.\n\nSteven Wamhoff, senior fellow for federal tax policy at the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, told the New York Times that those last two items \u2014 lower pass-through tax rates and an AMT repeal \u2014 \u201care so hugely beneficial to Trump that I have trouble imagining any way that he wouldn\u2019t come out ahead.\u201d\n\nThe Times noted that Trump paid 24 percent of his income in 2005 because of the AMT, but would have paid just 4 percent without it.\n\nSALT deductions. Trump, like some other high-income taxpayers from high-tax states, could see a drop in the amount he could claim as itemized deductions, because the bills would eliminate a deduction for state and local income or sales taxes. However, those state taxes aren\u2019t deductible under the AMT. So it\u2019s unclear how much Trump benefits from the deduction now.\n\nBottom line: The president needs to release his tax returns to support his claim.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: For more about Trump\u2019s tax speech, see our item, \u201cTrump\u2019s Claims Don\u2019t Add Up.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
