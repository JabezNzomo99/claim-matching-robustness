In some cases, far less confidence.\n\nFor example, 86 percent of Germans said they had \u201ca lot of confidence\u201d or \u201csome confidence\u201d in Obama, but only 11 percent said the same of Trump.\n\nSeparately, the Pew Global Attitudes Project measures foreign opinion of the United States. That survey found that only two of the 37 countries have a more favorable opinion of the United States since Trump took office.\n\nThe president made his remarks about world respect at a campaign rally, which got far more media attention for his criticism of professional football players who kneel during the pregame national anthem.\n\nWe cannot find any surveys that measure \u201crespect,\u201d and the White House could not provide any. However, the Pew Global Attitudes Project since 2002 has been tracking world confidence in U.S. presidents and world opinion of the U.S. in general. Pew reports a sharp decline in both.\n\nIn June, the Pew Research Center released the results of its surveys in 37 countries and found that among those nations \u201ca median of just 22% has confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs.\u201d By contrast, \u201ca median of 64% expressed confidence\u201d in Obama.\n\nThe decline in confidence in the U.S. president has been severe in some countries since Trump took office on Jan. 20, 2017, and it \u201cis especially pronounced among some of America\u2019s closest allies in Europe and Asia, as well as neighboring Mexico and Canada,\u201d Pew found.\n\nIn addition to Germany, which we mentioned earlier, only 14 percent of French citizens surveyed said they had \u201ca lot of confidence\u201d or \u201csome confidence\u201d in Trump \u2014 a drop of 70 percentage points from the 84 percent that expressed confidence in Obama.\n\nOther notable low confidence scores for Trump: Mexico, 5 percent; Canada, 22 percent; the United Kingdom, 22 percent; Japan, 24 percent; and Italy, 25 percent.\n\nThe biggest decline was in Sweden. Pew found 93 percent of those surveyed expressed confidence in Obama, but only 10 percent said the same of Trump.\n\nThe Pew survey shows that Trump received \u201chigher marks than Obama in only two countries: Russia and Israel.\u201d The increase was particularly pronounced in Russia, where 53 percent of those surveyed said they had confidence in Trump. Only 11 percent had expressed confidence in Obama.\n\nThe lack of confidence in the current U.S. president is also having an impact on the image of the U.S. in general.\n\n\u201cIn countries where confidence in the U.S. president fell most, America\u2019s overall image has also tended to suffer more,\u201d Pew reports. \u201cIn the closing years of the Obama presidency, a median of 64% had a positive view of the U.S. Today, just 49% are favorably inclined toward America. Again, some of the steepest declines in U.S. image are found among long-standing allies.\u201d\n\nThe steepest decline was in Mexico, where only 30 percent of those surveyed said that they had a favorable view of the United States \u2014 down from 66 percent in 2016.\n\n\u201cFavorability ratings have only increased in Russia and Vietnam,\u201d Pew reported.\n\nThe Pew Research Center surveyed 40,448 people in 37 countries from Feb. 16 to May 8, 2017.", "lang": "en"}
