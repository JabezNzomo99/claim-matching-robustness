At the time, nationwide protests against police violence and racial injustice were unfolding across the United States after a Black man died while in police custody in Minneapolis. These protests renewed calls to remove statues connected to slavery, the Confederacy, and racism. While we don\u2019t know exactly why this Stevie Ray Vaughan statue was vandalized, the \u201cFTP\u201d on this statue is likely shorthand for \u201cFuck the police.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson with the Austin Parks and Recreation Department told us that the picture was real, and that the statue had since been cleaned. No permanent damage was done.\n\nThis was not the first time that this statue had been tagged with graffiti. In 2018, for example, a football fan wrote \u201cPhilly loves St. Nick,\u201d a reference to Austin-born quarterback Nick Foles, on the statue and then dressed it in a Philadelphia Eagles jersey.", "lang": "en"}
