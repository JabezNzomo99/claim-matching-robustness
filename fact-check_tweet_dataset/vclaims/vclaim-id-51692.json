Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern greeting video on the occasion of Janmashtami festival. Fact: Video in the post shows US Congress Representative of Hawaii Tulsi Gabbard, speaking about the importance of Bhagavad Gita on the occasion of Janmashtami festival. It has nothing to do with New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn reverse image search of the screenshots in the video, we found out that it is US Congress Representative Tulsi Gabbard who was speaking about the importance of Bhagavad Gita in the video. This video was found in the official youtube channel of Tulsi Gabbard.\n\nShe published the same video on her twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts. It can be seen here, here and here. Articles related to this greeting video can also be seen here and here.\n\nWhen we searched for greeting video posted by New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern, we did not find any greeting video on the occasion of Janmashtami by Jacinda Ardern.\n\nTo sum it up, video of US Congress representative Tulsi Gabbard is falsely portrayed as that of New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern greeting on the occasion of Janmashtami.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
