The school\u2019s principal said the school attempted to donate as many as possible.\n\nThe Facebook post features a photo of a recycling dumpster filled with dozens of books behind Sunrise Park Middle School in White Bear Lake, Minnesota. The books were allegedly thrown away by the middle school because there was no way to clean them, a concern likely linked to children returning to school during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cAll the books have been removed from the classrooms,\u201d the post\u2019s caption reads. \u201cThey claim that the books cannot be cleaned.\u201d (RELATED: \u2018Book Of Yeezus\u2019 \u2013 Did Kanye West Publish A Bible That Replaces \u2018God\u2019 With His Name?)\n\n\u201cHundreds and hundreds of books regarding American history including Native Americans like Sitting Bull and Famous Sioux Chiefs, foreign nations far and wide, the Holocaust and even Mister Rogers, found in dumpster behind Sunrise Park Middle School in White Bear Lake, MN,\u201d the post continues. \u201cNo sign of any fiction books, just non-fiction regarding history, cultures, wars, tyranny, communism, politics, etc. They are trying to erase history.\u201d\n\nHowever, the books were neither discarded due to COVID-19 concerns nor in an effort to \u201cerase history.\u201d Rather, the books were weeded out from the school\u2019s collection to ensure it stays up to date, according to a statement from the principal.\n\n\u201cWeeding is sometimes thought of as selection in reverse because it removes resources from the collection when they are no longer useful,\u201d the American Library Association explains on its website. \u201cIt involves evaluation of the collection in order to determine which resources need to be removed from the collection.\u201d\n\nAfter the photo began circulating online, Sunrise Park Middle School principal Christina Pierre stated in a July 10 message to the community that the school\u2019s media specialist had been removing outdated books from the school\u2019s collection and tried to \u201cdonate as many of the materials as possible,\u201d before putting the remainder of the books in the recycling bin. Some organizations could not accept the books because they \u201cdidn\u2019t meet a specified criteria because of the outdated content, required a fee or aren\u2019t accepting donations with COVID-19 restrictions,\u201d Pierre said.\n\n\u201cThe books in this picture were removed from the school\u2019s library either because they were outdated and/or because they had not been checked out by any student during the past several years,\u201d Pierre told the Daily Caller in an email. \u201cBooks would be considered outdated if they have information that is no longer accurate (for example, a book that refers to the USSR instead of Russia).\u201d\n\nSome residents salvaged some of the discarded books to be donated, local Fox affiliate KMSP reported.", "lang": "en"}
