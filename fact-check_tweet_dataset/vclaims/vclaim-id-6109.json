Franklin Drilon\u2019s question on the number of individuals killed during \u201clegitimate\u201d police operations since July 1, 2016, Dela Rosa said:\n\nDela Rosa's figures do not match the ostensibly \u201creal numbers\u201d on the war on drugs published by the PNP itself, in its own website.\n\nAn infographic called \u201cReal Numbers PH,\u201d which appears on the homepage of the PNP website, puts the number of \u201cdrug personalities who died in anti-drug operations\u201d at 3,811 during the period July 1, 2016 to Aug. 29, 2017.\n\n\n\n\u201cReal Numbers PH\u201d data is sourced from four government agencies involved in the anti-illegal drugs campaign: the PNP, the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, the National Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Customs.\n\nBefore Dela Rosa, Pres. Rodrigo Duterte himself on several occasions blundered on figures on the war on drugs, the supposed centerpiece policy of his administration.\n\nOn Aug. 4, Duterte exaggerated the monetary value of shabu confiscated during his term. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Duterte skews war on drugs figures; Aquino gets it wrong too)\n\nOn Aug. 21, he incorrectly claimed that two to three cops are being killed every day in the war on drugs. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Duterte says 2-3 cops killed daily in war on drugs)\n\n(Guided by the code of principles of the International Fact-Checking Network at Poynter, VERA Files tracks the false claims, flip-flops, misleading statements of public officials and figures, and debunks them with factual evidence.
