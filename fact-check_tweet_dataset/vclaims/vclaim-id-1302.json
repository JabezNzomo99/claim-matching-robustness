It\u2019s up to you what you count as grotesque, but to take earners at opposite ends of the income scale, on the minimum wage you\u2019d earn \u00a35.30 an hour as a 18-20 year old. Whereas the average FTSE 100 Chief Executive now reportedly earns \u00a35.5 million a year.\n\nFigures quoted by the Office for National Statistics suggest the richest 10% get almost 30% of gross income in the UK.\n\nThere are a lot of different ways to measure inequality. Overall, income inequality actually seems to have decreased slightly in recent years.\n\n\u201cSince 2007/08, there has been a slight decrease in overall income inequality on a range of measures, though from a longer-term perspective remains above levels seen in the early 1980s\u201d, according to the ONS.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies commented recently that \u201cThe combination of strong employment growth, some earnings growth for low-paid workers, and a lack of earnings growth for others, has kept inequality below its pre-recession level\u201d.\n\nBut it also said that a slight fall in inequality for most people has been offset by the share of income going to the top 1% continuing to increase, at least up until the recession.\n\nWealth inequality is a lot harder to measure. We\u2019ve written more about it here.\n\nIncome and wealth aren\u2019t the whole argument. Mr Corbyn stated that \u201cLabour\u2019s goal isn\u2019t just greater equality of wealth and income but also of power\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
