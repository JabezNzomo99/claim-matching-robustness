No vaccine against the novel coronavirus is currently available.\n\nFeatured in the image is a medicine vial with the words \u201cBovine Rotavirus-Coronavirus Vaccine\u201d printed on its label. The post uses this cattle vaccine to suggest the novel 2019 coronavirus, known as COVID-19, has been known about \u201cfor years.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust in case you are wondering how much the media controls people, America has been vaccinating cattle for coronavirus for years,\u201d reads the post. \u201cYet the news tells you it\u2019s new and gunna (sic) kill you all so go buy a mask.\u201d (RELATED: Did Trump Call The Coronavirus A \u2018Hoax\u2019 At His South Carolina Rally?)\n\nThe pictured vaccine, however, isn\u2019t for COVID-19. It\u2019s actually for \u201chealthy, pregnant cows and heifers as an aid in preventing diarrhea in their calves caused by bovine rotavirus (serotypes G6 and G10), bovine coronavirus, and enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli,\u201d per the manufacturer\u2019s website.\n\nBovine coronavirus is part of the coronavirus family but distinct from the novel 2019 coronavirus that had not been previously identified in humans before December. No vaccine for COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel virus, is currently available, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\n\u201cMore than 20 vaccines are in development globally, and several therapeutics are in clinical trials,\u201d World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told the Daily Caller in an email. \u201cWe expect the initial results within a few weeks.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
