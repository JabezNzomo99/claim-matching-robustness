{"title": "Moldovan President Says 'No Advantages' From EU Agreement", "subtitle": "Dodon\u2019s claim, made during a recent visit to Moscow, is not backed by the data. Moldova, a small impoverished state sandwiched between Romania and Ukraine, has actually increased its exports to the EU since the Association Agreement was signed in 2014. Exports to Russia are down but that trend dates back to 2006 when Moscow slapped an import ban on Moldovan wine as bilateral ties soured.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "February 06, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-1828", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/moldova-eu-agreement-/28276865.html", "vclaim": "Igor Dodon made his claim during a visit to Moscow on January 17, his first trip abroad since he was sworn in a month earlier as president, a mostly ceremonial post in Moldova, one of Europe\u2019s poorest countries.\n\nDodon had vowed to improve relations with Russia while campaigning ahead of the October vote.\n\nIn the Russian capital, Dodon met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and said afterward that he wanted \u201cfull re-establishment\u201d of economic cooperation with Moscow.\n\nDodon then slammed the 2014 EU Association Agreement, one of several similar pacts Brussels has inked with former Soviet republics to foster closer economic and political ties.\n\n\u201cThis agreement [Association Agreement with EU] did not bring Moldova any advantages. We\u2019ve lost the Russian market while, oddly enough, our exports to the EU also fell. We\u2019ve gained nothing from the signing of this agreement,\u201d Dodon claimed in comments widely reported by Western news agencies.\n\nBut is it true? Official data not only from the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive body, but Moldova\u2019s government itself show the country has benefited from the deal, and not just due to higher exports to EU countries.\n\nAccording to European Commission data, financial support provided to Moldova before and after the signing of the Association Agreement, has amounted so far to some 700 million euros. A large chunk of this money was to make sure Moldovan exports \u2013 mostly agricultural goods -- meet European standards.\n\nMoldovan export figures crunched by the European Commission and Moldova\u2019s own National Bureau of Statistics vary, but both show the country\u2019s exports to the EU have been more robust compared to other markets.\n\nThat is clear from the data for 2015, the first full year after the signing of the Association Agreement, but also when Moldova was rocked by the fallout from a huge banking scandal. As a result, economic indicators all dropped that year.\n\nData from the National Bureau of Statistics show the value of Moldovan exports decreasing from 2.3 billion in 2014 to 1.9 billion in 2015, a drop of 16 percent.\n\nDespite this drop, statistics from the European Commission and released to RFE/RL\u2019s Moldovan Service show that Moldovan exports to the EU rose by 5 percent in 2015, with agricultural exports up even higher at 9 percent.\n\nAccording to the European Commission, Moldovan exports to the EU grew by 21 percent between 2013 and 2015.\n\nEconomy Minister Octavian Calmic told RFE/RL that trade with Russia has declined because \u201cMoldovan economic actors have found alternatives, primarily in European markets.\u201d\n\nCalmic questioned Dodon\u2019s assertion that Moldova had lost the Russian market since the signing of the EU Association Agreement.\n\nCalmic explained Moldova\u2019s trade ties with Russia began going south in 2006 when Moscow slapped an import ban on wine from Moldova and Georgia.\n\nMany observers criticized that move as political retribution for both countries' pursuit of closer relations with the West.\n\nAt the time, Moldova\u2019s economic minister designated closer ties with the EU a top foreign policy objective. His name? Igor Dodon.", "lang": "en"}
