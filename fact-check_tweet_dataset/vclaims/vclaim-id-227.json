It makes three claims about how this alleged inflation is occurring. The claim outlined first is the subject of this check. The other claims made within this social media post are outside the scope of this check.\n\nThe first claim reads: \u201cThe test used in hospitals can only check for the whole family of Corona viruses (rather than just the new \u201cCover-19\u201d [Sic]), present in many healthy people who would test positive\u201d.\n\nThis claim is not correct. Public Health England (PHE) told Reuters that at the beginning of the outbreak, patients who were symptomatic were indeed simultaneously tested for all coronaviruses (a pan-coronavirus assay - detecting each of the four circulating human coronaviruses), but this was in addition to three different tests for COVID-19.\n\nBy the end of January, they had moved to a single assay test for COVID-19, which is in still in use today.\n\nBritain reported its first confirmed coronavirus case on January 31, which means most cases were confirmed using a single COVID-19 test (here).\n\nPHE said that it was \u201cone of the first organisations outside of China to implement a diagnostic test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, and the diagnosis of COVID-19\u201d. SARS-CoV-2 is the name of the virus that causes COVID-19, which is the disease.\n\nAlthough SARS-CoV-2 is part of the coronavirus family, there is specific test for it - meaning UK hospitals are not broadly testing for all coronaviruses as the post suggests.\n\nWhile there are limitations to all diagnostic tests, this is accounted for when the results are being interpreted. PHE said that \u201cCOVID-19 laboratory results from any supplier, both positive and negative, should be interpreted in the context of the clinical presentation\u201d, including the clinical likelihood of the patient having the disease.\n\nFalse. UK hospitals have a specific diagnostic test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
