Police stopped vehicular traffic from both sides as the animal started attracting crowds who were keen to take images and videos. The leopard was later seen entering a private farm on the Shamshabad Road, but was still untraceable at the time of writing this story. A team of police, forest officials and officials from the Nehru Zoological Park were looking to rescue the animal. It is unclear if the leopard was injured. \n\n\n\nA video uploaded by Hindustan Times from the incident shows the same divider and electric pole. Other visuals such as the movements of the leopard and the wall alongside the road are exactly the same as the viral video. The video can be seen below.\n\n\n\nAlso read: Tigers On The Prowl In Madhya Pradesh?
