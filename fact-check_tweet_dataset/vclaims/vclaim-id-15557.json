After multiple exterminators say they can\u2019t handle the problem, he decides to bring in \"one guy...who guarantees to get rid of them.\" The message suggests that although the man may have shortcomings, such as being an alcoholic, smelling bad or swearing, it doesn\u2019t matter \u2013\u2013 as long as he gets rid of the raccoons.\n\n\"Here's why we want Trump: Yes, he's a bit of a jerk; Yes, he's an egomaniac; but we don't care!\" the analogy continues. \"The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republicans and Democrats can be two-faced and gutless, and illegals are everywhere.. We want it all fixed!\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It is several years old.\n\nThe message appears to have originated in March 2016 when it was posted on conservative website \"100% FED up!\" In the introduction, the website said the letter was submitted by an anonymous 80-year-old American.\n\nBest we can tell, the attribution to Harvey started in 2019, when a different man named (you guessed it) Steve Harvey posted it on his Facebook page. His post was shared over 160,000 times.\n\nAt some point, the TV host\u2019s photo was attached to the rant. The rest is celebrity misattribution history.", "lang": "en"}
