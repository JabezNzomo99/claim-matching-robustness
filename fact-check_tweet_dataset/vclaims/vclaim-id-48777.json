One such 'advisory', attributed to the Stanford Hospital Board, claims that if you can hold your breath for more than 10 seconds, you are not infected by coronavirus.\n\n\"Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort stiffness or tightness, etc., it proves there is no Fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicates no infection.In critical time, please self-check every morning in an environment with clean air,\" says part of the claim posted by Facebook page \"Relationship Essentials Radio\".\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral claim is misleading. The fact is that most young Covid-19 patients will be able to hold their breaths for much longer than 10 seconds, while on the other hand, many elderly without the virus won\u2019t be able to do it.\n\nThe Stanford University has also tweeted to clarify that the viral advisory was not issued by them.\n\nFaheem Younus, the chief quality officer and chief of infectious diseases, University of Maryland UCH, has also tweeted that this piece of viral information is not correct.\n\nPIB has also debunked the claim.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that just by holding your breath for 10 seconds, you cannot confirm if you are infected by coronavirus or not.\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: Fake WHO's warning of lockdown in India goes viral\n\nALSO WATCH| We need to practice social distancing: Health ministry", "lang": "en"}
