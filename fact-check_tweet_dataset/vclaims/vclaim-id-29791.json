This week, he found a new way to misrepresent the program.\n\nTrump said those who win the diversity visa lottery are awarded U.S. citizenship. That\u2019s not how it works. Eligible entrants selected in the lottery must pass an extensive background check before they are given green cards, or legal permanent resident status.\n\nThose who get green cards can apply for citizenship in five years. But it\u2019s not automatic. In order to become a citizen, green card holders have to demonstrate \u201cgood moral character\u201d \u2014 meaning, for example, that they pay their taxes and don\u2019t commit any crimes \u2014 and they have to learn English and pass a test on U.S. history and government.\n\nMany who come to the U.S. via the diversity visa program never become naturalized citizens.\n\nTrump\u2019s latest misinformation about the diversity visa program came during remarks at the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association Roundtable on Feb. 13.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot wrong packed into those few sentences. As he has in the past, Trump suggests foreign governments have a hand in who gets selected. As we have written before, that\u2019s not true.\n\nThe Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, or DV program, uses a computer lottery system to randomly issue up to 50,000 immigrant visas each year \u2014 from among millions who apply \u2014 to qualified applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. Applicants are self-selected. There is no evidence of other countries gaming the system to offload their undesirable residents.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim that \u201cthey\u2019re not giving us their finest\u201d is also misleading. In the past, he has been more direct, saying the U.S. is getting the \u201cworst of the worst\u201d from other countries.\n\nIn fact, there is evidence that diversity visa recipients are better educated than most other immigrants \u2014 better educated than Americans as a whole \u2014 and that they are more likely than most other immigrants to be employed in management, professional and related occupations and less likely to be unemployed.\n\nThe Migration Policy Institute estimates that about 50 percent of diversity visa recipients have at least a college degree. That\u2019s based on U.S. Census Bureau survey data for the educational attainment of immigrants from countries that have high rates of their residents entering the U.S. with diversity visas between fiscal years 2012 and 2016. Among those immigrants age 25 years and older, 50 percent held a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. That\u2019s a higher percentage than the 32 percent among the overall U.S. population.\n\nThe Migration Policy Institute cross-referenced its findings with a federally funded research project that tracked immigrants who obtained green cards in 2003. The project, known as the New Immigrant Survey, also found that 50 percent of diversity visa holders had a college degree or higher (18 percent had a graduate degree). That\u2019s lower than the 80 percent of employment-based immigrants who held a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. But it\u2019s significantly higher than the 28 percent of family-sponsored immigrants who had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst at MPI, told us in a phone interview.\n\nThe MPI report concluded that \u201cthe high educational attainment of diversity visa holders proves an important lesson for future U.S. immigration reforms: One does not need a \u2018merit-based\u2019 system, or one that allows entry only of college- or graduate-educated individuals in order to attract highly skilled immigrants.\u201d\n\nTrump repeatedly has misrepresented how the diversity visa program works, and the quality of people it attracts, as he did in his State of the Union address.\n\nThe new wrinkle this week was the incorrect assertion that the diversity visa lottery automatically awards U.S. citizenship.\n\nThose whose names are selected through the diversity visa lottery still must undergo a lengthy background screening. As we have written, this means checks to make sure the person has not committed a crime, doesn\u2019t have a serious health problem, isn\u2019t a terrorist, hasn\u2019t committed fraud, and hasn\u2019t overstayed a visa in the U.S.\n\nThere are more than a dozen grounds of inadmissibility, including health issues, criminal activity, national security concerns and the \u201clikelihood of becoming a public charge,\u201d meaning \u201ca person who is primarily dependent on the government for subsistence.\u201d And in order to even be eligible for the lottery, applicants must demonstrate that they have a high school education, or its equivalent, or \u201ctwo years of work experience within the past five years in an occupation that requires at least two years of training or experience to perform.\u201d\n\nProvided all of that checks out, the lottery winners are granted legal permanent resident status, otherwise known as a green card. That\u2019s not U.S. citizenship, though it puts them on the path to apply for citizenship.\n\nIn order to apply for citizenship, one must hold a green card for at least five years; demonstrate \u201ccontinuous residence\u201d in the U.S. for five years; be able to read, write and speak basic English; and pass a brief oral exam on U.S. history and government. Applicants also must \u201cbe a person of good moral character,\u201d meaning, for example, that they pay their taxes and child support and have committed no crimes.\n\nOver the last several years, immigrants spent a median of seven years in lawful permanent resident status before becoming citizens, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nNo perfect data exists on the naturalization rates of diversity visa holders, but a report issued by USCIS in 2016 looked at the 10-year naturalization rates for various categories of immigrants. Those who got legal permanent resident status through the diversity visa program were part of an \u201cothers\u201d category. Among those in that \u201cothers\u201d category from 2004 \u2014 the most recent cohort included in the analysis \u2014 58 percent went on to gain citizenship. That\u2019s not a perfect analysis, as the \u201cothers\u201d category includes some who came to the U.S. through programs other than the diversity visa lottery, but it demonstrates the point that not all green card holders become citizens.\n\nOn Feb. 14, Trump threw his support behind an immigration plan proposed by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and others that would eliminate the diversity visa program. The same day, a bipartisan group of senators agreed on an immigration plan that would keep the diversity visa program.\n\nWe take no position on the future of the program. Our role is to provide accurate information about a program that has been misrepresented by the president.", "lang": "en"}
