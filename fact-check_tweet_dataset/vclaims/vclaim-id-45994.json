The first two show empty cityscapes and are labeled \"Chicago\" and \"New York.\" The third shows a highway clogged with cars. This photo is labeled \"South Carolina.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThat supposed photo of South Carolina? It\u2019s Houston. The Houston Chronicle ran it with a 2017 story about traffic congestion. According to the caption, it shows traffic on Interstate 45 around downtown Houston during the afternoon rush hour.\n\nThe image labeled Chicago appears to be a photo of Michigan Avenue in downtown Chicago \u2014 based on the architectural landmarks \u2014 but it\u2019s not of the city under a stay-at-home order. We found it posted to a website called desktopbackground.org three years ago. The photo is reversed.\n\nOnly the photo labeled New York actually shows Times Square in New York City during the pandemic.\n\nIt\u2019s true that South Carolina was behind New York and Chicago in issuing statewide orders limiting the movements of its residents. Charleston and Columbia, S.C., told people to stay at home before the state issued its statewide mandate. Gov. Henry McMaster didn\u2019t direct all South Carolinians to follow suit until this month. The order was effective on April 7.\n\nBut this Facebook post misrepresents what that looked like in South Carolina, using an old photo of Houston to claim that South Carolinians are flouting the law.", "lang": "en"}
