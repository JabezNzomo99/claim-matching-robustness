In exchange, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations agreed to lift a broad range of sanctions on Iran. U.S. allies say the Iran deal has helped maintain stability. Critics of the deal say that the broad lifting of sanctions has enabled Iran to increase its influence in a volatile region and that the accord does not restrict Iran from developing ballistic missiles.\n\nIran also has agreed to abide by the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s Additional Protocol. It has committed to ratify this agreement in 2023. The IAEA already has the ability to investigate nuclear facilities and activities disclosed by Iran\u2019s government. The Additional Protocol supplements those powers by giving IAEA investigators the \u201cability to investigate undeclared nuclear facilities and activities by increasing the IAEA\u2019s authority to inspect certain nuclear-related facilities and demand information from member states,\u201d according to a 2017 report by the Congressional Research Service. Simply put, Iran has agreed to give international inspectors wide-ranging authority to peer into its nuclear activities.\n\nThe JCPOA limits the number of IR-1 centrifuges Iran may have at its Natanz plant to 5,060, and it restricts the \u201cnumber and type of more advanced centrifuges that may be tested over this period,\u201d according to a timeline from the Nuclear Threat Initiative produced by the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, Calif. Those restrictions expire in 2026. (IR-1 centrifuges are decades old and not very efficient.)\n\n\u201cUnder Article II [of the Non-Proliferation Treaty], Iran may not \u2018manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices,\u2019 \u201d Lewis said. \u201cBut did Iran\u2019s pre-2003 nuclear weapons research constitute the \u2018manufacture\u2019 of nuclear weapons? I said yes at the time, but Iran\u2019s defenders said that it did not \u2014 they claimed that research and development fell short of the definition of \u2018manufacture.\u2019 The JCPOA settles this debate by barring Iran from conducting research and development, prohibiting an itemized list of the pre-2003 activities. This provision does not sunset.\u201d\n\n\u201cIran has nuclear programs that could potentially provide Tehran with the capability to produce both weapons-grade highly enriched uranium (HEU) and plutonium \u2014 the two types of fissile material used in nuclear weapons,\u201d according to the report from the Congressional Research Service. \u201cStatements from the U.S. intelligence community indicate that Iran has the technological and industrial capacity to produce nuclear weapons at some point, but the U.S. government assesses that Tehran has not mastered all of the necessary technologies for building a nuclear weapon.\u201d In addition to the production of weapons-grade nuclear material, a nuclear weapons program requires other key elements, such as warhead design and reliable delivery systems.\n\n\u201cLeft unchecked, in about a decade Iran will be closer to producing enough nuclear fuel for a bomb \u2014 a \u2018breakout capability\u2019 \u2014 than it was before the agreement was finalized in 2015,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe Europeans recognize the danger of allowing the sunset clauses to stand, yet they haven\u2019t offered any serious solutions. They are, however, rebuilding business with the Islamic Republic. Although the nuclear deal placed restrictions on Tehran\u2019s gas centrifuge uranium-enrichment program, the regime will be allowed in just six years to ramp up the centrifuge manufacturing process essential for the production of thousands of advanced centrifuges.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that as part of the JCPOA, Iran said it was bound by this commitment: \u201cIran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons.\u201d According to the Congressional Research Service report, \u201cOfficials from both the Barack Obama and Donald Trump administrations have certified that Iran is abiding by its JCPOA commitments.\u201d\n\nWhether the president was referring to \u201cTermination Day\u201d in 2025, or to the portions of the JCPOA that sunset in 2026, Iran has pledged to never develop nuclear weapons. The Non-Proliferation Treaty, the IAEA\u2019s Additional Protocol and other parts of the JCPOA \u2014 all of which Iran has committed to \u2014 run well past 2025, and key provisions apply indefinitely.", "lang": "en"}
