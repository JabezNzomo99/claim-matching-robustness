Hot Bitter Melon Affects Cysts and Tumours, and Can Cure all Types of Cancer.\u201d\n\n\u201cA research report at the cellular level in the laboratory found that bitter melon contains antioxidants that may help fight cancer cells. However, drinking hot bitter gourd is not associated with cancer treatment and cannot be treated for cancer,\u201d the report reads.\n\nThe National News Bureau of Thailand also refuted the claim in a report published here on June 22, 2020. The article is titled \u201cNational Cancer Institute warns about fake news: Hot Bitter Melon Affects Cysts and Tumours, and Can Cure all Types of Cancer.\u201d\n\nThe Sure and Share Centre, a Thai fact-checking organisation, debunked the same claim about bitter melon in this video report posted to YouTube on January 30, 2019.\n\nAFP has debunked multiple other claims about false cancer treatments, such as drinking cold water and eating a no sugar diet.", "lang": "en"}
