Hispanics are the country\u2019s largest ethnic minority group at , and by 2060, the Hispanic population is expected to reach nearly 130 million. That would equal about a third of all Americans.\n\nAlready, there are signs of a shift, Ramos said.\n\n\"The most popular name is no longer John or Steven,\" Ramos told Stewart. \"It's Jose, Camilo and Maria.\"\n\nLike Stewart, we wondered if Ramos\u2019 claim was correct.\n\nWe got in touch with Ramos, and he clarified that when he talked about names, he had states like California and Texas in mind, not so much the entire United States. And he thought he was talking about which names were more popular (as a comparison), not the most popular overall.\n\nThe ultimate source on baby names is the , which conveniently provides a database that allows you to slice and dice the information by year, state and name.\n\nWe found that in certain states, Ramos is partly right. In the five states with the highest portion of Hispanic residents, Jose is more popular than both John and Steven. We looked at other states that have some of the largest numbers of Hispanics and found that there is a break point.\n\nWhen the Hispanic population is above 27 percent of the total, Jose outranks John. Below that line, John is more popular.\n\nSo Ramos has a point when it comes to Jose and even more so for Steven, which fails to make the top 100 in Texas, Arizona and New Mexico. Ramos\u2019 batting average falls for the rest of the names he gave. Camilo barely ranks in the top 1,000 nationwide. Maria is more popular but never does better than its rank of 58 in Texas.\n\nWe should give a nod to the creativity or maybe just the flexibility of American parents. Since 2000, the popularity has fallen for every name Ramos mentioned, except Camilo. Nationally, Jose fell from 34 to 72, John went from 14 to 28, Steven dropped from 54 to 112, and Maria from 41 to 101. Camilo only shows up in the top 1,000 starting in 2009 and its rank moved from 901 to 837.\n\nIf you were wondering, the most popular names in 2012: Jacob and Sophia.\n\nRamos said that the most popular names are no longer John or Steven, but Jose, Camilo and Maria. Afterward, Ramos said he was thinking of states with large Hispanic populations.\n\nWith that caveat, he has a bit of a point. In states with the highest percentage of Hispanics, Jose beats out John and Steven. Camilo and Maria are not really contenders. None of these names are the most popular in any state.\n\nWe rate the claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
