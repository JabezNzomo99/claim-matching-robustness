Only voluntary app users' locations can be tracked; the locations of people in their contacts list who have not installed the app cannot be tracked.\n\nDifferent mobile applications are using Bluetooth and/or GPS technology to trace various users' locations (on a voluntary basis) to inform public health workers about transmission zones and contact patterns.\n\nIn early 2020, a number of smartphone applications (apps) were tested and launched across North America to help regions identify which users have been infected with the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, who they came into contact with, and transmission zones.\n\nThese apps are attempting to help make contact tracing easier, a form of disease control that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) calls a key strategy for preventing further spread of the disease. The process involves public health staff who work with COVID-19 patients to help them recall everyone they came into contact with during the time they may have been infectious. Staff then warn exposed individuals in a rapid and sensitive manner (while protecting the identity of the patient) and provide support and information on how to mitigate the spread.\n\nIn May 2020, a number of Facebook posts claimed that mobile apps that are using contact tracing to research COVID-19 transmission patterns are also taking information from the user\u2019s device to \u201cidentify, track or locate\u201d various contacts on their phones or their Facebook friends lists. Most posts refer to one of two such apps: Healthy Together or ABTraceTogether. The posts say:\n\nThese posts greatly exaggerate the extent to which apps have access to contact lists and particularly to Facebook accounts.\n\nHealthy Together, built by Twenty Holdings, Inc., was rolled out by the state of Utah in April and May 2020, as part of an effort to help public health officials trace contacts of those infected with the disease, and to allow Utahns to track their symptoms and find the nearest testing center. The app uses GPS, location data, and Bluetooth technology to identify potential contacts.\n\nBluetooth technology allows health officials to gather data by connecting devices to each other, while GPS data allows them to track a person\u2019s movements and their location to within 5 to 10 feet. Thus, Bluetooth determines potential person-to-person transmission of the disease while GPS tracking figures out potential transmission zones and how contagious diseases can move through populations and regions.\n\nThe Utah government is encouraging more people to download this application. As of May 13, more than 45,000 people had done so, at least 2% of the state\u2019s population, according to CNBC.\n\nThe app is opt-in and voluntary and allows users to control what data they release. They own their personal data and can delete it at any time. Location data is automatically deleted after 30 days, symptom data becomes anonymous after 30 days, and users can identify what data they would like to share, which includes Bluetooth data, location data, or contact lists.\n\nThe FAQ on the Utah government\u2019s coronavirus resources website suggest that officials are taking precautions around user privacy as well:\n\nHealthy Together\u2019s privacy policy also states users may provide the following, among other details:\n\nHealthy Together responded to Snopes\u2019 questions about these rumors:\n\nOnly if a user opts-in to share their phone\u2019s contact list, can they then invite friends on their contact list to use the app. Sending this invitation will prompt their contact to join Healthy Together, but this invitation to join the app is also opt-in. Sending an invitation to a friend does not mean Healthy Together will track or automatically collect data. If someone chooses to download the app by accepting their friend\u2019s invitation, they too have to opt-in to share any data permissions. The app is not connected to Facebook and Healthy Together users cannot invite their Facebook friends to use the app. Healthy Together is not tracing anyone who is not a user of the app, and is not tracing anyone who does not opt in to the Bluetooth or location data permissions. Healthy Together is completely opt-in, users own their data, and can delete it at any time.\n\nThus the app\u2019s ability to access your contact list is in the user\u2019s control and is available only to invite friends to download the app. The app does not appear to have the ability to access your Facebook friends list. Furthermore, the app can only track and identify people who have downloaded it, so those people without the app cannot be tracked.\n\nThe app ABTraceTogether requires even less information from the user. The other app at the center of the Facebook/phone contacts rumor mill has been downloaded in the Canadian province of Alberta 100,000 times as of May 5. This voluntary app also does not connect to your phone contact list or Facebook friends list but collects only the following information:\n\nContact tracers, health officials who are trying to track down people exposed to the virus, may ask users about their locations in verbal interviews. The app\u2019s privacy policy states:\n\nThe privacy policy further points out that because tracers rely only on Bluetooth technology and not GPS, they do not collect data about users\u2019 locations; they only communicate with nearby phones through Bluetooth for a limited period.\n\nPrivacy advocates like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) are critical of apps that ask for names and phone numbers of users, arguing that will erode trust and discourage people from signing on. They argue that developers need to be as transparent as possible to ensure their app is effective. Bennett Cyphers, a Staff Technologist with EFF spoke to Snopes, arguing that ultimately these apps should only get what is absolutely necessary from the user, with \u201cas little private information [and] strict data minimization,\u201d something they don\u2019t agree apps like Healthy Together and ABTraceTogether are doing:\n\n[The government] doesn\u2019t need [this information], they want it \u2026 Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s proposals [have] ways to do it where the user\u2019s phone is able to give push notifications to the user through anonymized data. There are ways to do contact tracing that is privacy preserving, and that the government doesn\u2019t get data at all. The only difference between [the] decentralized contact tracing approach (which Apple and Google are proposing) and the centralized approach is that in the first model [when] someone who you\u2019ve contacted is sick, [you will be notified] on your phone and it will tell you what to do and which public health officials to get in touch with. The other scenario is the government calls you themselves. The government prefers the latter because it gives them more control. We don\u2019t think there is a significant difference in the outcome [pertaining to health access] for users. \u2026All these apps are opting to share a record of who the people interacted with. That can reveal a lot about what you do, whether you engage in political activism, criminal activity, all kinds of things not related to COVID, and the government will have access [to it] \u2026 We wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you what the government will do [with this] but what they could do \u2026 [and] that\u2019s the problem.\n\nJeff Jenkins, associate professor of Information Systems at the Brigham Young University, Marriott School of Business, said this about Healthy Together in a published news interview: \u201cJenkins said he feels like the app gives users a reasonable amount of control over their data, even if it\u2019s not totally clear how the data will be used. \u2018With any app, there is a tradeoff between the intended benefit \u2014 in this case, combating COVID-19 \u2014 and privacy.'\u201d\n\nA range of contact-tracing apps were being tested and implemented in the spring of 2020. In May, Apple and Google released their own smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they have been exposed to someone with the virus. Unlike Healthy Together, their tech relies solely on Bluetooth technology to monitor person-to-person contact. Many of these apps are achieving mixed results, and the full implications of their impact on data privacy are being closely followed by groups like EFF and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).\n\nIn sum, little evidence exists to indicate that apps like Healthy Together and ABTraceTogether are collecting others\u2019 information from users\u2019 phone or Facebook contacts, especially without consent. As their privacy policies outline, the information they gather is for specific health-related purposes, and all the information given is with the user\u2019s consent. Healthy Together can receive your contact list if you agree to it, while ABTraceTogether only asks for your phone number. Furthermore, users have to actually install the app for their interactions to be monitored, or their location to be tracked. Individuals without the app will not be tracked this way. As such, we rate this claim a \u201cMixture.\u201d\n\nUpdate, Dec. 2, 2020: In July 2020, Utah\u2019s state epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn announced that Healthy Together\u2019s major feature of using GPS and Bluetooth location tracking would be turned off, \u201cWe\u2019ve learned over the course of the last three months that location tracking isn\u2019t popular and as a result, it hasn\u2019t really been helpful to our contact tracing efforts.\u201d In November, the state\u2019s health leaders announced their intention to explore using Google and Apple technology to notify users if they had been exposed to the coronavirus. Healthy Together now serves as a symptom checker and a resource for people in the event that they get COVID-19.\n\nABTraceTogether has also face issues with its effectiveness. In November, the Alberta government revealed that its app had been used to trace only 20 cases over six months. The province also said that issues with the app could persist on devices made by Apple and the app needs further testing. Apple and Google\u2019s contact tracing software forms the backbone of the federal Canadian government\u2019s COVID Alert app, and is being used in all provinces except Alberta and British Columbia.", "lang": "en"}
