Under alert level two, retail businesses were not required to keep records on customers.\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s government introduced a four-tiered COVID-19 Alert System in March that outlines measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. The system moved from alert level three to alert level two starting on May 14, loosening some restrictions on public spaces, Forbes reported.\n\nThe May 15 Facebook post claims that moving to alert level two made the use of the EVA Check-In app mandatory to enter New Zealand establishments. The app, developed by Theta, offers a \u201csecure, contactless way\u201d to help businesses with guest registration via QR code, according to the tech company\u2019s website. It does not appear to be a contact tracing app.\n\n\u201cThis started yesterday in New Zealand, the first day of Level 2,\u201d reads the post, which is accompanied by a photo of an EVA Check-In flyer. \u201cYou cannot go into a STORE, Post Shop, mall, unless you scan in the QR code posted outside with the contact tracing app, your phone camera, or sign a register (where your name. address and phone details are visible to everybody), and in some cases (people are telling me), have your photo taken.\u201d\n\nShopping malls and other retail stores were not required to keep record details on their customers during alert level two, according to New Zealand\u2019s COVID-19 website. Under alert level two measures, non-retail businesses had to keep customer records, but such records did not need to be collected using EVA Check-In, according to AFP Fact Check.\n\n\u201cEVA Check-in does not ban anyone,\u201d a Theta spokesperson told AFP Fact Check. \u201cIt is the responsibility of the business to keep a guest register. If someone does not check in with EVA it is up to that business to offer a manual alternative if they wish.\u201d (RELATED: Does The Australian Government\u2019s COVIDSafe App Track Users\u2019 Locations?)\n\nNZ COVID Tracer is the New Zealand government\u2019s only official contact tracing app, and it is \u201centirely voluntary,\u201d according to the Ministry of Health. EVA Check-In \u201cis not connected with the NZ COVID Tracer app,\u201d a spokesperson for Theta told AFP Fact Check.\n\nStarting June 9, New Zealand is operating under alert level one procedures. That alert level lifts restrictions on personal movement, gatherings and businesses, though maintaining records for contact tracing is still encouraged, according to New Zealand\u2019s COVID-19 website.", "lang": "en"}
