Let\u2019s try to check the veracity of the claims made in the post.\n\nWhen one looks at the Twitter account of Chandrashekar Ravan if he has given any clarification regarding the rumours over his real name, a tweet by him rubbishing such rumours was found. In his tweet, he referred to a tweet that made allegations over his name and has written, \u201cI have not stopped laughing since I have read this post. Well, the name \u2018Naseemuddin\u2019 is not bad\u201d.\n\nTo verify his name in any of the official records, we accessed a copy of bail order granted by Allahabhad High Count after his arrest regarding the Saharanpur violence in 2017. It can be noted that even in the bail order his name is mentioned as \u2018Chandrashekhar @ Ravan\u2018. Hence there is no evidence to claim Bhim Army Chief Chandra Shekar Ravan\u2019s actual name is Naseemuddin Khan.\n\nWhen BOOM contacted Chandra Shekar on Twitter, he said, \u201cThe BJP does these things to defame me.\u201d (\u201c\u092f\u0947 \u092d\u093e\u091c\u092a\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u094b\u0917 \u092c\u0926\u0928\u093e\u092e \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0910\u0938\u0940 \u091a\u0940\u091c\u0947\u0902 \u0915\u0930\u0935\u093e\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u201d). Finally, there is no truth in the rumours that Bhim Army Chief Chandrashekar Ravan\u2019s actual name is Naseemuddin Khan.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of DECODE Lite series.", "lang": "en"}
