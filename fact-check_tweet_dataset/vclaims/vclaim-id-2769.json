After climbing into the room of the 3 and 6-year-old sisters, James got more than he bargained for when family\u2019s Pitt Pull Terrier leaped to the girl\u2019s defense. The dog severed the rapist\u2019s genitals clean off and swallowed his penis and testicles.\n\nThere was no truth to this story, which originated with Neon Nettle, a fake news site that traffics in fabricated clickbait tales. This item wasn\u2019t even original to Neon Nettle, as it strongly resembled an earlier story from a different fake news site positing that a pitbull had torn off the genitals of a man who tried to rape the dog.\n\nThe photograph that accompanied the Neon Nettle story had nothing to do with a canine attack or an attempted rape. Rather, the picture of the alleged perpetrator was a still image taken from a video showing a man\u2019s reaction to being given ketamine (an anesthetic) after fracturing his ankle in a skateboarding accident:", "lang": "en"}
