Times Now aired a broadcast on the skirmish on May 26. \u201cThe biggest concern for the Indian army has been the Chinese troops around several key points including the post of KM120 along with the Galwan valley. Times Now accesses the visuals,\u201d read the description of the broadcast on YouTube.\n\nThe complete broadcast is below. At 49 seconds, the anchor says, \u201cAnd in fact, these are the visuals we are getting for you.\u201d\n\nDuring the close to 15-minute show, the channel played three \u201cvisuals\u201d of the stand-off on a loop. As it turned out, each of these videos was old and unrelated to the recent border tensions.\n\nBelow is a screengrab of a video that was played multiple times during the show while the ticker on television screens read \u2013 \u201cChina\u2019s belligerence caught on camera.\u201d The video which made the first appearance at 6 seconds into the report was claimed to have been shot at Pangong lake, Ladakh.\n\nHowever, at a later part, Times Now flashed the word \u201cfile\u201d which suggested that the clip does not represent recent events.\n\nA reverse-search of the screengrab after cropping out the texts led us to the same video posted by India Today journalist Shiv Aroor on August 19, 2017. His description also said that the video was shot in Pangong Tso, Ladakh. However, Times Now did not mention that the clip is not recent.\n\nThe video below was aired for the first time at 54 seconds into the broadcast with \u201cTimes Now Exclusive\u201d written in bold. However, ironically, the video also carried a ticker which said that that the channel does not vouch for its authenticity.\n\nThe same clip was used by Times Now, with the exact tickers, on July 31, 2017 when Chinese soldiers had transgressed into Uttarakhand\u2019s Barahoti.\n\nWe found an older link to the video \u2014 June 26, 2017 \u2014 on YouTube channel Polimer News which also reported on border skirmish between Indian and Chinese soldiers.\n\nThe third video aired by Times Now made the first appearance at 1:05 minutes. The word \u201cfile\u201d is written on the top right corner. This video was debunked by Alt News almost a week before it was picked up by the channel. The clip was viral on social media as the recent stand-off between India and China.\n\nWe had traced back a link from January 2020 which said, \u201cChinese army arguing with Indo Tibetan Border Police (I.T.B.P.) in Border of Arunachal Pradesh.\u201d\n\nTherefore, all the three videos played by Times Now during a broadcast on India-China tensions were old. While the anchor said that the channel \u201cbrings these visuals\u201d for viewers and the YouTube description read the same, disclaimers during the show suggested that all the three videos were file footage.", "lang": "en"}
