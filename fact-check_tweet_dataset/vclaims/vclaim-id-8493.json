An image making it\u2019s way around the internet in January 2018 would have you believe as much:\n\nYet, none of the posts of this image included information about where the alleged Elephant\u2019s Mountain is located. That\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t exist. Mirekis, the artist who created this image, did so using digital editing software.\n\nMirekis posted the image to his Facebook page on 18 January 2018 along with a message in Polish saying that it was the second image in a series of seasonal landscape artworks. The message, automatically translated and edited for clarity, read:\n\nAnd this is the second image of the series \u201cOn the precipice,\u201d this time set in winter. The series is still missing spring and fall. I think it will be interesting to present all of them together.\n\nMirekis also posted this image to his 500PX page (which is full of similar artwork), where he tagged it as \u201csurreal,\u201d \u201cfantasy,\u201d and \u201cphotomanipulation.\u201d\n\nWe reached out to Mirekis, who told us that \u201cElephant\u2019s Mountain\u201d was a composite of several different images. The foreground of the image, which shows a field and a few scattered bushes, was taken from a photograph of a Rocca Malatestiana, a fortress on a mountain range in Italy:\n\nHe used was created from two images from Pixabay to create the elephant-shaped cliff:", "lang": "en"}
