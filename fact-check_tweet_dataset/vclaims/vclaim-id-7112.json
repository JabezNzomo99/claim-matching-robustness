Because we can\u2019t independently confirm the information, we won\u2019t assign a rating on the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nIn terms of dollar value, most of the payments Avenatti described have been confirmed (or not denied) by Cohen's corporate benefactors, and in some cases the payouts exceed Avenatti's figures. A smaller portion of the payments has been refuted or contested.\n\nAvenatti\u2019s May 8 memo lists 10 companies or individuals who allegedly paid Cohen through his company Essential Consultants or his law firm Michael D. Cohen & Associates.\n\nBy our count, payments to Cohen totaled around $1.5 million. The higher figure Avenatti cited to CNN is apparently due to counting Cohen\u2019s payments as well as related transactions, including some that occurred between multiple parties, creating a confusing picture.\n\nAfter Cohen\u2019s financial records surfaced, four companies acknowledged making payments. In some instances, the amounts paid to Cohen were higher than the figures Avenatti cited.\n\nAvenatti\u2019s memo detailed payments from AT&T to Cohen in the amount of $200,000. In subsequent statements, the telecom giant revealed it had actually paid Cohen $600,000. AT&T quickly expressed regret for the move and ousted its top Washington executive.\n\n\"Our company has been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons these last few days and our reputation has been damaged,\" AT&T Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson said in a May 11 letter to AT&T employees. \"There is no other way to say it \u2014 AT&T hiring Michael Cohen as a political consultant was a big mistake.\"\n\nThe Avenatti memo also cited a $399,920 payment from drugmaker Novartis. The company later clarified it paid Cohen $1.2 million and called its contract with Cohen a \"mistake.\" The Swiss drugmaker\u2019s top lawyer left the company amid the fallout.\n\nAvenatti said he was aware of the higher sums paid out by the drugmaker and telecom giant at the time he released the memo.\n\n\"We actually gave Mr. Cohen the benefit of not counting hundreds of thousands of additional monies from Novartis and AT&T, which we previously knew about,\" he told PolitiFact.\n\nIt\u2019s possible Avenatti is referring to two additional suspicious action reports concerning Cohen, which were referenced in a May 16 press report. According to a New Yorker article, those financial reports, which have gone missing from a Treasury Department database, flagged more than $3 million worth of suspicious activity by Cohen in addition to what Avenatti disclosed.\n\nThe memo cited Korea Aerospace Industries as having paid Cohen $150,000. The company confirmed to the Wall Street Journal that it paid Cohen \"for legal counseling regarding U.S. accounting standards,\" but did not specify an amount.\n\nColumbus Nova, an investment firm linked to Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, confirmed it paid Cohen an undisclosed amount, which Avenatti said totaled \"approximately $500,000.\"\n\nA fifth company, the Real Estate Attorneys\u2019 Group, has not confirmed the memo\u2019s claim that it paid Cohen \"at least $187,500.\" According to Avenatti, former RNC official Elliott Broidy used the group as a conduit to pay Cohen. (A representative for Broidy told the New Yorker, \"Mr. Broidy is not going to detail his payments for legal services to Mr. Cohen,\" and Broidy did not reply to our request to verify the payment amount.)\n\nHow much is disputed?\n\nSix of the 10 payment sums in Avenatti\u2019s memo have not been confirmed.\n\nWhile this may seem like splitting hairs, it\u2019s worth pointing out the distinction between unconfirmed and disputed.\n\nAvenatti told CNN \"all but about $25,000 has checked out and been verified.\" That\u2019s technically wrong because it overlooks $187,500 or more that Avenatti said the Real Estate Attorneys\u2019 Group paid Cohen, but which the company hasn\u2019t confirmed.\n\nIn a subsequent email to PolitiFact, Avenatti said, \"The only amount that has been disputed is less than $30,000, which means nothing.\" Based on those parameters, he\u2019s correct.\n\nTwo payments Avenatti cited \u2014 one for $4,250 and another for $980 \u2014 went to two different Michael Cohens, who have no affiliation to Trump or the litigation, according to a court filing by Cohen\u2019s lawyers. Cohen\u2019s attorneys also disputed three other payments totaling $15,353.\n\nBy our count, $20,583 of the Cohen payments in Avenatti\u2019s memo are disputed.
