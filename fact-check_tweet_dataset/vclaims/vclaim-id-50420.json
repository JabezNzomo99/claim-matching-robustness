A UNICEF spokesperson said the letter is \u201cNOT from UNICEF and is not accurate.\u201d\n\nHealth agencies like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have put out recommendations for avoiding infection as the novel coronavirus has spread to at least 110 countries around the world. The Facebook post claims to show a letter from UNICEF offering some dubious tips on preventing the virus, including \u201cany mask prevents its entry\u201d and \u201cgargle with warm and salt water.\u201d\n\nBut the Daily Caller searched the UNICEF website and found nothing matching or similar to the contents of the alleged letter. A UNICEF spokesman, Christopher Tidey, confirmed to the Caller that the letter is \u201cNOT from UNICEF and is not accurate.\u201d (RELATED: Viral Image Claims A Lysol Product Label Proves The Coronavirus Isn\u2019t A \u2018New Virus\u2019)\n\n\u201cMisinformation during times of a health crisis can result in people being left unprotected or more vulnerable to the virus,\u201d Tidey said in an email. \u201cIt can also spread paranoia, fear, and stigmatization, and have other consequences like offering a false sense of protection.\u201d\n\nMeasures to prevent COVID-19 include washing your hands often, using hand sanitizer when soap and water is not available and avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. The CDC only recommends health workers and people sick with the novel virus or under investigation for it wear masks.\n\n\u201cSeriously people \u2013 STOP BUYING MASKS!\u201d the Surgeon General tweeted. \u201cThey are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can\u2019t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!\u201d\n\nAs of March 10, the novel coronavirus has sickened at least 113,702 people and killed at least 4,012 others, according to the WHO.", "lang": "en"}
