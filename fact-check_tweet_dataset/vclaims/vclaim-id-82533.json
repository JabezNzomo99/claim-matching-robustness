The posts included an article by Hindi daily Dainik Jagran, . Jagran's headline loosely translated to 'Muslims come together at Jantar Mantar, Demand Construction of Ram Temple'.\n\nWhile Muslims did gather on December 16, 2018 demanding a temple be built at the disputed site; the event was organised by Muslim Rashtriya Manch.\n\nJagran's story mentioned the name of the organisation but did not include MRM's ties to the Sangh.\n\nA search on Twitter with keywords 'Muslim Rashtriya Manch' (in Hindi) showed several tweets with the same message and link.\n\nNot just Jagran, Navbharat Times also did not include anything about the link between the two organisations.\n\n\"The new movement was initially called \"Rashtravadi Muslim Andolan-Ek Nayi Raah\" which was re-christened as \"Muslim Rashtriya Manch\" in 2005,\" the About Us section of Muslim Rashtriya Manch's website states.\n\nBOOM also spoke to MRM\u2019s National Convener Md. Afzal, who reiterated what the posts claimed.\n\n\u201cAround 1,000 Muslims from 25 states came for the protest. The time has come that peace should dawn upon our country. Indian Muslims believe this and thus they want that Ram temple be constructed at the site. Indian Muslims identify more with Ram lalla than Babar.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether MRM was the Muslim wing of the Rashtra Swyamsewak Sangh, Afzal said, \u201cYou can say so if you want to. We have no objections to it.\u201d\n\nWe also contacted author and Rajya Sabha MP Rakesh Sinha to know more about MRM's affiliation to the RSS. Sinha told us that while MRM was not an official wing of RSS, it draws heavily from the social philosophy of the Sangh. \"Several Pracharaks have also been guiding light for the MRM,\" Sinha said.\n\nIndresh Kumar, who has been named as MRM\u2019s patron, was not immediately reachable for a comment. Incidentally, Kumar's name can be seen listed as an RSS member on the RSS\u2019s official website.\n\nIn one of the tweets, Indresh Kumar can be seen addressing a gathering reportedly at Jantar Mantar on December 16.\n\nOnly the Tribune, in its report dated December 16 described the Muslim Rashtriya Manch as a RSS-backed organisation.
