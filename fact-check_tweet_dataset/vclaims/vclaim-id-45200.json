The memorial was one of several around the country that was vandalized before Memorial Day that year.\n\nImages of the defaced mural in 2016 appear to match up with the image shared in the Facebook post. Los Angeles detectives identified four people behind the vandalism, which was not connected to a Black Lives Matter protest.\n\nSince Floyd\u2019s death on May 25, demonstrations have erupted in more than 350 American cities. Protesters in Washington, D.C., have defaced some war monuments, including the World War II Memorial.\n\nBut as of now, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington remains untouched.\n\n\"I have had no reports of it being vandalized,\" said Sgt. Eduardo Delgado, a public information officer for the National Park Service, in an email. \"I saw it this morning and it was fine.\"\n\nWe could find no evidence that other Vietnam memorials have been vandalized as a result of Black Lives Matter demonstrations.\n\nThe Facebook post is inaccurate.
