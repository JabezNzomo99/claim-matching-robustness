While dozens of medical experts have already debunked this idea (the evidence indicates that the virus evolved naturally), this bit of misinformation continued to spread on social media.\n\nIn April 2020, for instance, a lengthy text message started to circulate on Facebook and WhatsApp that supposedly included a quote from Nobel laureate Dr. Tasuku Honjo in which he ostensibly said that COVID-19 was \u201cinvented\u201d at a lab in Wuhan, China:\n\nThe text of the post reads:\n\nIt\u2019s as damning an indictment as it could be stretched to. China is accused of inventing the Coronavirus in its Wuhan laboratory with whatever intent that might have prompted the venture. A Nobel laureate Japanese academician, Dr. Tasuku Honjo (pictured below), who had shared a 2018 Nobel prize for his outstanding works in the study of immunology, had revealed the reasons for blaming China for inventing the deadly virus that had already infected, maimed and killed millions across the globe. Professor Honjo maintains, \u201cI know the Chinese labs where the virus was perfected. I called many times since the Wuhan breakout. Phones are dead. Doctors and technicians involved were killed.\u201d He added, \u201cnatural viruses are temperature and climate-sensitive. Corona had affected every nation, irrespective of geography, climate and temperature. Had it been natural, it\u2019s spreading would have been limited to Wuhan like places and climate.\u201d Dr. Honjo threw a challenge in support of his finding and the assertions, saying, \u201cif it\u2019s not proven even after my death, take away my Nobel prize.\u201d\n\nHonjo never worked at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the quotes in this post are fictitious, and China did not \u201cinvent\u201d this virus. But in this message\u2019s defense, it does accurately state that Honjo won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2018.\n\nHonjo is currently the Deputy Director-General and Distinguished Professor at the Kyoto University Institute for Advanced Study. A biography on the KUIAS website lists the various institutes and academies Honjo has been associated with since the 1960s. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is not included.\n\nWe searched for the quotes included in this viral text but could not find them reported by any credible sources. In fact, it appears that this quotation exists solely in social media posts. We did find a Twitter account using the handle @TasukuHonjo that expressed similar sentiments as the above-displayed quotes, but it doesn\u2019t appear that this account actually belongs to the Nobel Prize winner.\n\nFor starters, this account is not verified. It is also only a few days old (its first tweet was posted on April 23) and it has been used almost exclusively to push conspiratorial content regarding COVID-19.\n\nThe Indian fact-checking website News Meter managed to contact one of Honjo\u2019s students who issued a statement on the Nobel Prize winner\u2019s behalf. The statement confirmed that this Twitter account was fake, that Honjo never worked at the Wuhan lab, and that these were not real quotes:\n\nFurthermore, Honjo\u2019s genuine public statements about the pandemic fly in the face of the quotes presented in this viral piece of text.\n\nFor instance, in an interview with the Nikkei Asian Review, Honjo was asked why medical advancements have not been able to eradicate infectious diseases. While the fake quote included in the above-displayed text falsely claimed Honjo said that \u201cnatural viruses\u201d couldn\u2019t spread around the globe due to factors such as climate, Honjo\u2019s genuine response to this question shows that he actually has the opposite view, saying that \u201cone novel virus can turn the world on its head\u201d and that \u201cinfectious disease can spread quickly to a large number of patients.\u201d\n\nMedicine has evolved dramatically even compared with 20 years ago, but every new virus requires a new response. Physics and chemistry have established principles, but biology is a science that\u2019s still developing, and there\u2019s so much we still don\u2019t know. So one novel virus can turn the world on its head. Many people probably wonder why, but that\u2019s just the reality. Infectious diseases are completely different from something like cancer. Infectious diseases can spread quickly to a large number of patients. Meanwhile, incidence and survival rates for cancer largely stay constant, and expertise in the area is growing steadily. Research into infectious diseases needs to go hand in hand with immunology. There\u2019s no point in looking only at the virus, and we need to know how people battling the virus respond to it.\n\nOn April 27, 2020, Honjo published a statement saying that he was \u201cgreatly saddened\u201d that his name, and the name of Kyoto University, have been used to spread misinformation.\n\nIn the wake of the pain, economic loss, and unprecedented global suffering caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, I am greatly saddened that my name and that of Kyoto University have been used to spread false accusations and misinformation. This is a time for all of us, especially those of us devoting our careers to the forefronts of scientific research, to work together to fight this common enemy. We cannot delay one moment in this effort to save the lives of our fellow humans. At this stage, when all of our energies are needed to treat the ill, prevent the further spread of sorrow, and plan for a new beginning, the broadcasting of unsubstantiated claims regarding the origins of the disease is dangerously distracting. This University devotes itself to furthering the wellbeing of humanity based on a principal of harmonious coexistence with the natural environment. It is my enduring pleasure and honor to support this aim to my fullest. Let us keep our eyes on the highest goals attainable by our species.\n\nHonjo did not work at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, he did not say that COVID-19 was \u201cinvented\u201d or \u201cman-made,\u201d and the Twitter account posting similar claims does not belong to the Nobel Prize winner. In addition, this rumor is all based on the unfounded notion that COVID-19 was created as a bioweapon. You can read our examination of that false conspiracy theory here.", "lang": "en"}
