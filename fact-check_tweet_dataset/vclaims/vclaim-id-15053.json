Hindi sinasabi may destruction. Wala akong nabasa na may destruction.\"\n\n\n\nPanelo was being asked if the Duterte administration agrees with China Ambassador Zhao Jianhua that the claims in a complaint filed against Chinese President Xi Jinping before the International Criminal Court are \"fabrications.\" Among the charges against Xi is environmental destruction by China in the West Philippine Sea.\n\nThe Hague ruling is an important legal victory won by the Philippines in an international court and which Duterte himself recognizes as his \"ace\" against China when it comes to the West Philippine Sea dispute.\n\nPanelo had to be informed by GMA News reporter Joseph Morong of the specific lines in the 501-page Hague decision that mention China's destruction of the environment. Even then, the spokesman was not willing to say for certain that the lines read were indeed from the ruling.", "lang": "en"}
