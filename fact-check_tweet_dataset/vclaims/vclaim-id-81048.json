The page does not identify itself as satirical.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe text above the photo states: \u201cJacinda Ardern arrives for the Pike River safety briefing.\u201d\n\nJacinda Ardern is the current prime minister of New Zealand.\n\nShe has been in talks about a re-entry plan to the Pike River coal mine, where 29 men died following multiple explosions in 2010.
