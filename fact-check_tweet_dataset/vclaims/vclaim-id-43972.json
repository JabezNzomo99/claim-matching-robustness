{"title": "FALSE: Imee Marcos 'earned degree from Princeton'", "subtitle": "(UPDATED) 'Our records do not show that Ms Marcos was awarded a degree,' says Princeton deputy university spokesperson Michael Hotchkiss in an email to Rappler", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Jan 20, 2019 4:52 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-43972", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/false-imee-marcos-princeton-degree", "vclaim": "Rappler asked her during a forum in Manila to clarify the matter after the senatorial aspirant first dodged the question in December 2018, when she was asked in a DZMM interview whether she finished her undergraduate degree at Princeton University.\n\nHer major field was \"Independent Concentration in Religion and Politics.\" Hotchkiss explained that \"concentration\" is Princeton's term for what is called a \"major\" or a student's primary area of study in other universities. But he said Marcos did not finish her concentration.\n\nAn article published on Tuesday, February 26, in The Daily Princetonian said Marcos was \"not an average student\" at Princeton.\n\n\n\nThe article quoted a letter from then-Philippine consul general Ernesto Pineda addressed to then-dean of student affairs Adele Simmons. The letter, dated July 30, 1973, said Marcos would live outside the campus, be escorted by Philippine security personnel, and have a Filipino chauffeur drive her to and from the university.\n\n\n\nAnother article by the Prince published on September 11, 1973, reported the Asian-American Students Association (AASA) had protested Marcos' admission to Princeton.\n\n\n\n\"The AASA worried that the presence of Marcos and her security personnel would be threatening to students who were critical of her father\u2019s government,\" said The Daily Princetonian.\n\nHotchkiss was not able to provide other academic files of Marcos \u2013 like copies of her grades \u2013 as these are not allowed to be shared to the public because of a United States federal law, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974.\n\nThis column, titled \"Dear Brooke: Here's The Lowdown On Coping With Your New Role As A Princeton Freshman,\" was addressed to model and actress Brooke Shields, who attended Princeton in 1983. The piece talked about what a Princeton freshman can expect during his or her first few days at the university.\n\nThe column ended with a reference to Marcos, which goes: \"You might draw a lesson from the experience of Imee Marcos. She never did graduate; she flunked out. At Princeton, that is one thing that is still being taken very seriously.\" \u2013 with reports from Vernise Tantuco/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
