Conservative MP James Cleverly also appears to have retweeted then deleted the image.\n\nThe image claims to show Umunna tweeting in June 2014 that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be caught dead in a yellow rosette, and that\u2019s a #chukapromise\u201d.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like that tweet is the genuine article though. There is no existing tweet from Mr Umunna\u2019s account using the hashtag \u201cchukapromise\u201d, and no tweets (from any MP) using that hashtag have ever been deleted.\n\nIn the image of the supposed tweet the date is 2014, but the layout of Twitter was quite different back then, and the font isn\u2019t the same either.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that Chuka Umunna has never criticised the Liberal Democrats before, as can be seen from his Twitter history.", "lang": "en"}
