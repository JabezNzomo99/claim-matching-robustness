The clip is not related to the Indonesian incident as it can be traced back to a YouTube video shot in the Russian republic of Dagestan five years before the flag burning.\n\nThe clip shows a group of men walking by a long line of cars with black flags that appear to display Arabic words. Cars honking can be heard in the video.\n\nThe one-minute clip has a title that, when translated to English, says: \u201cRussians angered by the burning of a tauhid flag by Banser which thought it was an Hizbut Tahrir flag.\u201d\n\nA tauhid is an Islamic holy verse. Banser is the youth wing of Indonesia's biggest Muslim group, Nahdlatul Ulama. Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia was a Islamic hardliner group that Indonesian authorities banned.\n\nThe misleading video was viewed more than 37,000 times in the first three weeks after being posted to Facebook on October 29, 2018.\n\nThe clip refers to a real event in late October, 2018, in Indonesia when some Banser members publicly burned a flag that they believed carried the logo of the now-defunct Hizbut Tahrir group.\n\nThe incident sparked an angry response among some Muslim groups that saw it as blasphemous.\n\nHere is an article in the Indonesian newspaper The Jakarta Post about that controversy.\n\nWhile the incident is real, the Facebook post claiming an angry reaction by some Russians is false as it uses an old video from Russia.\n\nAFP\u2019s examination using clip keyframes from InVID found that the misleading Facebook post clip can also be seen in a video uploaded to YouTube on April 27, 2013 -- more than five years before the flag-burning incident.\n\nBelow is the 2-minute, 13-second video.\n\nThe YouTube video a titled that, translated to English, says: \u201cStopping an Islamic wedding in Kizlyar\u201d, referring to a town in Dagestan near the border with Chechnya.\n\nA road sign in the video also confirms it is one kilometer from Kizlyar.\n\nThe Facebook clip was cut from the second half of the original video, starting from exactly minute 1:05 of the latter. The comparison between the two can be seen in snapshots below.", "lang": "en"}
