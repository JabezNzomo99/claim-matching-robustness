The display would celebrate the commencement of the temple\u2019s construction.\n\nIn the backdrop of this, several people on social media have shared an image of billboards in Times Square adorned with pictures of Ram. Avinash Gorakshakar, director research ProfitMart, tweeted the viral image claiming this was Times Square \u201can hour ago\u201d. The image was liked by over 1,500 users. Several other Twitter users also posted the viral image including Sunder Chaudhary, @FltLtAnoopVerma, @satyendra81 and @mauna_adiga.\n\n\n\nTamil Nadu-based news outlet Kathir News published an article headlined, \u201cJai Shriram slogans to be played in Times Square on Shri Ram Bhoomi Puja\u201d. The article carried the same picture.

However, the viral image has been flipped horizontally.\n\nPictures of Hindu deity Ram were photoshopped into the original picture and subsequently flipped horizontally. The similarities are pointed out below.\n\n1. Green billboard on top of a white building (highlighted in red).\n\n2. Corona beer billboard close to the green billboard (highlighted in yellow).\n\n3. An identical number of cabs in the front most row on each side of the street (highlighted in green and orange).\n\n4. A picture of Ram has been superimposed on a poster of the musical Wicked (marked in blue). A portion of the green poster can be spotted behind Ram\u2019s image.\n\nFurthermore, a keyword search \u201ctimes square billboard generator\u201d on Google leads to makesweet.com where a temple of the same image is available.\n\nThus, a picture showing images of Hindu deity Ram splashed all over New York\u2019s Times Square billboards was manufactured then flipped horizontally to escape reverse-image search attempts.\n\n[Update: The poster of \u2018Wicked\u2019 is for the musical and not the movie releasing next year. The same was rectified after it was pointed out.]", "lang": "en"}
