If some deviations happen, it means that the law is not observed and the rights of some people are violated. However, it does not mean that the minority must infringe on the rights of the majority.\u201d\n\nKhazaradze was responding to a TV talk-show presenter who asked about his position on same-sex marriage and child adoption by gay couples. On this specific issue Khazaradze said that marriage was very well defined in the Constitution of Georgia and required no revision: \u201cWe must stick to it.\u201d\n\nKhazaradze added that he opposes same-sex marriage and that children should be raised by a mother and father. Then, on June 8, another member of the Lelo party, ex-Parliament Speaker David Usupashvili, posted a Facebook message saying Lelo would not support same-sex marriage.\n\nThe statement that sexual minorities are well protected is misleading.\n\nIt is true that Georgian law recognizes equal rights for all and prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. The law also considers hate motivation an aggravating circumstance for a crime.\n\nBut a constitutional amendment in 2017 changed the definition of marriage. Under Georgia\u2019s Civil Code, marriage was defined as a heterosexual union, but the language of the constitution was neutral: Marriage was a union \u201cbased upon equality of rights and free will of spouses.\u201d In a step backward, the amendment redefined it as a \u201cunion between a woman and a man.\u201d\n\nLGBT+ people are among those most vulnerable to persecution in Georgian society.\n\n\u201cViolence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity are pervasive in Georgia: Beatings are commonplace, harassment and bullying constant, and exclusion from education, work and health settings appear be the norm,\u201d a 2019 United Nations report says.\n\nThe report, by the U.N.\u2019s Independent Expert, called the discrimination systemic.\n\nIn Georgian society and culture, aspects of homosexuality are seen as sinful, shameful or pathologic, the report says. These convictions are \u201cfueled and reinforced by agents of the church, tolerated and at times sponsored by politicians, governmental and law enforcement agents, and replicated by mass and social media,\u201d the expert found.\n\nThe discrimination is not limited to marriage. LGBT+ individuals in Georgia find it difficult to realize a range of basic rights, including the rights to life, free expression and assembly.\n\nThis manifested most glaringly on May 17, 2013, when thousands of anti-gay protesters, led by Orthodox priests, chased and attacked gay activists gathered in the center of Tbilisi to peacefully mark International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia (IDAHO).\n\nShouts from the frenzied mob included \"Kill them! Tear them to pieces!\" Some 30 people were injured. Though police failed to contain the mob, they were able to put the gay rights activists on buses that took them to safety, preventing more injury.\n\nSince then, any attempt of LGBT+ activists to mark IDAHO has been thwarted. Authorities have cited questionable excuses for blocking LGBT+ groups from holding public events. In 2016, they said Tbilisi\u2019s main avenue was already booked by Orthodox groups to mark Family Day.\n\nThey\u2019ve also said it would be too hard to protect demonstrators from anti-gay protesters.\n\nIn 2019, LGBT+ activists planned Georgia\u2019s first-ever Pride Week for June 18-22, which included various events and a march. Despite lengthy advance negotiations, the Interior Ministry at the end of May rejected outdoor events because participants\u2019 safety could not be guaranteed. On June 14, the Georgian Orthodox Church called Tbilisi Pride \u201cabsolutely unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThat day, a small group of gay rights activists organized a gathering outside the Government Chancellery building to call for police protection. Conservative groups mobilized there and chanted homophobic slurs. A six-hour standoff ensued until police evacuated the activists.\n\nOn June 16, groups led by right-wing businessman Levan Vasadze held a rally at which he announced the formation of vigilante patrols against Tbilisi Pride and gay people. The Pride Week was rescheduled due to threats, as well as to political unrest in Tbilisi in June that led to violent clashes between police and anti-Russia protesters.\n\nIt was not until July 8 that the LGBT+ activists held the march, with its time and date kept in strict secret for threats to their safety. The event was scaled down to about 40 participants and lasted only for 30 minutes amid reports that extremist groups were on their way.\n\nNo attempt was undertaken by the LGBT+ organizations to mark IDAHO this year due to the COVID-19 outbreak. They limited themselves to releasing statements.\n\nGay rights activists and supporters displayed rainbow flags on this occasion. However, police forced the cafe Gallery, an openly gay-friendly venue in Tbilisi, to remove the flag \u201cto avoid excesses from opponents\u201d, police reports say.\n\nAt times, the discrimination has been violent, even deadly:\n\u2022 On June 11, 2020, a young man and his three friends were attacked and severely beaten, allegedly on homophobic grounds.\n\u2022 In January 2018, a transgender woman and Equality Movement activist, Miranda Pagava, was insulted and physically assaulted in Tbilisi.The perpetrator used homophobic and transphobic hate speech.\n\u2022 In November 2018, two trans women were attacked in central Tbilisi. The victims were hospitalized and claimed the attackers told them \u201ctheir lives have to be taken\u201d because they \u201cpretend to be women.\u201d\n\u2022 In 2016, Zizi Shekiladze, 32-year-old transgender woman, was attacked by strangers who cut her throat. She was taken to the hospital with multiple head injuries and remained in a coma for several weeks before she died.\n\u2022 In 2014, another transgender woman, Sabi Beriani, 25, was killed in her apartment. According to the official investigation, there had been an argument over money. However, human rights activists said that she was killed because of her gender identity.", "lang": "en"}
