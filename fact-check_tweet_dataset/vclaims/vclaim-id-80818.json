Incidentally, advocate Prashant Bhushan was held in contempt over tweets that were brought to the judiciary's attention by a plea filed by Maheshwari, who hails from Guna, Madhya Pradesh.\n\nOn August 14, the Supreme Court held advocate Prashant Bhushan guilty of contempt over two tweets which scandalised the court. The hearing on sentencing is scheduled for August 20. The apex court observed that it would not remain a \"silent spectator\" when statements are made \"in order to malign the image of the judiciary\".\n\nWhat is contempt of court?\n\n\n\nContempt of court is a legal mechanism to protect the judiciary from motivated and unwarranted attacks and punishes those who attempt to lower its authority.\n\nAccording to the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, contempt of court can be civil or criminal. Willful disobedience or breach of a court order, judgment, decree, direction, writ or an undertaking given to court amounts to civil contempt.\n\nPublication of any material (words, spoken, written, signs, visible representations, an act or in any manner or form) that (i) scandalises or tends to scandalise, or lowers or tends to lower the authority of, any court; (ii) prejudices, or interferes or tends to interfere with, the due course of any judicial proceeding; or (iii) interferes or tends to interfere with, or obstructs or tends to obstruct, the administration of justice in any other manner is considered to be criminal contempt.\n\nContempt of court attracts a simple punishment for a term up to six months, or a fine, or both. However, contempt maybe discharged, or the punitive action waived off if the person accused of contempt makes an apology that satisfies the court.\n\nAlso See: A Video Explainer On What Is Contempt of Court\n\nOn August 1, senior journalist N. Ram, former union minister Arun Shourie and advocate Prashant Bhushan challenged section 2(c)(i) of the act which attracts punitive action for the publication of any matter that could scandalise the court or lower its authority. The plea submitted that the impugned section was vague, manifested arbitrariness and violated the fundamental right of freedom of speech.\n\n\"\u2026The offence of \"scandalizing the court\" is rooted in colonial assumptions and objects, which have no place in legal orders committed to democratic constitutionalism and the maintenance of an open robust public sphere,\" the plea read.\n\nHowever, two weeks later, the plea was withdrawn. The withdrawal came after the Supreme Court sought an explanation from the registry officials as to why the plea was listed before a bench other than Justice Arun Mishra's which was already hearing similar cases.\n\nThere are two aspects to contempt of court. While experts have maintained the importance for civil contempt \u2013 this ensures the judicial authority is not circumvented, criminal contempt has faced criticism. In an opinion piece for The Hindu, former high court judge AP Shah spoke about the \"chilling effect of criminal contempt\" even as he along with at least 139 others, including 10 former judges from the higher judiciary, endorsed a statement supporting Bhushan.\n\nIn supporting Bhushan, the endorsement letter criticised the top court on its \"reluctance\" to \"play its constitutionally mandated role as a check on governmental excesses and violations of fundamental rights of people by the state.\"\n\nLike Bhushan, Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy is not a stranger to contempt cases. On March 6, 2002 the apex court bench comprising Justices GB Pattnaik and RP Sethi held her guilty of criminal contempt and sentenced her to simple imprisonment in Tihar Jail for one day. A fine of Rs. 2000 was also imposed on her, which if she failed to pay, would result in an extension of her prison term by another three months.\n\nRoy was held in contempt for criticizing a 2001 top court verdict by Justices Pattnaik and Ruma Pal in another contempt case against her.\n\nIn 2015, Roy got another notice for contempt for criticizing a Bombay High Court decision rejecting Delhi University Professor GN Saibaba's bail. The Nagpur bench of the high court had found her remarks against the police, state administration and the judiciary \"nasty\" and \"scurrilous\". However, two years later, in 2017, the top court stayed contempt proceedings against Roy.\n\n\n\nThe top court has pulled up one of its own as well. In 2016, former top court judge Justice Markandey Katju was summoned to court after he criticised the SC verdict in the Kochi rape case. During the hearing, a heated argument took place, following which he was escorted outside the courtroom. A notice of contempt followed soon after. However, contempt proceedings against him were dropped after Katju submitted an unconditional apology before the court on December 10, 2016.\n\n\n\nThe dramatic case featuring former Calcutta High Court judge CS Karnan is also noteworthy. On May 9, 2017 Karnan gained the dubious distinction of becoming the first sitting judge to be held in contempt. He was sentenced to six months in prison. \n\n\n\nIn an extraordinary situation, seven senior-most judges of the Supreme Court initiated contempt proceedings against Karnan after he alleged corruption by judges of the high judiciary. Karnan had also accused eight top court judges of caste discrimination and \"sentenced\" them to five years rigorous imprisonment and Rs. 1 lakh fine each. The West Bengal police arrested Karnan\u2014he had absconded soon after the top court verdict against him\u2014on June 20, 2017 more than a month later and eight days after his retirement.", "lang": "en"}
