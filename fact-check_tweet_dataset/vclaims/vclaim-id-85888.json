But a report released in August by the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG), while highly critical of VA practices that included unofficial waiting lists, said it could not conclusively link that many deaths to being on the wait list.\n\nAfter reviewing the records of 3,409 patients from a variety of sources, OIG uncovered 44 deaths that took place while a patient was on an electronic waiting list. But in the complete list of patients, OIG found only 28 instances of \u201cclinically significant delays in care associated with access to care or patient scheduling.\u201d Of that group, six were deceased.\n\nFirst of all, the OIG had difficulty in assigning blame because many of these patients were very sick to begin with \u2014 and the cause of the death would be the underlying disease. When one goes through the case studies of the deaths, it is clear that many patients had substantial health problems \u2014 and they were often also being treated at other non-VA facilities. Here\u2019s a sampling:\n\nSam Foote, the retired doctor who first alleged that some 40 patients died while on a waiting list for an appointment, was highly critical of the OIG report at a congressional hearing on Sept. 17, saying that in two cases in which he had personal knowledge, \u201cthe authors appeared to have downplayed facts and minimized the harm.\u201d\n\nFoote also pointed to one case (#29), in which a patient who died of cardiac arrest failed to get an implantable cardioverter defibrillator in a timely manner \u2014 and yet he was not included on the list of deaths related to patient scheduling. (This patient had been on an electronic waiting list for treatment of management of poorly controlled diabetes, but once given an appointment, he failed to go to it.)\n\nKatherine Mitchell, medical director for the Iraq and Afghanistan post-deployment center in Phoenix, also disagreed with the OIG\u2019s findings in the case studies. \u201cIn a minimum of five cases, I believe there was a very strong actual or potential causal relationship between delayed care or improper care in veteran death,\u201d she testified. \u201cIn addition, health care delays contributed to the quality of life for five other veterans who were terminally ill, and shortened the lifespan of one of them.\u201d She then cited numerous other cases in the report where she believed investigators played down the facts, including two suicides by patients while waiting for a mental-health referral.\n\nJOLLY: \u201cWould you be willing to say the wait lists contributed to the deaths?\u201d JOLLY: \u201cWould you agree that wait lists contributed to the deaths of veterans? Yes or no? Please, yes or no? Words mean something, and you need to\u2026\u201d RICHARD GRIFFIN, ACTING VA INSPECTOR GENERAL: \u201cNo. I would say that it may have contributed to their death, but we can\u2019t say conclusively it caused their death.\u201d\n\nSo this brings us to Boehner\u2019s statement. His staff noted that he did not say dozens of veterans died because they were on the wait list; he said dozens died while they were waiting for care. That cleverly sidesteps the question of causality.\n\nInitially we were inclined to believe that the speaker was exaggerating the number of deaths and ignoring the results of the OIG report. But OIG officials have acknowledged that wait lists might have contributed to the deaths, in effect negating the previous conclusion that just six deaths could be traced to scheduling delays. The OIG found 44 patients who died while on the electronic waiting list, so that certainly qualifies as \u201cdozens.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, unlike some of his colleagues, Boehner was careful not to say the deaths occurred because of wait lists. That put his statement in a bit of a gray area. One may never be able to make a direct link between the deaths and the care in Phoenix, especially given the poor health of the patients. Still, given that the OIG report was highly critical of the Phoenix facility\u2019s practices in the first place, on balance that tips Boehner\u2019s statement into Geppetto territory.", "lang": "en"}
