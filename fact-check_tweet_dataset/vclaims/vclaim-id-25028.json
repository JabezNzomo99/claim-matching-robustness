Muslims are doing this in Bhopal and throughout the country, you at least share this video so that blindfolded Hindus may take note.\u201d\n\nThe above message accompanies a 45-second video clip which shows an irate mob vandalising a bus. The video and message have been posted on Twitter.\n\nThe above tweet has been retweeted over 1300 times so far.\n\nThe video and the accompanying claim have also been shared on WhatsApp.\n\nThe video in question was fact-checked earlier by Alt News, when it was shared with the false claim that Muslim auto drivers in Mumbai had damaged state govt transport buses. This incident had taken place in Surat, Gujarat and NOT Bhopal, MP.\n\nIn the video, the word \u2018SITILINK\u2019 can be seen imprinted on the side of the bus. SITILINK stands for Surat Bus Rapid Transit System, which is an integrated public bus transportation system that runs only in Surat. The second clue was the number plate of the bus. A faint \u2018GJ 05\u2019 is visible at numerous points in the video. GJ 05 is the RTO vehicle registration code for Surat.\n\nOn the basis of these clues, Alt News found several news reports pertaining to the incident. A rally in protest against mob lynchings was taken out in Surat on July 5, 2019. The agitation however had turned violent, and the mob started pelting stones. According to a Times of India report, \u201cPolice lobbed 15 teargas shells and fired one round in air on Friday to disperse a mob which was pelting them with stones during a rally organised by a city-based organisation to protest against mob lynching incidents in different parts of the country. Five policemen suffered injuries in stone pelting by the mob.\u201d\n\nIt may be noted that the video in question represents an incident of mob violence in Surat, and is not from Bhopal as claimed.", "lang": "en"}
