Jones would be a disaster!\" Trump tweeted Nov. 26.\n\nJones and Moore are seeking the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, who now leads the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nMoore, who faces allegations of sexual misconduct against teenagers several decades ago, supports Trump\u2019s promised border wall with Mexico.\n\nWe wanted to know if Jones is \"weak on the border\" as Trump claimed. We are not rating this claim on the Truth-O-Meter because it's an opinion, but we can explore Jones' position on border security. We found that Jones opposes Trump\u2019s border wall, but no indication that he is against other border security measures.\n\nThe White House did not offer on-the-record comments to support Trump\u2019s claim that Jones is \"weak on the border.\"\n\nThe priorities section of Jones\u2019 campaign website does not include immigration or border security. There\u2019s no reference to these topics on other pages of his website.\n\nYet his campaign pushed back on Trump\u2019s tweet.\n\n\"Doug supports border security \u2014 he is committed to ensuring the national security of the United States, and that includes maintaining the integrity of our borders against all threats. He believes in utilizing the most advanced and effective technology to secure the border and help keep Americans safe,\" Jones campaign spokesman Sebastian Kitchen told PolitiFact.\n\nJones has told news outlets that he opposes Trump\u2019s proposed border wall.\n\nHe told Fox News on Nov. 18 that he was against the construction of the wall because \"it\u2019s too expensive.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t think we need to be spending $20 billion,\" Jones told Fox News. \"I want to put it on health care, I want to get tax cuts for the middle class.\"\n\nIn July, Jones told the Montgomery Advertiser: \"The last wall that was constructed to stop people\u2019s movements between countries was the Berlin Wall. The United States of America is better than that.\"\n\nHe also told the newspaper that he favored changes in administrative procedures for legal immigration.\n\n\"If we can make a more streamlined process of allowing immigrants into this country legally without all of the backlogs and quotas, we would have far less undocumented immigrants,\" Jones told the Montgomery Advertiser.\n\nIn a June interview with the Alabama Political Reporter, Jones affirmed his opposition to a border wall, but said, \"I do want to see more border security.\"\n\nJones\u2019 immigration-related comments have focused on his support for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, a program that prevents the deportation of young immigrants who came to the country illegally when they were children.\n\nTrump is phasing out DACA, but gave Congress time to find a legislative solution for its beneficiaries.\n\nOverall, Trump\u2019s claim appears to be based on Jones' opposition to Trump\u2019s promised border wall. Jones has said he is against a border wall, but wants to see more border security, including advanced technology.", "lang": "en"}
