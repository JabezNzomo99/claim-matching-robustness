Cargo train in DC,\u201d reads the caption. \u201c#Dothemathondaspread.\u201d (RELATED: Does Sunlight Kill The Coronavirus?)\n\nFuller versions of the photo reveal that the train tank car bears the markings of GATX Corporation, a global railcar lessor that operates in North America. The \u201cCOVID-19\u201d label appears to have been superimposed into the image, as a video of similar tankers on the GATX website shows they do not have them.\n\nThe American Railroad Association, which sets the standard food railroad car markings, requires reporting marks have \u201ctwo, three, or four letters\u201d and a \u201cnumber of up to six digits,\u201d according to Trains Magazine. Railinc, a company that manages a database for the North American train industry, has no record of the \u201cCOVID-19\u201d mark featured in the Facebook post.\n\n\u201cWe have no mark registered in our system that matches to COVID,\u201d Steven Hinkson, a communications director at Railinc, told The Associated Press. \u201cFurther, the rules governing registered marks only allow for 2-4 alphanumeric characters. COVID would not meet that standard.\u201d\n\nThe new coronavirus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has since triggered a global pandemic. At press time, the new virus has sickened some 1.3 million people worldwide and killed some 78,500 others, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.", "lang": "en"}
