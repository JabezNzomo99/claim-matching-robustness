BOOM has chosen not to translate it.\n\nYou can view the archived version of Facebook posts here, here and here.\n\nAt the time of writing the article, the post had already been shared more than 100 times.\n\nThough the post was deleted by the Facebook group \u09b9\u09bf\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09c1 \u09b8\u0982\u0997\u09a0\u09a8(R.S.S), an hour after it was shared in it, the photoshopped picture found its way to other Facebook pages which mocked the candidature of the Bengali actresses. The Facebook group is not officially linked to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.\n\nA cursory look shows that Jahan\u2019s head appears to be larger than the rest of the body, in the image.\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search and found the image of the tattooed woman is originally of a model whose image has been shared appears on the website indulgy.com with the caption \u2018Inked Girl by Jeanine.\u2019\n\nThe website in turn has credited tats-and-lingerie.blogspot.com for the picture.\n\nThe difference of the photoshopped and original image is quite clear.\n\nBOOM also found that Jahan's photoshopped image is old and has been used as a thumbnail image for websites with pornographic content.\n\nNusrat Jahan is among the 17 women who will be representing Trinamool Congress in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. Apart from Nusrat, Mimi Chakraborty, another Tollywood actress will also be contesting the polls from Jadavpur constituency.", "lang": "en"}
