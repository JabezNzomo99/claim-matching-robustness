We identified a video making numerous claims about the NHS that had gone viral with 9.8 million views on Facebook.\n\nWe've now factchecked what was claimed in the video.\n\u2022 None NHS funding in the UK is at\n\u2022 None But it\u2019s correct that the increases have been getting smaller, and experts argue that at this rate spending won\u2019t keep up with the size of the economy (as measured by GDP).\n\u2022 None This claim may take its cue from a similarly worded finding by the King\u2019s Fund health think tank, that the ten years up to 2020/21 would see the \u201clargest ever sustained reduction in UK NHS spending as a percentage of GDP\u201d.\n\u2022 None Similarly, government health spending in the UK (which counts more than just funding for the NHS) is down as a percentage of GDP since 2010, according to calculations by the\n\u2022 None Around \u00a35 billion could be saved in English non-specialist acute hospitals\u2014a sum worth 9% of their budget\u2014\n\u2022 None that if all trusts got their facilities running costs to the average it would save \u00a31 billion a year. Reducing costs could save at least \u00a3700 million.\n\u2022 None \u201csuggests that trusts become 1% more efficient each year on average\u201d. It recently set a \u201cchallenging but achievable\u201d target of 2% a year over the next two years.\n\u2022 None first out of 11 2014 report by the Commonwealth Fund, a US think tank.\n\u2022 None There have been over the years. These include things like diagnosis of respiratory diseases to save lives and money down the line, or the number of infections people pick up in hospital\u2014this saved the NHS \u00a375 million in 2008/09.\n\u2022 None There are various ways to measure the impact of these initiatives on performance.\n\u2022 None One piece of research does mention that efficiency has been increasing\n\u2022 None Based on this, the Nuffield Trust think tank told us that \u201c NHS spending in hospitals, community services and mental health trusts (but not GP practices, for which there is far less information) would have been \u00a37.3 billion higher in 2015/16 without annual efficiencies\u201d.\n\u2022 None The debate over whether competition within the NHS\u2014the \u2018internal market\u2019\u2014is a good or a bad thing is fundamental, and not something we can dash off a quick answer to.\n\u2022 None Splitting the NHS into competing purchasers and providers of health services necessarily leads to \u201c \u201d\u2014such as purchasers and providers and commissioners negotiating with one another. The question is whether those costs are outweighed by financial savings and/or improvements in patient care.\n\u2022 None You can find reports to the effect that the benefits of the internal market are \u201c very small when set against the costs the effect of [NHS] competition is to save lives without raising costs\n\u2022 None A summary of the available evidence by the chief executive of the King\u2019s Fund said that the impact of competition in the 1990s and 2000s was \u201c that \u201ccompetition and choice do have a role to play, but should be used as just one means to improve care rather than being a guiding principle\u201d.\n\u2022 None that treating deliberate health tourists and those \u201ctaking advantage\u201d costs around \u00a3100 to \u00a3300 million a year. That was in 2012/13.\n\u2022 None figures even at the time.\n\u2022 None The Department of Health was projected to \u00a313.8 million per hour on average in 2016/17, which does mean around \u00a3200 million every 15 hours. Over the same period NHS England spent roughly \u00a3180 million every 15 hours.\n\u2022 None working in NHS hospitals and community health services in England reported they were from other countries\u2014that\u2019s about one in four.\n\u2022 None and health visitors said they were from other countries\u2014that\u2019s about one in six.\n\u2022 None Overall, around 12%\u2014or roughly one in ten\u2014of all NHS England staff were foreigners.\n\u2022 None These figures only include those staff members who said what their \u2018nationality\u2019 was\u2014some may have interpreted this as country of birth or ethnicity\u2014and don\u2019t include GPs or GP staff.\n\u2022 None the Conservative Party included a commitment to recruiting 10,000 more mental health professionals. It has separately said this will be . We\u2019ve asked the Conservatives if this commitment includes all mental health staff or nurses specifically.\n\u2022 None The number of full time equivalent (FTE) mental health nurses in England fell by nearly\n\u2022 None to the Royal College of Nursing, but it refers to all registered nurses, rather than those specifically working in mental health. Around 11% of nursing posts in England were vacant as of December 2016; it was 6% in 2013.\n\u2022 None 11,000 adverts for full time equivalent nursing and midwifery jobs published in England in September 2016, according to the NHS. But it points out that the figures are experimental and that one advert doesn\u2019t equal one job\u2014a single advert can be used to fill a number of vacancies. In the same month the previous year there were around 10,000 adverts.\n\u2022 None The NHS previously published figures on the proportion of vacancies, but this was discontinued in 2010.\n\u2022 None In September 2014, 29% of nurses, midwives and health visitors were aged 50 or over, according to\n\u2022 None this year new nursing, midwifery and students from England will no longer be given an , but will instead have access to the same\n\u2022 None shows that the number of applicants to nursing courses in England in January 2017 has dropped by 23% (or around 10,000) compared to January 2016.\n\u2022 None Applications from students in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, who aren\u2019t affected by the changes, fell by much smaller amounts.\n\u2022 None That\u2019s an understatement if anything. There were \u201ctrolley waits\u201d in English accident and emergency departments in the 2016/17 winter months.\n\u2022 None This doesn\u2019t mean all these people are physically on a trolley, though. It\u2019s a measure of how many times a patient waited for more than four hours for a bed after the decision had been taken to admit them to hospital.\n\u2022 None The number of people in this situation over winter has always been in the tens of thousands since 2010, but \u201ctrolley waits\u201d have been rising\u2014in the winter of 2010/11 there were around 35,000.\n\u2022 None Winter waits of over 12 hours after admission have risen from a couple of dozen to almost 2,000 over the same period.\n\u2022 None This is against the background of for A&E services. There were 2.5 million more visits in 2016 than there were in 2010.", "lang": "en"}
