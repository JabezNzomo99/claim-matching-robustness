Even if we did have a definite number, the circumstances behind these cases can be complex, and don\u2019t always reflect malicious intent.\n\nThe evidence we do have shows that proven cases of false allegations are rare, and it\u2019s reasonable to cite 3-4% of rape cases as an estimate.\n\nIf a reported rape doesn\u2019t result in a conviction, this isn\u2019t evidence that the original allegation was false. Criminal charges must be proven \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d.\n\nThere are a small number of cases where people are convicted for deliberately perverting the course of justice or of wasting police time, depending on the seriousness of the case and whether there was a named perpetrator.\n\nA study by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) found that, in cases between 2011 and 2012, there were 5,651 prosecutions for rape and 35 prosecutions for making false allegations of rape. The CPS doesn\u2019t prosecute if there\u2019s not enough evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.\n\nThe view of the Director of Public Prosecutions at the time was that false allegations were \u201cserious but rare\u201d.\n\nBeyond when people are prosecuted for false allegations, there\u2019s been some research looking at police case files, to try and work out how common false allegations are more generally. Here, there isn\u2019t actually a single definition of what constitutes a false allegation.\n\nResearch by the Ministry of Justice in 2012 estimated that around 3% of 1,149 rape cases they analysed were perceived to be malicious allegations. These are not proven cases of false or malicious allegations.\n\nThis echoes a study for the Home Office from 2005 which found that about 3% of cases they studied might be considered \u2018probable\u2019 or \u2018possible\u2019 false allegations.\n\nBoth studies emphasise the limitations of their data.\n\nWhile false rape allegations do include people complaining maliciously, this isn\u2019t always the case. Research has suggested that allegations can turn out to be false if the person who reported it to the police misremembered what happened, didn\u2019t know what happened and wanted to find out, or misunderstood the law.\n\nThe CPS, for example, mentions cases where people report to the police because they thought they might have been raped, but can\u2019t recall because they had been affected by drugs or alcohol.\n\nResearch by the Ministry of Justice in 2012 estimated that around 12% of reported rape cases in England and Wales may be based on a false allegation if you take a broad definition that might cover these kinds of cases. Again, this goes far beyond allegations that are malicious and false, very few of these cases amount to a proven false allegation.\n\nITV have a list of helplines if you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article.", "lang": "en"}
