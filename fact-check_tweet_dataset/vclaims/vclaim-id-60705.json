The portion of the street bearing the mural has also been designated \u201cBlack Lives Matter Plaza,\u201d according to CNN.\n\nThe new designation came amid protests calling for justice in the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. John Falcicchio, chief of staff for Bowser, said in a tweet that Bowser \u201cwanted to make it abundantly clear that this is DC\u2019s street and to honor demonstrators who were peacefully protesting on Monday evening,\u201d according to the Washington Post.\n\nSome social media users claimed that the new name meant President Donald Trump \u201cnow resides at 1600 Black Lives Matter Plaza NW, Washington, DC 20500.\u201d (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show All The Lights Out At The White House During George Floyd Protests)\n\nThat is, however, not the case. The portion of 16th Street bearing the mural runs perpendicular to Pennsylvania Ave. NW and ends at Lafayette Square. The two streets are distinct from each other. The White House remains located at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW on Lafayette Square\u2019s southern end.\n\nLaToya Foster, press secretary for Bowser, confirmed to USA Today that the White House address has not changed. She also said that section had been ceremonially renamed and that Bowser planned to introduce legislation to the city council to make the name change permanent, according to USA Today.\n\nMembers of the D.C. City Council introduced on June 15 a bill that would designate the street section \u201cBlack Lives Matter Plaza\u201d for 225 days.", "lang": "en"}
