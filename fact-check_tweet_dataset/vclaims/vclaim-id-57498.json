Go on Netflix... type in My Secret Terrius, go to Season 1, episode 10 and skip to 53 minutes. it's kind of suspicious. This series came in 2018 and the first reported case of Coronavirus was in Nov 2019,\" reads one such viral tweet.\n\nIn an eerie similarity, children in the show are also taught how to wash hands properly in order to prevent contraction.\n\nThe synopsis of the South Korean show reads, \"A secret agent who detaches himself from the world after a failed operation tries to unravel the mystery behind a neighbour's death.\"\n\nA doctor hands over some documents to another character, telling her, \"We must do more research, but it looks like a mutant coronavirus.\"\n\nThe other character responds: \"Corona? Then MERS?\"\n\n\"MERS, SARS, the common flu. They all fall in the same gene family with the same gene information. The coronavirus attacks the respiratory system. During the 2015 MERS epidemic, the mortality rate was over 20 percent,\" says the doctor.\n\nThe first season of My Secret Terrius ended with a doctor getting a disease similar to COVID-19.\n\nNetflix show 'My Secret Terrius' predicted the Coronavirus pandemic in 2018.\n\nIn the video clip that is being circulated, the doctor lists out some features of the 'fictional' novel coronavirus. These features in contrary to what is now known about the SARS-CoV-2 (the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19).\n\nAccording to the doctor the virus had been artificially mutated by a human, bringing the mortality rate to \"almost 90%.\"\n\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic has claimed 27,365 lives out of 597,268 infected individuals at the time of writing this article, therefore the mortality rate is about 4.5%.\n\nAccording to peer-reviewed articles (Zhou et. al (2020); Andersen et. al (2020)), there are two potential origins of the virus.\n\nFirstly, the virus went through natural selection in an animal (currently the progenitor host is theorised to be a bat or a pangolin), before going through zoonotic transfer (transfer of pathogens between animals and humans), and jumping into a human host.\n\nSecondly, the virus jumped into a human host from an animal, while going through re-assortment of its genetic make-up that could lead it to acquire the properties to start a pandemic.\n\nNo evidence about the fact that the virus is man-made artificially made in a lab has been found, yet.\n\nTherefore, the show couldn't have predicted the outbreak of coronavirus back in 2018. It is noteworthy to mention here that Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.\n\nIn humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans which causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.\n\nTherefore, it is quite possible for people to make shows or write books on the Coronavirus, which is an umbrella term.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343", "lang": "en"}
