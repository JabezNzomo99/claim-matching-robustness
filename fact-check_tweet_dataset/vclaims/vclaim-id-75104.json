The post seemingly gained traction due to national and international media coverage of former first lady Barbara Bush\u2019s funeral on April 21.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time fake news sites have claimed Tutu died. Another hoax about his death spread in September 2016 after a hospitalization. The former Anglican archbishop of Cape Town was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his opposition to apartheid policies.\n\nNytimes-news.com does not feature any description of who runs the site. The website\u2019s banner only says \"New York,\" and its address is designed to give readers the wrong impression that it\u2019s the actual New York Times. (The real Times can be found at www.nytimes.com.)\n\nTake this quiz to see if you know how to spot fake news sites.\n\nNytimes-news.com\u2019s post claiming Tutu died in Texas is made up.
