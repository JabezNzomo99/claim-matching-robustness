In reality, it showed a night-time shooting event at a Kentucky gun range. ABC apologized for the mistake.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken down video that aired on \u2018World News Tonight Sunday\u2019 and \u2018Good Morning America\u2019 [on Oct. 14, 2019] that appeared to be from the Syrian border immediately after questions were raised about its accuracy. ABC News regrets the error,\u201d an ABC spokesman said in a statement.\n\nA source from ABC said the video was provided by someone who purported to be in a \u201csensitive position\u201d on the border between Turkey and Syria. The network is investigating the incident.\n\nTurkey launched a military offensive against Kurdish forces in northern Syria shortly after Trump pulled American troops from their posts there, where they had been for several years supporting Kurds in a fight to contain Islamic State (ISIS) terrorists. The resulting chaos that included the escape of detainees associated with ISIS, violence against civilians, and a geopolitical advantage handed to America\u2019s adversaries, have prompted sharp bipartisan criticism of Trump\u2019s decision.\n\nThe video aired by ABC has been online since at least 2017. A caption on what appears to be the original YouTube post says the explosion was the rather spectacular result of a night time machine-gun shoot, an event held at the Knob Creek Gun Range in Kentucky.\n\nA number of right-wing partisans have pointed to the incident as evidence of the nefarious work of the \u201cmainstream media\u201d or \u201cMSM,\u201d which attracted the attention of Trump, who often attacks the news media.\n\n\n\n But Peter Adams, head of education at the non-profit, non-partisan News Literacy Project, explained that although ABC owes the public a detailed account of how the misstep happened, it appeared to be nothing more than human error, not an intentional effort by ABC to mislead.\n\n\u201cDespite the online rantings of bad-faith partisans, there is no evidence that this was intentional nor ideologically-motivated. The conflict in Syria is highly newsworthy & the motivation here was almost certainly to get a sensational, great-for-TV clip,\u201d Adams wrote in a Twitter thread. Adams added that legitimate news outlets publicly acknowledge even minor errors and correct the record, and that it\u2019s important to remember that these types of mistakes are relatively rare.", "lang": "en"}
