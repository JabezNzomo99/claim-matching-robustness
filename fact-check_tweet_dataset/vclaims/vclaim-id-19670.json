{"title": "Will Eating an Egg and a Banana Kill You?", "subtitle": "A viral warning seems to ignore the obvious truth that eggs and bananas are commonly and deliciously mixed together with no harmful effect on consumers.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2018-07-31T14:50:12+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-19670", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/eating-egg-banana/", "vclaim": "Since early 2017, the Internet has been littered with \u201cwarnings\u201d about the dangers of eating bananas and eggs together (or serially):\n\nIt is unclear what \u201cnet\u201d is in danger of being killed by this combination of food, but the claim presented here appears to have its origins in a dubious chain message spread via the mobile chat app WhatsApp. The earliest reference to the claim we could find was an 18 January 2017 Facebook post by a Nigerian based internet comedy channel. The claim appears to have first gone viral in India a month later, with the first round of debunkings occurring from Indian sources around 20 February 2017.\n\nThe use of \u201csweet banana\u201d could imply a specific cultivar of banana known as a sugar banana or a \u201clady finger\u201d banana, but this would not change the nature of the claim appreciably. Though the nutritional composition of bananas varies significantly between different cultivars, they nevertheless contain largely the same suite of chemicals. That means the claim rests on the assertion that mixing bananas and eggs is dangerous, despite the fact that those two ingredients are consumed together all over the world.\n\nIt is unlikely, for example, that a large restaurant chain such as Denny\u2019s would so enthusiastically promote their \u201csalted caramel banana cream pancake breakfast\u201d (which contains both eggs and bananas) if the risk of death were real. Similarly, the risks of Starbucks\u2019 banana bread, which is made with eggs and bananas, would likely discourage the coffee chain from prominently featuring the product in their pastry section if it were going to kill the company\u2019s customers.\n\nWe have uncovered no evidence the story referenced in the warning of a young man\u2019s dropping dead on the spot after consuming a banana and an egg is real, and we understand no mechanism by which a person\u2019s death could be triggered by the consumption of a benign egg and banana combination, absent a severe allergy to either food.", "lang": "en"}
