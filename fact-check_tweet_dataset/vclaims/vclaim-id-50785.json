Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Photo of an old man with his 3 wives and 32 children. Fact: The photo shows an old man with his 37 other family members that includes his children and grandchildren. Not all the kids in the photo are his sons and daughters. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image in the post was subjected to Yandex reverse image search technique, it was found in a video of \u2018The Print\u2019 news channel. The video has the title \u2018\u090f\u0915 \u091d\u094b\u092a\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0930\u0939\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902 38 \u0932\u094b\u0917, \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u092f\u094b\u091c\u0928\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0924\u0939\u0924 \u0918\u0930 \u0928 \u092e\u093f\u0932\u0928\u0947 \u0938\u0947 \u0928\u093e\u0930\u093e\u091c\u093c\u2019. The English translation of it is- \u201838 men live in a single hut and are disappointed as the government isn\u2019t sanctioning a house to them\u2019.\n\nIn the video, the old man said that he lives in the hut along with his 4 children and grandchildren, but hasn\u2019t stated anywhere that he has 3 wives and 32 children (his sons and daughters). So, it is a false claim.\n\nTo summarize, not all the kids seen in the photo are the children of that old man.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Indian Rivers?", "lang": "en"}
