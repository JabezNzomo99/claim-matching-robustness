Ano ba sinasabi ng batas for a senator? Able to read and write, natural-born citizen. Does it say na dapat good moral character yung tao? Does it say the person has to be honest? Kaya sinabi ko kung honesty ang pagbasehin natin, disqualified lahat,\u201d she said in an interview with reporters.\n\nDuterte, a lawyer, is the campaign manager of Hugpong ng Pagbabago which is endorsing 13 senatorial candidates. One of them is Ilocos Norte Governor Imee Marcos whose lies about her educational attainment led to the debate on honesty as a necessary virtue for senatorial candidates.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the requirements Duterte mentioned are all that is listed in Section 3, Article VI of the Constitution which has to do with qualifications to serve as senator.\n\nBut the Constitution, which is considered the country\u2019s foundational law, also explicitly states that public officials, which include senators, must be honest and must have good moral character. This is in fact mentioned in two articles.\n\nSection 1 of Article XI states: Public office is a public trust. Public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives.\n\nThe word \u201cintegrity\u201d is defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary as \u201cfirm adherence to a code of especially moral or artistic values, incorruptibility.\u201d It also lists \u201chonesty\u201d as a synonym for integrity. \u2013 Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
