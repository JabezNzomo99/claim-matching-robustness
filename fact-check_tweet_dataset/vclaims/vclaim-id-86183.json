All three countries were allocated only $88 million in aid in 2018, down from a combined total of $499 million in 2016. The aid is intended to improve the economy and government functions in these countries, in the hopes that lives will improve for citizens and fewer will feel the need to flee. In fact, Trump\u2019s tweet appears to contradict an announcement by the State Department on Dec. 18 that, along with Mexico, the United States will boost aid to these countries to promote \u201ca safer and more prosperous Central America.\u201d\n\nTrump had a chance to strike a deal. Democrats came to Trump with a bipartisan plan that had been crafted in the Senate to spend $25 billion over 10 years on a border wall and provide protections for 1.8 million dreamers who had arrived illegally as children. But he rejected it. As we noted, the bipartisan proposal had the most support in the Senate, including from eight Republicans, but was blocked from a final vote because of GOP opposition. Trump\u2019s proposal, which came with limits on legal immigration, received the least support and was roundly rejected by a combination of Republicans and Democrats. The funding bill currently offered by Democrats would provide $1.3 billion for border security but not the president\u2019s wall.\n\nThe causes of the deaths remain under investigation. Jakelin Caal, the 7-year-old Guatemalan girl who died in U.S. Border Patrol custody, was healthy before she arrived, a representative for the family said. The family disputed reports that she went several days without food and water before crossing the border. \u201cJakelin\u2019s father took care of Jakelin \u2014 made sure she was fed and had sufficient water,\u201d said a statement from his attorneys. \u201cShe had not suffered from a lack of water or food prior to approaching the border.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security said an \u201cinitial screening revealed no evidence of health issues. During the screening, the father denied that either he or his daughter were ill.\u201d Jakelin\u2019s father has charged that she was given no water while they were detained.\n\nIn trying to make the case for a high concrete border wall, Trump exaggerates about the Obama house in Washington. It is an 8,200-square-foot Tudor-style home in the Kalorama residential area, but it is not a \u201ccompound.\u201d The Obamas added security fencing to an enlarged retaining wall in front for the needs of the Secret Service, but there is not a 10-foot wall around the house; the front steps are open to the sidewalk. Chain-link fencing, but no wall, was added to the back. While Trump says the border wall would be a \u201cslightly larger version\u201d of the alleged Obama wall, he has previously described his proposed wall as 1,000 miles long, made of precast concrete slabs, rising 35 to 40 feet.\n\nTrump is stuck on an unworkable campaign pledge that Mexico would be forced to pay for the wall, but administration officials have refused to explain Trump\u2019s logic for how the revised North American Free Trade Agreement would pay for the wall. The updating of the trade pact negotiated by the Trump administration makes some changes at the margins. The agreement has yet to be ratified by three countries and likely would not take effect until 2020 at the earliest. But if that results in a smaller trade deficit because Mexico is buying more goods from the United States, it does not necessarily translate into greater revenue for the U.S. government. (As we noted, Trump often equates trade deficits to \u201closses,\u201d but that\u2019s a misunderstanding of basic economics.) Moreover, Congress would still have to appropriate funds, and it has refused to do.", "lang": "en"}
