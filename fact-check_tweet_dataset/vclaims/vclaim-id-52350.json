The claim is false; YouTube made no such announcement and an official at YouTube\u2019s parent company told AFP Fact Check that it \u201cdoes not make it a habit\u201d of commenting on live streams.\n\nOn June 16, 2020, the Tanzanian leader dissolved parliament ahead of elections due in October 2020 as per the constitution, which requires that the 393-seat legislature be dissolved ahead of the polls. In a two-hour speech, Magufuli also detailed his government\u2019s actions since he was elected five years ago.\n\nA Facebook post circulating in Tanzania and written in Swahili -- which was shared more than 1,200 times and garnered more than 3,000 comments -- made a number of bogus claims.\n\n\u201cYouTube has announced that more than 600 million people globally followed the live speech of president Magufuli as he dissolved Tanzania's Parliament,\u201d it reads.\n\nIt claims that \u201cmore than 80 countries and 50 heads of state were online following the speech\u201d, including US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who apparently \u201chalted government business for five hours until the address was over\u201d.\n\nThe post also claims that a Thai website named Magufuli \u201cthe best 21st-century president\u201d and that a British political magazine \u201cdescribed him as a development genius and problem solver\u201d.\n\nSimilar posts were shared here, here and here.\n\nIn the comments, some online readers appeared to believe the claims while others cast doubts.\n\nA search of Magufuli\u2019s speech on YouTube with the Swahili keywords \u201cMagufuli avunja bunge\u201d (Magufuli dissolves parliament) and the filter restricted to the past week reveals a dozen videos that were live-streamed on June 16, 2020. The video of the speech with the highest amount of viewership garnered about 158,000 views, far below the 600 million views claimed on the post.\n\nA spokeswoman for Google, which owns YouTube, confirmed to AFP Fact Check that the video-sharing platform has not made any such announcement.\n\n\u201cWe do not make it a habit of releasing concurrent views (the number of viewers watching a live stream, editor's note),\u201d Dorothy Ooko, Google\u2019s Head of Communications & Public Affairs in Africa, told AFP Fact Check in an email.\n\nAFP Fact Check found no reports in reputable British and international media about Prime Minister Boris Johnson shutting down government business to watch the speech. A search on UK government sites and on Johnson\u2019s official Twitter account did not reveal any directive to close government business.\n\nFollowing searches in both English and Thai, AFP Fact Check found no evidence to support the claim that \u201ca Thai website\u201d and \u201cUK magazine\u201d named the Tanzanian leader \u201cthe best 21st-century president\u201d or a \u201cdevelopment genius\u201d.\n\nPresident of Tanzania since 2015, Magufuli has steered away from international protocol recommended to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, prompting Tanzanian newspapers to falsely claim that his policies have been applauded by the World Bank.
