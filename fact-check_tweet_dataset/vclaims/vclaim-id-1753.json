In fact, ISIS largely has been funded through extortion, robbery, taxes and Syrian oil, according to government reports and terrorism financing experts.\n\n\u201cTrump is absolutely correct that oil sales have been a critical part of ISIS\u2019s revenue stream since at least early 2014, but he\u2019s wrong that an ongoing American occupation of the Iraqi oilfields would have bankrupted ISIS,\u201d Peter Harrell, the deputy assistant secretary for Counter Threat Finance and Sanctions in the State Department under President Obama, told us in an email. \u201cIf you look at the facts on the ground ISIS has likely always produced more oil in Syria than in Iraq.\u201d\n\nHoward J. Shatz, a staff member of President George W. Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, concurred. In a phone interview, Shatz \u2014 who is now a senior economist at the RAND Corporation and whose research includes the finances and management of ISIS \u2014 told us revenue from Iraqi oil fields \u201cwould not have made much of a difference\u201d to ISIS.\n\n\u201cThey did have control over some Iraq oil fields, but they were nothing compared with Syrian oil fields,\u201d Shatz said.\n\n\u2018Should Have Kept the Oil\u2019\n\nAs a candidate, Trump frequently mentioned that the United States should have kept the oil in Iraq as compensation for the money that the U.S. spent during the Iraq War and reconstruction. It is something that he has been saying for years, dating to at least 2011.\n\nIn remarks he made at the CIA during his first full day in office, Trump brought up the Iraq oil fields again. He turned at one point to Rep. Mike Pompeo, who has since been confirmed by the Senate as Trump\u2019s CIA director, and suggested that ISIS probably would not exist \u201cif we kept the oil\u201d in Iraq.\n\nThe president repeated that claim three times during an interview with ABC News\u2019 David Muir that aired on Jan. 25, when Trump was asked about his remarks at the CIA.\n\nIn that same interview, Trump later said, \u201cWe should have taken the oil. You wouldn\u2019t have ISIS if we took the oil.\u201d And still later he said, \u201cWe should\u2019ve taken the oil. And if we took the oil you wouldn\u2019t have ISIS.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s briefly recap how and when ISIS formed, and then look at how it was financed.\n\nAs we have written before, the terrorist group has its roots in the U.S. invasion of Iraq in March 2003. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian, formed al Qaeda in Iraq (AQ-I) in October 2004, according to a Jan. 18 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. airstrike in June 2006, and shortly after \u201cAQ-I leaders repackaged the group as a coalition called the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI),\u201d CRS said.\n\nIslamic State of Iraq became known as ISIS in April 2013.\n\nExperts we interviewed attributed the rise of ISIS to multiple factors, most flowing from the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq: sectarian strife in Iraq (Sunni opposition to U.S. forces and the ruling Shia party); decisions by the U.S.-led provisional coalition government in 2003 to disband the Iraqi army and ban the Baath Party, driving Sunnis into militant groups; the rule of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, whose Shia government further ostracized Sunnis; the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq by Dec. 31, 2011 \u2014 a date agreed to by President Bush and carried out by the Obama administration; the Syrian civil war, which began in 2011; and the weakening of the Iraqi army, which abandoned its posts in Mosul in June 2014 and gave control of the city to ISIS.\n\nFor this story, we interviewed experts on ISIS and terrorism financing and reviewed government statements and reports regarding the group\u2019s finances.\n\nIn its early years, the Islamic State of Iraq\u2019s revenue-generating activities \u201cclosely resembled that of petty criminality, including significant revenues generated from sales of stolen goods,\u201d according to \u201cFoundations of the Islamic State: Management, Money and Terror in Iraq 2005-2010,\u201d a 2016 report co-authored by Shatz for the RAND Corporation.\n\nThe RAND Corporation\u2019s report is based on documents and ledgers obtained from high-level officials within the Islamic State of Iraq. Shatz told us the group\u2019s oil revenue was not a source of financing from 2005 to 2008, and there was not much from 2010 to 2012.\n\nBut for a brief time, from August 2008 to early 2009, the Islamic State of Iraq received about 39 percent of its revenue from Iraqi oil fields.\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t forget this is happening at a time when we have 150,000 troops on the ground, when we are working very closely with Iraq on security, conducting a withering counter-terrorism strategy,\u201d Shatz said, referring to the heavy presence of U.S. troops in the late 2000s. \u201cThis says we can\u2019t be every place at every time.\u201d\n\nLuay al-Khatteeb, the founding director of Iraq Energy Institute, wrote in February 2016 that the importance of oil revenue for ISIS and its predecessor was \u201cvastly over-estimated,\u201d writing \u201coil was not and is still not critical for IS.\u201d\n\n\u201cIts predecessor, the Islamic State of Iraq, managed to cause chaos for almost a decade without control over a single wellhead,\u201d wrote Khatteeb, who is also a nonresident fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.\n\nIn March 2011, the Syrian civil war started and the terrorist group began taking control of that country\u2019s oil producing regions, as explained in an April 2015 report by the Congressional Research Service.\n\nBy late 2012, the Islamic State was reaping \u201cmassive cashflows\u201d from eastern Syrian oil wells, selling the crude oil back to the Syrian government, as reported by the Guardian.\n\nBut oil revenue was not the group\u2019s primary source of funds in 2014 or 2015, according to U.S. terrorism financing officials and government reports.\n\nIn a February 2015 speech, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing Jennifer Fowler listed four primary revenue sources, in order:\n\u2022 Robbery and extortion, $500 million. \u201cTreasury estimates that during 2014, ISIL probably gained access to at least half of a billion dollars from seizing control of state-owned banks in northern and western Iraq.\u201d\n\u2022 The sale of oil, $100 million. \u201cLast year ISIL may have earned as much as several million dollars per week, or $100 million in total, from the sale of oil and oil products to local smugglers who, in turn, sell them to regional actors, notably the Assad regime,\u201d referring to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\u2022 Ransom, $20 million. \u201cIn 2014, we estimate that ISIL earned at least $20 million from collecting ransoms for kidnapped victims.\u201d\n\u2022 Donations, figure not provided. \u201cForeign donations represented an important but comparatively smaller source of revenue for ISIL in 2014. However, externally raised funds are used frequently to finance the travel of extremists to Syria and Iraq. Of note, at least 19,000 fighters from more than 90 countries have left their home countries to travel to Syria and Iraq to join ISIL.\u201d\n\nHarrell, who was the deputy assistant secretary for Counter Threat Finance and Sanctions from 2012 to 2014, told us in an email that revenue from Iraqi oil fields was not as important as robbery and other criminal activity.\n\n\u201cWithin Iraq, ISIS\u2019s largest sources of revenue were robbery and looting \u2014 for example, in 2014 ISIS may have looted more than $400 million from the Iraqi central bank branch in Mosul (when ISIS overran Mosul in 2014),\u201d Harrell said. \u201cISIS also always extorted large sums of money from the population under its control in Iraq.\u201d\n\nIn her speech, Fowler did not say how much of ISIS\u2019s oil revenue came from Iraq in 2014. But al-Khatteeb of the Iraq Energy Institute in a September 2014 CNN interview estimated at that time that two-thirds of ISIS\u2019s oil production came from Syria: 25,000 barrels per day from Iraq and 50,000 barrels per day from Syria.\n\nISIS generated much more oil revenue in 2015. But again, it was not the group\u2019s primary source of financing, and most oil revenue still came from Syrian oil fields \u2014 not Iraqi oil fields.\n\nISIS had total revenues of $1.18 billion in 2015, according to a 2016 report by the inspectors general for the State Department, Defense Department and US AID. The terrorist group\u2019s primary source of financing that year was extortion, stolen goods and taxes, at a combined total of $600 million. Oil accounted for $480 million.\n\nThat report didn\u2019t say how much oil revenue came from Iraq and how much came from Syria. However, a former Bush administration counterterrorism official told the House Financial Services Committee in May 2015 that about 90 percent of oil produced by ISIS came from Syrian oil fields.\n\n\u201cThe group is estimated to produce forty-four thousand barrels a day from Syrian wells and four thousand barrels a day from Iraqi ones. The group then sells the crude to truckers and middlemen, netting an estimated $1 to $3 million a day,\u201d said Celina Realuyo, who served as the State Department director of Counterterrorism Finance Programs from 2002 to 2006 and is now a professor at the William J. Perry Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies at the National Defense University.\n\nAt a Nov. 13, 2015, press conference, Col. Steve Warren, a defense spokesman, said about two-thirds of ISIS\u2019 oil revenue comes from one region in Syria along the eastern border with Iraq. \u201cWe estimate that about two-thirds of their oil revenue comes from the Deir ez-Zor region,\u201d Warren said.\n\nWhile ISIS has controlled most of Syrian oil fields, the group has had control of only some smaller oil fields in Northern Iraq, Shatz said. Iraq\u2019s principal petroleum centers are located in the south and have been largely unaffected by the Iraq War and Syrian civil war.\n\nFor that reason, Shatz said that ISIS\u2019 revenue from Iraqi oil fields has been helpful, but not essential to the group\u2019s finances.\n\n\u201cEven if the Northern Iraqi fields had been well protected [by the U.S.], it would not have made much of a difference because they had Syrian fields,\u201d Shatz said.\n\nTrump said \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t have ISIS\u201d if the U.S. had \u201ckept the oil\u201d in Iraq, because \u201cthat\u2019s where they got the money.\u201d But the evidence shows ISIS had a diversified portfolio and received more of its finances from robbery, extortion, taxes and Syrian oil than it did from Iraqi oil fields.\n\nCorrection, Feb. 10: We have fixed a typo. Instead of \u201cmillion,\u201d the article originally said that in 2015 ISIS made $480 billion from oil and $600 billion from extortion, stolen goods and taxes.", "lang": "en"}
