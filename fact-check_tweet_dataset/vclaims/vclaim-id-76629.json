Judging by the number of commenters asking to be signed up, there also is an audience for marijuana studies.\n\nFacebook users flagged this post as possibly being fabricated, as part of the site\u2019s efforts to fight fake news in users\u2019 social media feeds.\n\n\"NASA has put out an ad looking for people who\u2019re willing to take part in their \u2018Rest Studies\u2019 \u2013 a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 USD,\" the post read. \"During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 USD per week.\"\n\nThere are more details on the post, but you get the gist. We found versions of the same story on several other blogs going back to at least March 2016, all claiming NASA is doling out the big bucks for people who want to lounge all day and spark up. Pretty good hustle, right?\n\nWell, it\u2019s true that NASA does perform bed rest studies. The goal is to examine the potential effects of weightlessness on astronauts, and lying in bed with your head tilted down at a six-degree angle is apparently a fair substitute.\n\nThe studies sound pretty much as described at TheSolExchange.com \u2014 except for the cannabis part. Several media outlets like the Houston Chronicle, Forbes, Vice and CBS News have written in the past about the studies, which involve people getting paid something on the order of $1,200 per week for 15 weeks (that\u2019s $18,000) to hang out in bed.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all that great of a time, from the sound of it. Boredom is a constant problem, as every moment of a volunteer\u2019s life is spent in bed for that time. Scientists continually poke and prod them, taking readings and measurements on everything from weight to bone density. Volunteers are told when and what to eat, and have to do everything in bed. That means eating, exercising, showering and even, yes, using the facilities while lying down.\n\nA NASA spokesman told us that there have not been any sleep studies that involved consuming cannabis. There also aren\u2019t any more sleep studies currently planned, so it\u2019s not like NASA is suddenly going to try it the next time.\n\nBlog posts that have been saying that NASA is paying subjects $18,000 to lie in bed and smoke marijuana for 70 days are pretty far out.\n\nThe only lighting up we see here is when we rate this Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
