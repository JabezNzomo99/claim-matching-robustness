Rand Paul\u2019s story about how his oldest son tried to get health insurance via the Kentucky version of Obamacare, and ended up on Medicaid, the federal-state health-care program for the poor. We initially rated this with a \u201cverdict pending,\u201d but after receiving screen grabs from the Kentucky insurance exchange, we concluded there were too many holes in Kentucky Republican\u2019s recounting and awarded him Two Pinocchios.\n\n2: The GOP claim that more Americans have lost insurance than gained it under Obamacare\n\nRepublicans have pushed the line that more people have \u201clost\u201d health insurance or have \u201ccanceled plans\u201d than who have gained it through the Affordable Care Act. But the accuracy of the claim depends on what you count, how you count it and how carefully the attack line is phrased.\n\n3: Ignore claims that 3.9 million people signed up for Medicaid because of Obamacare\n\nIn this column, we took Obama administration to task for highlighting a misleading figure about the number of Medicaid sign-ups under the ACA \u2014 and also reporters (and The Fact Checker) for repeating it. The number actually does not reveal the impact of the ACA expansion of Medicaid, and it should be used with caution.\n\n4: Harry Reid\u2019s claim that under Obamacare 9 million people \u2018have health care that didn\u2019t have it before\u2019\n\nWe examined the Senate majority leader\u2019s math regarding the newly insured and found it wanting. A key element in his calculation was the Medicaid figure mentioned above, which turned out to be misleading. He also included in his count people, such as himself, who joined the exchanges but had previously been insured.\n\n5: Four Pinocchios for an over-the-top ad attacking the Keystone XL pipeline", "lang": "en"}
