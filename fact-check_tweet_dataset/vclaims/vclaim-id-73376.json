This image has circulated in a Chinese report about police seizing illegal motorboats\n\nAn image has been shared hundreds of times in multiple Facebook posts which claim it shows Chinese police officers arresting a group of Hongkongers on a boat after they attempted to flee to Taiwan. The photo has been shared in a misleading context; it has circulated in reports about Chinese police seizing motorboats which were allegedly being operated without licenses.\n\nThe image was published here on Facebook on August 27, 2020. It has been shared more than 600 times.\n\n\n\nThe post\u2019s traditional Chinese-language caption translates to English as: \u201cIt all started with the \u2018anti-extradition bill protest\u2019, but ended with \u2018protester automatically turning themselves in\u2019... Huh? So if there\u2019s no extradition bill, where should this trial be held?\u201d\n\nThe post refers to China\u2019s arrest of a dozen people fleeing Hong Kong on a boat bound for Taiwan, including Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Andy Li, as reported here by AFP on August 28, 2020.\n\nComments from some Facebook users on the misleading post suggested they believed the image shows the arrests.\n\nOne commenter wrote: \u201cNever seen pro-democratic people in Hong Kong obeying to law enforcement\u201d.\n\nAnother Facebook user commented: \u201cActually they want to tell Hongkongers not to oppose and just simply turn themselves in\u201d.\n\nThe photo was shared alongside a similar claim here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here on Facebook, the image was also used as a thumbnail of a video here on YouTube.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found an identical image published in this August 1, 2020 report by a Chinese state media organisation Xin Kuai Bao.\n\n\n\nIt is headlined: \u201cGuangdong Coast police carrying out law enforcement inspections and seized 11 motorboats\u201d.\n\nThe article reads in part: \u201cAt around 5am, a group of suspicious ships were found near the Hong Kong waters. After the targets were locked, law enforcement officers accelerated their approach and boarded for inspection Other nearby ships began to flee after spotting the maritime police law enforcement officers. Some even rammed the maritime police law enforcement motorboats.\n\n\u201cThe maritime police law enforcement officers resolutely adopted methods such as oblique interception; launching shock bombs; and forcibly jumping to control the suspected ship. In the end, a total of 11 illegally modified high-horsepower speed boats were seized and 26 suspects who were suspected of driving the ship without a license were taken away.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading post (L) and the photo in the Xin Kuai Bao report (R):\n\nThe arrests were also reported by other Chinese news organisations on August 1, 2020, including CCTV here, and YCWB here.\n\nThe misleading post was also debunked on August 28, 2020 by Hong Kong-based fact-check page Kauyim on Facebook here.", "lang": "en"}
