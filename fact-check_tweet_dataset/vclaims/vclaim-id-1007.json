Finally,\u201d one of the users comments, alongside the post.\n\nThat the document is clearly fake is evident from what it says is the date of publication, mentioned as 49th Day, Year of Yahweh, 6022.\n\nThe letterhead on the page reads \u201cThe Human Rights Tribunal International, The Government of the United States of America\u201d. The U.S. does not have any such tribunal.\n\nThe document provides links for a few documents, one of which is on a website https.//reignoftheheavens.com\n\nThe other link leads to a insecure website here . That the website and the organisation are bogus is evident from this page ( here ), which states: \u201cThe present human rights tribunal started within the reign of the heavens before it was placed in trust.\u201d It links to another page ( here ), which mentions the \u201coffice of the Secretary of State for the reign of the heavens\u201d.\n\nA complete list of U.N. bodies involved in the protection of human rights can be found here\n\nFalse. The people and organisations mentioned have not been indicted for war crimes. The posts purport to show a letter from the Human Rights Tribunal International, an organisation that does not exist either in the United States or elsewhere.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
