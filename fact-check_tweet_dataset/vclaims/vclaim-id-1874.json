All four websites, which were Macron-themed, were the type that hackers use to trick people into giving up their passwords. Trend Micro discovered that a group called Pawn Storm was behind the hacking campaign in France.\n\nAccording to multiple IT analyses and reports, Pawn Storm, also known as Fancy Bear or Tsar Team (APT28), was involved in hacking servers of the U.S. Democratic Party during the 2016 presidential elections. The group was also involved in hacking servers of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which disqualified Russian athletes for involvement in state-sponsored doping.\n\nWADA said its investigation was able to obtain IP addresses directly linking Fancy Bear/Tsar Team (APT28) with Russian military intelligence\u2019s cyber spy unit.\n\nAccording to Trend Micro, the same group has conducted a hacking campaign targeting the servers of En Marche! (On the Move!), Emmanuel Macron\u2019s political party.\n\nTrend Micro said it has been tracking Pawn Storm\u2019s activities since 2004, describing the group as \u201can active cyber espionage organization that has been very aggressive and ambitious in recent years.\u201d\n\n\u201cPawn Storm\u2019s activities show that foreign and domestic espionage and influence on geopolitics are the group\u2019s main motives, with targets that include armed forces, the defense industry, news media, and politicians,\u201d Trend Micro wrote.\n\nSteven Pifer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, told Polygraph.info via email that Kremlin spokesman Peskov\u2019s comment, calling the Trend Micro report \u201cfake news\u201d based on \u201cfantasy,\u201d is itself \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d\n\nPifer believes the Kremlin has a strong motivation to try to influence the outcome of the French presidential race, given that Russia has openly supported Macron\u2019s rival, far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.\n\nHe noted that Le Pen\u2019s party, Front National, received a multimillion-dollar loan from Moscow.\n\nLe Pen visited Moscow in late March at the invitation of Vladimir Putin; no other French presidential candidate received such an invitation. In February, a French newspaper reported that the country\u2019s external intelligence agency, the Directorate-General for External Security, believed Russia intended to interfere in France\u2019s presidential elections in order to help Le Pen.\n\n\u201cLe Pen has advocated pulling France out of the euro zone and suggested a referendum on exiting the European Union altogether (like Brexit),\u201d said Pifer. \u201cShe would like to weaken France\u2019s participation in NATO military structures. She has indicated that she would recognize Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea. If you are sitting in the Kremlin, what\u2019s not to like?\u201d", "lang": "en"}
