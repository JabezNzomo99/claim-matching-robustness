Officials from the South African and Rwandan governments, as well as the WEF, have denied these claims, saying these absences were already planned before the unrest broke out on September 1.\n\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s Africa meeting, gathering political and business leaders from around the continent, took place in Cape Town on September 4-9 just as a wave of violence targeting immigrants shook South Africa.\n\nAs reported by AFP, Nigeria did boycott the WEF over the unrest, which included attacks on numerous Nigerian-owned shops in Johannesburg.\n\nThat announcement came a day after widely-shared reports claimed that Rwanda\u2019s President Paul Kagame, DR Congo\u2019s Felix Tshisekedi and Malawi\u2019s Peter Mutharika were boycotting the major event in protest at the attacks.\n\nThis tweet by Zimbabwean television host Josey Mahachie, reporting that the three leaders had \u201cwithdrawn\u201d from the event, was retweeted nearly 7,000 times after it was posted at the height of the unrest on September 3:\n\nMany articles on Nigerian news websites similarly reported that the presidents had pulled out of the event, making an explicit link with the anti-immigrant violence in South Africa.\n\n\u201cThis is coming following the xenophobic attacks launched by South Africans against foreigners, especially Nigerians,\u201d reported this article by Information Nigeria, which was shared more than 1,800 times on Facebook and quoted Mahachie\u2019s tweet.\n\nThe claim was also reported by numerous videos on YouTube, including one by CGTN Africa, archived here, which is captioned: \u201cRwanda, Malawi, DRC pull out in WEF in light of xenophobic attacks\u201d. Nothing in the video supports the claim made in the caption, however.\n\nAnother video, archived here and viewed more than 100,000 times, is captioned \u201cSouth Africa Embarrassment for Africa as Presidents & Celebrities Boycott Events\u201d. It goes on to state that the three presidents were boycotting the WEF following \u201csenseless xenophobic attacks\u201d.\n\nThe boycott claim was reported widely across the continent, including by Kenyan newspaper The Star and Tanzanian newspaper The Citizen.\n\nThere were however no official confirmations of such a boycott by any of the three governments involved -- which might seem surprising had it been true, as you would expect officials to publicise such a protest.\n\nRegarding Kagame\u2019s attendance, both the South African and Rwandan governments rejected the claim that his non-appearance was linked to the unrest.\n\n\u201cWe are refuting these allegations. We knew that Rwanda was not coming. In their correspondence\u201a they did not mention xenophobic attacks as the reason for not coming,\u201d said Lunga Ngqengelele, spokesman of the South African department of international relations and co-operation, as quoted by The Times.\n\nKagame\u2019s communications advisor Yolande Makolo tweeted: \u201cNot true, Rwanda has not withdrawn. President Kagame was unable to attend for other reasons, but there is a strong Rwandan delegation participating at the World Economic Forum-Africa in Cape Town, including three cabinet members,\u201d she said.\n\nAs for Tshisekedi\u2019s attendance, Ngqengelele said: \u201cThere was never an indication from the DRC that they were coming.\u201d\n\nWEF also denied a boycott by the three presidents\n\nOfficials from the World Economic Forum confirmed that Kagame and Mutharika had said they would not be attending before the xenophobic attacks began on September 1, and that there had been no word from the government of DR Congo.\n\nIn an interview with South Africa\u2019s Radio 702, Oliver Cann, head of communications at WEF, said: \u201cWe were made aware on Saturday (August 31) that President Kagame of Rwanda was unable to join us and the notification was made to us in the previous week that president of Malawi was unable to join us.\u201d\n\nAs for the government of DR Congo, Cann said: \u201cWe have not had actual communications with them for a few days. We assume that they are not joining us now, because we have not heard from them.\u201d There had in any case been no communication from DR Congo\u2019s government saying that Tshisekedi was boycotting the event over xenophobic unrest.\n\nThe absence of the three leaders was \u201cnot a knee jerk reaction to events in South Africa\u201d, Cann stressed.\n\nWEF\u2019s Africa chief Elsie Kanza said she was surprised to see the reports, telling South African TV station eNCA that \u201cone of the leaders -- Rwanda -- unfortunately had to cancel his participation last week, before the very unfortunate events\u201d.\n\nAfter reports of the boycott began circulating on September 3, many Nigerians began calling on the president of Nigeria to follow suit -- via this widely-shared tweet, for example.\n\nNigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari had not been billed to attend, but Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo had been due to speak at the forum.\n\nAs diplomatic tensions between Africa\u2019s two superpowers rose over the attacks, Nigerian presidential media aide Bashir Ahmad confirmed that the government would not attend.\n\nAs reported by AFP, the unrest has claimed 12 lives since the start of September, while also sparking reprisal attacks against South African-owned businesses in Nigeria.\n\nThe violence prompted a wave of misleading social media posts, some of which we\u2019ve fact-checked here.", "lang": "en"}
