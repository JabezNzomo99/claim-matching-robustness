Forty-five countries and the European Union have signed, and thirty-four have ratified it. None of the signatory countries have withdrawn from the Istanbul Convention.\n\nGul had not explained, which countries he identifies as \u201cbelonging to Western culture,\u201d but Germany, Italy and France, among others, have signed and ratified the treaty.\n\nThe United Kingdom signed the Istanbul Convention in 2012 and declared its commitment to ratifying it, announcing a \u201c95-actions cross-government strategy\" to complete the administrative and legislation reforms, including in Scotland, Ireland and Wales, that would enable the country to ratify the convention.\n\nOne of the key elements of the Istanbul Convention is its Article 44, which requires the ratifying states to use their national law to prosecute crimes committed abroad by their citizens or residents - i.e., \u201cextraterritorial jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nIn July 2019, the U.K. introduced a Domestic Abuse Bill in Parliament, which included the \u201cnecessary legislative measures on extraterritorial jurisdiction for England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland required by Article 44.\u201d\n\nIn its 2019 progress report, the U.K. said that \u201cof 95 actions, 54 have been completed, 29 are on track to be delivered, and 12 remain a work in progress, due to be delivered by 2020.\u201d\n\nIn Turkey, Poland and Hungary, far-right and conservative political and religious groups have criticized the treaty, claiming it contradicts cultural values, undermines traditions, contributes to increased divorce rates and promotes homosexuality.\n\nIn July, Poland\u2019s government announced plans to start the procedure for withdrawing from the convention.\n\nHungary signed the Istanbul Convention in 2014. The country\u2019s president, Victor Orban, and his ruling Fidesz party have attacked the convention on the grounds that it promotes \u201cdestructive gender ideologies\u201d and \u201cillegal immigration.\u201d In May, the Hungarian parliament rejected the treaty's ratification.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ordered the text of the Istanbul Convention be examined to determine whether it is inconsistent with traditional values. He also asked Turkey\u2019s parliament to draft culturally appropriate legislation to replace the EU treaty.\n\nIn a study published by the Oxford University, Clara Rigoni wrote that the reference to \u201cculture and traditions\u201d is commonly used to justify crimes against the most vulnerable members of society, including honor killings, female genital mutilation, forced marriages, and domestic violence.\n\nRigoni stated: \u201cGreat importance in this sense is to be given to the Council of Europe convention... It seems clear from the text that no room should be left for the appreciation of cultural practices with a decriminalizing or mitigating purpose.\u201d\n\nThe Istanbul Convention forbids the legal systems in signatory nations to decriminalize violence against women out of \u201cprejudices, customs, traditions and other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority of women or on stereotyped roles for women and men.\u201d It also requires signatory nations to \u201censure that culture, custom, religion, tradition or so-called \u2018honor\u2019 shall not be considered as justification for any acts of violence covered by the scope of this Convention\u201d (Istanbul Convention, Article 12).\n\nTurkey is notorious for \"femicide\" - the killing of women or girls.\n\nIn 2018, 440 pairs of high heels were placed on the fa\u00e7ade of a building in Istanbul. The installation, a project of Turkish artist Vahit Tuna, was a memorial to 440 women murdered by their partners or family members that year alone.\n\nAccording to Anit Sayac, a digital database that records the names of female victims of gender-based violence in Turkey, the number of female victims has increased yearly, from 69 in 2008, when the database was launched, to 417 in 2019 and 245 in the seven months of 2020.\n\nWomen in Turkey have protested the government\u2019s plans to withdraw from the Istanbul Convention, staging demonstrations and posting black-and-white photographs of themselves on social media.", "lang": "en"}
