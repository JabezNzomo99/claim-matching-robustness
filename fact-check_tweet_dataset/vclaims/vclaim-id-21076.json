Nonetheless, it concluded: \u201cIn terms of overall capability, the U.S. Army remains in a league of its own\u2014no other army in the world has the same depth and breadth of capabilities.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the Global Firepower Index, which focuses on quantitative and ignores qualitative differences, also put the U.S. military at the top.\n\nThe CSIS report, it should also be noted, looked at the A2/A2, ground combat, and non-kinetic operations capabilities of the U.S. Army, not the entire U.S. military. RT, for its part, failed to take into consideration the U.S. military\u2019s overall capabilities, or the offensive and defensive operational advantages enjoyed by separate U.S. military branches or by joint U.S. fighting forces.\n\nStill, the CSIS report conceded that the U.S. Army is currently at a disadvantage because it must rely on joint fighting forces (i.e., the air force and navy) for A2/A2 and non-kinetic capabilities.\n\nRT also disregarded the impact of U.S. and Russian military budgets on the development and modernization of -- and investment in -- technologically advanced weapon platforms.\n\nAs Polygraph.info noted recently, a 2017 U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) assessment of Russian military capabilities found that Russia faces \u201ca critical gap\u201d in the inventory of conventional precision-strike weapons relying on high-end technology.\n\nUnlike the U.S., which has been using precision-guided munitions since at least the 1970s, Russia has used them in combat only minimally and, for the most part, only recently. As the DIA pointed out: \u201cRussia was unable to achieve real progress in the development of precision strike until the first decade of the 21st century, when it was able to create a viable state armaments program that allowed prioritization of certain key components of 21st-century warfare.\u201d\n\nRussia has indeed been modernizing and developing its military, presenting the U.S. military with challenges that are real but not yet fully tested. It has also taken asymmetric approaches to coping with the U.S. military\u2019s qualitative advantages, which explains why Russia\u2019s military today enjoys a degree of technological advantage in some areas.\n\nStill, there is no denying that Russia\u2019s asymmetric approach stems from the country\u2019s weaker military and economic potential \u2013 an approach aimed at ensuring military preparedness in the face of a technologically and qualitatively superior U.S. military force.", "lang": "en"}
