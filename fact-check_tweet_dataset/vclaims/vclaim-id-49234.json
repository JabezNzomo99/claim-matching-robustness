The 2020 Tokyo Olympics have not been postponed at the time of publication.\n\nThe Daily Caller watched the entirety of the English-dubbed version and found that, contrary to the post\u2019s claim, the 1988 animated film does not depict a disease outbreak or mention the WHO at any point. The \u201capocalyptic event\u201d referenced in the post is actually an explosion that destroys Tokyo at the beginning of the film.\n\nAn early scene does show a large sign counting down the days to the Tokyo Olympics, with graffiti below it saying, \u201cJust cancel it,\u201d according to Mashable Southeast Asia. However, the Olympics are only referenced visually a few times and aren\u2019t central to the plot of the film, though the final battle takes place inside the Olympic stadium.\n\n\u201cAkira\u201d is set in 2019 in Neo Tokyo, a fictional city built where Tokyo was previously located. Its main plot revolves around a teen biker gang that gets entangled in a secret government project involving children with supernatural powers.\n\nAt the time of publication, the WHO has not advised Japan to cancel the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but rather provided them with guidance.

Options include modifying existing operational plans to allow the Games to begin on July 24 and changing the start date entirely, according to the IOC\u2019s statement.\n\nCOVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, has spread across the global, sickening some 335,972 people and killing some 14,632 others, according to the Johns Hopkins University live map.", "lang": "en"}
