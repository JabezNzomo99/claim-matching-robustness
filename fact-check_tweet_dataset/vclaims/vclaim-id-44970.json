But the pictures that supposedly prove this theory actually show unrelated people.\n\nNational tragedies are often followed by calls for change. In the case of George Floyd\u2019s death, there have been calls for an overhaul in policing; in the case of school shootings, there had been calls for tougher gun laws. In recent years, those calls have been followed by a wave of conspiracy theories aimed at undercutting them.\n\nSince the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, a standard component of these conspiracy theories has been the claim that the incident was an orchestrated show performed by \u201ccrisis actors.\u201d\n\nThis claim is an offshoot of the \u201cfalse flag\u201d idea, which means that the incident was planned to advance a particular agenda and conducted in a way that would hide the identity of those who are responsible.\n\n\u201cThe idea of the \u2018false flag\u2019 has been around for a long time,\u201d said Joseph Uscinski, an associate professor at the University of Miami who researches conspiracy theories.\n\nAsked in an interview with FactCheck.org about the origins of the \u201ccrisis actor\u201d claim, specifically, he said, \u201cyou can go back in time and find things that are similar.\u201d He noted that following the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, there were claims that the victims were really still alive or that the planes never existed. But, he said, \u201cSandy Hook is when\u2026 the whole theory came together.\u201d\n\nVice traced the origins of the term to an October 2012 press release for a Colorado acting studio that was offering to help schools and first responders create safety exercises and active-shooter drills with actors from the company who would be \u201ctrained in criminal and victim behavior.\u201d The press release called them \u201ccrisis actors.\u201d\n\nTwo months later, 20 children and six staff members were killed in a shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School and, within weeks, conspiracy theorists had seized on the term \u201ccrisis actor.\u201d\n\nThey had also misrepresented what the acting studio was offering.\n\n\u201cWe started getting hacked and stalked,\u201d said Jennifer McCray Rincon, founder and artistic director of the studio, in an interview with FactCheck.org. \u201cI was getting emails personally saying that I had staged Sandy Hook,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was quite frightening.\u201d After that, the studio stopped offering the training service.\n\nNow the term \u201ccrisis actor\u201d belongs to conspiracy theorists, and they\u2019ve trotted it out for the death of George Floyd.\n\nOne video has been circulating widely on social media, making claims that have been parroted in other types of posts, too.\n\nWe\u2019ll address the primary claims made in the video.\n\u2022 Regarding George Floyd: \u201cHe is not even dead.\u201d\n\nThe evidence presented to support that claim is a photo of a man in sunglasses with a hooded sweatshirt about which the video says, \u201cThat, my friends, is George Floyd at his own funeral.\u201d\n\nThe photo shows Stephen Jackson at a press conference in Minneapolis City Hall.\n\nJackson, a former NBA player who grew up with Floyd in Houston, Texas, has been vocal in the demonstrations that have followed Floyd\u2019s death.\n\nThe two men bear a resemblance, though. Jackson has actually referred to Floyd as his \u201ctwin.\u201d\n\nAs for the simple claim that Floyd isn\u2019t dead, two separate autopsies have been performed on his body \u2014 one by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office and the other by doctors commissioned by Floyd\u2019s family.\n\u2022 Regarding Derek Chauvin, the former police officer charged with second and third degree murder and second degree manslaughter in Floyd\u2019s death: \u201cThis is no cop. This is an actor. This is a crisis actor.\u201d\n\nThe evidence presented to support this claim includes two pictures of law enforcement officials in other settings \u2014 the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012.\n\nThe picture from the Boston bombing has been featured by conspiracy theorists since that incident happened. Shortly after the bombing, a popular conspiracy theory that was amplified by Alex Jones\u2019 InfoWars claimed that the photo showed mercenaries who should be considered \u201cpersons of interest\u201d in the bombing.\n\nThat theory was based largely on the blurry image of a logo seen on one of the men in the picture. InfoWars and others claimed that this was the logo for a company called Craft International, which had offered law-enforcement training before filing for bankruptcy in 2014. The company did not offer mercenary services.\n\nDespite the bogus basis for the claim, it was recycled along with the photo two years later in a related conspiracy theory claiming that the 2015 shooting in San Bernardino, California, was carried out by the same mercenaries.\n\nNow the photo is being used to claim that it shows Chauvin as a \u201ccrisis actor.\u201d\n\nThe three men in the photo are members of the National Guard\u2019s Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team, said Lt. Col. Matthew Woolums in an interview with FactCheck.org.\n\nWoolums, who was in command of the National Guard unit that day, is one of the three pictured. The other two were members the CST unit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a little bit of hurry here,\u201d he said, looking at the picture. The crowd was being evacuated and his team was assessing the area near the finish line of the race, where the first bomb detonated.\n\nThe National Guard\u2019s CST was stationed at various points in the race course in case of emergency, as it had been in previous years, according to a report from Harvard University\u2019s John F. Kennedy School of Government Case Program.\n\nSo, Chauvin is not shown in that picture.\n\nThe Sandy Hook example is a screenshot taken from a CBS News interview with three Newtown police officers who responded to the scene at the elementary school. The video zooms in on the officer in the middle, claiming that it shows Chauvin.\n\nIt shows Newtown Police Lieutenant David Kullgren. At the time of the shooting, Kullgren was a sergeant. His promotion to lieutenant two years later was covered by the local newspaper, as were several other developments in Kullgren\u2019s career, showing that he has been in the community for years rather than moving from crisis to crisis as an actor.\n\u2022 Regarding Maya Santamaria, who owned the club where Chauvin had worked for over a decade and Floyd had worked for a short time: \u201cTheir boss, the one who the cop and the guy worked for \u2014 she is a crisis actor.\u201d\n\nThe evidence for this claim is a picture of Nicole Hockley with her 6-year-old son Dylan, who died in the Sandy Hook shooting.\n\nIt does not show Maya Santamaria.\n\nHockley is a co-founder of Sandy Hook Promise, which is aimed at preventing gun violence. She has maintained an active Twitter profile from Newtown over the years, while Santamaria has been featured in Minneapolis-area publications talking about her club.\n\u2022 Regarding Tou Thao, one of the four former officers who has been charged in Floyd\u2019s death: \u201cCrisis actor. That badge is painted on\u2026 Not a cop.\u201d\n\nThe video doesn\u2019t offer any evidence to support the claim that Thao is a \u201ccrisis actor\u201d other than the baseless assertion that his \u201cbadge is painted on.\u201d\n\nThao, though, has accumulated six complaints over the years with the Minneapolis Police Department and, in 2017, he was named in a lawsuit alleging excessive force that resulted in a $25,000 settlement paid by the city.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
