The world will have a generation of idiots.\" Pasted below it is an image of a five young people standing side by side while looking down, their eyes glued to their cellphones.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe could find no record of Einstein ever saying or writing this, despite his papers and quotes being archived in several databases, including the definitive collection \"The Ultimate Quotable Einstein\" from Princeton University Press.\n\nThe closest iteration of the quote (at least the first half) was said, and linked to Einstein, in a scene from the 1995 movie \"Powder.\" Actor Jeff Goldblum, who plays the character Donald Ripley, says \"It\u2019s become appallingly clear that our technology has surpassed our humanity,\" to which Powder, played by Sean Patrick Flanery, responds \"Albert Einstein.\"\n\nQuote Investigator, a website that tracks down quotations, found that variations of the quote started to appear on webpages in 2012,the same year the scene in \"Powder\" was uploaded to YouTube.\n\nThe website concluded that the quote is likely fake, as \"the phrasing of the saying has changed over time and different sets of pictures have been attached.\"\n\nEinstein did, however, note the negative impacts of technology. The closest Einstein quote to share the sentiment, that we could find, was in a letter to Otto Juliusburger on April 11, 1946:\n\n\"I believe that the abominable deterioration of ethical standards stems primarily from the mechanisation and depersonalisation of our lives\u2014a disastrous byproduct of science and technology. Nostra culpa! (We are to blame!)\"\n\nOn the other hand, Einstein supported the advancement of technology, too. In another quote recorded by the Quotable Einstein collection (p. 246), he said it internationally chained economies together.\n\n\"Technology resulting from the sciences has internationally chained together economies and this has caused all wars to become a matter of international importance. When this situation has entered the consciousness of mankind, after sufficient turmoil, then men will also find the energy and goodwill to create organizations that have the power to end wars.\"\n\nJimena Canales, historian of science and author of \"The Physicist and the Philosopher: Einstein, Bergson, and the Debate That Changed Our Understanding of Time,\" told PolitiFact that she has never heard of such a quote by the physicist, either.\n\n\"I could be wrong, but (it) doesn\u2019t sound like Einstein to me at all,\" Canales wrote in an email. \"He had quite the opposite view of radio technology, which he believed would unite people.\"\n\nA post on the internet claims that Einstein once said he feared \"the day technology will surpass human interaction.\" And when that happened \"the world will have a generation of idiots.\"\n\nThere is no record of Einstein ever saying or writing anything close to those words, despite his papers and quotations being well-documented in several databases and works.\n\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
