This is false.\n\nSome posts on social media contain screenshots of a 2005 study originally published in the Virology Journal ( here ) and found among the National Institutes of Health\u2019s archived studies ( here ). The original article is entitled \u201cChloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread\u201d.\n\nOther posts are accompanied by screenshots of an April 2020 opinion column by Bryan Fischer on \u201cThe Northwest Connection\u201d ( www.nw-connection.com/?p=6147 ). Fischer referenced the same Virology article and notably wrote: \u201cSo HCQ functions as both a cure and a vaccine.\u201d Examples of the claim are visible here and here .\n\nThe 2005 study in Virology specifically found that chloroquine had \u201cstrong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells,\u201d and that \u201cfavorable inhibition of virus spread was observed when the cells were either treated with chloroquine prior to or after SARS CoV infection\u201d meaning that the drug had both preventative and therapeutic benefits for the test subjects.\n\nThis study, however, was limited to animal testing in a laboratory setting (the study refers to primates in its abstract and methodology, there is no mention of human testing, pages 1 and 9 here ). The authors do suggest that their positive results in primate cell culture are promising (see page 9) and the use of chloroquine for the clinical management of SARS is presented as a possibility. They also mention that \u201cinfectivity of coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV are also affected by chloroquine, as exemplified by the human CoV-229E\u201d (page 9), a possible source for the online claims.\n\nThe study\u2019s focus was the then-newly discovered SARS-CoV coronavirus that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, not the SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19. While the two are both coronaviruses, they are different strains causing different diseases.\n\nThe 2005 study could not have investigated chloroquine\u2019s effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 because the latter was not identified until January 2020 following the December 2019 outbreak in Wuhan, China, of what we now know as COVID-19 ( here ).\n\nChloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are two related, but different drugs with similar \u201cclinical indications for use\u201d and similar toxicity ( here ).\n\nAs of this fact check\u2019s publication, evidence for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine\u2019s effectiveness against COVID-19 remains inconclusive.\n\nAs of June 16, 2020 the U.S. NIH recommends against the \u201cuse of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19, except in a clinical trial\u201d and against \u201cthe use of high-dose chloroquine (600 mg twice daily for 10 days) for the treatment of COVID-19.\u201d ( here )\n\nOn July 1, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also cautioned against the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for COVID-19 \u201coutside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems.\u201d ( here )\n\nThis warning did not discourage the use of these drugs for FDA-approved uses for other diseases like malaria, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nAnother recent study published in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents found that unsupervised use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure against COVID-19 can \u201cexpose the public to serious adverse drug effects\u201d ( here ).\n\nIn June, the World Health Organization (WHO) discontinued experimental treatments involving the use of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir after the initial results of an international trial called Solidarity showed that the drugs produced little or no reduction in the mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients ( here , here ).\n\nOne month earlier, EU governments moved to halt the use of anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients, Reuters reported. Medicines agencies in France and Italy said the drug should not be used for COVID-19 outside clinical trials. Belgium\u2019s regulator said trials aiming to evaluate the drug should also take potential risks into consideration ( here ).\n\nFalse. A 2005 chloroquine/SARS study does not prove hydroxychloroquine\u2019s effectiveness against COVID-19. Existing evidence on the drug\u2019s effectiveness against COVID-19 remains inconclusive.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
