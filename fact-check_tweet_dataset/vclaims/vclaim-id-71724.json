And lots of other people too.\n\nThe cuts are projected to total $1.8 trillion over the next decade, according to the Tax Foundation, a think tank that generally has a pro-business leaning.\n\nIn 2018, about 80% of taxpayers had a tax cut due to the new law, according to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation.\n\nThe savings do skew toward high-income earners. The center said 21% of the total tax savings went to the highest-earning 1% of taxpayers in 2018, more than the total for the bottom 60%.\n\nBy 2025, that gap is projected to increase, with 25% of the tax savings going to the top 1%.\n\nThe increases are larger for higher-income earners on a percentage basis as well \u2014 not just in raw dollars. In 2025, the top 1% are expected to see after-tax income grow by 2.9%, compared to 1.4% or less for the bottom 80% of income earners.\n\nThat\u2019s largely in line with estimates from other groups, such as the Tax Foundation.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find a breakdown of exactly how much of that money is going to billionaires. The Tax Policy Center stopped its analysis at 0.1% of highest income earners. That group includes about 140,000 tax returns, and by 2025 will receive about 11% of the total tax savings. (Annual income for that group is currently at least $6.9 million, according to the IRS.)\n\nMeanwhile, Forbes reported there are 607 billionaires in the U.S. in 2019. That is less than half of the top 0.001% of income earners.\n\nSuffice it to say, the vast majority of the money is not going to billionaires.\n\nThe Medicare cost reduction under Trump\u2019s budget is expected to be roughly $600 billion over the next 10 years, when compared to current spending levels, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, largely agrees, putting the number at $575 billion.\n\nThere are some important caveats.\n\nAbout 85% of the savings comes from reductions in what Medicare pays to providers, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\n\"Those cuts would primarily reduce what Medicare pays providers, and I would not expect them to have negative effects on Medicare beneficiaries,\" Matt Fiedler, an economics fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, said in an email. \"The budget\u2019s Medicare proposals are also, in my view, largely sensible policy.\"\n\nMedicare changes aren\u2019t exactly an original idea, either \u2014 Trump is actually building on proposals from Democratic President Barack Obama. Obama\u2019s last budget proposed trimming Medicare spending by a pretty similar amount: $420 billion over 10 years.\n\nThat brings us to the root of the issue \u2014 is it fair to connect proposed Medicare changes to tax cuts from two years ago?\n\nIn October 2017, PolitiFact National gave U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer a Half True rating for claiming that Republicans were proposing \"to pay for their giant tax cut to the rich by gutting Medicare and Medicaid.\"\n\nWe noted at the time that drawing a direct link between specific tax cuts and Medicare-Medicaid cuts was exaggerated since they were separate pieces of legislation.\n\nThe Priorities USA ad makes a different claim, starting with the fact it refers to just Medicare (not Medicare and Medicaid) and, instead of \"the rich,\" it refers specifically to billionaires. In addition, we\u2019re now dealing with the final version of the tax cuts and a firm budget proposal.\n\nThat said, the ad does connect the two pieces of legislation in the way Schumer did, which we noted is problematic.\n\nFinally, Fiedler notes that \u2014 broadly speaking \u2014 cutting taxes does require other adjustments be made.\n\n\"Tax cuts aren\u2019t a free lunch: lower tax revenue will lead to higher deficits, which will require either future tax increases or spending cuts,\" he said in an email. \"Medicare is a substantial fraction of federal spending, so it\u2019s certainly possible that Medicare would bear a portion of those future adjustments, but it\u2019s impossible to say with any precision where those adjustments would ultimately fall.\"\n\nThe Priorities USA web ad said Trump is cutting Medicare to fund tax breaks for billionaires.\n\nAny large-scale tax cuts reduces revenue and can require cuts elsewhere in the federal budget, where Medicare is a high-cost piece.\n\nBut the ad over-reaches in directly linking tax cuts signed into law almost two years ago and Medicare changes that are still in the works.\n\nReferring to the tax cuts simply as \"to billionaires\" is a stretch as well. The cuts do disproportionately benefit the wealthy, but a very small portion of the money actually goes to billionaires.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
