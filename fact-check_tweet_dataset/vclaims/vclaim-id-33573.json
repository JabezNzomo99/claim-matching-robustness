Let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of the claim.\n\n\n\nClaim: Image of Muslims offering their last namaz at the Babri Masjid site before handing over it to Hindus. Fact: The image shows Muslims offering Eid al-Adha prayers at the Feroz Shah Kotla Mosque in New Delhi in 2008. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFrom the article of \u2018News18\u2019 published on 10 November 2019, it was found that the Supreme Court in its Ayodhya verdict has directed the Central government to constitute a trust in three months to oversee the construction of a temple for Hindus on the 2.77-acre site in Ayodhya. In 1992, Babri Masjid, a four-century-old structure that existed at that site was destroyed.\n\n\n\nWhen the image in the post is cropped and subjected to Google reverse image search technique, an archived article of \u2018Indian Express\u2019 was found in the search results. The article titled \u2018Eid al-Adha celebrations\u2019 had a gallery of seventeen pictures in it. The photo in the post can be seen as fourth among those pictures. The description seen along with the photo is \u2018Muslims offer Eid al-Adha prayers at the Ferozshah Kotla Mosque in New Delhi\u2019 and also, photo credits were given to \u2018AP images\u2019.

The information here regarding the image confirmed that it is related to Muslims offer Eid al-Adha prayers at the Ferozshah Kotla Mosque in New Delhi. From that description, it was also found that the image was taken in 2008. \n\n\n\nTo conclude, a 2008 image of Muslims praying at a mosque in New Delhi is falsely shared as \u2018the last namaz offered at the Babri Masjid (Ayodhya)\u2019. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
