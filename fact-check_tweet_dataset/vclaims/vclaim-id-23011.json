(Now this is what will happen to rapists. A mulla [Muslim] who raped an 8-year-old girl was stabbed with a knife in the middle of the road in Barabanki.)\u201d \u2013 is the caption used to circulate the video.\n\nA few social media users have shared another clip of the same incident, shot from a different angle.\n\nThe claim is in wide circulation on Facebook.\n\nUpon searching for the incident with the keywords \u201cman stabbed on road\u201d, Alt News came across news reports from last week by India Todayand The News Minute. According to both the reports, the case pertained to Hyderabad and not Uttar Pradesh. The victim, Imitiaz, was not stabbed for raping a minor, but marrying a woman without the consent of her parents. Six persons were arrested for the crime and the police are on the lookout for two others who are absconding. The victim is hospitalised.\n\nIndia Today\u2019s report carried the same video viral on social media, initially uploaded by passers-by who claimed that the incident took place in SR Nagar.\n\nWhen Alt News looked for the video on Twitter, using the keyword \u201cSR Nagar\u201d, we came across a tweet by a correspondent of The Hindu, Abhinay Deshpande, who had tweeted the identical clip.\n\nDeshpande shared another video of the incident shot from a different angle.\n\nAccording to news reports, a rape case was registered in Barabanki where the survivor was an 8-year-old. However, the viral video is unrelated to this case. The man stabbed in the video is a youth and the accused of the crime was a 40-year-old man named Salim.", "lang": "en"}
