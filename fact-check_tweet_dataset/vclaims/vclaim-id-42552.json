Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: People shouting \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 in Europe after the Coronavirus outbreak. Fact: The video is not related to COVID-19 outbreak in Europe. The video was found to be on the internet since 13 January 2020, whereas the first COVID-19 case in Europe was reported on 24 January 2020. The video was taken in Germany, where the first COVID-19 case was reported on 28 January 2020. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, the same video was found in the search results. The video was found to be uploaded on YouTube on 13 January 2020. It has the description that the video was taken in Hamburg (Germany). But, the first COVID-19 case was reported in Germany on 28 January 2020 (first COVID-19 case in Europe was reported on 24 January 2020). So, it was not taken after the outbreak of Coronavirus in Europe.\n\n\n\nWhen searched about the procession in Hamburg in January, some pictures with similar visuals were found on the \u2018Getty Images\u2019 website. On the website, it can be read that people in Hamburg demonstrated, on 11 January 2020, against the oppression of the Uyghur Muslim minority in China. While the location of the demonstration looks the same from the pictures, it cannot be concluded that the video is related to the same demonstration. But the video was definitely taken before the Coronavirus outbreak.\n\nTo sum it up, an old video falsely shared as \u2018people shouting \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 in Europe after the Coronavirus outbreak\u2019.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
