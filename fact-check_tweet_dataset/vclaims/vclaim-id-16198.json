In fact, the share of annual GDP generated by the government and state-run enterprises has risen from 35 percent in 2005 to 70 percent in 2015.

Putin\u2019s remarks came while discussing the possible sale of 19.5 percent of Russia\u2019s stake in the Rosneft oil company, an anticipated deal critics have labelled \u201cpseudo-privatization.\u201d \n\n \n\n Putin\u2019s remark came literally weeks after a cabinet meeting in Moscow to discuss a report by the Federal Anti-Monopoly Agency (FAA) on the degree of competition in the Russian economy. That report found the government and state-run enterprises control 70 percent of the Russian economy. The report itself concluded that Russia has created what it termed \u201cstate monopoly capitalism.\u201d\n\n \n\n Interestingly, the information provided by the FAA is largely in line with the findings in 2013 of the International Monetary Fund, according to Forbes. The IMF put Russia\u2019s share in the country\u2019s GDP at 71 percent. \n\n \n\n Similar figures were put forward by Kirill Androsov, chairman of the board of directors of Russian airline Aeroflot, at a Moscow economic conference earlier this year.\n\n\"Hybrid\" forms of state capitalism are taking root in Russia as well, according to Valery Mironov, deputy director of \u201cCenter of Development\u201d at Moscow\u2019s Economic Institute.\n\nIn particular, Mironov, has highlighted what he calls the rise of \u201cregional monopolies,\u201d which he says began to appear after Putin scrapped popular elections of regional governors in 2004 as part of a drive to tighten his grip on the political system. Mironov says the development of small and medium business in Russia\u2019s 85 regions has been severely hampered as a result. Without ties to local leaders, Mironov explains, small and medium businesses have little chance to survive let alone thrive. \n\n \n\n In one respect, Putin is right. Russia does not need to build state capitalism, it already exists.", "lang": "en"}
