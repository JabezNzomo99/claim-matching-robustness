He named and thanked the nurses who had cared for him, especially \u2018Jenny from New Zealand and Luis from Portugal\u2019.\n\nPitarma received praise from Portuguese president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa in a message on the presidential (here) while New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she sent McGee a message on Facebook to thank her for her work (here).\n\nFalse: the nurses who treated Boris Johnson are fully registered to work in the UK by the Nursing & Midwifery Council.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
