Earlier this month, a post alleged that \u201cCNN Tonight\u201d host Don Lemon called Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi an \u201cunarmed father of three\u201d during a live broadcast. (RELATED: Did CNN\u2019s Don Lemon Call al-Baghdadi An \u2018Unarmed Father of Three\u2019 During An Oct. 27 Broadcast?)\n\nThe image, posted Oct. 23, allegedly shows a CNN chyron beneath a photograph of an assault-style weapon. \u201cBreaking News,\u201d reads the supposed still from one of the network\u2019s broadcasts. \u201cCNN Exclusive: Democrats ask, \u2018Why even have a Second Ammendment (sic)?'\u201d\n\nYet, while CNN has extensively covered the subject of gun control on its broadcasts and website, there is no record of the cable news network ever airing this news chyron. No matching or similar graphics appear in Grabien, a video clip editing service.\n\nSearching CNN\u2019s website didn\u2019t turn up any exclusive reports on Democrats questioning the usefulness of the Second Amendment either. In a 2017 video, former Republican Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy told anchor Chris Cuomo that Democrats want to \u201ceradicate the Second Amendment,\u201d but at no point did CNN use the chyron in the Facebook post.\n\nA CNN spokesperson confirmed to PolitiFact that the chyron had, in fact, been fabricated.", "lang": "en"}
