The claim originated on a satirical website.\n\nPhilbin died at the age of 88 on July 24. He is remembered for his six-decade career in the TV industry, including roles as host of the popular game show \u201cWho Wants to Be A Millionaire\u201d and co-host of the daytime talk show \u201cLive! With Regis and Kelly.\u201d\n\nA post shared on Facebook shortly after his death shares a picture of Philbin with a halo around his head, claiming he \u201cleft $20 Million to the Trump campaign.\u201d (RELATED: Did Actor Lee Majors Die And Leave The Trump Campaign $6 Million In His Will?)\n\nThe television host did appear to have a friendship with Trump, which Philbin described in his 2011 book \u201cHow I Got This Way\u201d as being centered around their shared interest in television and baseball. Trump described Philbin as a \u201cfantastic person\u201d and a \u201cfriend\u201d in a July 25 tweet memorializing him.\n\nWhile they shared a friendship, the Daily Caller News Foundation found no news reporting to corroborate the claim that Philbin left $20 million to Trump\u2019s campaign. The family also did not mention anything to that effect in its statement to the media, and the Trump campaign has not made any such announcement. It appears Philbin made just two donations to political campaigns \u2013 neither Trump\u2019s \u2013 since 1975, according to Federal Election Commission records.\n\nThe claim appears to have originated in an article, titled \u201cRegis Left $20 Million To Trump Campaign,\u201d which was published on the satirical website America\u2019s Last Line of Defense. The website describes itself as a part of a network that publishes \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d While the article is clearly labeled as satirical and categorized as \u201cSilly Tater Satire,\u201d the Facebook post does not disclose the satirical nature of the source, a common way online misinformation spreads.\n\nOther satirical websites associated with the America\u2019s Last Line of Defense network have written similar stories that erroneously allege that public figures like late Texas billionaire Ross Perot and late musician Bill Withers also bequeathed millions to the Trump campaign.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
