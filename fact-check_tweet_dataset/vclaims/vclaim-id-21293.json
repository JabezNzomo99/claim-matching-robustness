No, that's total nonsense, if you believed that you've been taken in by a joke website publishing a satirical articles. Chickpeas are not laid by chickens, it is not real.\n\nThe joke story originally appeared in an article published by the Waterford Whispers News on June 20, 2018 titled \"Chickpea Shortage Feared As Chickens Lay Fewer Peas\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nRETAILERS are reporting a large decrease in chickpea stocks around the world as chickens are laying fewer peas, sparking an increase in both demand and the price of chickpeas. Chickpea or the 'Egyptian pea' is a legume of the family Fabaceae and was named so due to the chickens from that area often laying small circular legume in place of eggs due to the hot and humid conditions of the North African country. The main ingredient in hummus, chickpeas grew in popularity in the West and lead to mass production in America and some parts of Europe, importing Egyptian chickens while recreating the climate conditions they experienced in Africa in large industrial style units known as hummus farms.\n\nUsers on social media who only saw this title, description and thumbnail may have thought it was a real news story:\n\nThe chickpea or chick pea (Cicer arietinum) is a legume of the family Fabaceae, subfamily Faboideae.[2][3] Its different types are variously known as gram[4][5] or Bengal gram,[5] garbanzo[5] or garbanzo bean, and Egyptian pea.[4] Its seeds are high in protein. It is one of the earliest cultivated legumes: 7500-year-old remains have been found in the Middle East.[6][7] In 2016, India produced 64% of the world's total chickpeas.[8]\n\nSo it is clearly plant-based in origin, not laid by chickers, should you still doubt it.\n\nThe site Whaterford Whispers News has a disclaimer page which reads:\n\nFor that reason alone you should probably never believe anything they publish.\n\nWe wrote about waterfordwhispersnews.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Statue Of Liberty NOT Converted Into Prison For Immigrant Children\n\u2022 Fake News: Israeli Soldier NOT Awarded Medal For Bravery After Being Hit By Pebble\n\u2022 Fake News: Palestine NOT Granted Permission To Compete In Eurovision 2019\n\u2022 Fake News: 'Facebook Courts' Application NOT Launched For Trials By Social Media", "lang": "en"}
