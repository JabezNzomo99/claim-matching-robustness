However, reverse image searches show that the video is actually a snippet of an advertisement by an online shopping store in Pakistan and the rickshaw cannot fly.\n\nA reverse image search using InVID showed that the video was first shared on this Facebook page and has attracted over 70,000 views and at least 3000 reactions.\n\nA post, from October 29, 2018, appeared on Group Kenya which is a Facebook page with over 1.9 million followers according to CrowdtTangle data.\n\nThe caption on the video read: \"Tuktuk airways from Mombasa to JFKennedy NY in other words from Kenya to the USA. Booking is available for our CBD office.\" This was in reference to the launch of the non-stop direct flight to the US.\n\nThe full-length video depicts a driver of the rickshaw flying a passenger who is not wearing a seatbelt and appears to be terribly terrified during the ride.\n\nThe same video was shared in Nigeria where the public commented that the flying rickshaw would be a good idea to deal with the heavy traffic snarl-ups in Lagos.\n\nIn Kenya, some commenters showed skepticism that the video was actually real, while in Pakistan several Facebook pages described the video as the future of rickshaws.\n\nThe video was originally created an advertisement by Yayvo, an online shopping store in Pakistan. On its website, the store says that the main purpose of the video was to communicate that shopping can be exhilarating.\n\n\"The message behind this video is that by shopping on the website, you can save so much that you can do anything!\"\n\nThe online shopping store went on to place a disclaimer in a much smaller font compared to the rest of the text warning that the rickshaw cannot actually fly.", "lang": "en"}
