Yes, that's partially true, but the headline is misleading. Here is some context: Only images rated \"false or partly false\" by independent fact-checkers will be flagged. There will not be labels on all content that has been altered using desktop photo-editing tools.\n\nThe claim originated from a meme (archived here) published by The Shade Room on January 18, 2020, under the title \"Instagram Will Begin To Label Photoshopped Images With a 'False Information' Warning.\" It opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nWhile the headline is partially true, it would have been more accurate to say, \"Instagram Will Begin To Label Some Edited Images With A 'False Information' Warning.\"\n\nPhotoshop is a registered trademark of Adobe and is not the only desktop photo editor that can alter, enhance, or edit photos. Adobe frowns upon the use of the term as a verb to describe all photo editing.\n\nAs the Instagram press release noted, only false or partially false content will be flagged on the site. Specifically:\n\nWhen content has been rated as false or partly false by a third-party fact-checker, we reduce its distribution by removing it from Explore and hashtag pages. In addition, it will be labeled so people can better decide for themselves what to read, trust, and share. When these labels are applied, they will appear to everyone around the world viewing that content - in feed, profile, stories, and direct messages.\n\nInstagram is trying to combat misinformation, not flag content that has been artistically or stylistically created on Photoshop and other photo-editing software.\n\nTo determine which content should be sent to fact-checkers for review, we use a combination of feedback from our community and technology. Earlier this year, we added a \"False Information\" feedback option, and these reports, along with other signals, help us to better identify and take action on potentially false information.\n\nWe wrote about disinformation on Instagram before.
