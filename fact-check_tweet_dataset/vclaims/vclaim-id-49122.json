The chicken welfare association has also stopped adoptions. People are buying animals as LIVE FOOD because of the food shortage.\u201d\n\nIt is true that a group in Berkshire paused rabbit adoptions out of fear that the rabbits were being bought to be eaten, supposedly due to food shortages during the current coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHowever the RSPCA told Full Fact that they are not aware of any cases of people trying to buy pets as food. As such, there is no reason to believe that such activity is widespread.\n\nIn a Facebook post from 22 March, one of West Berkshire Small Animal Rescue\u2019s admins said they are not letting anyone new register for adoption. It said \u201cI have had numerous messages and phone calls now that were highly suspicious. 1 claimed to want the bunnies for \"livestock\" and another admitting to wanting to use the bunnies for meat but that they would be killed \"nicely\".\u201d\n\n\n\nIt is also true that a chicken welfare trust has stopped new adoptions, although the reason for this is unclear.\n\nThe British Hen Welfare Trust announced that it has received unprecedented interest in adopting hens, but are \u201cnow unable to carry out any hen collections or rehomings until the Covid-19 outbreak has passed.\u201d It also adds that all its staff are now working from home.\n\n\n\nFull Fact has reached out to the group to ask for the reason behind this. An alternative explanation for the rise of interest in hens could be the ongoing reports of people looking to buy chickens so they can produce their own eggs.", "lang": "en"}
