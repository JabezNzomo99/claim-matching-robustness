It further urge people to stop eating seafood as it is being claimed that bodies of Coronavirus patients are thrown into the sea.\n\nThe caption to the video reads: \u201cSome countries throw COVID-19 infected dead bodies into the seas. Advice to stop eating seafood. The World is really coming to an end. Dear God, please intervene.\u201d\n\nThe same video was shared with the same claim several times which can be seen here and here.\n\nALSO READ: Government is NOT reducing employees\u2019 pension by 30%; here\u2019s a fact\u2026\n\nWhen we took keyframes from the above video using the InVid Tool, it led us to a 2014 Al Jazeera report of a boat that capsized off the Libyan Coast and led to the death of African migrants.\n\nThe article states that a boat filled with upto 250 migrants, headed to Europe, has sunk off the Libyan coast and many passengers have died. Migrants on the capsized boat were mostly Africans.\n\nWhen we further checked for information on this incident, it led us to a Daily Mail article with photos from the capsize, which matched other keyframes from the video.\n\nIt is hence confirmed that the video has no links to COVID-19 and its an old video from 2014. It is thus fake news.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
