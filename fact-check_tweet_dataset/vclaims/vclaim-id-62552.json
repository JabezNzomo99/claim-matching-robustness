We looked at two claims directly related to 5G.\n\nContacted by Africa Check for his evidence for this, Onovo would only confirm that he had made the claims in question.\n\nIn the TV interview, he said that such levels of radiation could \u201ccremate people\u201d and cause cancer.\n\n5G is the fifth generation, or wireless standard, of mobile networking technology. There have been four previous generations, each an improvement on the previous one. These are referred to as 1G (the first generation), 2G, 3G and 4G. (\n\nElectromagnetic radiation is a form of energy transfer through space, as waves. It is most familiar to us as visible light, but there are other frequencies that are invisible to humans. These include radio waves, commonly used by mobile networks, radio and television broadcasts and in navigation.\n\nWe asked experts if the claim that radiation from 5G is 10,000 times that from 3G is correct.\n\nin the US, told Africa Check. His research interests include studying how electromagnetic fields interact with the human body.\n\nFoster said that while the frequency used by 5G is higher than current mobile phone systems, \u201cit is not likely that their signal levels will be very different from present day mobile networks\u201d.\n\n\u2018No basis to claim mobile phone signals of any kind harmful,\u2019 says expert\n\nMobile phone networks have to comply with national exposure limits, which in nearly all countries are based on those of the\n\nThe Germany-based commission is the body behind international guidelines on exposure to radiation.\n\n\u201cThe limits are designed to protect against all known hazards of radiofrequency energy,\u201d Foster said, adding that signals from mobile phone base stations \u201care invariably very far below these limits\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is no basis to claim that mobile phone signals of any kind are harmful, and no basis to claim that 5G signals are more harmful than those from earlier generation mobile phones.\u201d\n\nWhile more studies will be done as the technology becomes more common, current research on 5G signal levels shows low exposure levels, Foster said.\n\nHe directed us to\n\nthat the highest radiation levels at 22 sites where 5G technology had been implemented were \u201c0.039% of the maximum set out in the international guidelines\u201d.\n\nWhen signals such as 2G and 3G were included, the highest levels were 1.5% of the guidelines. More research is underway, the regulator said.\n\nDr Eric Van Rongen, the vice chair of the commission, agreed.\n\n\u201cNo, this [claim] is not correct. From what is known from limited measurements around the world, the actual exposure from 5G systems will not differ appreciably from that of 3G or 4G systems,\u201d he told Africa Check.\n\n5G and other cellphone networks belong to the lowest frequency-lowest energy spectrum of radiofrequency radiation, Van Rongen said.\n\nIn an 11 May statement,\n\nof 5G in Nigeria. It said that in November 2019, it approved a three month trial of the technology and this has been concluded.\n\nOnovo claimed he knows people who are electrosensitive. For them, exposure to radiation from telecommunication masts \u201coffsets their entire system and makes them very sick\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis thing is very harsh to people who are very electrosensitive and we are not sure how many they are in the population. What if half of our people are electrosensitive? And in two, three years all of them have cancer?\n\n\u201cHow do you treat them \u2026[what] if you have 30 million cancer patients from 5G?\u201d (\n\nWhat does being electrosensitive mean?\n\n\u201c\u2018Electrosensitivity\u2019 refers to nonspecific symptoms, such as headaches, that some people report when they consider themselves exposed to electromagnetic fields of various types,\u201d Prof\n\nof the University of Pennsylvania told Africa Check.\n\nThese fields could be from fluorescent bulbs, mobile phones and base stations, or wifi. \u201cThe symptoms are entirely self reported and scientific tests have not been able to link actual exposures to the symptoms,\u201d Foster said.\n\nDr Eric van Rongen from the commission on non-ionizing radiation, echoed this.\n\n\u201cThere are many studies on self-proclaimed electrosensitive people, using several frequencies that are going to be used by 5G, or that are close to 5G frequencies. In none of these studies has a relation been found between radio frequency exposure and the symptoms these people attribute to such exposure.\u201d\n\nWhat about a risk of cancer from 5G?\n\n\n\n There is no conclusive risk of cancer from 5G, Kenneth Foster, \n\n\n\n He noted that in 2013 the classified radiofrequency fields as a \u201cpossible\u201d human carcinogen. This was based mainly on research on diseases in humans, or epidemiology studies, some of which reported associations between the long term use of cell phones and brain cancer, he said. \n\n\n\n \u201cThis designation indicates a level of suspicion, but not the conclusion, that radiofrequency fields actually cause cancer. The IARC considered that there is \u2018limited evidence\u2019 from human studies, and \u2018limited evidence\u2019 from animal studies,\u201d said Foster. \n\n\n\n \u201cThere is no evidence that exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic fields from masts is related to cancer,\u201d said Dr Eric Van Rongen, the vice chair of the \n\n\n\n \u201cThere are some studies on mobile phone users that claim such relation, but many more that don\u2019t and overall the evidence for a causal relation is considered by the commission to be not substantiated.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
