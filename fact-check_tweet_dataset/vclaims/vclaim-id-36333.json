The claim is false; the video shows a deadly explosion in Tianjin, a port city in northeast China, in August 2015.\n\nThis video has been viewed more than 250 times after it was uploaded to Vimeo on January 25, 2020.\n\nThe video, titled \u201cLarge Explosion in Wuhan, China\u201d, contains the following caption: \u201cThis happened a few hours ago in wuhan likely the Chinese government began to kill its own people to control the virus\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe novel coronavirus has killed more than 1,300 people and infected almost 60,000 others in China after it was discovered in Wuhan, AFP reported here on February 13, 2020.\n\nThe video was also shared with a similar claim here, here and here on Twitter and here and here on Facebook.\n\nThe claim is false. A Google reverse image search of a keyframe from the video found a longer version published here on YouTube.

The blast killed more than 170 people and prompted fears of toxic contamination.\n\nIn August 2015, AFP also published a video obtained by Chinese state media CCTV that shows a similar scene as the footage being shared in the misleading posts. Other similar user-generated content from the Tianjin blast was published here by the BBC and here by the Guardian.\n\nAFP published its own footage from the scene, which shows smoke billowing from the destroyed warehouse, here on August 12, 2015.\n\nAFP also took photos of the aftermath of the blast.\n\nThe caption of one of the photos reads: \u201cFire and smoke rise from the site of a series of explosions in Tianjin early on August 13, 2015. A series of massive explosions at a warehouse in the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin killed 17 people, state media reported August 13, as witnesses described a fireball from the blasts ripping through the night sky.
