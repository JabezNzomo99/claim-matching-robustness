The chaos of the Iowa caucuses earlier this week provided both in spades.\n\nIn the hours after the first votes of the 2020 presidential election cycle were cast, the Iowa Democratic Party proved unable to report the results. Only 62 percent of the vote was released the following day, with the remaining precincts reporting their final tallies at a slow drip throughout the week. By the time 100 percent of the results were finally published on Thursday, the process had been marred by not only justifiable accusations of incompetence and serious allegations of errors and inconsistencies, but conspiracy theories that lacked supporting evidence.\n\nCentral to the dysfunction in the Hawkeye State was a mysterious app\u2014fittingly called Shadow\u2014backed by Acronym, a self-described \u201cnonprofit organization committed to building power and digital infrastructure for the progressive movement.\u201d Emily Stewart put together an excellent explainer on the pair\u2019s relationship over at Recode.\n\nIn a press conference on Tuesday addressing what went wrong the night before, Iowa Democratic Party Chair Troy Price blamed the app for the delays. \u201cThis was a coding error in one of the pieces on the back-end,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhile the app was recording data accurately, it was reporting out only partial data,\u201d an official statement from the state party read. \u201cWe have determined that this was due to a coding issue in the reporting system.\u201d\n\nAlmost immediately, rumors began to fly about ties between the campaign of South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and those behind the app. Supporters of other candidates began to float theories connecting him to Shadow and suggesting he benefited from the technological breakdown.\n\nButtigieg\u2014a polarizing candidate among the Democratic party\u2019s younger, more liberal base\u2014outperformed expectations in Iowa. The RealClearPolitics polling average in the state showed him in third with 16.8 percent of the vote going into the caucuses; he ended up edging ahead of Bernie Sanders by winning 26.2 percent of the pledged delegates.\n\nIn the early morning hours of February 4, as the chaos of the counting was unfolding, Rep. Ilhan Omar, who has endorsed Sanders, drew attention to the rumors.\n\nA short time later, a tweet from @GotBerniesBack pointed to alleged ties between the Buttigieg campaign and individuals connected to the app, concluding, \u201cthis all reeks.\u201d It has since been retweeted more than 1,200 times.\n\nThe next morning, Shaun King, a prominent Sanders surrogate, claimed \u201cPete\u2019s team funded the company that built the failed election app in Iowa.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Bernie supporters spreading the claims. Kayleigh McEnany is the press secretary for Trump\u2019s re-election campaign:\n\nHere are the facts surrounding Shadow, Acronym, and Mayor Pete.\n\nThe Buttigieg campaign paid Shadow $42,500, but they weren\u2019t the only campaign to do so.\n\nPete For America made two separate payments of $21,250 to Shadow in July of 2019, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nA campaign spokesman acknowledged to The Dispatch that the Buttigieg campaign has contracted with Shadow. The relationship, however, was for \u201c[text] messaging services to help us contact voters,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's totally unrelated to any apps they built for the party.\u201d\n\nBut the Buttigieg team wasn\u2019t alone. Kristen Gillibrand\u2019s presidential campaign, which ended in August, spent $37,400 with the company. Joe Biden, who is very much still in the race and floundered in Iowa, gave Shadow $1,225. The Nevada State Democratic Party paid Shadow $58,000 in August\u2014but promptly cut off its relationship with the company after the role it played in the Iowa debacle. \u201cWe will not be employing the same app or vendor used in the Iowa caucus,\u201d a statement read.\n\nThe founder and CEO of Acronym, the organization behind Shadow, has demonstrated support for Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign.\n\nA quick scan through Tara McGowan\u2019s Twitter feed illustrates the Acronym CEO\u2019s backing of the former South Bend mayor.\n\n\u201cMAYOR PETE IS RUNNING \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\u201d she tweeted upon the candidate\u2019s launch last January.\n\n\u201cMayor Pete is an incredible candidate I am so, so excited to see get in this race,\u201d she added.\n\nIn November, she dreamed of a potential Democratic ticket.\n\nMcGowan\u2019s husband, Michael Halle, describes himself on Twitter as a \u201cstrategist for @Petebuttigieg,\u201d and McGowan\u2019s brother-in-law, Ben Halle, was Buttigieg\u2019s Iowa communications director.\n\nMcGowan\u2019s views on Bernie Sanders\u2014Buttigieg\u2019s main competition in Iowa\u2014have been much less enthusiastic, though she did say last month she would \u201cproudly vote for Bernie on Election Day if he is our candidate.\u201d\n\nMcGowan did not address these previous expressions of support in a lengthy Medium post on Wednesday, but she did write that the group\u2019s employees support a variety of candidates.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to count among our ranks supporters for nearly every Democratic candidate, as well as former employees who are working for nearly all the leading Democratic campaigns. This diversity of viewpoint is something I\u2019m incredibly proud of, it\u2019s what makes us that much stronger and better prepared to take on the fight at hand, together. ACRONYM and PACRONYM will continue to stay neutral in the primary so that we can better focus on the common threat before us. But make no mistake, we will rally around and support whomever is the eventual Democratic nominee.\u201d\n\nPolitical campaigns are notorious for their nepotism and self-dealing, and there is certainly some overlap here that raises questions about conflicts of interest. But there is no evidence that the caucuses were \u201crigged,\u201d or that the problems with the Shadow app had anything to do with Buttigieg\u2019s connections to those behind it.\n\nBeyond that, such a conspiracy theory lacks common sense.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses take place out in the open. Citizens announce their votes by standing with others who support the same candidate\u2014and they do so in front of dozens, sometimes hundreds, of other witnesses. Journalists from around the world descend on Iowa to cover the caucuses. International observers attend them. Some of the 1,765 caucus sites are covered on television. It's simply not possible to secretly manipulate the results through an app when they're among the most public electoral contests in the world.\n\nThere were undoubtedly problems with the app itself and errors with subsequent attempts to tally the results\u2014that much is indisputable. But there is zero evidence that the problems with the app were orchestrated by the Buttigieg campaign or Buttigieg supporters\u2014or anyone else, for that matter.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
