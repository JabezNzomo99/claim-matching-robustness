(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nAll the images in the collage have been circulating online since at least 2015 and are predominantly used in posts and blogs to claim that white South African farmers are under attack. Some have also been misused to claim that immigrants in Europe are violent.\n\nThe image in the top left of the post dates back to Oct. 3, 2014, when 75-year-old Anne Els from Bloemfontein, South Africa, was attacked and robbed in her home. A Facebook page called \"'Stop White South African Genocide\" shared the image and claimed Els was attacked by a Black man.\n\nIn 2019, Norweigan fact-checking organization Faktisk debunked another false claim about the photo that said it showed a Swedish rape victim. The organization found a report about the incident by Volksblad, a South African newspaper, but said no information about the attacker was given.\n\nThe woman pictured in the bottom right shows 75-year-old Renske Cowan in October 2010 \u2014 three years before the Black Lives Matter movement began \u2014 when she was beaten by an intruder in her home in Primrose, Germiston South Africa, according to an Africaans news website.\n\nWe weren\u2019t able to track down the other photographs, and while the news stories didn\u2019t identify the women as farmers, their photos, along with the others in the post, have appeared in collections of images that claim to show attacks on farmers in South Africa.\n\nNone of the photographs were identified as being from the United States or connected to members affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement outside of unsourced social media posts.", "lang": "en"}
