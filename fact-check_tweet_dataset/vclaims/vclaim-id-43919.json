In fact it\u2019s highly likely that more are, and a greater proportion of offenders are.\n\nMs Abbott is using figures that don\u2019t show the full extent of prison sentences that offenders will face.\n\nLabour put out a press release featuring figures from the Ministry of Justice showing that the actual number of people sentenced to prison fell from 8,050 in the year ending September 2018, to 7,728 in the same period in 2019.\n\nThese aren\u2019t figures for all crimes that involve a knife\u2014assaults and murders, for example, are counted separately and flagged as involving knives. The figures Labour is reporting cover possessing knives or offensive weapons (other dangerous weapons not including firearms) in public or threatening or endangering people in public.\n\nThat 7,728 figure is provisional\u2014it doesn\u2019t include offences which happened in that year but haven\u2019t finished going through the justice system. Many will take several months to reach the sentencing stage.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice estimates this number will eventually reach 8,384 offenders\u2014slightly higher than the 8,050 the previous year.\n\nSo it\u2019s misleading for Labour to compare the actual number of offenders going to prison in 2018 and 2019, because 2019 figures are incomplete and will end up being higher. Labour should be comparing the 2018 figure with the estimated number for 2019, which will show the truer trend.\n\nAs has been reported widely, the comparable estimates indicate that offenders are more likely to face prison, with 38% estimated to do so last year compared to 23% back in 2009. That rate has been growing year-on-year.\n\nSentencing policy on knife crime possession has become stricter over the last decade, with a number of laws, judgements and guidance issued making it more likely that offenders receive prison sentences for longer.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the increase in offences may partly reflect a greater use of stop and search powers unearthing knives people are carrying, rather than just more people carrying knives. We don\u2019t seek to comment in this piece on the wider question of whether the government\u2019s policies are having a \u201cpositive effect\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
