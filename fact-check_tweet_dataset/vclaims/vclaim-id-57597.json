The claim is false; the screenshot in fact shows a WHO document that categorised Thailand as \"level 4\" in terms of \"preparedness and response readiness\" for the novel coronavirus, COVID-19; the Thai government has its own classification system for domestic pandemics, the highest of which is \u201cphase 3\".\n\nThe screenshot was shared on Facebook here on March 18, 2020. The post has been shared more than 1,200 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe Thai-language caption translates to English as: \u201cThe United Nations has raised\u2026 \u2623#COVID19 Thailand to level 4 #Thailandhasntannounced #UNannounceditthemselves\u201d.\n\nThe post\u2019s hashtags suggest that the United Nations (UN), which established the WHO as a UN specialised agency, that increased Thailand\u2019s pandemic level during the coronavirus crisis.\n\nAs of March 30, Thailand had 1,524 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and nine deaths, the Thai Ministry of Public Health reported here.\n\nComments by some Facebook users on the misleading post indicated they believed Thailand's pandemic level had increased to a level higher than had been stated by the Thai government.\n\nTheir comments translate to English as \u201cYesterday who said we were in phase 2\u201d; \u201cAre you ashamed?\u201d; and \u201cLeader will lead us to pray\u201d.\n\nBelow are screenshots of some of the users\u2019 comments:\n\nThe screenshot and claim were also shared on Facebook here, here, and here; and on Twitter here, here, here and here.\n\nThe screenshot was taken from this WHO \u201cPreparedness and Response Status for Countries, Territories, and Areas\u201d report published on March 6, 2020.\n\nThe WHO said the agency\u2019s \"preparedness and response\" categories differ from a country's domestic pandemic classifications.\n\n\u201cThe WHO doesn\u2019t announce the pandemic stage. That is categorised by Thailand\u2019s Department of Disease Control, Ministry of health,\u201d WHO spokeswoman Kanpirom Wiboonpanich told AFP by phone on March 24, 2020.\n\nBelow is a comparison of the screenshot in the misleading posts (L) and the document from the WHO\u2019s website (R) with similarities circled by AFP:\n\nThe Thai Ministry of Public Health also said the government\u2019s highest stage of pandemic phases is a phase 3. So far, however, only certain parts of Thailand have been classified as phase 2 due to COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe are in pandemic phase 2 in some areas of Thailand,\u201d Dr. Tanarak Plipat, the ministry\u2019s Deputy Director-General of the Disease Control Department, told AFP by phone on March 26, 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair if we call the whole country phase 2, because there are some provinces that have not been detected positive for COVID-19 like Mae Hong Son,\u201d\n\nPlipat added that the government\u2019s \u201caim for classifying areas of Thailand into different pandemic stages is for us to know what actions we need to take in order to handle the situation.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
