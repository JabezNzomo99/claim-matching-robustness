We are now at a place where, on July Fourth, there were 254; that\u2019s a tenfold decrease in mortality.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you start to look at the stats and look at all the numbers that we have, the amount of testing that we have, the vast majority of people are safe from this,\u201d White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told \u201cFox and Friends\u201d on July 6. \u201cWhen you look at the deaths that we have, if you\u2019re over 80 years of age or if you have three, what they call co-morbidities \u2014 diabetes, hypertension, heart issues \u2014 then you need to be very, very careful. Outside of that, the risks are extremely low and the president\u2019s right with that, and the facts and the statistics back us up there.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration bungled testing at the onset of the pandemic, allowing the coronavirus to spread silently through the United States. In recent months, testing has greatly expanded, though the United States still lags behind several other large nations, such as the United Kingdom and Spain, in testing per capita \u2014 which is a much better metric than raw numbers of tests, given the size of the United States.\n\nOr, as Trump tweeted on July 2: \u201cThere is a rise in Coronavirus cases because our testing is so massive and so good, far bigger and better than any other country. This is great news, but even better news is that death, and the death rate, is DOWN.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no question that the more testing you get, the more you will uncover, but we do believe this is a real increase in cases because of the percent positivities are going up. So this is real increases in cases,\u201d Adm. Brett Giroir, the Department of Health and Human Services official overseeing the nation\u2019s coronavirus testing efforts, told Congress on July 2.\n\nExperience so far is that younger people are less likely than older people to die of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. That\u2019s a possible explanation for why the death rate has not yet spiked to the levels seen earlier in the pandemic, when the virus spread through nursing homes, leading to many deaths. If many of the new cases are younger people, then it follows that fewer deaths would result.\n\nThe big unknown is how many cases are undetected, as many people who contract the coronavirus do not show symptoms. The CDC has tested blood samples in six states to check for coronavirus antibodies, and results suggest anywhere from six to 24 times more cases than detected. But as we have noted before, there is also evidence that the official death count is much too low. So without precise numbers, it\u2019s difficult to make even a rough calculation.\n\nThe World Health Organization in March said that \u201cfor covid-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation.\u201d A review of 21 reports in April indicated that as few as 5 percent and as many as 80 percent are asymptomatic. Neither of those figures comes close to 99 percent.", "lang": "en"}
