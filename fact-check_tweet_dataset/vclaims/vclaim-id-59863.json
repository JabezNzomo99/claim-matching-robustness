When the COVID-19 pandemic initially began surging in the U.S. in March 2020, Trump wanted payroll tax cuts in the first round of economic relief too.\n\nExperts have said such a tax cut would cripple the funding source for retirement benefits older Americans rely on. Quoting Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, Reuters reported in March 2020 that it would have \u201c\u2018blown a trillion-dollar hole\u2019 in the trust funds that pay Social Security benefits for retirees and help fund the Medicare healthcare program for Americans over age 65.\u201d\n\nBut Trump has since backed down from his most recent vow to veto relief after support for the payroll tax cut floundered among both Democratic and Republican lawmakers. The Associated Press reported on July 23, 2020, \u201cTrump yielded to opposition to the payroll tax cut among his top Senate allies, claiming in a Twitter post that Democratic opposition was the reason. In fact, top Senate Republicans disliked the expensive idea in addition to opposition from Democrats for the cut in taxes that finance Social Security and Medicare.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
