The fine was later overturned.\n\nOn Sept. 22, 2019, New Orleans Saints linebacker Demario Davis wore a headband bearing the words \u201cMan of God\u201d during a game against the Seattle Seahawks. The National Football League (NFL) ended up fining Davis $7,017 because his wearing of the headband violated the league\u2019s dress code policy, as reported by The Washington Post:\n\nIt\u2019s undeniable that Davis\u2019 was fined after he wore a \u201cMan of God\u201d headband during an NFL game, but some people spread news of Davis\u2019 fine as if it documented that the league held an anti-Christian bias and/or that the penalty was predicated purely upon the \u201cMan of God\u201d message.\n\nConservative commentator Todd Starnes, for example, suggested that the phrase \u201cMan of God\u201d (or religious expression in general) was a \u201cbig no-no\u201d in the NFL:\n\nThe NFL has a famously strict dress code policy that has led to the levying of some unpopular fines over the years. In 2015, two players were fined for honoring their late mothers by wearing pink and purple items (to represent causes related to domestic abuse and breast cancer) with their uniforms. In 2013, a Detroit Lions player was fined for wearing blue and black socks instead of the league-approved blue and white socks. And a few weeks after Demario Davis was fined in September 2019, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was similarly fined for wearing an Apple Watch on the sidelines.\n\nThe aforementioned fines were not levied by the NFL because the league has something against charity, blue and black socks, or smartwatches. These fines were handed out because the players violated a provision of the league\u2019s five-page-long dress code policy. Here\u2019s the \u201cpersonal message\u201d portion of the NFL\u2019s dress code policy that relates to Davis\u2019 fine (emphasis ours):\n\nThroughout the period on game-day that a player is visible to the stadium and television audience (including in pregame warm-ups, in the bench area, and during postgame interviews in the locker room or on the field), players are prohibited from wearing, displaying, or otherwise conveying personal messages either in writing or illustration, unless such message has been approved in advance by the League office. Items to celebrate anniversaries or memorable events, or to honor or commemorate individuals, such as helmet decals, and arm bands and jersey patches on players\u2019 uniforms, are prohibited unless approved in advance by the League office. All such items must relate to team or League events or personages. The League will not grant permission for any club or player to wear, display, or otherwise convey messages, through helmet decals, arm bands, jersey patches, or other items affixed to game uniforms or equipment, which relate to political activities or causes, other non-football events, causes or campaigns, or charitable causes or campaigns. Further, such armbands and jersey patches must be modest in size, tasteful, noncommercial, and non-controversial; must not be worn for more than one football season; and if approved for use by a specific team, must not be worn by players on other teams in the League.\n\nDavis was fined for displaying an unapproved personal message, regardless of its content. A player\u2019s wearing a headband bearing the words \u201cHail Satan,\u201d \u201cAvengers Endgame Was a Bad Movie,\u201d or \u201cTrump 2020\u201d would have, theoretically, resulted in the same penalty.\n\nIt should also be noted that fines collected for dress code violations don\u2019t go to the NFL, but to two charities that support former players. The NFL also started the \u201cMy Cause, My Cleats\u201d campaign in 2017, which allowed players to wear personalized cleats in support of a charity during one week of the NFL season.\n\nDemario Davis is selling \u201cMan of God\u201d and \u201cWoman of God\u201d headbands to raise money for St. Dominic\u2019s Hospital:\n\nDavis appealed the fine and on October 9, 2019 he announced that the NFL had reversed their decision:\n\nThe New Orleans Saints\u2019 starting weak-side linebacker fielded a message from his agent, telling him that he wouldn\u2019t have to pay the $7,014 fine stemming from the \u201cMan of God\u201d headband he wore during the Seattle Seahawks game. Davis and his team cited several reasons for their appeal. Davis said he didn\u2019t know the headband was a fine-worthy offense. He also argued that the headband wasn\u2019t offensive and that he wouldn\u2019t wear the headband during a game again.", "lang": "en"}
