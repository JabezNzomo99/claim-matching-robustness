He had been reporting about the deaths of Russian mercenaries from his region in Syria. The Kremlin has systematically denied that Russian mercenaries have fought in Syria.\n\nBorodin\u2019s reports from the funerals of Russians killed fighting in Syria while employed by the shadow military group Wagner, and interviews with their relatives, contradicted the official narrative.\n\nPolygraph.info published audio recordings of Wagner servicemen admitting massive losses at the hands of U.S. troops whom the Russian mercenaries had knowingly attacked. We also revealed ties between Wagner and the Kremlin.\n\nBorodin\u2019s news agency, Novy Den (New Day), announced that he died on April 15 after sustaining lethal injuries from falling from the balcony or window of his fifth-story apartment on April 12.\n\nThere were no witness interviews to confirm or deny the official version that he had \u201cfallen from the balcony/window.\u201d The only press reports on the incident said the journalist was found by neighbors lying unconscious on the street near his apartment building.\n\nNovy Den chief editor Polina Rumyantseva initially said that the circumstances of the incident were \u201cunclear\u201d but that \u201ca crime\u201d could not be ruled out.\n\nShe later appeared to backtrack, saying that Borodin \u201capparently fell from the balcony while smoking\u201d and ruling out the possibility of suicide. \u201cWe spoke a week before the incident,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was supposed to be moving to Moscow and working for our agency there, he had built grandiose plans.\u201d\n\nRumyantseva \u201ccategorically rejected the allegations that Borodin\u2019s death was connected to his reporting,\u201d and other colleagues and friends downplayed the significance of his reporting about Wagner.\n\nNot everybody supports the official narrative.\n\nLocal activist Vyacheslav Bashkov said in a Facebook post that Borodin called him on April 11, the day before he was found, saying he urgently needed to find a lawyer because masked, armed men were on his balcony and in the stairwell and preparing to raid his apartment. Bashkov said that Borodin called again later that day and said he that he had made a mistake, and what he had seen was probably a security exercise.\n\n\u201cRussian authorities must conduct a thorough investigation into the death of journalist Maksim Borodin and consider the possibility that he was killed in retribution for his reporting,\u201d the Committee to Protect Journalists said on April 16.\n\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Representative on Freedom of the Media, Harlem D\u00e9sir, called on the authorities \u201cto carry out a full, transparent and independent investigation into the circumstances of the death of Maksim Borodin.\u201d\n\n\u200bFalling out a window is not an uncommon cause of death for public figures in Russia. Some of the most suspicious cases include:\n\nAlexey Stroganov, a prominent member of Solidarity, a Russian opposition party, died in October 2017 after falling out of a window at the second floor of his apartment building. His death was ruled accidental and no criminal investigation was launched.\n\nVadim Godlevsky, a magazine publisher, died in December 2017 after falling from a window on the 14th floor of his luxury apartment building in Moscow. Investigators concluded that his death was a suicide.\n\nA Russian Interior Ministry general, Boris Kolesnikov, died in June 2014 after falling off of a balcony on the sixth floor of the State Investigative Committee building in Moscow. Kolesnikov had been arrested in February of that year on corruption charges, and was brought to the State Investigative Committee building from a detention cell for questioning in the case against him. His death was ruled a suicide.\n\nAn unnamed criminal suspect of Central Asian origin died in March 2016 after falling from a window on the fifth floor of the Center for Countering Extremism in Moscow during questioning. His death was ruled a suicide.\n\nIgor Vakhnenko, a businessman, died in September 2008 after falling from a window on the fifth floor of the building of the local branch of the Interior Ministry\u2019s Department for Combating Economic Crimes (UBEP) in the city of Tomsk. An investigation found Vakhnenko had been thrown out of the window by the local UBEP head and his deputy, and ruled the death a murder.\n\nIvan Safronov, an investigative reporter with Kommersant newspaper, died in March 2007 after falling from a window in the third floor staircase of his apartment building. Investigators ruled his death a suicide.\n\n\u201cThrowing themselves of the windows of investigative offices and dying is a more common thing in Russia than you can imagine,\u201d Russian investigative journalist Orkhan Jemal said, with a note of sarcasm. \u201cWe have had cases in which suspects managed to jump out of completely sealed, barred windows, and even cases in which the suspects suffered multiple lethal injuries from falling out of first floor windows.\u201d\n\nJemal asserts that \u201cwindow deaths\u201d are one of the common \u201cmethods\u201d police and secret services in Russia use to cover up deaths from torture, or to get rid of unwanted witnesses.", "lang": "en"}
