This is a composite image of at least two separate photographs.\n\nThe image of the shark was taken from a photograph by David Jenkins for the Cater News Agency in 2013. The original photograph came from a series of images documenting a great white shark\u2019s attempt to catch a seal off the coast of South Africa. The image of the shark was then inserted into a second, unrelated photograph of a person parasailing.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the original photograph (left) and the doctored image (right):\n\nJenkins\u2019 photographs received some media attention when they were first published in 2013. One of the images was even featured on the cover of Time magazine\u2019s \u201cThe Year in Pictures\u201d issue.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the Time magazine cover and an excerpt from a CNN report about the photographs:\n\nWildlife photographer David \u201cBaz\u201d Jenkins seems to have a knack for photographing great white sharks. His website is filled with pictures of the fearsome predators leaping from the sea and devouring seals. But a photo Jenkins took during a July shark-watching cruise in South Africa is garnering the Irish photographer so much attention that his website was having trouble keeping up Wednesday after numerous media outlets published his shots. One photo shows a seal seemingly balanced on the tip of the rising shark\u2019s mouth, moments away from becoming a meal. Later photos in the series show the seal twisting away and escaping as the giant shark\u2019s jaws snap shut.\n\nNo parasailers (or apparently seals) were harmed in the making of this photograph.", "lang": "en"}
