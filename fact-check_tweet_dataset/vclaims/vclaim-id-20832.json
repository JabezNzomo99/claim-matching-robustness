Trump called Trudeau \u201cmeek and mild\u201d and referenced \u201cfalse statements\u201d following a 9 June 2018 press conference during which Trudeau said Canadians are polite and reasonable, but refuse to be \u201cpushed around\u201d:\n\nThe conversation appears in the United States Department of State Office of the Historian\u2019s Historical Documents from 1969-1976; transcripts of recordings from the Nixon White House were released incrementally through 2013.\n\nA transcript of a 19 May 1971 discussion about defense and diplomacy between Nixon, Defense Secretary Melvin Laird, and Assistant for National Security Affairs Henry Kissinger included an exchange referencing Pierre Trudeau. Earlier in the conversation, Nixon said:\n\n[USSR President Leonid] Brezhnev is clever, clever. [Soviet statesman Alexei] Kosygin [unclear] the other side [unclear]. You go first, boys, the hell with their issues, it would be very different. We can get some sort of agreement at some time with the Soviet, Warsaw Pact, but only on the basis of, well, we both have our forces and we intend to continue them until we get an agreement. You\u2019re not going to do it by either side going first with some half-assed, either unilateral action or some jackass statement. Either one, right? we\u2019ve got to control the game, in other words. That\u2019s what it really gets down to. The Soviet will control their game, that\u2019s for sure.\n\nNixon, Kissinger, and Laird continued discussing Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and European positions on force reduction negotiations. The conversation turned to a separate May 1971 discussion between the United States\u2019 Ambassador to Czechoslovakia Jacob Beam and Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrei Gromyko. In that portion of the exchange between Nixon, Laird, and Kissinger, Nixon referenced a statement involving Kosygin and Trudeau in 1971:\n\nNixon: \u2014No, no. I am talking about after the announcement on SALT tomorrow.\n\n Kissinger: Oh.\n\n Nixon: Now anything is possible with the Russians, get my point?\n\n Kissinger: The Russians, I don\u2019t read the Gromyko thing as if they\u2019re ready to negotiate.\n\n Nixon: The Kosygin?\n\n Kissinger: The Gromyko\u2013Beam conversation.\n\n Nixon: Well\u2014\n\n Kissinger: So, let, all they\u2019re left at is let\u2019s both review our positions.\n\n Nixon: Well, Kosygin made some statement with\u2014\n\n Kissinger: \u2014Well\u2014\n\n Nixon: \u2014that asshole Trudeau.\n\nWhen that particular transcript or recording was made public wasn\u2019t clear, but Pierre Trudeau referenced Nixon\u2019s comments in his 1993 book Memoirs.
