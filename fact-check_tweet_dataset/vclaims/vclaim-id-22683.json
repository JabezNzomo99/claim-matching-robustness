Namely, some of the commenters on a May 14 Facebook post highlight the Dancing Queen series on the streaming service.\n\n\"Netflix calls this s---; entertainment!\" reads the oddly punctuated post above a photo of child dancers and drag queen Alyssa Edwards. \"New Netflix show to make little boys into \u2018sexy\u2019 little girls!\"\n\n\"If this is true we are cancelling!!!\" one commenter said.\n\n\"The OBAMAS,\" another explained. \"ENOUGH SAID.\"\n\nThis post, which had been shared more than 1,500 times as of May 16, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nBut the poster included a link to back up the claim: the Netflix page for the show.\n\n\"Snatching trophies. Getting gorgeous. Turning it up,\" the show description says. \"Alyssa Edwards rules the dance studio by day \u2014 and the drag world by night.\"\n\nThe series is produced by RuPaul, and it\u2019s not exactly \"new.\" It debuted in October 2018 \u2014 about five months after Barack Obama announced his Netflix production deal. And while the reality show stars a drag queen, the children in it \u2014 both boys and girls \u2014 are students at the Beyond Belief Dance Company. The photo in the Facebook post is a promo for the show, but, if you watch the show, you know that most of the children in the shot are girls, not boys in drag.\n\nJustin Dwayne Lee Johnson is the owner of the dance company and a popular contestant on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race where his alter-ego, Alyssa Edwards, first became famous. Before that, the parents of his students didn\u2019t know their children\u2019s teacher was a gay man who does drag.\n\nThe Dancing Queen reality show followed and, as Vanity Fair recalled in this October 2018 article, the first two episodes show Johnson officiating a wedding of friends in full Alyssa Edwards drag, him buying his first home, and him visiting his childhood home in Mesquite, Texas. The series also has plenty of drama, sniping among the dance moms (think pageant moms) and dancing as the children practice and perform in competitions.\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!\n\nCorrection: This story was updated to reflect that Barack Obama announced his Netflix production deal about five months before Dancing Queen debuted. This story previously said that the show debuted seven months before the deal was announced.", "lang": "en"}
