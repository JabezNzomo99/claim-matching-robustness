But where in the state are property taxes highest?\n\n\"Western New Yorkers pay some of the highest property taxes in the state,\" Walter said in a recent press release about Republican efforts to replace Obamacare. He supports a part of a congressional bill designed to reduce property taxes in New York state by shifting Medicaid costs from counties to the state.\n\nWalter said he was talking about property taxes as a percent of home value in Western New York. He defines the region as the eight counties west of the Finger Lakes: Erie, Niagara, Chautauqua, Allegany, Cattaraugus, Orleans, Wyoming and Genesee counties.\n\n\"It\u2019s off the charts as a percentage of home value,\" Walter told PolitiFact New York. \"In real dollars it\u2019s not as high just because our home values are not as high as other places in the state.\"\n\nIs Walter right that Western New York has some of the highest property taxes in the state?\n\nU.S. Census Bureau data shows how property taxes compared with home values in each county in 2015, the latest figures.\n\nIt\u2019s a better apples-to-apples comparison because some counties have higher home values but similar property tax bills. The home value in Brooklyn is more than triple that of Sullivan County, for example, but the property tax bills are within a few hundred dollars of each other.\n\nAll eight counties in Western New York rank among the 18 highest counties in the state for property taxes as a percent of home value.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 Orleans County ranks first out of the state\u2019s 62 counties. Its median property tax of $3,055 is 3.35 percent of its $91,300 median home value.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 Allegany County ranks second. The $2,320 median property tax bill is 3.3 percent of the $70,300 median home value.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 Erie County ranks lowest in the region, but 18th highest in the state. Its median property tax bill is $3,499, which is 2.69 percent of its median home value of $130,000.\n\nThe data is only reported for owner-occupied housing units. It does not include property taxes on businesses or rented units.\n\nThe ten counties with the highest median property tax in dollar amounts are in New York City, the lower Hudson Valley and on Long Island. Western New York counties are lower in this category. Four of them rank in the bottom half.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 Erie County has the highest property tax in the region. The county ranks 21st in the state.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 Niagara County, where the median property tax bill is $3,255, is second highest in the region but 26th in the state.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 Allegany County has the lowest median property tax in dollars in Western New York. Only five other counties in the state are lower.\n\nThree counties tie for highest property taxes in the state \u2014 and the country. Nassau, Rockland, and Westchester counties each have median property tax bills that exceed $10,000. That\u2019s the highest amount in the country as well.\n\nThe Census Bureau does not report exact dollar amounts when the median tax exceeds $10,000.\n\nProperty taxes can also be measured as a share of median household income.\n\nThe eight counties in Western New York rank in the middle in this category.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 Wyoming County, where the tax bill is $2,871, is lowest in the region. Residents spend 5.29 percent of the median income of $52,564 on property taxes. Fifteen counties have lower property tax bills as a percent of median resident income.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 Erie County is again highest in the region. Residents there pay 6.83 percent of the median income of $51,247 toward property taxes. Twenty-one counties are higher.\n\nNassau, Rockland, and Westchester counties tie for first in this category. At least ten percent of the median income in each is spent on property taxes.\n\nWalter said \"Western New Yorkers pay some of the highest property taxes in the state.\"\n\nHis statement might come as a surprise to homeowners on Long Island and other counties near New York City, where median property tax bills exceed $10,000. To them, Erie County's median property tax bill of $3,499 doesn't look too high.\n\nSo, no, Western New Yorkers do not pay some of the highest property taxes in the state.\n\nBut Western New Yorkers shoulder a heavier burden paying the property tax.\n\nWalter said he was talking about property taxes as a percent of home value. And in that sense, he\u2019s right about the tax. Two Western New York counties lead the state in this category and all eight counties in the region are among the top third.", "lang": "en"}
