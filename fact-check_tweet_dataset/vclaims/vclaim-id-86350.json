But he did not specifically mention the travel restrictions on China.\n\nGupta: \u201cI mean, you know, these are all models, Wolf. It\u2019s a little tough to say, but, you know, if you talk about something that is spreading, you know, very robustly throughout a community. You know, two to three times more contagious than flu, and up to 10 times, perhaps even more than that, more deadly than flu, then yes.\u201d\n\nBut the death estimate he referred to concerned a model that estimated what would happen if Americans ignored the virus and continued to go to work, meet at conferences, attend movies and eat in restaurants. It was issued on March 16, weeks after the travel restrictions were in place. On March 29, the day before this CNN exchange, Trump referenced a study showing the United States could see up to 2.2 million deaths from the coronavirus if there were no mitigation measures.\n\nThe best that could be said about the travel restrictions is that they could have been used to buy time \u2014 but the administration then bungled efforts to rapidly build up testing in the month of February. The New York Times calculated that at least 430,000 people arrived in the United States on direct flights from China since Jan. 1, including nearly 40,000 in the two months after Trump imposed restrictions. Moreover, screening proceedings of travelers from China were uneven and inconsistent, the Times said.\n\nThis is a favorite Trump line, but it\u2019s not true. We\u2019ve fact-checked it dozens of times. Trump inherited a rising economy from Barack Obama, and most of the trend lines under Trump continued at the same rate \u2014 at least until the coronavirus struck. By most measures, the pre-coronavirus economy was not as good as the 1950s, 1960s and 1990s in the United States. Some key sectors, such as manufacturing, were already under stress even before the virus tanked the economy.\n\nCuomo went on to praise just about everyone for the outcome: \u201cThe federal government stepped up and was a great partner, and I\u2019m the first one to say it. We needed help and they were there. State and local governments were fantastic. The hospital system was fantastic. New Yorkers were fantastic. And that is an undeniable fact.\u201d\n\nCampaigns must be willing to make their case without resorting to video manipulation. The editing of the CNN interview is so deceptive \u2014 complete with images to suggest Blitzer and Gupta were discussing restrictions on travel from China \u2014 that it is little wonder CNN filed a complaint. The Trump campaign is quick to cry foul when the Biden team makes misleading edits, but this is especially dismaying. Some of the other edits in the video are not in the same league but leave out useful or interesting context.", "lang": "en"}
