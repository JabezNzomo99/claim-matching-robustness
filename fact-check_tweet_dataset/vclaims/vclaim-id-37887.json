Parnas would have been 18 at the time, whereas the man in the photo looks much older.\n\nA viral image showing a birthday party for young Eric Trump has been circulating on Twitter and Facebook over the past week. It identified the man standing next to President Donald Trump in the photo as Parnas, a former associate of the president\u2019s personal lawyer who was indicted on campaign finance charges.\n\n\u201cHere is a photo of Lev Parnas who I have never met celebrating Eric\u2019s birthday party 25 years ago,\u201d claims the post. \u201c25 YEARS I HAVEN\u2019T KNOWN THIS MAN!\u201d\n\nTaken in 1990, the photo shows Eric Trump\u2019s sixth birthday party at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, per its caption. Ivana Trump, the mother of Eric Trump and the first wife of Donald Trump, shared the family photo with ABC News in October 2017 while promoting her book \u201cRaising Trump.\u201d\n\nParnas, born in 1972, would have been 18 years old in 1990. The man in the photo appears to be visibly older than that.

Trump denied knowing Parnas in a Jan. 16 press conference, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know who this man is.\u201d\n\nHowever, Parnas has been photographed with the president, his family members and Vice President Mike Pence.
