Do not re-use a disposable mask and always change it as soon as it gets damp.\"\n\nCarbon dioxide molecules are tiny - far smaller than droplets containing coronavirus which the masks are designed to stop - and won't be trapped by a breathable material, particularly during relatively short periods like a bus journey.\n\nWhen you breathe out, the carbon dioxide will go through and round the type of masks most commonly worn, and is unlikely to build up to the extent that it causes health issues.\n\nHe claims: \"It's not healthy to breathe in your own CO2 all the time\", but as we've explained there's no evidence that wearing a face covering causes this.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) says face coverings should be worn to provide \"a barrier for potentially infectious droplets\" in areas where \"physical distancing of at least one metre is not possible\".\n\nIt's worth pointing out that there are some situations in which face masks might not be advised:", "lang": "en"}
