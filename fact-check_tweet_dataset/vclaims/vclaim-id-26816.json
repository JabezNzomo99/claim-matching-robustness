Proponents of the latter viewpoint often cited a purported quote from John Lennon himself in which Lennon supposedly scoffed at the notion of Ringo as the best drummer of all time, quipping: \u201cThe best drummer in the world? Ringo wasn\u2019t even the best drummer in the Beatles!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely Lennon would ever have said such a thing and meant it seriously, as he \u2014 along with the other Beatles \u2014 typically spoke fondly and positively of Ringo, both as a person and as a drummer. In the famous Playboy interview conducted just a few months before his murder in 1980, for example, Lennon responded as follows when asked for his opinion of Ringo\u2019s musicianship:\n\nPLAYBOY: \u201cLet\u2019s move on to Ringo. What\u2019s your opinion of him musically?\u201d LENNON: \u201cRingo was a star in his own right in Liverpool before we even met. He was a professional drummer who sang and performed and had Ringo Starr-time, and he was in one of the top groups in Britain but especially in Liverpool before we even had a drummer. So Ringo\u2019s talent would have come out one way or the other as something or other. I don\u2019t know what he would have ended up as, but whatever that spark is in Ringo that we all know but can\u2019t put our finger on \u2026 whether it is acting, drumming or singing, I don\u2019t know \u2026 there is something in him that is projectable and he would have surfaced with or without the Beatles. Ringo is a damn good drummer. He is not technically good, but I think Ringo\u2019s drumming is underrated the same way Paul\u2019s bass playing is underrated \u2026 I think Paul and Ringo stand up with any of the rock musicians.\n\nThose who have tried to run the alleged criticism of Lennon\u2019s to ground have found it to be sourceless, something that has not turned up in any known audio recording, interview transcript, or primary reporting on Lennon and the Beatles, as renowned Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn noted in an interview with the Los Angeles Times:\n\nAs part of his in-depth research, Lewisohn also has debunked a humorous knock on Starr\u2019s drumming abilities, long attributed to John Lennon. For decades, people and media outlets have repeated the anecdote about Lennon being asked whether he considered Starr to be the best drummer in the world. The oft-quoted response: \u201cHe\u2019s not even the best drummer in the Beatles.\u201d While it sounds like the kind of acerbic comment that might have come out of Lennon\u2019s mouth, Lewisohn says no. \u201cThe London Times newspaper quoted John Lennon \u2018famously saying that Ringo wasn\u2019t even the best drummer in the Beatles.\u2019 John Lennon never said that, famously or otherwise, and that is the London Times quoting him,\u201d Lewisohn said, making a point about his motivation for trying to separate fact from Fab Four mythology. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s [a case of tracking down] when did he say this? I\u2019ve heard every John Lennon interview, I\u2019ve read every John Lennon interview, I never saw that quote. So when did he say it, let alone when did he famously say it?\u201d he said. \u201cI determined to get to the bottom of it \u2026 John Lennon never said it \u2014 and wouldn\u2019t have said it.\u201d\n\nThose who have sought the true origins of this quip have commonly attributed it to a 1983 television appearance by British comedian Jasper Carrott. Although Carrott may have employed the gag (or something like it) back in 1983, a more recent discovery has traced the earliest known source to a joke used in a 1981 British radio comedy show:\n\nFurther scholarship may eventually uncover even earlier antecedents.", "lang": "en"}
