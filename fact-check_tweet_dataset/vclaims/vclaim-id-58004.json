Gravina Island has 50 people living on it. Critics seized on the project as a prime example of how the earmark process invites wasteful spending.\n\nThere was such a firestorm of criticsm that in November 2005 Congress removed the earmark requirement. Alaska still got the federal transportation money, but the state no longer was required to use it on the bridge.\n\nNonetheless, McCain continues to speak as if Congress still is requiring that the bridge be built. He says $223-million was \"spent\" on the bridge, but that's not true. The \"bridge to nowhere\" never was built.", "lang": "en"}
