The protests have sparked debates over whether monuments to Confederate generals and other historical figures should be removed. Protesters have vandalized and toppled some statues, and some local officials have taken them down.\n\nOn July 5, a statue of abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass in a Rochester, New York, park was torn from its base and left 50 feet away near the Genesee River gorge. Douglass had escaped slavery in Maryland and lived in Rochester for 25 years. The statue was toppled on the anniversary of a renowned speech \u2014 \u201cWhat to the Slave is the Fourth of July?\u201d \u2014 that Douglass delivered in 1852.\n\nOn July 6, Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son, shared a meme that makes the unsupported claim that \u201cDemocrats\u201d vandalized the Douglass statue.\n\nTrump Jr. posted the image on Facebook showing the empty base where the Douglass statue once stood, superimposed with a photo of Douglass and the text: \u201cREPUBLICAN FREDERICK DOUGLASS ESCAPED SLAVERY AND BECAME A LEADER IN THE ABOLITION MOVEMENT[.] DEMOCRATS JUST DESTROYED HIS MONUMENT\u2026 ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF HIS MOST FAMOUS SPEECH.\u201d\n\nThat same day, President Donald Trump weighed in on Twitter, saying: \u201cStatue of Frederick Douglass Torn Down in Rochester\u2026This shows that these anarchists have no bounds!\u201d\n\nThe Facebook meme has been shared thousands of times on Facebook, and a headline on the National File website claims \u201cBlack Lives Matter Rioters\u201d toppled the statue.\n\nBut there is no basis to support claims that \u201cDemocrats\u201d or \u201canarchists\u201d or \u201crioters\u201d tore down the Douglass statue.\n\nJacqueline Shuman, a Rochester police spokeswoman, told the New York Times on July 8 that the police department is \u201cstill looking into\u201d the vandalism. She said the police do not have any evidence to confirm the removal was related in some way to the date of Douglass\u2019s speech, and they don\u2019t know who vandalized it.\n\nCity police detectives asked for the public\u2019s help in identifying the vandals in a July 9 tweet.\n\nRochester officials did not return our calls and email requests for further comment on the investigation.\n\nThis is not the first time a Douglass statue in Rochester has been vandalized. The Rochester Democrat & Chronicle reported in December 2018 that two college students were suspended from school and criminally charged after they broke a different statue of Douglass from its base and tried to run off with it.\n\nWe will continue to follow this story and update any progress in the police department\u2019s investigation.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
