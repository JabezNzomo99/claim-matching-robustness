( here , here , here, here).\n\nThe Rhodes scholarship was established in 1902 through Rhodes's will, and covers the costs of a postgraduate degree at Oxford and other expenses ( here ).\n\nIn the letter, the author praises Rhodes\u2019 \u201cgenerous bequest\u201d that \u201chas contributed greatly to the comfort and well being of many generations of Oxford students\u201d.\n\nThe letter goes on to criticise black Rhodes scholars who have asked for the statue of Rhodes at Oriel, one of the colleges that make up Oxford University, to be removed.\n\n\u201cThis ludicrous notion you have that a bronze statue of Cecil Rhodes should be removed from Oriel College, because it\u2019s symbolic of \u2018institutional racism\u2019 and \u2018white slavery\u2019. Well even if it is - which we dispute - so bloody what?\u201d, one paragraph reads.\n\nThe letter is signed \u201cYours, Oriel College, Oxford\u201d and has been misinterpreted by some as an official response from the university.\n\n\u201cEloquent, and articulate! If only more universities were brave enough!\u201d one social media user commented. Another said: \u201cWell written, am really proud of Oxford for standing up and defending her principles.\u201d ( here ).\n\nThe letter was previously fact-checked by Snopes in 2016 after social media posts falsely claimed it was written by Oxford University\u2019s Chancellor Chris Patten ( here ).\n\nIt was in 2015 that Oxford first came under pressure from the Rhodes Must Fall campaign to remove the statue ( here ).\n\nThe letter has come back into circulation now that Oriel has announced it wants to take down the statue ( here ).\n\nThe letter was first published on the website of right-wing Breitbart News in late 2015 here .\n\nIt is presented in the article as \u201cthe letter that Oriel College should have written to the campaigners from Rhodes Must Fall\u201d.\n\nOxford University declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.\n\nFalse. The letter was not written by Oxford University, but first appeared on Breitbart in 2015.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
