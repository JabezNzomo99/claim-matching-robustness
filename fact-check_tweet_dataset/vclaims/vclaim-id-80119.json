The issue has got international media coverage. on August 17, 2018, The New York Times posted a video titled, \u201cFloods in Kerala, India, Kill Hundreds\u201d on its official Facebook page.\n\nAt 0:25, the same visuals are seen inscribed with the text, \u201cThe flooding has triggered massive landslides and displaced more than 220,000 people\u201d. It may be noted that only this single visual is subjected to question.\n\nKhaleej Times, an English daily from United Arab Emirates(UAE) has also uploaded a video titled, \u201cKerala floods: The story so far\u201d on August 18, 2018.

The former hasn\u2019t tweeted since March 19, 2018.\n\nOn Saturday, Karnataka Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy visited Kodagu(Coorg), one of the worst hit districts in the southern states. An article published by The Times of Indiaon August 19, 2018, quoted a statement from the CM, \u201cAt least 1,500 people are stranded in various parts of the district, but the rescue officials have not been able to reach them due to bad weather and landslides. Efforts are being made to rescue them.\u201d The incident of two storey house sliding down a slope due to a landslide is from Kodagu, Karnataka and not from Kerala.\n\nAn article published The News Minute on August 16, 2018 stated, \u201cThis scary video of the landslide in Kodagu shows how dangerous the situation in the district has turned.Luckily, no one was in the building at the time of the incident. Officials with the district administration said that people left their homes and headed to the hilltop when the rains lashed the villages.\u201d\n\nMultiple mainstream media outlets including Scroll, The Times of India and NDTV have also attributed the location of the video to Kodagu, Karnataka.\n\nAlt News also found one more video of the same incident from a different angle posted on Facebook where people are conversing in Kannada.\n\nRecently, visuals from Bankura, West Bengal were passed off as Kerala by Times Now. Multiple media organisations across the world have extensively covered the flooding in Kerala but in the process, lack of due diligence was observed as in this instance where an unrepresentative visual was used to portray the devastation.", "lang": "en"}
