No, that's not true: The U.S. House has passed a sweeping coronavirus response package, but the U.S. Senate has not yet taken it up - so, no stimulus package has been officially announced. It is unclear whether the package would give each American a stimulus check, though such ideas are on the table.\n\nThe claim originated on a post (archived here) published on Facebook by Devona Jayva Miller-Adair on March 15, 2020. It opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this:\n\nThe post is not accurate, though U.S. lawmakers may agree on a second response package as early as this week.\n\nEarlier this month, Congress passed an $8.3 billion coronavirus response package, and President Trump signed the bill.\n\nOn March 14, 2020, after reaching a deal with the White House, the U.S. House passed additional legislation to respond to the novel coronavirus outbreak. According to Politico, it would \"expand access to free testing, provide $1 billion in food aid and extend sick leave benefits to vulnerable Americans.\"\n\nThe bi-partisan vote passed 363-40, and President Trump has backed the measure.\n\nPolitico now reports that \"major differences\" remain between House Democrats and the White House. It said that Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin continue to work out the details. However, this could delay the bill's passage in the U.S. Senate.\n\nThere is increasing public pressure for Congress to act. The U.S. stock market has plunged, nearly wiping away all the gains made during the Trump administration, according to Forbes. Schools have been postponed, and sporting events have been canceled. Some communities have closed bars, gyms, and indoor dining at restaurants.\n\nThe novel coronavirus has killed at least 65 people in the United States, according to the Chicago Tribune. More than 3,800 infections have been recorded. The World Health Organization has classified the novel coronavirus as a pandemic, and President Trump has declared a national emergency.\n\nAccording to CNN, Republican Sen. Mitt Romney has suggested giving each American adult $1,000, to ensure economic stability. However, this is merely a proposal and has not been taken up by Congress.\n\nAmericans may receive a stimulus check at some point, as economic uncertainty continues to mount. However, the post is not true, as of this writing.", "lang": "en"}
