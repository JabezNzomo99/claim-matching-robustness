It also claims the vaccine \u201ckilled five people\u201d during human trials.\n\nThe post presents the supposed choice as \u201ca predicament\u201d.\n\nThe July 25 post has been viewed more than 87,200 times and shared more than 924 times.\n\nThis Facebook post misrepresents the Covid-19 recovery rate as being 99.9 per cent \u2013 it is not \u2013 and makes false and misleading claims about a vaccine that is not even available, including the unsubstantiated claim that people died during testing.\n\nWhile the post doesn\u2019t mention a specific vaccine, the original poster subsequently refers in comments to \u201cThe Moderna RNA\u201d vaccine, saying it has an \u201c80% adverse reaction rate\u201d and \u201chas killed 5 people so far in the trials\u201d.\n\nBiotech lab Moderna is working with the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) on a COVID-19 vaccine. The Moderna RNA vaccine is among more than 15 currently being trialled around the world. and is one of the few that has already begun its last stage of testing.\n\n Moderna reported in first phase trials of its mRNA-1273 vaccine , that \u201cno trial-limiting safety concerns were identified\u201d, as reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe U.S Department of Health and Human Services concluded that in terms of safety, there were no serious adverse events reported. Following the trial, Moderna said in a statement on July 14 that \u201cmRNA-1273 was generally safe and well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported\u201d over the eight-week period of the trial.\n\nThe statement noted that \u201csystemic adverse events\u201d \u2013 which relates to effects that occur away from the injection site \u2013 were more common after the second of two shots of the vaccine, which was administered to three groups at three different doses: 25micrograms (mcg), 100 mcg and 250mcg. It said the most common adverse reaction after the second shot for recipients of the 100mcg dose \u201cwere fatigue (80%), chills (80%), headache (60%) and myalgia (53%), all of which were transient and mild or moderate in severity.\u201d\n\nThe 80 percent for fatigue and chills appears to be where the Facebook post sourced its \u201c80%\u201d figure.\n\nHowever the suggestion that anyone could \u201cget the vaccine with its 80% adverse reaction rate\u201d is completely misleading. The percentage relates to results in some recipients in an early stage clinical trial of a vaccine. No vaccine has reached final production and no vaccine is available for anyone to \u201cget\u201d.\n\nThe phase three trial of the Moderna vaccine, involving up to 30,000 participants, only began on July 27 and is not due to be completed until October 27, 2020.\n\nProfessor of Respiratory Medicine at the University of NSW Guy Marks said the COVID-19 recovery rate presented in the Facebook post was \u201cabsolutely false.\u201d\n\nProfessor Marks said country-specific data on mortality rates from Sars COV-2 \u2013 the virus that causes COVID-19 \u2013 produced by the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center -shows the average mortality rate of all countries combined is roughly three \u2013 four per cent.\n\n\u201cAssuming everyone who doesn\u2019t die recovers, then the recovery rate can\u2019t be more than 96 or 97 per cent,\u201d Professor Marks told AAP FactCheck.\n\n\u201cBut the other part to this is there is increasing evidence some people who have had COVID have persistent symptoms and persisting abnormalities, and as yet we don\u2019t know how long that will last.\n\n\u201cFor many diseases there are long term consequences which mean that not having died is not the same as recovering.\u201d\n\nAAP FactCheck has previously examined claims that COVID-19 has a 99.9 per cent or higher \u201csurvival rate\u201d and also found them false.\n\nProfessor Marks said the claim about the vaccine adverse reaction rate of 80 per cent was false.\n\nThere are no vaccines for which 80 per cent of people get adverse effects that I am aware of in use,\u201d he said.\n\nThe only identified source of the claim that five people died from a vaccine trial is an unsubstantiated story that appears on a low-profile news website in the Lugansk People\u2019s Republic, a pro-Russian independent state in Ukraine.\n\nNews site Lugansk Media Centre published this article on July 17 claiming that five people, including four Ukranian Army members, died after being exposed to \u201cthe vaccine and medication produced by Americal (sic) virologists in the Kharkov region\u201d.\n\nThe story does not mention Moderna or provide details of the purported trial.\n\nThe Lugansk Media Centre website was established in 2014 and does not specify who is writing for it. There are no Ukraine-based trials listed among vaccine research currently taking place around the world.\n\n The Ukrainian English language newspaper Kyiv Post reported in June that \u201cUkraine currently isn\u2019t part of any vaccine projects, nor is it testing potential vaccines on humans\u201d.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the Facebook post to be false. It is incorrect to claim COVID-19 has a 99.9 per cent recovery rate as statistics do not back that claim. It is false to claim there is any vaccine available that has an 80 per cent adverse reaction rate and there is no reliable basis on which to claim five people have died during any COVID-19 vaccine trial.
