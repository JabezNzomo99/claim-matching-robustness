That particular episode was an exaggeration about a flu epidemic and did not name the virus - Coronavirus.\n\n\n\nCoronavirus is a family of viruses that create flu like symptoms and are found in both animals and humans. The Coronavirus family was first diagnosed in in the 60s. \n\n\n\nThe World Health Organization recently said it was calling the virus and the disease outbreak as COVID-19. The current COVID-19 is just one particular strain from the family.\n\nOver the past few days, several netizens have shared a series of snapshots from The Simpsons with the claim that the show had predicted the Coronavirus outbreak years ago. The Simpsons is an animated show that is a satirical take on middle class life and is set in the fictional town of Springfield. \n\n\n\nTwitter users also shared snippets from the French comic Asterix suggesting that the authors knew about the existence of Coronavirus and had also predicted an outbreak.\n\nMany Twitter users also mentioned that the character Coronavirus is defeated in the end thus predicting how the world will tackle the current COVID-19 outbreak. \n\n\n\nAlso Read: Did Dettol Know About Coronavirus Outbreak Beforehand?

The much debated episode and clip is from 1993 which was the show's fourth season. This episode discusses a virus called 'Osaka Flu' from Japan and not the Coronavirus in China.\n\nIn the episode, titled 'Marge in Chains', aired in May 1993 shows that most of Springfield's residents have purchased 'Juice looseners' from the mall which are shipped from Osaka, Japan. One of the packagers has the flu and transmits his germs in the package meant for Homer Simpson. The looseners spread the Osaka flu in Springfield.\n\nIn a 4:21 second clip of the episode, at 1:14 seconds, the Springfield news anchor Kent Brockman is shown to discuss the spread of a hypothetical cat flu that could hit Springfield. Simultaneously, at 2:35 seconds, Brockman is discussing the Osaka flu that has spread through the Juice looseners.\n\nThe claim seemed convincing to many as real life has sometimes mirrored the show's bizarre plotlines. In the year 2000, the show had an episode where Donald Trump was the president of the United States, 16 years before Trump took office.\n\nAsterix is a comic book series about the adventures of Gaulish warriors in the Roman Empire during the era of Julius Caesar, was published first in 1959.\n\nThe current illustration written by Thibaut Deleaz was featured in the comic's 37th edition in 2017 showing a masked crusader called Coronavirus and his partner Bacillus (Latin for bacteria.
