But the journalistic movement is increasingly under attack.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-06-25T07:00:25Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-86089", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/06/25/rapidly-expanding-fact-checking-movement-faces-growing-pains/", "vclaim": "\u201cA dark cloud hangs over us,\u201d said Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), the umbrella organization that organized the meeting, when he opened the three-day conference on June 20. \u201cThe disaffection and distrust that have plagued mainstream media outlets for many years is now spilling over to fact-checkers. In Turkey, the Philippines and especially Brazil it broke out in the form of concerted campaigns aimed to vilify fact-checking as an instrument.\u201d\n\nA meeting of fact-checkers in Buenos Aires two years ago resulted in the creation of a code of principles for the movement, which laid out guidelines on a commitment to political neutrality, transparency on sourcing and funding and robust correction policies. The code gained new importance after Facebook decided it would only enlist fact-checkers who are annually assessed to be in compliance with the code. A European Commission report in April on misinformation highlighted the IFCN code as a model that should be followed. \u201cA dense network of strong and independent fact-checkers is an essential requirement for a healthy digital ecosystem,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cFact-checkers are no longer the fresh-faced journalistic reform movement pushed forward by the tail winds of positive expectations,\u201d Mantzarlis warned. \u201cWe are wrinkly arbiters of a take-no-prisoners war for the future of the Internet. And yet I think that in too many ways we still behave like in those early days when we were an experiment \u2014 when our good qualities were refreshing and our bad ones part of the learning curve.\u201d\n\nOne persistent compliant is that fact-checkers suffer from \u201cselection bias,\u201d in that they decide what to fact-check. The problem has become particularly acute for U.S. fact-checkers in the era of a president persistently tweeting and speaking falsehoods \u2014 and Republican domination of Congress. The result is that the percentage of fact checks of Democrats has fallen since the end of the Barack Obama presidency, creating an imbalance that some readers \u2014 and fact-checkers \u2014 find troubling.\n\nThe fact-checkers at Liberation newspaper in France \u2014 which is considered left-leaning \u2014decided to confront charges of selection bias by overhauling their format and rebranding the product as CheckNews.fr. The revamped organization now only answers queries posed by readers \u2014 and all of the questions, even the unanswered ones, will be made public in a searchable database.\n\nPauline Moullot of CheckNews joked that it is \u201cthe slowest search engine in the world,\u201d with one question taking six months to answer. But the format has proved such a hit that CheckNews is now working with the IFCN to take the concept worldwide and build a global database of fact checks. Already, it has been used during the recent elections in Tunisia.\n\nMevan Babakar, head of automated fact-checking at Full Fact, demonstrated to the conference an impressive tool that, via voice recognition, creates automated fact checks from data on the U.K.\u2019s Office for National Statistics. Speaking into a microphone, Babakar said \u201cunemployment was going down\u201d and the tool instantly created a chart on the British unemployment rate. The hope is that the tool would allow reporters to quickly challenge politicians who may make a false claim during an interview or news conference.\n\nFacebook product manager Tessa Lyons told attendees that the company has learned from its association with fact-checkers and is making improvements to reduce the amount of fake news spread through the social network. For instance, the company is using machine learning to detect duplicate fake news articles that have been debunked \u2014 and it will soon use machine learning to predict pages that are more likely to share misinformation. In four countries \u2014 France, Ireland, Mexico and India \u2014 Facebook also has expanded a test that allows fact-checkers to debunk manipulated and out-of-context photos and videos.\n\nBut in many countries, a bigger problem is the spread of hoaxes on WhatsApp, an encrypted instant messaging and phone service that has 1.5 billion users, mainly outside the United States. WhatsApp\u2019s groups are restricted to 260 people \u2014 and the company never monitors the private-encrypted exchanges \u2014 so it\u2019s difficult to crack down on hoaxes. People have been killed across India, including in vigilante mob lynchings, because of misinformation spread on WhatsApp.\n\nCarl Woog, policy communications lead at WhatsApp, said the company has rolled out a way for businesses, such as news organizations, to develop a presence on the platform so that WhatsApp users can receive news and information from them. Silla Vac\u00eda in Colombia and Verificado in Mexico, which seek to debunk WhatsApp hoaxes, have already used the business app to respond efficiently to readers on the platform. During the Mexican earthquake, Verificado relied on 500 volunteers to help track down rumors and either confirm or debunk them.", "lang": "en"}
