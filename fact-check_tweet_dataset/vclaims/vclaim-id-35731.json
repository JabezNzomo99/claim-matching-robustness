Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Video of Viplove Thakur making Modi silent with her speech in the Parliament. Fact: Viplove Thakur was referring to Modi\u2019s government in her speech and was asking the interrupting BJP members, not Modi, to sit silently. Modi was not there in the house while she was making her speech. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nAt the beginning of the video, the clips of Viplove Thakur\u2019s speech in Rajya Sabha and Modi standing silently were shown and it is being claimed that Viplove Thakur made Modi silent with her speech. By just looking at the video, it can be observed that the visuals of Viplove Thakur were taken from the Rajya Sabha and the visuals of Modi were taken from the Lok Sabha. Let\u2019s try to find whether Modi was present in the house (Rajya Sabha) while Viplove Thakur was making her speech.\n\nIt can be seen that Viplove Thakur started her speech regarding the \u2018Motion of Thanks on the President\u2019s Address\u2019 in Rajya Sabha at 2:36 pm. Her full speech can be watched on the Rajya Sabha YouTube channel and the transcript of her speech can be found on the Rajya Sabha website. In the video, it can be seen that Modi was not there in the house while she was making her speech, as he is absent in his seat. (According to Rajya Sabha\u2019s seating arrangement, \u2018the first seat on the right side of the Chair is reserved for the Leader of the House and the second seat for the Prime Minister\u2019.) \n\n\n\nIn other videos, on the Rajya Sabha YouTube channel, it can be seen that Modi entered the house at 5:11 pm while Ramdas Athawale was talking and began his speech at 5:14 pm.\n\nTo sum it up, Viplove Thakur made Modi silent? No, he was not present in the Rajya Sabha during her speech. Viplove Thakur was referring to the Modi Government in her speech and not Modi.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
