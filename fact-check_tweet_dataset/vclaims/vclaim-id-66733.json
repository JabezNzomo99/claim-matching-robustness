We figured this was worth a look.\n\nFirst, the minimum wage. Starting on Jan. 1, 1978, the was $2.65. Someone working at the minimum wage for 13 weeks, and 40 hours per week, in the summer of 1978 would have ended up with $1,378 for their labors.\n\nFor the tuition they would have faced in the 1978-79 school year, we turned to from the National Center for Education Statistics, the federal government\u2019s repository of education data.\n\nThe cost of tuition and fees (in that year\u2019s dollars, not adjusted for inflation) was $688 for in-state residents attending a four-year, public university.\n\nSo the meme\u2019s claim is correct except for a few caveats -- two minor and one more significant:\n\u2022 The cost of tuition and fees plus room and board was significantly higher that year -- $2,145 -- but the meme was careful to cite \"tuition\" only, so we\u2019ll ignore the impact of room and board.\n\u2022 The tuition-and-fees figure we used is a national average, so some states may have had in-state tuition rates out of reach of minimum wage workers.\n\u2022 The meme\u2019s only notable failing has to do with overly broad wording -- specifically its use of the phrase \"of their choice.\" The data we used refers to in-state tuition, meaning that the student would have access to this sweet tuition rate only at their home-state university. That\u2019s not the same thing as \"of their choice.\"\n\nThe meme said that \"in 1978, a student who worked a minimum-wage summer job could afford to pay a year's full tuition at the 4-year public university of their choice.\"\n\nIf you use the national average the figure is correct. The only problem is the part about a university \"of their choice.\" The data is correct for in-state tuition -- not for any university in the country, where out-of-state rates may well have kicked up the tuition amount beyond a summer\u2019s minimum-wage haul.\n\nOn balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.\n\nCORRECTION: After we published this article, a reader noticed that we had used the incorrect tuition figure from the National Center for Education Statistics chart. This version uses the correct figure. The rating remains at Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
