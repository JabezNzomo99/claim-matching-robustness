One of the first stories to be debunked was a viral post which claimed that Congress President Rahul Gandhi had met Pakistan PM Imran Khan for dinner and the duo feasted on chicken biriyani.\n\nIncidentally, the same template was viral with PM Modi in place of Gandhi last month. A reverse image search showed that the photo had been edited to inculde Rahul gandhi in place of Khan\u2019s former wife Reham Khan.\n\nAnother story involving a member of the Gandhi family was a post that claimed if former PM Rajiv Gandhi could shoot using a digital camera in 1983, then why couldn\u2019t PM Modi do so in 1988?\n\nThe only difference was that the camera used by Gandhi senior was not a digital camera as claimed, but a video recorder.\n\nLastly, another post showed a billboard with an Amul cartoon taking a dig at the Gandhi parivar\u2019s latest entrant Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.\n\nOnly, Amul themselves called out the photo of the billboard as being edited, and tweeted the original cartoon.", "lang": "en"}
