Students sometimes complain that they can\u2019t sign up for Friday classes because they aren\u2019t offered. Whatever the reason, most schools hold far fewer classes on Friday than on other weekdays.\u201d\n\nMany campuses do offer fewer classes on Friday afternoon than they do at peak times during the rest of the week, said Mike Reilly, executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers. But he said it\u2019s not necessarily a hindrance to students graduating in four years, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a problem from a registrar\u2019s perspective and resource administration [perspective],\u201d Reilly said. \u201cYour goal is to try to have your space occupied as fully and efficiently as possible, and that means you need your courses distributed uniformly throughout the week.\u201d\n\nThe broader enrollment-management issue is the lack of data to help students manage their course load so they can graduate on time. Schools increasingly are incorporating more data and predictive analyses into enrollment for this reason: to catch students early when they\u2019re struggling in a class, and to make sure students have the right prerequisites so they don\u2019t fall behind.\n\nBut the trend of such low class loads for tenured professors is most common in elite schools, doctoral research institutions and flagship public institutions, said John Barnshaw, senior higher education researcher at the American Association of University Professors. That comprises several hundred schools, which tend to have the highest retention and completion rates (therefore undercutting Bush\u2019s argument). Meanwhile, there are about 4,000 other institutions that do not fit that criteria, where tenured professors teach an average of four classes per semester, Barnshaw said.\n\nSeveral higher-education experts we interviewed said that Bush has a fair, but generalized, point that more can be done to give completion incentives to schools and students. For this reason, 32 states have enacted a completion-based funding formula \u2014 the same incentive that Bush pushed for during his answer at the town hall. There have been mixed results, but states are continuing to experiment with this model, rather than an enrollment-based one.\n\n\u201cI think what Jeb Bush is saying is, should we be looking at tenure, should we be looking at teaching loads, should we be looking at course offerings and when they\u2019re available? The answer is, yes, we should be,\u201d said Michelle Asha Cooper, president of the Institute for Higher Education Policy.\n\nBush makes a broad claim: that schools have an incentive not to graduate students on time. He cites the lack of Friday afternoon course options and light teaching workloads for tenured professors as examples. Yes, schools tend to offer fewer Friday afternoon courses \u2014 but they make up for that by offering other course options. Tenured professors teach one to two classes per semester at research schools, but the average workload for tenured professors is four per semester.\n\nContrary to Bush\u2019s claim, experts say schools don\u2019t have much of an incentive to keep students enrolled longer. Among other reasons, schools need a reputable completion rate to remain competitive. The longer a student is in enrolled, the more student debt they accumulate \u2014 and higher student debt also makes the school less attractive to prospective students.\n\nBush has a point that there needs to be more incentive for schools and students to graduate on time. Yet he makes the point by generalizing two trends that apply to some schools and don\u2019t apply to others \u2014 obscuring the context necessary to understand the issue.", "lang": "en"}
