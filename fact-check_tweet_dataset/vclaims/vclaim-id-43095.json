No, that's not true: The images are not satellite measurements. A member of the NASA sulfur dioxide (SO2) team told Lead Stories that their satellite retrievals did not show significantly enhanced SO2 measurements over the region.\n\nThe claim originated from a series of tweets published by Intelwave (@inteldotwav) on February 8, 2020 (archived here). It opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this:\n\nThe image has been cited by several other websites and newspapers to suggest that bodies were being burned on a massive scale to control the novel coronavirus outbreak, which originated in Wuhan, China. As of February 18, 2020, the virus has killed at least 1,868 people, according to The New York Times.\n\nLead Stories reached out to the NASA team in the Global Sulfur Dioxide Monitoring Personnel group. Dr. Nickolay Krotkov, a physical research scientist at the Goddard Space Flight Center, said:\n\nWe asked Krotkov to clarify the difference between model data and satellite measurements. He said:\n\nModels forecast air quality based on meteorological weather forecast (predicted winds, temperatures, humidity, etc.) assuming KNOWN emissions of gases (NO2, SO2, etc.) and aerosols and chemical transformations models for different criteria pollutants (e.g., surface ozone, PM2.5).\n\n \n\nEmissions inventories (SO2, NO2, etc.) are fixed, outdated and it takes years to compile and update them. Models cannot account for changes of pollutant EMISSIONS from day to day.\n\n \n\nSatellite data show what gases and aerosols are actually measured at an overpass time over any cloud-free region. They are used to VERIFY model pollution forecasts.\n\n \n\nIn this case satellites do NOT see enhanced SO2 pollution over Wuhan region, which means that model SO2 emissions were not correct.\n\nThe suppositions from the original series of tweets have also been debunked by fullfact.org, which concluded that the images do not show evidence of mass cremations in Wuhan. It wrote:\n\nOn February 12, 2020, Open, an Italian website, also rated the claim improbable. It quoted a chemistry professor from the University of Palermo who estimated it would take 30 million bodies to achieve the levels in the claim, which is simply impossible.\n\nWe wrote about disinformation on Twitter before.
