However, the claim is false, originating from a website with a history of spreading misinformation. The volunteer, herself, has dismissed the report, which was also denied by UK health officials and the scientists behind the trial.\n\nThe claim was published here in South Africa on a website called News NT. Since it was posted on Facebook on April 25, 2020, it has been shared nearly 70,000 times and seen by more than two million people, according to data provided by the social network.\n\nAccording to News NT, microbiologist Elisa Granato died two days after she was administered Britain\u2019s first trial COVID-19 vaccine. \u201cA statement by the researchers said Elisa had complications few hours after taking the vaccine and died while on admission (sic),\u201d the article read.\n\nGranato was one of the first two people to take part in the human trial of a new COVID-19 vaccine at Oxford University on April 23, 2020. The scientist told BBC in an interview that the decision was to \u201csupport the scientific process\u201d.\n\nAs part of the process, the Oxford Vaccine Group, which is conducting the trial, hopes to vaccinate about 800 more people in Britain in the next month.\n\nThe viral claim appears on Twitter here and here, while the link to the publication was also shared in several Facebook posts published globally, including in Australia, Nigeria, Kenya and the US.\n\nBut the website has a history of spreading misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic, and there is no evidence to support the claim.\n\nIn March 2020, Guyana\u2019s health ministry rejected as \u201cfake news\u201d a News NT\u2019s article that a family of three in the capital Georgetown died before testing positive for coronavirus.\n\nThe site recently published an article that Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari had tested positive for the virus and was receiving treatment in an isolation ward after the death of his chief of staff, Abbah Kyari.\n\nThe claim was false -- Buhari addressed Nigerians in a nationwide broadcast on April 27, 2020, shortly after the article was published. AFP has also debunked a similar claim here.\n\nWe traced the website\u2019s history using site identity tool Whois.com and found that it was registered on March 4, 2020, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nGranato rejected the claim in a video shared on April 26, 2020, by BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh, who covered the human trial of the Oxford vaccine.\n\n\u201cI am very much alive,\u201d Granato said in 17-second footage posted on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m having a cup of tea. It\u2019s Sunday, the 26th of April, three days after I got the vaccine or the control.\u201d\n\nWalsh also tweeted that the claim was \u201cnot true\u201d when he published the video.\n\n\u201cI spent several minutes this morning chatting with Elisa Granato via Skype. She is very much alive and told me she is feeling \u2018absolutely fine\u2019,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAFP has contacted Granato for comment but is yet to hear from her. She has made her Twitter account private since the video was published.\n\nMeanwhile, Oxford University has also warned that people should not believe or share the report.\n\n\u201cWe are aware there have been and will be rumours and false reports about the progress of the trial,\u201d Oxford said in recent news about the trial progress. \u201cWe urge people not to give these any credibility and not to circulate them.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the UK Department of Health and Social Care has dismissed the report as untrue. \u201cNews circulating on social media that the first volunteer in a UK #coronavirus vaccine trial has died is completely untrue,\u201d it said in a tweet published on its official Twitter account.", "lang": "en"}
