The same edited video also shows an old news report from Gujarat of demolition drive against illegal constructions including temples in a bid to back up the misleading claim.\n\nThe edited video was tweeted by an account 'Re-tweet Sarkar 100 Follow back same day', with the caption, \"Modi himself confess, I don't believe in Hindu dharm, he is fooling all Hindus\"\n\nClick here to view tweet and here for an archive.\n\nClip from an old news report of temples being demolished in Surat plays after the edited part\n\n\n\nBOOM found that the video in the tweet has been edited from a 2014 interview aired on Times Now channel as part of the show - Frankly Speaking With Arnab Goswami.
