Akira Muto and Iwane Matsui commanded troops that commited atrocities at Nanking, including the rapes of 20,000 women and the slaughter of 300,000 people; foreign minister Koki Hirota was also held responsible for being \u201cwell informed about the massacre.\u201d Heitaro Kimura forced prisoners of war to do extremely hazardous work, including the construction of a railway between Burma and what is now Thailand.\n\nThe judgment of the IMTFE included a description of the type of torture known as \u201cthe water treatment,\u201d in which \u201cthe victim was bound or otherwise secured in a prone position; and water was forced through his mouth and nostrils into his lungs and stomach until he lost consciousness,\u201d according to \u201cDrop by Drop: Forgetting the History of Water Torture in U.S. Courts,\u201d a 2007 article in the Columbia Journal of Transnational Law, by Judge Evan Wallach. (The article is generally behind a paywall, but a plain type version can be found on the Internet.)\n\nSpecification 1: That in or about July or August, 1943, the accused Yukio Asano, did willfully and unlawfully, brutally mistreat and torture Morris O. Killough, an American Prisoner of War, by beating and kicking him, by fastening him on a stretcher and pouring water up his nostrils. Specification 2: That on or about 15 May, 1944, at Fukoka Prisoner of War Branch Camp Number 3, Kyushu, Japan, the accused Yukio Asano, did, willfully and unlawfully, brutally mistreat and torture Thomas B. Armitage, William O. Cash and Munroe Dave Woodall, American Prisoners of War, by beating and kicking them, by forcing water into their mouths and noses, and by pressing lighted cigarettes against their bodies. Specification 5. That between 1 April, 1943 and 31 December, 1943, the accused Yukio Asano, did, willfully and unlawfully, brutally mistreat and torture John Henry Burton, an American Prisoner of War, by beating him, and by fastening him head downward on a stretcher and forcing water into his nose.\n\nOne victim, Cpt. William Arno Bluehe, testified: \u201cAfter beating me for a while they would lash me to a stretcher, then prop me up against a table with my head down. They would then pour about two gallons of water from a pitcher into my nose and mouth until I lost consciousness. When I revived they would repeat the beatings and \u2018water cure\u2019 . . . . The tortures and beatings continued for about six hours.\u201d\n\n\u201c[We] were strapped to stretchers and warm water poured down our nostrils until we were about ready to pass out. [The Japanese] strapped him to a stretcher and elevated his feet and then poured on his face so that it was almost impossible for him to get his breath. [The victim] was then taken into the corridor, strapped to a stretcher, which was tilted so that his head was toward the floor and feet resting on a nearby sink.Water was then poured down his nose and mouth for about twenty minutes. Then I was taken into the hallway of the barracks. Both of the Japanese still insisting I was guilty and urging me to confess.\u201d\n\nThe Japanese version, as practiced in World War II, appears harsher than the rules under which Americans were supposed to operate after the Sept. 11 attacks; a cloth was supposed to be used, but the Senate Intelligence Committee report details at least one case where water appears to have been poured directly on a detainee\u2019s face. Water torture was not the only charge in the Japanese trials \u2014 and no one has accused U.S. personnel of using burning cigarettes \u2014 but in these cases it often was a key charge and clearly played a role in the sentences. Thus Cheney is simply wrong when he claims Japanese soldiers were not tried for waterboarding.\n\nWhile Todd did not mention it, during the Vietnam War, an American soldier was court-martialed within a month after the following photograph appeared on the front page of The Washington Post on Jan. 21, 1968, according to the book \u201cTorture and Democracy,\u201d by Darius Rejali, which in turn cites \u201cAmerica in Vietnam,\u201d by Guenter Lewy, who relied on military records. (A reader, Bryan W. White, pointed us to another published account that says disciplinary action was taken but \u201cno court martial is recorded.\u201d)\n\nThe American soldier, at the left, is shown pinning a captured North Vietnamese soldier to the ground while two other Vietnamese placed a towel over his face and poured water in his nose. The picture, taken four days earlier near Da Nang, had a caption that said the technique induced \u201ca flooding sense of suffocation and drowning, meant to make him talk.\u201d The article with the photograph said the practice was \u201cfairly common\u201d in part because \u201cthose who practice it say it combines the advantages of being unpleasant enough to make people talk while still not causing permanent injury.\u201d\n\nCheney dismissed too cavalierly Todd\u2019s question about the prosecution of Japanese soldiers for waterboarding. One could quibble about whether these practices were exactly like the techniques practiced by CIA interrogators. But Todd raised a legitimate question and, contrary to Cheney\u2019s assertion, waterboarding was an important charge in a number of the lesser-profile cases. Moreover, waterboarding also resulted in at least one court martial during the Vietnam War.", "lang": "en"}
