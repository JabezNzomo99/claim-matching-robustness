It\u2019s remained about the same under the Conservatives.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re interested in the challenges facing the NHS in the winter of 2017, this survey from 2015 isn\u2019t necessarily the best indicator of how the NHS is doing anyway.\n\nWe should also point out that the second set of figures quoted in the tweet we\u2019re factchecking is out by a few percentage points, an error that flatters the government.\n\nNHS satisfaction improved over the course of the last decade\n\nThe Guido Fawkes website sourced these figures from health think tank The King\u2019s Fund, which took them from the annual British Social Attitudes survey carried out by NatCen Social Research. It's been asking the question \"all in all, how satisfied or dissatisfied would you say you are with the way in which the National Health Service runs nowadays?\u201d since 1983.\n\nThe latest data available is from 2015: so five rather than (as claimed) seven years into a Conservative government, and not directly related to public debate about the state of the NHS in the winter of 2017.\n\nThe percentage of respondents expressing themselves \u201cvery satisfied\u201d or \u201cquite satisfied\u201d with the NHS in 2002 was 40%, while 41% were quite or very dissatisfied.\n\nIn 2015, the latest year for which data is available, 60% said that they were satisfied and 23% were dissatisfied. The claim above says 63% satisfied and 20% dissatisfied for 2015, which is three percentage points off in each case.\n\nAs is apparent from those figures, satisfaction is significantly higher in 2015 than in 2002. As the NatCen researchers comment, \u201clevels of dissatisfaction with the NHS are comparatively low and remain relatively stable, despite reductions in funding since 2010\u201d.\n\nBut there\u2019s more to the story than this. For instance, the proportion of people unhappy with the NHS \u201cdeclined from 50% in 1997 and levelled off between 2010 and 2015\u201d.\n\nThe King\u2019s Fund also points out that \u201cpublic satisfaction cannot be interpreted as a straightforward indicator of NHS performance\u201d. It thinks that some people use the question to express political support for the NHS as an institution, rather than thinking about the standard of medical treatment on offer.\n\nOr as The King\u2019s Fund puts it, \u201cthe relatively high levels of satisfaction reported in 2015 in part reflect positive views on the quality and range of services available on the NHS, but also reflect public support for the concept of a publicly run health service free at the point of use and providing a comprehensive range of services\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
