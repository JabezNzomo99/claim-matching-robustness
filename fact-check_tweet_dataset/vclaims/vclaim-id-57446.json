The picture is actually from 2013; it did appear in the 2017 movie, too, but there\u2019s no evidence it\u2019s being used by credible news organizations now.\n\nFacebook users are spreading a false claim that the \u201cMSM\u201d \u2014 mainstream media \u2014 is using an image from a 2017 movie in its coverage of the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe viral post \u2014 a screenshot of one user\u2019s text-and-photos post \u2014 suggests that the picture, showing rows of coffins, was taken from a 2017 movie and is now being circulated by news organizations as an image related to the outbreak in Italy.\n\nThe picture was indeed used in that movie, but it was originally taken in 2013 by an Associated Press photographer. We could find no evidence of news organizations today using it to illustrate the pandemic\u2019s toll in Italy, where more than 12,400 deaths have been reported.\n\nThe post claims: \u201cOk, Patriots so I\u2019m watching the movie UNLOCKED on Showtime and this scene pops up of coffins lined up and guess where I saw that exact picture\u2026 from our MSM telling us that this is ITALY right now because of COVID 19 virus!!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis movie was made in 2017! It\u2019s on Showtime right now!\u201d it continues. \u201cThis proves that you cannot trust the Media!!!\u201d\n\nMany of the screenshots simply show that the photo appeared on a website for CTV News, a Canadian news organization.\n\nBut some larger versions of the post further show that the example cited was actually connected to a CTV story dealing with \u201cAfrican migrants.\u201d We found that story, which was reported by the Associated Press. It\u2019s from 2013, not 2020, and the caption described the image as showing an airport hangar filled with coffins of African migrants who died in a shipwreck near an Italian island in 2013.\n\nThe same picture was indeed used in the movie \u201cUnlocked,\u201d which came out four years later.
