However, we\u2019ve investigated dozens of claims holding that \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d had predicted some world event, and in almost every case we\u2019ve found the rumor to either be based on edited footage, faulty logic, or minor coincidences. This instance falls victim to all three.\n\nThe above-displayed video is a mash-up of two different episodes of \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d It starts with a clip from the final episode of the show\u2019s seventh season, entitled \u201cSummer of 4 Ft. 2,\u201d in which Homer purchases illegal fireworks. But Homer ends up destroying a dishwasher with the explosives, not an entire town:\n\nThe explosion seen in the \u201cBeirut prediction video\u201d comes from an entirely different episode of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d: a mini-episode titled \u201cThe Ned Zone\u201d that aired during the show\u2019s \u201cTree House of Horrors\u201d special during the 16th season. The explosion can be seen at the 1:15 mark of the following video:\n\nNot only are the two clips in the Beirut prediction video unrelated, they also hardly qualify as a prediction. \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d are far from the only television show or movie to depict a fireworks mishap or nuclear explosion.\n\nA slight variation of this rumor was also shared on TikTok. The \u201cmind blowing\u201d prediction in that rumor implied that the same building could be seen in both an episode of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and in a photograph of the Port of Beirut:\n\nWhile these are genuine pictures from the Beirut explosion and the fictional town of Springfield, it should be noted that squares and rectangles are commonly used in architectural design. More importantly, the explosion in Beirut did not occur at a nuclear power plant.\n\nThese viral \u201cpredictions\u201d make no mention of Beirut, ammonium nitrate (the reported cause of the explosion), the year 2020, or any other details specific to the catastrophic events in Lebanon. While it\u2019s true that \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d showed fireworks in one episode, a large explosion (in an entirely different episode), and a square building near Springfield\u2019s nuclear power plant, this in no way demonstrates the fortune-telling abilities of the animated show.", "lang": "en"}
