President Donald Trump has rounded that up to $100 trillion. But the estimate, which comes from a right-leaning think tank, has important caveats, and experts told us the Green New Deal is too vague to try to estimate its cost.\n\u2022 None Sen. Ed Markey, the Democratic sponsor of the resolution, claimed that without any action climate change \u201cwill result in 10% GDP loss by 2090,\u201d citing the National Climate Assessment. That number is an upper-end estimate, and two of the researchers who did the original study caution against using it.\n\nWe\u2019ll explain the origin of Markey\u2019s 10 percent gross domestic product line, and go over why it\u2019s not the best way to summarize the economic impacts of climate change.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll demystify the seemingly specific $93 trillion figure, which the think tank report\u2019s own authors say should not be the only takeaway.\n\nWe\u2019ve already written about the Green New Deal, and the confusion over what the resolution entails. Some of that applies here, too, as many Republicans continue to say the proposal covers things it doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe Green New Deal, which hasn\u2019t yet come up for a vote in either chamber, is a nonbinding resolution that calls for the country to address climate change by reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions through a \u201c10-year national mobilization.\u201d The proposal requires that the transition to clean energy be done in a way that is sensitive to vulnerable populations, and includes other large-scale goals, such as providing all Americans with health care, housing and economic security.\n\nIn the past two weeks, the cost of the Green New Deal has been a relentless focus for Republicans, including during a Feb. 27 Western Caucus forum and press conference organized by Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar that was devoted to denouncing the proposal.\n\nAt the annual Conservative Political Action Conference on Mar. 2, Trump said the Democrats would \u201ccompletely takeover American energy and completely destroy America\u2019s economy through their new $100 trillion Green New Deal.\u201d\n\nAnd on Mar. 5, Eric Trump, the president\u2019s second eldest son and an executive vice president of the Trump Organization, said on Fox News Radio that the proposal would cost $93 trillion, adding, falsely, that it banned airplanes, cows and cars. (As we\u2019ve explained before, the Green New Deal doesn\u2019t call for any of those prohibitions.)\n\nSens. John Barrasso, Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn and Joni Ernst, among many others, have also cited the same $93 trillion figure.\n\nThe number is an estimate from the American Action Forum, a self-described \u201ccenter-right policy institute.\u201d The AAF is the \u201csister organization\u201d of the American Action Network, a conservative nonprofit that has spent tens of millions of dollars supporting Republicans in general elections. The AAN is a tax-exempt 501(c)(4) that doesn\u2019t disclose donors, but must disclose any independent expenditures on TV ads for or against specific candidates to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nIn a brief analysis, the AAF estimated costs for six sectors related to Green New Deal goals, including clean energy, high-speed rail, a job guarantee, health care, green housing and food security. The estimated costs only include outlays, and don\u2019t factor in economic benefits or other effects.\n\nThe group produced a single figure or range for each category, which, when tallied, runs from $51 trillion to $93 trillion between 2020 and 2029. The summed figures don\u2019t appear in the report, although they are mentioned in a separate summary. The upper number has gotten the most attention.\n\nBut the experts we spoke to said it\u2019s not possible to put a specific price tag on the Green New Deal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say that it is *way* too early to even pretend to put cost estimates on the \u2018Green New Deal.\u2019 It\u2019s at this point a still-amorphous construct,\u201d said Josh Bivens, director of research at the labor-funded Economic Policy Institute, in an email to FactCheck.org.\n\nNoah Kaufman, a research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy, agreed. When asked what one can say about how much the Green New Deal would cost, he said, \u201cbasically nothing.\u201d\n\nThe Green New Deal, he said, is a set of ambitions, not policies, and how much things cost will depend on what the policies are.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t use policy analysis if you don\u2019t have policy,\u201d said Kaufman, who previously served as President Barack Obama\u2019s deputy associate director of energy and climate change. \u201cIt just seems definitely premature and a little misleading to try to claim we know how much.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Miron, the director of economic studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be very precise because a lot of the proposals are broad brush and vague.\u201d\n\nHe nevertheless noted that other estimates \u2014 including one back-of-the-envelope calculation from Bloomberg Opinion writer Noah Smith, which came out to $6.6 trillion every year \u2014 have been roughly the same as the American Action Forum\u2019s figure.\n\nThe president of the American Action Forum and a co-author of the analysis, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, defended the estimate, but acknowledged that using the $93 trillion figure by itself was not ideal.\n\n\u201cThe figure\u2019s not wrong, but it\u2019s incomplete,\u201d he said, adding that in a perfect world, people would give ranges and convey uncertainty. Holtz-Eakin is a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and was John McCain\u2019s chief economic adviser during the 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nA better numerical summary of the findings, Holtz-Eakin said, would be $50 trillion to $90 trillion, with some mention of the nuances in the report.\n\nThe analysis, for example, notes that the breadth of the Green New Deal \u201cmakes it daunting to apply the standard tools of policy analysis.\u201d\n\nThe paper goes on to say that the Green New Deal would result in changes that \u201care impossible to quantify at this point,\u201d and that redundancy in certain policies \u201ccomplicates a precise analysis, as the interactions are difficult to predict.\u201d\n\nThose caveats aren\u2019t included when Republicans bring up the Green New Deal\u2019s price tag.\n\nStrictly speaking, as a nonbinding resolution that would require other legislation to carry out its goals, the Green New Deal costs nothing. Even if it passed both the House and the Senate, it would not have the force of law. Lawmakers would have to propose other legislation to act on any of the broad goals in the resolution. And that legislation would include specific policy proposals, which the CBO would score as it would any other bill. The score would then be provided to lawmakers so they could be informed about the impact of the legislation on the federal budget.\n\nThe AAF estimate shouldn\u2019t be thought of as the same or even similar to a CBO cost estimate, which estimates the full impact of the legislation on the federal budget, given spending and revenue changes.\n\nWe won\u2019t pick through all of the AAF estimate \u2014 most economists we spoke to didn\u2019t want to comment on it. As Miron said, \u201cit\u2019s impossible to argue about details because the exact proposals don\u2019t have enough details.\u201d\n\nBut a few key examples help explain why the $93 trillion figure is problematic.\n\nBecause none of the Green New Deal\u2019s policies are defined yet, the estimate\u2019s authors had to make assumptions about what sorts of policies would be made.\n\nIn the case of health care, AAF authors assumed the Green New Deal would be similar to Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All proposal, despite the fact that the only thing the resolution says about health care is that it should be \u201chigh-quality\u201d and provided to \u201call people of the United States.\u201d The group calculated that single line item would cost $36 trillion over a decade.\n\nAs Miron pointed out, there are a variety of different universal health care systems that one could choose to implement, and the costs for each vary widely.\n\nSimilarly, the AAF estimate also makes assumptions about the Green New Deal\u2019s plan to invest in high-speed rail. The estimate states, inaccurately, that the Green New Deal \u201cenvisions enough high-speed rail to make air travel unnecessary.\u201d\n\nThat idea was originally included in a FAQ sheet that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office distributed to news organizations, but it does not appear in the resolution. The resolution, which Ocasio-Cortez sponsored in the House, simply mentions investment in high-speed rail as one way of \u201coverhauling transportation systems\u201d to reduce pollution and greenhouse emissions in the sector \u201cas much as is technologically feasible.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the rail estimate isn\u2019t reliable because it claims to come from the number of airline miles flown multiplied by a cost per mile estimate. But the airline miles number that was used actually represents the number of airports in the country.\n\nRedundancies, too, could have a large impact on the ultimate cost of any Green New Deal. Miron explained that some of the Green New Deal\u2019s goals would have substantial overlap with others, which could lead to double-counting. For example, if there\u2019s infrastructure spending to build new rail lines, that could create jobs, reducing the costs of a jobs program. But the AAF estimate counts both separately, without factoring in those interactions.\n\nHoltz-Eakin said his group would have accounted for this if it could have.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that more than 80 percent of the AAF estimate was for social programs such as health care, not for clean energy and climate policies.\n\nKaufman, the Columbia researcher, said he does have concerns about cost, but reducing greenhouse gas emissions doesn\u2019t have to break the bank.\n\n\u201cIt turns out if you do something like carbon tax and use that money to reduce other taxes, what happens is you get a drastic reduction on emissions and basically no effect on the economy at all,\u201d he said.\n\nEconomists of all stripes generally agree that the most efficient way to cut emissions is to put a price on carbon. If the Green New Deal were not to take such an approach, the costs would almost certainly be much higher.\n\nSeveral economists have looked at how to implement plans that reach or work toward net zero emissions.\n\nRobert Pollin, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, thinks it\u2019s entirely possible to get to net zero by 2050 by spending around 2 percent of GDP each year, or around $18 trillion in total.\n\n\u201c$18 trillion is real money,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you spread it out over 30 years, it\u2019s entirely feasible and it will have a lot of economic benefits in addition to getting us down to zero emissions.\u201d\n\nUnder his scenario, Pollin says the economy would continue to grow and consumers would not see increases in their utility bills \u2014 one of the prospects that some politicians have highlighted under a shift to a greener economy.\n\nPollin, however, strongly disagrees with the resolution\u2019s aim of getting to net zero with just a decade of investment.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s completely unrealistic and it\u2019s not worth costing out,\u201d he said of the Green New Deal.\n\nEdward Barbier, an economist at Colorado State University, agrees that a strict timeline isn\u2019t realistic. He advocates jump-starting the transition by investing about 5 percent of GDP over five or so years. GDP was $20.5 trillion in 2018, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, so that\u2019s a little over $1 trillion a year.\n\n\u201cThat would push us on a path to clean energy, and a path that permanently lowers carbon emissions,\u201d he told us.\n\nAfter that push, Barbier said the costs of renewables and other technologies would fall, and the country would be able to take advantage of those reductions.\n\nAs Republicans have attacked the Green New Deal because of its potential price tag, Democrats have hit back, arguing that the costs of climate change are also high.\n\nSen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, for example, pointed to the National Climate Assessment and a frequently cited GDP statistic.\n\nThe National Climate Assessment doesn\u2019t make such a definite prediction, and the scientists behind the number say it really shouldn\u2019t be used without providing more context. One told us a better estimate to use would be roughly 4 percent of GDP, but that, too, is only a projection. (Climate change, it should also be noted, is making life more difficult for humans and many other organisms on Earth, but it won\u2019t literally destroy the planet, as Markey said.)\n\nThe GDP estimate doesn\u2019t appear anywhere in the text of the climate report. Instead, it\u2019s found in a graphic that was reprinted from a 2017 Science paper.\n\nThe graph plots out damage to the U.S. economy by around 2090 as a function of various climate scenarios and temperature increases. Damages amounting to 10 percent of GDP are projected only under the higher climate scenario, which assumes emissions continue unabated, and under large temperature changes.", "lang": "en"}
