The claim is false; surgical masks are not reversible, a major US manufacturer of the products says.\n\n\u201cWhile at the doctors office today, we were informed by a Nurse the proper way to use a medical mask,\u201d says the text of the post, shared on March 25, 2020. \u201cColored side out if you\u2019re sick and do not want to spread your germs around. White side out (this is the filter part) for when you\u2019re not sick and you want to stop the germs from getting in.\u201d\n\nIn January, AFP Fact Check debunked similar misinformation circulating in Sri Lanka and the Philippines.\n\nPrestige Ameritech, the largest domestic surgical mask maker in the US, said by email that surgical masks are not reversible.\n\n\u201cMasks have a front and a back. For proper performance, they should be worn correctly,\u201d the vice president of the company, Mike Bowen, told AFP.\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking, the colored side should face outward. I suppose that someone somewhere for some reason might make a mask with a colored inner layer, but I\u2019ve never seen one,\u201d Bowen added.\n\nIf the mask is all white and does not have a distinctive, pre-bent nosepiece, Bowen said \u201cthe side that should face the wearer is the side where the edge of the bottom-most folded pleat points toward the ceiling.\u201d\n\nDifferent countries have recommended different approaches to mask wearing during the pandemic, which has left roughly 165,000 people dead worldwide and pushed some health authorities to recommend face coverings to help slow its spread.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), medical masks cannot currently protect against the novel coronavirus -- which causes the COVID-19 disease -- \u201cwhen used alone.\u201d\n\nThe WHO\u2019s latest guidance on masks is available here.\n\nA surgical mask is \u201cnot considered respiratory protection,\u201d the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says in a graphic, as it does not \u201cprovide the wearer with a reliable level of protection from inhaling smaller airborne particles.\u201d\n\nThe CDC currently does recommend the use of face coverings for the general public to help slow the spread of COVID-19, but not to keep the wearer from becoming infected.\n\nSurgical masks are currently considered \u201ccritical supplies\u201d by the CDC and are reserved for \u201chealthcare workers and other medical first responders.\u201d\n\nFor more of AFP Fact Check\u2019s work on claims surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, visit our coronavirus verification hub.", "lang": "en"}
