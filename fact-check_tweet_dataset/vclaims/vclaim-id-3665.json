In the information it provided to us, the White House did not specify that there was a detainer for this individual, although it did for other cases. We asked the White House whether there was an ICE detainer in 2004 or 2017 and got no answer.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear that ICE was seeking the individual in San Francisco or the individual in the unnamed city in California at the time they were released for violent offenses. ICE apparently had no detainer out for one of the New York individuals. This is key. States and local governments don\u2019t have the power to deport immigrants, so if ICE wasn\u2019t looking for these individuals, local authorities would have had no reason to keep them in jail for ICE to pick up.", "lang": "en"}
