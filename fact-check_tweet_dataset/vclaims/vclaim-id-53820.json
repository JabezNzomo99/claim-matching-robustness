The posts imply that the blast was in retaliation to launching commercial flights from Israel to UAE for the first time.\n\nThe first commercial flight from Israel to the UAE, that took off on August 31, carrying a delegation of Israeli and US officials, was a major step taken to normalise relations between the two nations after the announcement of a peace deal.\n\nThe Facebook posts, that are going viral claim: \u201cExplosions in 2 American restaurants, KFC and Hardee\u2019s in Abu Dhabi and Dubai ahead of first Israeli commercial flight operations in the Muslim kingdom. 2 messages in 1 operation?\u201d\n\nNewsMobile fact checked the post and found the claim to be misleading.\n\nWe ran a simple keyword search on Google and found several reports on the incident.\n\nAccording to a Reuters report published in The Wire , three people were killed and several others were injured at the KFC and Hardee\u2019s restaurants on the city\u2019s Rashid bin Saeed Street, following a blast on August 31.\n\nThe article states that the reason for the blast was the \u2018misalignment in the gas container fittings following refuelling\u2019. Other reports can be seen here and here\n\nHence, from the above information, it is clear that the video of the explosion is being shared with misleading claims.", "lang": "en"}
