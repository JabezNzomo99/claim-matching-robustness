Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican who is one of the lead co-sponsors of the bill.\n\nOn Sept. 20, 2017 -- 10 days before a deadline to pass the measure with a simple majority -- there was this exchange between Johnson and Chuck Todd, host of MSNBC\u2019s \"MTP Daily\" talk show:\n\nTodd: \"So, you contend that this bill will protect those folks with pre-existing conditions -- period.\"\n\nJohnson: \"Every bit as well as Obamacare did. And it\u2019s also going to protect the individuals that can\u2019t afford Obamacare right now.\"\n\nThe protections are a major point of contention. The Affordable Care Act makes it illegal for insurers to deny coverage to people who have pre-existing health conditions, such as asthma, diabetes or cancer, or charge them higher rates.\n\nBut under the Johnson-sponsored plan, waivers that would give states new flexibility erode protections for pre-existing conditions.\n\n\"The only way people (with pre-existing conditions) are protected is if every state in the nation looks at this and says, \u2018We\u2019re not going to do that,\u2019\" said Karen Pollitz, a health reform and private insurance expert at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. \"This lets states take away your protections.\"\n\nThe bill, introduced a week before Johnson\u2019s interview, is known as the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson bill (or its shorter moniker, Graham-Cassidy). That\u2019s for the GOP senators co-sponsoring the measure: Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Dean Heller of Nevada and Johnson.\n\nUnder Senate rules, the bill could be approved with 51 votes (50 senators plus a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence) if it is adopted by Sept. 30, 2017. After that, Republicans, who hold 52 seats, would need 60 votes, which seems an impossibility.\n\nThe bill and pre-existing conditions got heavy attention after late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel, whose infant son was born with a congenital heart disease, attacked it on his show the night before Johnson\u2019s interview.\n\nThe bill keeps the Affordable Care Act prohibition on insurers denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nBut states could obtain waivers that would enable them to opt out of other ACA provisions that protect those people.\n\nThe upshot: States could allow insurance companies to charge people with pre-existing conditions more than they charge healthy people; and the insurers could offer policies that offer less than the \"essential benefits\" that are now mandated.\n\nPolitiFact National rated Mostly False a claim by President Donald Trump that the bill includes \"coverage of pre-existing conditions,\" finding that:\n\u2022 If a state merely says it \"intends to maintain access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions,\" then it can allow insurance companies to charge sick people more than healthy ones. The federal government could withhold money granted to a state under a waiver if the state doesn\u2019t do as it promised, but the words \"adequate\" and \"affordable\" are open to interpretation.\n\u2022 Policies would not have to provide the same level of coverage now mandated under Obamacare.\n\u2022 Estimates say about 34 states would see net funding cuts under the bill. It costs money to cover people with known health conditions, and most states would have less of it.\n\nJohnson's claim goes further than Trump\u2019s, saying the bill\u2019s pre-existing protections are as good as Obamacare\u2019s.\n\nBut in reviewing the GOP bill, the political news website Axios arrived at similar findings:\n\u2022 The funding cuts \"could pressure states to waive protections for sick people as a way to keep premium increases in check. Older, sicker people in every state could end up paying more as states try to make up for a funding shortfall.\"\n\u2022 States could get a waiver to let insurers charge sick people more than healthy people.\n\u2022 A waiver would exempt insurers from the current requirement to provide \"essential health benefits,\" including prescription drugs -- so, people who need expensive drugs might have to pay out of pocket.\n\nAnd Pollitz told us that states could also allow insurance companies to:\n\u2022 Charge lower premiums to people while they\u2019re healthy, but then raise the rates at renewal time if, for example, they get cancer.\n\u2022 Charge higher premiums based on a person\u2019s location or occupation, practices that are outlawed under Obamacare.\n\nInformation from the bill\u2019s sponsors say it would protect people with pre-existing conditions, but doesn\u2019t provide details.\n\nPatrick McIlheran, a Johnson spokesman, told us the bill gives states the flexibility to try \"new approaches to keeping insurance for those with pre-existing conditions affordable.\"\n\nWriting about the bill in the conservative National Review, Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, made one reference to pre-existing conditions, saying:\n\nOn the positive side, supporters of the legislation correctly point out that it would give the states far more flexibility with the funds they receive, and would allow them to waive many of Obamacare\u2019s more onerous regulations, including the mandate to buy coverage, mandated benefits and pre-existing-condition coverage requirements. Those are the regulations most responsible for driving up premiums and destabilizing insurance markets.\n\nJohnson said the GOP health bill he is co-sponsoring will protect people with pre-existing conditions \"every bit as well as Obamacare did.\"\n\n \n\n The bill would keep the Affordable Care Act\u2019s prohibition on denying coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions. But states could obtain waivers that would allow insurers -- unlike under Obamacare -- to charge people with pre-existing conditions premiums and provide them lesser benefits.", "lang": "en"}
