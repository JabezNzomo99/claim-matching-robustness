It is being claimed that the girl from Parle-G biscuit is Neeru Deshpande and she is now 65 years old.\n\nAccording to the claim, she was four years old when she posed for the brand.\n\nFacebook page \"The Pagla Engineer\" shared the post which got more than 700 shares till the time of filing the story.\n\nIndia Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral claim is false.\n\nThe girl on the cover is an illustration, whereas the lady in the viral post is Infosys chairperson Sudha Murthy.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nTo check the claim, we did a reverse search and found that the woman in the viral photo is not Neeru Deshpande but Infosys chairperson Sudha Murthy. We found her photo on the blog of Mehta Publishing House with some other photographs of the event.\n\nThe photo was clicked in January, 2013 when Murthy visited the office of the publishing house. One can also see her photograph on the website of Infosys.\n\nThe kid on the Parle-G biscuit cover is just an illustration.\n\nThe speculations about the kid are not new. Neeru Deshpande, Sudha Murthy and Gunjan Gundaniya are a few names that have remained in the centre of these speculations. But, Parle products' group product manager Mayank Shah had denied these stories a few years ago saying that the kid is just an illustration which was made in the 60s by Everest Creative.\n\nMany prominent media houses had published the statement of Shah.\n\nIt is clear that the Parle-G girl is actually an illustration and has nothing to do with Infosys chairperson Sudha Murthy.", "lang": "en"}
