Several Facebook pages and users have used it as a political weapon to hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nPages such as \"IT & Social Media Cell Congress\" and others have claimed that although Bedi towed the then PM's car by a crane, this picture shows, soon after the incident, that Gandhi admired the IPS officer and invited her for lunch at her residence. These posts compared the incident with the recent suspension of an IAS officer in Odisha's Sambhalpur for reportedly checking Modi's helicopter.\n\nIndia Today's Anti Fake News War room (AFWA) found the post to be misleading. The viral picture has no relation with the towing incident. And also Bedi, personally never towed former Gandhi's car by a crane.\n\nAnother Facebook user, \"Samuel George\", also posted the same black and white picture and wrote, \"Rare to find leaders like Indira Gandhi. When Kiran Bedi booked a challan on PM's vehicle for wrong parking, Indira ji invited her for lunch personally at PMO to honor her fearless commitment towards duty.\"\n\nMore than 1,200 users shared this post on Facebook. There are several others who have posted the same claim on Facebook.\n\nA simple Yandex reverse search revealed the original tweet of Kiran Bedi, the current Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry. She posted it on November 19, 2017. Besides details about her closeness with Gandhi, she mentioned that this picture was taken on January, 1975. In the caption she wrote, \"Invited to breakfast with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi after leading the Republic Day Parade.\"\n\nWe searched for the much-talked-about incident of \"Kiran Bedi towing Indira Gandhi's car\" and came across one article filed by NDTV in 2015. The article has a small chunk of Bedi's interview with journalist Barkha Dutt from the show \"The Delhi Town hall\".\n\nWhen Bedi was specifically asked about the \"car towing\" incident, she replied categorically that she did not tow away Gandhi's wrongly-parked car. According to this report, in 1982, an ambassador car that belonged to Gandhi's office was parked at the wrong spot and it was towed away by sub-inspector Nirmal Singh.\n\nBut she accepted the fact that as DCP (Deputy Commissioner of Police), she protected the junior officer and confirmed that he was not punished for doing his duty.\n\nThe viral image in question was taken on 1975, and the \"car towing\" incident happened must later, in 1982. So the picture has no relation with the incident.\n\nBut was Bedi rewarded after the \"towing\" incident? Contrary to general perception and the viral claim, Bedi opened up in NDTV's interview and claimed that she was transferred and given a punishment posting to Goa from Delhi seven months after Gandhi's car was towed away by Delhi Police.\n\nAlso Read | Fact Check: Viral post claiming Prime Minister Narendra Modi used abusive word in Gujarati is totally false\n\nAlso Read | Fact Check: Mehbooba Mufti, senior journalists are wrong on Sadhvi Pragya's age", "lang": "en"}
