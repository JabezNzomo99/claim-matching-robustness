The quote originated from a satire website.\n\nThe Facebook post contains a lengthy quote, purportedly from Pelosi, that states U.S. service members serving overseas should not be allowed to vote in U.S. elections because \u201cthey don\u2019t even live here.\u201d (RELATED: Viral Video Claims To Show Nancy Pelosi Slurring Her Speech)\n\n\u201cSome of these young men and women have been out of country for years. Why should they get to vote?\u201d Pelosi allegedly said. \u201cThey don\u2019t even live here. We need to strengthen our elections, not weaken them by allowing foreigners to participate. That\u2019s essentially what these soldiers have become \u2013 foreigners. They\u2019ve given up on being American by working for so long out of country. American elections are for Americans.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that Pelosi made such a comment about American soldiers participating in U.S. elections. Had she done so, media outlets would almost certainly have covered it, yet none have. No similar quotes appear on her verified social media accounts either.\n\nA keyword search traced the long statement back to an article published on America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, a satirical news website that describes itself as part of a network of \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d The quote appears in an article filed under the \u201cSilly Tater Satire\u201d category.\n\nYet, while America\u2019s Last Line of Defense clearly disclaims the satirical nature of its content, the Facebook post fails to convey a similar warning, a common way for misinformation to spread. Many Facebook users perceived the quote as real, with one person commenting, \u201cOut saving her ass and she says this!\u201d", "lang": "en"}
