Below is a screenshot of the IANS feed republished by Outlook.\n\nOther organisations that carried the story were Free Press Journal, Dainik Jagran and Newstrack.\n\nAshok Gehlot-led Congress government is in crisis in Rajasthan after Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot claimed the support 30 MLAs and said that Gehlot\u2019s government is in minority. The Rajasthan Congress Legislature Party has passed a resolution supporting the current government.\n\nThe tweet in question was made by Twitter account \u2018Sarah Sachin Pilot (@SarahSachin)\u2019 on July 12.\n\nThis is an imposter account and not Sara Pilot\u2019s official account. The first obvious give away is that her name is misspelt as \u2018Sarah\u2019. Below is a tweet where her brother and former Chief Minister of J&K Omar Abdullah refers to her as \u2018Sara\u2019.\n\nThe same spelling mistake is also present in the IANS copy.\n\nAnother clue that the account is fake is its bio which says, \u201cThe Spelandra of Kasmir.\u201d The misspelling of \u2018Kashmir\u2019 is a mistake that Sara, a native of the region, would not make. The handle has also made other spelling and grammatical errors such as \u2014 \u201cbrands ambassador\u201d and \u201cpolitics\u201d. Furthermore, it does not have a verified blue tick which a prominent individual\u2019s account would.\n\nSara Pilot does not have an official handle on Twitter. IANS fell for an imposter account and several media outlets republished its feed. Earlier the news agency had fallen for a fake account of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput\u2019s father. In fact, IANS has a history of falling for fake accounts including those of Raghuram Rajan and Biplap Deb.", "lang": "en"}
