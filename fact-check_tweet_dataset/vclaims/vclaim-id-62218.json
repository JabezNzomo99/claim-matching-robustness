The claim is false; the man circled in the photo is in fact a Bollywood production designer, Wasiq Khan.\n\nThe photo was published on Facebook here on August 21, 2020. The post has been shared more than 1,100 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s romanised Hindi caption reads in English as: \u201cShare widely and make this viral. Sandip Singh along with Deepika, Ranveer and Dawood.\u201d\n\nThe post refers to Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh, two prominent actors and one of Bollywood\u2019s most famous couples. Sandip Ssingh is a film producer.\n\nDawood Ibrahim is one of India\u2019s most wanted fugitives. He is accused of running major organised crime operations and supporting terrorist acts, including the 1993 serial bomb blasts in Mumbai.\n\nThe photo was also shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook here, here, here and here; and on Twitter here, here, here and here.\n\nThe claim, however, is false.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the photo was published by several Indian news and entertainment websites in August 2013; for example here, here and here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo shared in the misleading posts (L) and the photo published by India TV in 2013 (R):\n\nIndia TV\u2019s article reports: \u201cRanveer Singh and Deepika Padukone who are currently busy shooting for Sanjay Leela Bhansali's upcoming \u2018Ram Leela' took part in the iftaar party with the entire crew on the sets of the flick.\u201d\n\nA review of the cast and crew credits of the film Ram Leela, which was released in November 2013, found the two men seated beside the man circled in red are cinematographer Ravi Varman and Sandip Ssingh, who was an associate producer at the time.\n\nIn response to the misleading posts, Varman told AFP by Twitter direct message on August 21, 2020 that the man circled in the photo is in fact a production designer named Wasiq Khan.\n\nA further keyword search found Khan posted a statement in response to the misleading posts on Twitter here on August 23, 2020.\n\n\u201cFriends, this is me and my name is not Dawood Ibrahim. I am Wasiq Khan, a poor production designer. The photograph was taken during an Iftaar party in 2012.... Amidst chaos, I m (sic) sure CBI shall do a fair investigation and the departed soul shall get justice,\u201d reads his tweet.\n\nOther photos of Khan match the man seen in the photo shared in the misleading social media posts. One image, for example, was published here by Mumbai-based newspaper The Indian Express in January 2014.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of Khan pictured in the misleading posts (1), the photo of him published by The Indian Express (2) and an old photo of Ibrahim (3).", "lang": "en"}
