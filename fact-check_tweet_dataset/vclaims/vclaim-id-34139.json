It\u2019s been operating since 2013. President Trump toured a factory that makes Mac computers for Apple with the chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, on Wednesday in Austin, Texas. Pete Marovich for The New York Times\n\nPresident Trump on Wednesday toured a Texas plant that makes high-end Apple computers, chatting with Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, and accepting a plate with the words \u201cAssembled in USA.\u201d It was a pretty typical publicity event, until the end. Mr. Trump walked in front of the news cameras and took credit for the plant, suggesting it had opened that day. \u201cFor me, this is a very special day,\u201d he said. Mr. Cook stood next to him, stone-faced. The plant has been making Apple computers since 2013. Immediately after Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, Mr. Cook thanked the president and his staff. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for their support in pulling today off and getting us to this far. It would not be possible without them,\u201d he said. He did not correct the record. The moment was part of a bizarre afternoon in Texas, where the president played up a six-year-old factory as evidence of his three-year-old presidency\u2019s success in bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States. It showed Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to leverage his influence over American companies in his pitch to voters that he deserves another four years in the White House. And it illustrated the complicated position that Mr. Cook and other corporate executives find themselves in with this president, forced to stand silently by while he sometimes misleads about their businesses. After Mr. Trump departed the factory, he tweeted, \u201cToday I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America.\u201d The plant Mr. Trump toured is owned by Flex, a company that has made Apple\u2019s top-of-the-line Mac Pro computers there since 2013. When Apple decided to make the Mac Pro in the United States in 2012, Mr. Cook went on prime-time television to announce it. Apple had previously assembled virtually all of its products in China. Yet when production of the computer began in Texas, it quickly ran into problems, in part because of a lack of nearby suppliers. Earlier this year, Apple unveiled a new version of the Mac Pro, with a starting price of $6,000. Shortly after, Apple and the White House began a monthslong public dance over where the computer would be made. Apple said it needed waivers from tariffs the White House had imposed on certain Chinese-made components, like power cables and circuit boards, to keep making the Mac Pro in Texas. At first, Mr. Trump tweeted no, but the White House later granted 10 of the waivers. On Wednesday, Mr. Cook showed Mr. Trump the new Mac Pro, which recently began coming off the plant\u2019s assembly lines. He pointed to different components in the computer and ticked off which states they came from. Apple uses 9,000 suppliers across all 50 states for its products, it said. Nearly all of those suppliers ship their parts to China, where Apple\u2019s manufacturing partners assemble the vast majority of the company\u2019s devices, including iPhones, iPads, MacBooks and the Apple Watch. Those Chinese factories employ millions of people. Flex\u2019s plant in Austin employs about 500 workers, who assemble one of Apple\u2019s lowest-volume products. After Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on Wednesday, Mr. Cook used the moment to pitch Apple\u2019s new Mac Pro computer. \u201cIt can perform 56 trillion tasks per second,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of American design, American manufacturing and American ingenuity.\u201d He then noted that before Mr. Trump had arrived that day, Apple had broken ground on a nearby, previously announced $1 billion campus in Austin. Those offices are expected to open in 2022 with about 5,000 white-collar employees in areas like engineering, sales, operations and customer support. The campus could eventually house 15,000 workers, but none are expected to be in manufacturing. Mr. Cook has become one of Mr. Trump\u2019s top allies in corporate America, despite their differing styles and disagreement on certain issues. Mr. Cook has openly criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s policies on the environment and immigration, but he has put those concerns aside to lobby Mr. Trump on issues like tax and trade. Under the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts, Apple last year brought back the vast majority of the $252 billion in cash it had held abroad, saving it billions of dollars in taxes. It has since returned much of that money to shareholders. The trade war between the United States and China acutely threatens Apple\u2019s business. Apple is already paying tariffs on some products, and it is set to pay more if the next round of tariffs go into effect next month. Apple has been asking for waivers from those tariffs. When asked on Wednesday whether Apple will get those waivers, Mr. Trump replied, \u201cWe\u2019ll look into that.\u201d On Wednesday, Mr. Trump called Mr. Cook a \u201cvery special person\u201d because of his ability to create jobs. He turned to Mr. Cook and said, \u201cWhat would you say about our economy compared to everybody else?\u201d Mr. Cook replied, \u201cI think we have the strongest economy in the world.\u201d \u201cStrongest in the world,\u201d Mr. Trump said. The president then took questions on the impeachment inquiry and launched into a tirade against \u201cthe fake press.\u201d Mr. Cook stood silently nearby.", "lang": "en"}
