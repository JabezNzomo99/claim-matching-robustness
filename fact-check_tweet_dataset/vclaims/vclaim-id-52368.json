However, it actually came from Earnhardt\u2019s daughter, Kelley, not his son, Dale Jr.\n\nThe anecdote can be heard in an April 2015 episode of the \u201cFast Lane Family\u201d podcast. The episode featured a Q&A with Kelley Earnhardt Miller about her father on what would have been his 64th birthday. She prefaced the story by saying that it was a good example of her dad\u2019s heart and how he cared for people.\n\n\u201cOn my dad\u2019s truck, he had this sticker with a rebel flag that said \u2018American by birth, Southern by the grace of God\u2019 or something like that, you know, had a rebel flag on it. At the time, we had a lot of different nannies that took care of us and we had this housekeeper named Ann, and she was the most awesome lady. She was an African-American lady, and she asked my stepmother about my dad\u2019s rebel flag on the back of his truck. \u201cAnd so the next thing we know my dad\u2019s out there with a knife and a razor blade, and he\u2019s cutting the rebel flag out of the sticker, he left \u201cAmerican by birth\u201d but he didn\u2019t want to offend anybody or make anybody mad in that manner. It was so sweet. It was a little kind-hearted thing. She just thought that was the best. She\u2019s like, \u2018That\u2019s just so awesome that you would do that.\u2019 He had a good heart.\u201d\n\nShe tells this story around the 24:30 mark of the following audio:\n\nA few months after the episode aired, Dale Earnhardt Jr., also a famous race-car driver, said he, too, was against the display of the Confederate flag. At the time, in June 2015, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was calling for the removal of the Confederate flag from the state house, and NASCAR had endorsed that position.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made my comments about the Confederate flag several times, and I stand behind NASCAR\u2019s stance to remove it \u2026 I think if it\u2019s offensive to an entire race, it really does nothing for anybody to be there flying. It belongs in the history books, that\u2019s about it.\u2019\u201d", "lang": "en"}
