Two different images, one of Kumar addressing a gathering in an animated way, and the other of the map, which includes Kashmir as part of Pakistan, had been edited to make this viral fake image. Kanhaiya Kumar's photograph sans the map in the background has been used by multiple news portals. BOOM debunked the same image when it was earlier viral in February this year.", "lang": "en"}
