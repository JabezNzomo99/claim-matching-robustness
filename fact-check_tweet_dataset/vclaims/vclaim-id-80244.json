However, the majority of the images shown in the video were actually captured days before Hurricane Florence in Japan, during Typhoon Jebi.\n\n\n\nThe video description, says in Spanish that the video was taken \u201ctwo hours ago in North Carolina,\u201d where Hurricane Florence wreaked havoc in mid-September, with flooding from several feet of rain and storm surge.\n\nTyphoon Jebi, the storm actually seen in the images, hit the Kansai region of Japan on September 3 and 4, killing at least 11 people and leaving hundreds wounded, according to AFP reporting.\n\nThe videos compiled in the Facebook post show real images but are incorrectly attributed. A Twitter user posted this video September 4, claiming it was recorded at the Koshien train station in Japan\u2019s Hyogo, where Typhoon Jebi made landfall that week.\n\nA Google Street View search confirms that the images show the area around the Koshien train station, between the cities of Kobe and Osaka.\n\nOther video clips in the Facebook post said to be from North Carolina on September 11 were also taken in Japan the week before. At the 1:35-minute mark of the compilation, a van crossing a bridge is seen tipping over and sliding around as it\u2019s buffeted about by wind gusts.\n\nThe video was first been posted on Twitter the previous week, also on September 4, by @DimyatiDewi, who said her friend had sent her the shots from Osaka, Japan, also during Typhoon Jebi.\n\nThe same thing happened with the clips starting at around the 40-second marks of the \u201cNorth Carolina\u201d video and continuing for about 15 seconds.\n\nOne, posted by @CRAZY904Kaz, again on September 4, shows the roof of the Kyoto train station collapsing, according to the tweet text and a report from the British newspaper Daily Mail. A description and pictures of the building before it was damaged can be seen on the station\u2019s website.\n\nAnother video, a clip of which is seen in the false \u201cNorth Carolina\u201d video from Facebook, was also posted on Twitter September 4.\n\nThe next bit of the Facebook compilation, seen at 55 seconds, had also been posted on Twitter September 4, with the user commenting, \u201cThis typhoon is so strong.\u201d\n\nEven without in-depth investigation, other parts of the viral video can clearly be seen to be from Japan. At around 35 seconds, a vending machine flies through the street in the wind with an obvious view of storefronts signs written in Japanese characters behind it.\n\nDespite the serious wind and water damage wreaked by Hurricane Florence in North Carolina and the rest of the region earlier this month, the compiled video images posted on Facebook were not from that storm, but instead from Typhoon Jebi in Japan the week before.\n\nThe post was also shared in other languages, including Arabic and Russian (which apologized for spreading false information) for a combined 7,000 shares. A post in English on the page of the public Facebook group called Conservative Party was later deleted.", "lang": "en"}
