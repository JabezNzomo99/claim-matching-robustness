The vaccine\u2019s active ingredient was part of a hormone known as hCG, which has to be present in a woman\u2019s body for her to fall pregnant.\n\nThe researchers coupled hCG to a protein similar to the tetanus toxin to make the vaccine. When a woman was given the vaccine, her immune system was activated to fight both the protein and the hCG hormone \u2013 effectively immunising her against pregnancy. The immunity could last up to two years.\n\nBut the contraceptive vaccine had nothing to do with the tetanus vaccine.\n\n\u201cThere is no connection between tetanus immunisation programmes and this small clinical trial, carried out in India in 1994, and not sponsored, supported, nor executed by WHO,\u201d\n\n, \u201cin order to discredit the development\u201d of a contraceptive vaccine, the Indian research was \u201cerroneously\u201d linked to tetanus immunisation programmes in other places in the world and \u201cdistorted to confuse people\u201d.\n\nThe hormone hCG needs to be present for a woman to fall pregnant. Higher amounts of it indicate pregnancy, so it\u2019s detected in pregnancy tests.\n\n, used the Indian research to demand that the US Congress\n\ncontinents away from India \u2013 in Mexico.\n\nthe anti-tetanus vaccine used in Mexico contained the hormone hCG, and would make women infertile.\n\nas \u201ccompletely false and totally without any scientific basis\u201d.\n\nBut the rumour got legs when people who believed it started testing tetanus vaccines for hCG, as Africa Check\u2019s Lee Mwiti\n\nIn Kenya and elsewhere,\n\nif the hormone was present in the tetanus vaccine, and the result was positive. Some people also\n\nAfter these tests were also positive for hCG, the rumour got wings. What the rumour-mongers did not know was that both methods were scientifically ill-equipped for testing vaccines.\n\nWHO and Catholic doctors confirm vaccine is safe\n\nWhen proper lab tests were conducted on the vaccines in six laboratories around the world \u2013 including a lab chosen by the Vatican \u2013 no hCG was found.\n\n\u201cHad we been informed from the very beginning, we would have advised them on alternative labs to take the tests to for accurate results and even interpreted the data correctly,\u201d Lancet chief executive Dr Ahmed Kalebi\n\nwhen the issue resurfaced in Kenya.\n\nIn 2014 catholic bishops in Kenya raised fears about the vaccine but the\n\n\u201cThe organisation confirms that the tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccine is safe,\u201d the WHO said. \u201cThe vaccine has been used in 52 countries, to immunise 130 million women to protect them and their newborn babies from tetanus. There is no hCG hormone in tetanus toxoid vaccines.\u201d\n\nAnd MaterCare International, an international group of Catholic obstetricians and gynaecologists,\n\nsaying: \u201cIf tetanus toxoid vaccines given to millions of women in many countries was capable of causing infertility there would by now be ample demographic data to confirm this. We know of no such data.\u201d\n\nUS fact-checking site Snopes has also\n\nand found it to be false. \u2013", "lang": "en"}
