No, that's not true: Local media reports say the fifth-generation cellular network is not available in the city. \"5G has nothing to do with it,\" a newspaper headline reads in Italian.\n\nThe claim first appeared in a post (archived here) published in Italian on YouTube by Cosa \u00e8 successo on April 6, 2020. Four days later, another post published by Liftin the Lid added English subtitles and titled the post \"5g antennas on fire in La Spezia, Italy on 6th April 2020\" (archived here).\n\nClick below to watch the English-version of the video on YouTube:\n\nBoth posts incorrectly said the towers were \"5G antennas.\" That is not true, according to Citt\u00e0 della Spezia, a newspaper serving the Italian port city.\n\nThe paper covered the fire and wrote (roughly translated by Google):\n\nThe article went on to report that the towers deployed older technology:\n\nLa Spezia is in the Liguria region in northwest Italy known as the Italian Rivieria. The paper said that the city does not currently have 5G wireless technology:\n\nThe Italian video post appeared to link the tower fire to the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, and suggested 5G was to blame. The caption for the video read (roughly translated by Google):\n\nLead Stories has previously debunked online rumors that 5G caused the coronavirus to spread like wildfire. This is simply untrue because the high-speed technology is not available in many of the countries that have seen outbreaks.\n\nExperts also say 5G is not believed to have a severe impact on public health, according to a report by the U.K. edition of Wired magazine:\n\nWe contacted the mobile phone company that apparently owned or operated the tower. The WINDTRE Press Office confirmed to us that the antenna in question did not have 5G equipment installed on it:\n\nConcerns over 5G have spawned online rumors and conspiracy theories that are being shared to scaremonger the public.
