Under this pseudonym, she wrote numerous books, including \u201cMiddlemarch\u201d and \u201cDaniel Deronda.\u201d\n\nHowever, nowhere in these works, or any of her others, does the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post appear. TheDCNF searched the George Eliot Archive, an online database of all her writings, as well as her letters, but found no matching expressions.\n\nSeveral experts also told TheDCNF that they did not recognize the quotation, with two noting that it didn\u2019t sound like something she would say.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t recognize it being George Eliot,\u201d said John Burton, chairman of the George Eliot Fellowship, in an email to TheDCNF. \u201cIt seems altogether too glib for her.\u201d\n\nThe website Quote Investigator \u201ctentatively\u201d credits F. O. Hamilton with penning the quote in an essay published by a Pennsylvania newspaper in 1938, though elements of the quote appeared earlier.\n\n\u201cThe ascription to George Eliot is unsupported,\u201d reads the post. \u201cThe quotation about smiling and frowning appeared adjacent to a statement about the purpose of life in Hamilton\u2019s essay. The latter statement was based on an authentic Eliot quotation.\u201d\n\nAccording to Quote Investigator, the proximity of Hamilton\u2019s statement to a \u201cstreamlined\u201d version of a line from Eliot\u2019s \u201cMiddlemarch\u201d likely confused readers, leading to the false attribution.\n\nCollege of Southern Nevada professor Adam Burgess ascribed a similar mechanism of misattribution to the quote.\n\n\u201cThe two quotes were further paraphrased in multiple printings of various sources throughout the 1940s and 1950s,\u201d he further explained an email to TheDCNF, \u201cuntil they became indistinguishable (and because Eliot was the more notable literary figure, her name became the one attached to the quote).\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
