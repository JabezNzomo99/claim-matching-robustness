Facebook users flagged the story as potentially being false, as part of the social media website\u2019s efforts to curtail fake news in users\u2019 news feeds.\n\nThe story said 39-year-old Rasheed Thompson was arrested in Chicago after neighbors reported suspicious activity. Police supposedly found the bodies while searching Thompson\u2019s home.\n\nThe post is made up, and it has changed a bit since first appearing early in 2016.\n\nThe earliest version we found was posted on the fake news site Now8News.com, going back to at least Feb. 18, 2016. It was set in Los Angeles, and involved a man identified only as \"Mathis,\" who hid 12 white women\u2019s bodies in a freezer marked \"Black Lives Matter.\"\n\nThat was followed up the same month by EmpireHerald.com, which wrote the version about Chicago\u2019s Thompson killing 19 women. The original link is gone, but the Internet Archive Wayback Machine has a record of the story.\n\nEmpireHerald.com, a site filled with fake stories, carries no disclaimers about how its content is fabricated. It first started promoting the story the same day as the News8Now.com post.\n\nThis version of the story ended up on several other websites throughout the year. None of the websites identified the story as fake.\n\nSome of the photographs often used to illustrate the story are of freezers really used to hide bodies, but aren\u2019t of the fictional Thompson or his victims.\n\nOne image showed a chest freezer used by a Japanese man who strangled his wife and hid the body for a decade. Another showed police removing a freezer in which a California man\u2019s body had been hidden after he was killed.\n\nBut this story and its details are fake. We rate it Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
