(If you missed out on that particular era of internet humor, keep reading to learn more.)\n\nIn May 2020, Snopes readers inquired about a rumor circulating on social media that caused them to fear the actor known for fighting Bruce Lee in the 1972 martial arts film \u201cThe Way of the Dragon\u201d and battling bad guys in the TV series \u201cWalker, Texas Ranger\u201d had succumbed to the COVID-19 coronavirus disease.\n\nNorris, 80, is alive and well, but he has been the target of death hoaxes in the past. In 2012, scammers used a Norris death hoax as a vehicle to circulate a survey scam on Facebook.\n\nWe sent a message to Norris\u2019s talent agency, MN2S, asking for information about Norris\u2019 health but received no response. However, no news stories have reported any illness that has befallen the actor. Reports that Norris died from the COVID-19 disease appear to be nothing more than a variation of a celebrity death hoax.\n\nSome social media users used the hoax as an opportunity to add to the unending list of \u201cChuck Norris facts,\u201d a long-running internet meme in which jokes about Norris\u2019 tough persona use extreme hyperbole.\n\n\u201cThis just in,\u201d one Twitter user wrote. \u201cCoronavirus has tested positive for Chuck Norris and is now in quarantine.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
