He posed a challenge to Congress: try living on $15,000 or less a year. (For most members, that would be more than a 90 percent pay cut.)\n\nA reader e-mail about this statement piqued our interest: Would raising the minimum wage really help someone making $15,000 or less a year \u201cmake ends meet\u201d? How would that affect the public-assistance benefits they were eligible to receive before the raise in pay? Obama\u2019s statement will not face a Pinocchio Test, as he never quite claimed that boosting the minimum wage would allow families to \u201cmake ends meet,\u201d but it certainly raises some interesting questions.\n\nThe White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates more than 28 million workers would benefit from the minimum wage increase; 19 million of them would benefit directly and the ripple effect from a shifting wage structure would help the rest. CEA calculations show raising the minimum wage would boost incomes for about 12 million people in poverty, and would lift 2 million out of poverty. This applies to a minimum-wage worker working full time, supporting a family of four and receiving tax credits. This does not take into account any public-assistance programs.\n\nIf the minimum wage is raised, families below the threshold would see about 2.8 percent increase on their average real income, or about $300, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. In general, when the minimum wage is increased and a person\u2019s income rises as a result, he or she pays more in taxes and receives less in benefits.\n\nIf the minimum wage increases to $10.10, some people who are currently eligible for Medicaid no longer would qualify. Some could qualify for subsidized coverage through health exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. But others who lose Medicaid eligibility may still not qualify to receive subsidies because their income is still too low (if they live in states that have not expanded Medicaid coverage), or may choose not to enroll because they would have to pay a portion of the premiums themselves, CBO found.\n\nWashington, D.C., and 22 states have raised their minimum wages above the federal minimum. The Urban Institute studied the impact in Washington, D.C., where the minimum wage is being raised from $8.25 to $11.50, by 2016. Among workers affected by this change, half participate in at least one means-tested program. One-third receive federal earned income tax credit, and 28 percent receive SNAP.\n\nA single parent of two children working at the $11.50 minimum makes $6,760 more in annual earnings. But the actual increase in disposable income \u2014 after benefits and taxes \u2014 for a parent receiving tax credits and SNAP is just $1,328. For a single parent participating in multiple programs (including TANF, housing, SNAP, WIC, utility assistance, tax credits), the disposable income only increases by $227. But since not all families collect all benefits, \u201cthe nightmare scenario you can create on a spreadsheet doesn\u2019t really apply in the real world,\u201d said Greg Acs, director of the Urban Institute\u2019s Income and Benefits Policy Center.\n\nIn Illinois, researchers at the right-leaning think tank Illinois Policy Institute studied the benefits \u201ccliff\u201d that low-wage workers face as they earn more pay. According to the December 2014 report, a single parent must \u201cincrease her or his hourly wage multitudes more in order to recover from the loss in benefits from the peak\u201d in net earned income and benefits before reaching the cliff.\n\nEarnings increase quicker than disposable income does. Each additional dollar of earnings is less than a dollar of additional disposable income, according to the CBO\u2019s 2012 report. The chart below shows the interaction between disposable income and earnings. (For those who want to indulge in the wonkery, this CBO report discusses at length marginal tax rates for low- to moderate-income workers.)\n\nLawmakers may not be able to live on $15,000 or less a year, but millions of Americans are. And setting policies to help them is a much more complex issue than Obama characterizes in his speech: \u201cOf course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages.\u201d This is especially true for the type of family he describes in his \u201cchallenge on Congress.\u201d\n\nYet raising the minimum wage too much could hurt workers, and could reduce their purchasing power by increasing the cost of goods and services. Employers may decide to cut jobs because it costs more to pay workers, or replace low-wage workers with machines, technology or more productive higher-wage workers, according to CBO. This demonstrates the dilemma lawmakers face when setting policies to help low-wage workers.", "lang": "en"}
