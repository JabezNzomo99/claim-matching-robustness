So we dusted off our multiplication tables and checked Obama's math.\n\nAccording to the Energy Information Administration, the U.S. imported 10,102,000 barrels per day of oil during the week ending Feb. 15. The average world price for a barrel of oil that same week was $89.91. That means energy firms spent $908 million on foreign oil daily in mid-February.\n\nObama's campaign said they used $100 for the price of a barrel of oil, a record reached Feb. 19 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n\nThat number has since dropped a bit \u2013 to $98.86 as of Friday afternoon. Redoing the math, what we spend abroad comes awfully close to the billion-dollar figure Obama quotes. It's 998.2 million.\n\nWe'll allow him to round up. Obama gets a gold star in math, and we find his statement True.", "lang": "en"}
