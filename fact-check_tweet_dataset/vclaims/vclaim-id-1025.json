Text alongside the photo claims the man standing in the middle is Chauvin.\n\nThis is incorrect. Mike Hartley, Deputy Chief of Bloomington Police told Reuters that the man pictured is Bloomington Officer Mike Gallagher, not Chauvin.\n\nGallagher can be seen speaking in a YouTube video about how winter weather creates more work for the Bloomington Police Department. The man in the video and the man in the photo are the same person. ( here )\n\nFalse. The man pictured alongside Trump is not Derek Chauvin but Bloomington Police Officer Mike Gallagher.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
