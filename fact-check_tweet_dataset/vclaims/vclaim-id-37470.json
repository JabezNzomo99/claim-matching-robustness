Rashida Tlaib was \u201ccaught on film trying to attack someone.\u201d The photo in question is actually from a 2016 Trump campaign event she protested.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a freshman congresswoman from Michigan, has made headlines in her first few days in office.\n\nBut she did not, as a false narrative spread on Facebook claims, get \u201ccaught on film trying to attack someone who called her out.\u201d\n\n\u201c[T]his is who they elected a psychopath who needs to be restrained from attacking some person in the public?\u201d the posts continue.\n\nThat erroneous assertion has in recent days circulated alongside a photo of Tlaib being forcefully moved by two men in suits.\n\nReverse image searches show that photo is actually from August 2016 \u2014 when Tlaib was among 14 protesters kicked out of a Detroit Economic Club event for heckling then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. The photo appeared on the website of the Michigan-based Arab American News, for example, on Aug. 11, 2016.\n\nWe could find no evidence to support the contention that she was \u201ctrying to attack someone.\u201d\n\nTlaib\u2019s communications director, Denzel McCampbell, emailed us the following statement from the congresswoman: \u201cThe photo is from when I was joined by 12 other women who asked a question of then-candidate Trump during his speech in Detroit. We were all individually removed from the event. My question was, \u2018Have you ever read the U.S. Constitution?'\u201d\n\nIn an interview with CNN last year, Tlaib called the act \u201cthe most American thing I could ever do.\u201d\n\nTlaib, one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress in 2018, has been the target of misinformation before.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nBurke, Daniel. \u201cMichigan Democrat likely to be first Muslim woman elected to Congress.\u201d CNN. 8 Aug 2018.\n\nHarb, Ali. \u201cTlaib: I protested Trump\u2019s speech for my children.\u201d The Arab American News. 11 Aug 2016.", "lang": "en"}
