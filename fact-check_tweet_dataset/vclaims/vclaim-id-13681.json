We saw similar claims from both parties in the run-up to last year\u2019s elections, but found that there wasn\u2019t a fair way to compare the two parties in this way.\n\nThe same is true this year. The Labour party\u2019s figure is, technically speaking, correct for England. The average council tax bill for eligible homes in 2019/20 will be \u00a31,168 in collecting councils with a majority Labour council, compared to \u00a31,519 in collecting councils with a majority Conservative council.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean council tax in those areas is lower because they have a Labour council. There are a number of other factors that affect the size of your council bill, beyond which party controls your collecting council.\n\nA major issue with Labour\u2019s calculation is that you often pay council tax to more than one body, which can be run by different political parties. This means that often no single party is responsible for every penny you pay: you can live in a Labour-run council and actually pay most of your bill to a Conservative-run body.\n\nIn England, there are two main local government structures\u2014single-tier and two-tier.\n\nIn single-tier structures, one council is responsible for providing the majority of local government services, and collecting council tax. Single tier councils include most cities, and all London boroughs.\n\nIn a two-tier system, you\u2019ll have two main councils. The county council provides county-wide services (like education, transport and social care), and within that area, separate district councils operate to provide other services, like bin collections and housing, and collecting council tax. You might also pay some additional \u201cprecepts\u201d to a town or parish council, or to police or fire authorities.\n\nThat means that in two-tier areas the council collecting your council tax isn\u2019t setting the whole amount, and so Labour\u2019s comparison isn\u2019t very meaningful.\n\nTake, for instance, the 26 shire district councils that are run by the Labour party. In these councils, a portion of council tax is paid to the Labour-run district council, but a much larger sum is paid to the county council. Almost all county councils in England are run by the Conservative party.\n\nSo even though the average council tax bill per dwelling in Labour-run Burnley is a relatively low \u00a31,096 in 2019/20, most of that bill is set by Conservative-run Lancashire county council.\n\nThere is no perfect measure of average council tax bills\n\nHow you choose to calculate the value of the average council tax bill in any given area can also affect the figure you come up with, and no measure is perfect.\n\nOne alternative measure is the average bill for a two-person household in a \u201cband D\u201d property in any given council (bands in England are based on the value of a home in 1991). This gives a consistent benchmark, and \u201chas historically been used as the standard for comparing council tax levels between and across local authorities.\u201d On this measure, the average band D bill in Labour-run councils is around \u00a330 lower than Conservative councils (but the same problems as outlined above still apply to this calculation).\n\nAn additional problem with this measure is that it may not accurately reflect the typical bill in a council if it has few Band D homes. Almost two thirds of homes in England are in a cheaper bracket than Band D.\n\nCentral government can affect your bill too\n\nAnother issue is that central government decisions can affect the size of your council tax bill too.\n\nYour council tax bill pays for a number of local services, including education, transport, policing, and social care. Decisions made on these areas at central government level can have knock-on effect on how local authorities have to fund them, with potential increases in council tax as a result.\n\nFor instance, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has found that government plans to abolish certain grants for councils mean they will be more dependent on raising money through council tax and business rates and particularly \u201crisk a growing funding gap for adult social care\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
