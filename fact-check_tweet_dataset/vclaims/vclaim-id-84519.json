It was just few weeks ago, Zee had brought us the headline, \u201cShocking! Kashmir labelled as \u2018Indian Occupied\u2019 in UP Congress booklet.\u201d Zee News has now been caught in the same situation.\n\nAn article titled, \u201cWatch Kashmiri youth celebrate after India\u2019s defeat in ICC Champions Trophy final\u201d reported, \u201cShockingly, people in Indian occupied Kashmir were seen bursting crackers to celebrate Pakistan\u2019s win.\u201d Indian occupied Kashmir? No, this is not a page out of a Pakistani newspaper but a sentence from a Zee News report.\n\nThe article has now been deleted from the Zee News website. You can view the archived version here and the google cache version here.\n\nThe gaffe did not go unnoticed and Twitter users mocked Zee News for their \u201cadmission\u201d of an Indian occupied Kashmir.\n\nZee News, known for its hyper-nationalism had recently called for a boycott of the India-Pakistan cricket match at the Champion\u2019s trophy with its hashtag #SabseBadaDroh. The channel has taken upon itself the task of \u201cexposing fake nationalists today both in media and politics\u201d.\n\nFew weeks ago when Zee News carried the story of a similar gaffe by UP Congress, its story started with the sentence \u201cHowever, it was not immediately known whether it was done deliberately or it was a goof up.\u201d\n\nWe will not use the same sentence for Zee because we believe that such genuine goof-ups do happen. It is about time the channel steps down from its moral high ground and applies to itself the same standards that it preaches to others.", "lang": "en"}
