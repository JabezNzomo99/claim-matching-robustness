Many critics of the protests directed blame at U.S. President Donald Trump for encouraging the protests with his tweets calling for residents to \u201cliberate\u201d their states. According to USA Today:\n\nDemocratic and Republican governors pushed back on President Donald Trump\u2019s tweets to \u201cliberate\u201d states where people protested social distancing measures enacted to slow the spread of the coronavirus. \u201cLIBERATE MINNESOTA!\u201d the president exclaimed in one tweet. \u201cLIBERATE MICHIGAN!\u201d he cried in another. \u201cLIBERATE VIRGINIA! and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!\u201d he wrote in a third. Gov. Jay Inslee, D-Wash. \u2014 who said that Trump\u2019s \u201cunhinged rantings and calls for people to \u2018liberate\u2019 states could also lead to violence\u201d \u2014 told ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week\u201d that Trump\u2019s tweets were \u201cdangerous\u201d because some might take them as encouragement to ignore stay-at-home orders and other measures intended to stop the spread of the virus, which has killed more than 40,000 Americans. \u201cI don\u2019t know any other way to characterize it,\u201d Inslee said, expressing disbelief at seeing the \u201cpresident of the United States basically encourage insubordination\u201d against laws \u201cdesigned to protect people\u2019s health.\u201d \u201cIt is dangerous because it can inspire people to ignore things that actually can save their lives,\u201d Inslee said.\n\nIn the aftermath of those demonstrations, many social media posts featured photographs of the protesters and sought to poke fun at, or demonstrate the recklessness of, their actions and attitudes. One such post in the former category highlighted demonstrators holding up signs that read \u201cSave My Right to Die,\u201d \u201cDefund Science,\u201d and \u201cMy Virus, My Choice\u201d:\n\nAlthough detractors might argue that the sentiments displayed in the above image are representative of a lack of rationality exhibited in many protest signs and arguments wielded by anti-lockdown demonstrators, this image does not reflect the true content of the protest signs carried at the demonstration it captures. It\u2019s an altered version of a photograph of demonstrators taken by Jason Connolly of AFP at the Colorado State Capitol building in Denver during a \u201cReOpen Colorado\u201d rally on April 19, 2020. The original versions of the signs read \u201cFear Is the Real Virus,\u201d \u201cReopen CO Now,\u201d and \u201cThis \u2018Cure\u2019 Is Deadlier Than Covid\u201d:", "lang": "en"}
