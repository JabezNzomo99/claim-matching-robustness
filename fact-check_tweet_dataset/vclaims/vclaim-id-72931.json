Gov. Dan Patrick told Austin radio station KLBJ AM.\n\nIn the Feb. 25, 2015 interview, , Patrick said: \"We are in the best financial shape of any state in the country. We\u2019ll have about $11 billion or so in our rainy day fund by the end of our fiscal year. That\u2019s more money in reserve than the other 49 states combined.\"\n\nThis fiscal year runs through August 2015. Could it be that Texas will have more money in its rainy day fund than all other states combined?\n\nWe emailed Patrick\u2019s office to seek the basis of his statement and to gauge if he was trying to make an uncheckable prediction\u2014rather than a flat factual statement. We also looked for the latest information on each state\u2019s expected fiscal-year-end reserves.\n\nThe Texas state comptroller, Glenn Hegar, issued his two-year in January 2015. Hegar said the state\u2019s rainy day fund will have a balance of nearly $8.5 billion when fiscal 2015 ends Aug. 31, 2015. Hegar projected the fund to grow to $9.8 billion a year later and to $11 billion through August 2017.\n\nPer Patrick\u2019s statement, then, all the other states together should be expecting to end their 2015 fiscal years with less than $8.5 billion, combined.\n\nAn online search led us to a by the National Association of State Budget Officers initially making us think Patrick was onto something. In the report, The Fiscal Survey of States, a section headlined \"Year-End Balances\" said that generally, states have made progress rebuilding budgetary reserves since revenues plummeted during the Great Recession of 2009-10. State budgets passed into law for the 2015 fiscal year show reserve balances nationally totaling $53.1 billion, the report said. And, the report said, \"a disproportionate share of state budget reserves are concentrated in Alaska and Texas, which account for $20.6 billion or 38.8 percent of states reported total balances in fiscal 2015.\"\n\nFor more perspective, we sought guidance from the Pew Charitable Trusts, which in July 2014 issued a on how states might build rainy day funds. By email, spokeswoman Sarah Leiseca passed along analyst Brenna Erford\u2019s conclusion--drawing on , a Pew interactive breaking out the fiscal status of each state--that Patrick got it wrong.\n\nAt the moment, per Pew, Texas has $10.3 billion in reserve funds (rainy day funds plus ending balances) providing enough for state government to operate for 79.1 days. \"The only state with more reserve funds currently is Alaska, with $13.3 billion, providing enough for the state to operate for 181.9 days,\" Erford said.\n\nSOURCE: Online interactive, , Pew Charitable Trusts (chart received in an email from Sarah Leiseca, communications officer, Pew Charitable Trusts, attributing information to research by Brenna Erford, manager, state budget policy team, Pew Charitable Trusts, Feb. 26, 2015).\n\nGoing forward, Erford noted, the NASBO fall 2014 report indicates Texas projecting a reserve balance of about $8 billion through the end of the 2015 fiscal year, which would run second to the projected year-end reserves for Alaska, $11.4 billion. \"According to these data, the sum total of reserves in California, New York, Ohio, Massachusetts, Florida, and Indiana, is greater than Texas\u2019 reserves, providing clear evidence, Alaska withstanding, that Texas\u2019 reserves are not more \u2018than the other 49 states combined,\u2019\" Erford said.\n\nWith a nudge from , a state budget expert at the Washington, D.C.-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, we spotted charts in the NASBO report indicating the 50 states together in fall 2014 were projecting 2015 fiscal-year-end reserves, meaning regular balances plus rainy day fund set-asides, of about $53 billion--with Texas accounting for $10.7 billion of that and Alaska $10 billion and other states all together projecting nearly $32 billion in ending reserves. An adjoining chart indicates Texas ending fiscal 2015 with $8 billion in its rainy day fund alone compared to other states together winding up with about $34 billion in such funds.\n\nTexas appears to have bigger balances than many states. But its predicted totals don\u2019t dwarf all other states\u2019 projected savings combined.\n\nAfter we looked over the charts, Patrick\u2019s office told us Patrick made \"an unintentional error\" in the radio interview. By email, spokesman Alejandro Garcia said Patrick takes pride in the state stockpiling reserves, but he\u2019d meant to talk up jobs created in Texas versus jobs created in all other states combined \"as he ad-libbed the comment.\"\n\nPatrick said Texas this year will \"have more money in reserve than the other 49 states combined.\"\n\nOn our inquiry, Patrick acknowledged this was a misstatement. Indeed, what he celebrated turned out to be incorrect and ridiculous.\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
