But whether Issa \u201cwouldn\u2019t oppose\u201d the health-care replacement backed by President Trump is a matter of dispute. Save My Care pointed to a variety of news articles in which Issa indicated that changes made in the bill to attract votes had swung him toward a \u201cyes\u201d position. The right-leaning American Action Network even ran an ad thanking Issa even though a vote never took place.\n\nBut Calvin Moore, Issa\u2019s communications director, said Issa never supported the bill: \u201cThe congressman said that the bill wasn\u2019t \u2018in a form that I can approve of,\u2019 then followed it up later on Fox News, telling the network that he\u2019s \u2018not prepared to vote for it as is right now.\u2019\u201d He said that Issa raised concerns that the bill wouldn\u2019t do enough for mental health, that it could leave many \u2014 particularly those nearing retirement \u2014 worse off, and that it didn\u2019t do enough to expand the risk pools to help curb some of the premium increases in Obamacare. Issa has proposed to open the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan (FEHBP) to all Americans.\n\nMoore said the AHCA had been improved, which is why Issa said he was leaning toward a yes, but it still had not won Issa\u2019s support when it was pulled from a vote. He noted that after the bill was pulled, Issa issued a statement calling the bill \u201cimperfect\u201d and said lawmakers need to get \u201cback to the drawing board.\u201d\n\nThe CBO projected the impact of the AHCA compared to existing law, and concluded that 24 million fewer people would have health insurance by 2026. As the CBO put it, \u201cthe increase in the number of uninsured people relative to the number under current law would rise to 21 million in 2020 and then to 24 million in 2026.\u201d But that does not mean that all of those people involuntarily lost their insurance, as the ad suggests.\n\nInitially, CBO said, many of the people who would be uninsured would choose not to have insurance because they had decided to obtain health insurance only to avoid a penalty under the ACA\u2019s individual mandate; the replacement bill eliminated the mandate. Others, such as elderly Americans, would not get insurance because the premiums would become higher for the elderly. But by 2026, 14 million of the uninsured people would lose insurance because of reductions in Medicaid enrollment \u2014 after some states discontinue the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. By 2026, 7 million fewer people also would have health insurance through their employers, CBO estimated.\n\nBut the reasons for the decrease were not necessarily favorable for the proposed law. That\u2019s because insurance premiums would spike for older people (20 to 25 percent higher for a 64-year-old) and many older people would drop out of the insurance markets. Then the pool of people getting insurance would be younger and healthier, leading to lower premiums than currently projected. The Brookings Institution, in an effort to come up with an apples-to-apples comparison, estimated that premiums under the proposed law would actually be 13 percent higher if adjusted for coverage and age.\n\n\u201cAge tax\u201d is a phrase coined by AARP, the old-age interest group, to refer to the fact that proposed law would have changed the Obamacare requirement that older people could pay no more than three times a young person. Under the AHCA, the 3:1 ratio would have become 5:1. The result, as noted above, would have meant premiums would have dropped for younger Americans, relative to current law, but increased sharply for older Americans.\n\nOne of the most popular features of the ACA is its ban on insurance companies considering preexisting conditions. But conservative Republicans have pushed for changes that experts say could undermine that aspect of the law, such as allowing states to opt out of a requirement to provide certain benefits and charge the same price to everyone the same age. Save My Care says this line is based on the fact that Issa has not stated a position on these proposals. The bill was amended just before Congress went on recess, but the amendment did not include the broader changes sought by conservatives.\n\nThe ad is carefully worded, apparently in an effort to avoid becoming fact-checker bait. We noted our concern about the phrasing concerning the 24 million losing insurance, but even that did not push the envelope as much as many Democrats have in the past. The ad also leaps to a conclusion that Issa \u201cisn\u2019t fighting\u201d to provide coverage for preexisting conditions, when he has indeed been a supporter of that aspect of Obamacare.\n\nAlso missing, of course, is any notion that there are serious problems with the Affordable Care Act, including higher premiums and shrinking insurance options, that Congress at some point needs to tackle. Issa certainly has been a critic of Obamacare, but unlike the suggestion in this ad, he never fully embraced the House Republican bill either. Readers should always be wary of the claims made in 30-second attack ads, as the truth often is much more complex.", "lang": "en"}
