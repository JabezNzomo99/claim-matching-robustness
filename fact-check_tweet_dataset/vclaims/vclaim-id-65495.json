This video was posted by at least 4 other pages and accounts in 2018, and was being shared again in July 2020.\n\n\"Isa siya sa mga galamay at suportado ng founder ng mga Teroristang CPP-NPA-NDF na si Jose Maria Sison,\" read one frame of the video. (She is one of the tentacles and one of those supported by the founder of the terrorist CPP-NPA-NDF [National Democratic Front], Jose Maria Sison.)\n\nA reverse image search showed that the original photo was published in an Associated Press report. The woman in the photo is not Elago, but a 24-year-old NPA guerrilla with the nom de guerre \"Comrade Katryn.\" The photo was taken on November 23, 2016 by Aaron Favila.\n\nThe youth representative is often targeted by disinformation on social media. Rappler has debunked multiple manipulated and out-of-context photos that were used to link Elago to the CPP-NPA. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
