Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley. Some Democrats say that the schedule of six debates including some on weekends limits voters\u2019 exposure, giving Clinton an edge.\n\nBut Wasserman Schultz says ratings show that voters have had plenty of TV face time with the Democratic candidates.\n\n\"In fact, our first debate beat at least two of the Republican debates. And our last debate, compared to the Republican last debate, was just a little bit less than theirs,\" the Democratic National Committee chair told Jan. 17, hours before the debate over the Martin Luther King weekend in Charleston.\n\n\"Brian, there's no number of debates that will satisfy everyone. So, I did my best to make sure, along with my staff and along with our debate partners, to come up with a schedule that we felt was going to maximize the opportunity for voters to see our candidates.\"\n\nClearly, we can't rate what people within the Democratic party intended. Our fact-check looks at what the outcome was. Did the Democrats \"maximize the opportunity\" for voters to see their candidates? We found there\u2019s no fair reading of the Democratic debate schedule that supports this.\n\nThe Democrats scheduled ; the (plus one more in March that is unscheduled).\n\nSo far, Democrats have held four debates with a cumulative viewership of about 42.5 million while Republicans have held six debates with a cumulative viewership of about 103.7 million, according to Nielsen ratings of same-day viewership.\n\nBack in 2008, when Barack Obama won the nomination, the Democrats held about 25 primary debates while the Republicans held 21.\n\nOverall, it looks like the GOP is doing a significantly better job of reaching viewers.\n\nIn defense of Wasserman Schultz\u2019s statement, DNC spokesman Sean Bartlett raised several points:\n\u2022 There are more GOP candidates than Democratic candidates. At the outset of the 2016 race, there were 17 Republican candidates but only five Democratic candidates.\n\u2022 Only topped the Democrats\u2019 lowest rated debate this cycle.\n\u2022 The first Democratic debate drew 15.8 million viewers, surpassing the viewership of three of the Republican debates this cycle.\n\u2022 All but one of the Democratic debates are on broadcast network TV, which makes it more likely for people without cable to tune into the debates.\n\u2022 The schedule of one debate a month for six months doesn\u2019t pull the candidates away from town halls and other events with voters.\n\nStill, Wasserman Schultz has faced constant questions about the debate schedule, specifically whether it was intended to help Clinton or minimize viewership.\n\n\"That\u2019s ridiculous,\" she said on Jan. 11 in Broward County. \"I don\u2019t know how many times I have to say it.\"\n\nShe said that the Sunday debate in Charleston -- the city where nine African-Americans were killed at a church in 2015 -- was a recommendation by the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and NBC to coincide with Martin Luther King weekend.\n\nWe contacted five professors of political science and communications. None of them bought Wasserman Schultz\u2019s statement.\n\n\"By the time voting starts in Iowa, potential voters will have seen about 40 percent less of Democratic candidates on the debate stage than their Republican counterparts,\" University of Michigan\u2019s Director of Debate Aaron Kall told PolitiFact.\n\nKall cited several factors contributing to the larger Republican viewership:\n\u2022 The first Republican debate occurred in early August, before the start of the NFL and NCAA college football seasons. Viewer anticipation is usually highest for the first debate. The Democrats didn't host their first debate until over two months later.\n\u2022 Of the four Democratic debates so far, three were on weekends, including the Dec. 19 debate a week before Christmas and the same night as the New York Jets vs. Dallas Cowboys NFL game. The Jan. 17 debate was the day before the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day holiday.\n\nKall cited two major factors beyond the Democrats\u2019 control that have aided superior Republican ratings: a much larger GOP field and the phenomenon of Donald Trump, an entertainment star in his own right from his time on The Apprentice.\n\nJohn Schroeder at Northeastern University noted that the two highest Republican debates each drew between 23 million and 24 million, much higher than the Democratic debates. While a lot of the disparity is due to Trump, another factor is that all the Republican debates so far have been held on weekdays.\n\n\"I think we can safely say that weekend time slots are not the key to maximizing the viewing audience,\" Schroeder said.\n\nWasserman Schultz says the party came up with a debate schedule \"to maximize the opportunity for voters to see our candidates.\"\n\nWasserman Schultz\u2019s best point is that the Democrats largely scheduled their debates with TV networks, which means viewers without cable can see them. But other than that, her statement is very disingenuous.\n\nThere are six Democratic party debates compared with 11 scheduled for the Republicans, and half of the Democratic debates are on weekends -- including one the weekend before Christmas and another on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend. If the Democrats had wanted to \"maximize\" opportunities for viewers, the party could have added more debates, scheduled them on weekdays and avoided holidays.", "lang": "en"}
