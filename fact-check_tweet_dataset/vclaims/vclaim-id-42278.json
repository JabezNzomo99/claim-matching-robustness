It was actually taken in Akpatoeme, a village in Ghana.\n\nBut a reverse image search on Google reveals the photo had already been posted on Facebook on November 21, 2018. That post calls on Ghana\u2019s First Lady Rebecca Akufo-Addo to help provide clean water in Akpatoeme, a village near the border with Togo.\n\nThe man who published the post, Ahiabli Ernest, told AFP he took the photograph. He also sent AFP more photos which he said were taken by his sister, which resemble the one posted on Facebook.\n\n\u201cThis is not Cameroon. This is my village,\u201d Ernest told AFP. \u201cWe urgently need help. My people are truly in pain. A friend of mine wrote an article on it but we are not hearing anything.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
