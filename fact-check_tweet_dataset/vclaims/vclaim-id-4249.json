These are apparently the words of former President Pranab Mukherjee, according to a Facebook page \u092c\u093e\u0930 \u092c\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 (Baar Baar Modi Sarkar) which has shared this quotation along with the words \u201c\u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0906\u092a \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0923\u092c \u092e\u0941\u0959\u0930\u094d\u091c\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u092c\u093e\u0924 \u0938\u0947 \u0938\u0939\u092e\u0924 \u0939\u0948\u0902?\u201d (Do you agree with Pranab Mukherjee?) The quote has been shared more than 2500 times since it was posted on June 22.\n\nIt has also been posted by individual users on the social media platform. Most of these posts are from May 2018.\n\nSearching online for this quotation, we found that the Oriental Times website had published an article around this quote on May 27, 2018.\n\nAlt News contacted the office of the former President. In a clarification, the office of Pranab Mukherjee stated, \u201cThe statement attributed to him is false and baseless. He has never said anything of this sort.\u201d\n\nPranab Mukherjee is a favourite of the right-wing fake news machinery on social media. In the last few weeks and months, the former President\u2019s name has been used to spread fake quotes in which he severely berates the Congress Party. Consider the following instances:\n\n\u201cAfter PM Modi completed one year of his term in office, I praised him for the work done so far, on which Sonia Gandhi took umbrage and became angry\u2026\u201d The Facebook page of the fake news website, Postcard Newsposted this excerpt from former President\u2019s book that expressed his admiration for PM Modi and displeasure with Sonia Gandhi. This extract turned out to be fake. Mukherjee\u2019s latest book The Coalition Years chronicled events from 2004 to 2012, before Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister.\n\nWhen Pranab Mukherjee attended an RSS event at the RSS headquarters in Nagpur, a photograph emerged on social media showing him in the trademark RSS cap and doing the traditional RSS salutation.\n\nAlt News found that the photoshopped picture was the handiwork of a social media user who is followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Twitter.\n\nNumerous fake quotations have been attributed to Mukherjee in recent times. \u201cSonia Gandhi hates Hindus\u201d, \u201cI am not a slave like Manmohan Singh\u201d, \u201cCongress perceived as anti-national outfit, will be finished in 2019\u201d, etc. are a few examples, all of which are patently fake.\n\nMost of the fake quotations ascribed to Mukherjee are falsely claimed to be from the books he has penned. However, this particular quote was simply conjured up and betrays a conscious and clear attempt to portray the former President as sympathetic to the cause of the BJP/RSS.", "lang": "en"}
