It comes from analysis of government survey data from 2014 by campaigners for a frequent flyer levy.\n\nIn March 2014 the survey asked a random selection of 1,000 adults in Great Britain how many trips by plane they\u2019d taken in the last 12 months. 52% hadn\u2019t flown at all. 15% of people had flown three or more times and have been called \u2018frequent flyers\u2019.\n\nOne of the researchers shared their analysis with us. A more detailed breakdown of responses shows that those 15% of flyers made 70% of the total flights.\n\nWe asked the Department for Transport, which designed the survey, about this claim. It said a more precise estimate is that the 15% of adults in Great Britain who made 3 or more flights (our frequent fliers) made 71% of flights from March 2013 to March 2014.\n\nThe same survey asked about what types of flights people had taken. 7% had flown domestically, 37% short-haul within Europe, and 18% long-distance. People could choose more than one option, so we can\u2019t separate domestic flyers from international ones.\n\nA bigger survey, The National Travel Survey, asks 18,000 people in England how many times they flew abroad in the last year. In 2015, it found 12% of people had flown three or more times. The figures are less detailed, so we can\u2019t calculate the percentage of flights those people accounted for in the same way.", "lang": "en"}
