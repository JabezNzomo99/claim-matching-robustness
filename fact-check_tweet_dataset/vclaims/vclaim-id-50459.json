People with shortness of breath should contact a doctor and then make sure to follow the local protocols for when, whether and how to turn up for an exam.\u201d\n\nShortness of breath and coughing have both been listed by the NHS and Public Health England as symptoms, and the former recommends self-isolating for seven days if you suspect you are infected. The latest advice from the NHS is available here.\n\nThe claim that consuming liquids will prevent you catching the virus is also incorrect and the World Health Organisation has said: \u201cWhile staying hydrated by drinking water is important for overall health, it does not prevent coronavirus infection.\u201d\n\nProfessor Neuman says \u201cthis advice has a kernel of truth, but is mostly bonkers\u201d, but he also adds that staying hydrated while ill is a good idea in general.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe virus that causes COVID-19 can only enter a cell that has just the right proteins on the outside, and those are only commonly found in two places in the body\u2014mainly in the lungs, on a cell called a type II pneumocytes, but also in the small and large intestines.\n\n\u201cFor most people, infection will begin and end in the lungs, as the virus moves between the cells that it is able to enter. But for a smaller number of infected people, the virus will cause diarrhoea, most likely by infecting those cells in the inner lining of the intestine.\n\n\u201cUsually the acid in the stomach would be enough to break down the virus so that it becomes harmless, but it happens often enough that the virus seems to arrive at the intestines in one piece that the idea of deliberately pushing the virus to the intestines doesn't make a lot of sense.\n\nWhen asked about the claims, Public Health England told Full Fact that they recommend people stick to current NHS advice.\n\nThe World Health Organisation and NHS England have both provided clear guidance on how to protect yourself from the virus and what to do if you start to experience symptoms. We\u2019ve got more details on the NHS\u2019s advice here.", "lang": "en"}
