Streep\u201d Facebook page posted the following item and photograph about the actress\u2019 supposed experience auditioning for the 1976 film \u201cKing Kong\u201d and being told that she was too \u201cugly\u201d for the role:\n\nThis post was based on an underlying truth: During a January 2015 appearance on \u201cThe Graham Norton Show,\u201d Streep described how at the beginning of her film career she was up for role of the female lead in a mid-1970\u2019s remake of \u201cKing Kong,\u201d produced by Italian filmmaker Dino De Laurentiis. De Laurentiis\u2019 son, having spotted Streep in a play, brought her to meet his father for consideration for the role. At that meeting, according to Streep, the elder De Laurentiis asked his son in Italian, \u201cWhy do you bring me this ugly thing?\u201d to which Streep replied, also in Italian, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not beautiful enough to be in \u2018King Kong'\u201d:\n\nHowever, the Facebook post reproduced above departed from literal accuracy in several aspects:\n\u2022 It did not originate with Meryl Streep herself, but with a (since deactivated) fan page.\n\u2022 The wording of this post does not reflect what Streep herself said about the incident (i.e., she didn\u2019t maintain that she responded to De Laurentiis\u2019 insult by proclaiming, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you think I\u2019m too ugly for your film, but you\u2019re just one opinion in a sea of thousands, and I\u2019m off to find a kinder tide\u201d).\n\u2022 The photograph of Streep did not capture her riding the subway on her way home from the failed \u201cKing Kong\u201d audition. The picture of her used in the Facebook post was taken several years later, in 1981.\n\u2022 Meryl Streep does not have \u201c18 Academy Awards.\u201d She had received 18 nominations at the time this Facebook post appeared, but she won the award in only three of those instances.\n\nThe role that Streep missed out on went to another relatively unknown actress of similar age making her big screen debut, Jessica Lange.", "lang": "en"}
