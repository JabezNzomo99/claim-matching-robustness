The title of the document reads, \u2018Guidelines on reopen of schools in Telangana in 2020-2021 academic year due to COVID-2019(sic)\u2019.\n\nAccording to the list, high schools will be re-opened on July 1, 2020, whereas, primary schools will be opened on August 1, 2020.\n\nThe caption of the post reads: \u2018Guidelines for Schools in Telangana to reopen for the academic year 2020-21\u2018.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above claim and found it to be FAKE.\n\nWe carefully examined the document and found that it was full of grammatical errors, which is highly unlikely in an official government document.\n\nGovernment sources, also, confirmed that no such guidelines have been released by the government and the claims are baseless.\n\nIn fact, the Press Information Bureau (PIB), Telangana, in a tweet, explicitly clarified that this information is untrue. It is abundantly clear that both the document and the claim being made are FAKE.
