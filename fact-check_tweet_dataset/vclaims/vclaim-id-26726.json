But if they lie to us it\u2019s politics.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Murray said this quote. It likely got linked to him after a parody Twitter account tweeted the statement in 2013.\n\nAn award-winning actor with a career spanning more than four decades, Murray has starred in dozens of films, including \u201cGhostbusters\u201d and \u201cGroundhog Day.\u201d (RELATED: Did Groucho Marx Say, \u2018Politics Is The Art Of Looking For Trouble\u2019?)\n\nAlthough Murray has spoken publicly about politics in the past, there is no evidence that he ever made the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. An internet search revealed no credible sources linking the quote to the \u201cGhostbusters\u201d actor.\n\nIt likely got attributed to Murray after a Twitter account with the same name tweeted the quote in 2013, even though the account disclaims in its bio that it is not Murray\u2019s official Twitter, but rather a parody account. (Murray doesn\u2019t have a Twitter account, according to The New Yorker.)\n\n\u201cI AM NOT BILL MURRAY,\u201d reads the account\u2019s bio. \u201cThis is a parody account. This account is not in any way affiliated with the actor Bill Murray.\u201d\n\nThe exact origin of the expression is unknown, but variations have appeared in print since at least 1987, according to etymologist Barry Popik.", "lang": "en"}
