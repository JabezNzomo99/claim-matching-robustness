The posts cite alleged inconsistencies in what the former vice president was wearing as evidence that his speech accepting the Democratic nomination for president was pre-recorded. This claim is false.\n\nExamples of this claim can be seen here , here and here.\n\nThe posts falsely claim that the appearance of an American flag pin on Biden\u2019s left lapel and a watch on his left wrist are inconsistent during his speech and the on-stage celebration with Senator Kamala Harris and their respective spouses that followed. A link to footage of the entire fourth night of the Democratic National Convention can be found here , with Biden\u2019s speech accepting the party\u2019s nomination starting at the 1:47:38 mark (youtu.be/P7RkSA_f7Tc?t=6458).\n\nContrary to what the posts claim, Biden\u2019s appearance remains consistent during and after his speech. The American flag pin on his left lapel can be seen throughout most of the speech, except in a few moments, like at 1:48:13 (youtu.be/P7RkSA_f7Tc?t=6493), when it is obscured by a gesticulating left hand. After the speech, the pin is visible again at 2:16:36 as he claps on stage behind his wife, Dr. Jill Biden (youtu.be/P7RkSA_f7Tc?t=8196), and again at 2:22:23 as he reaches for Senator Harris\u2019s right hand (youtu.be/P7RkSA_f7Tc?t=8543).\n\nThough the watch is most visible after the speech, as he stands on stage raising up Harris\u2019s hand with his own, he is still wearing it during the speech itself. It is mostly unseen during the speech because it is underneath his shirt and jacket sleeve. A glimpse of the watch can be seen at the 1:48:40 mark (youtu.be/P7RkSA_f7Tc?t=6520) when the Democratic nominee raises both hands from the podium and says, \u201cWe will choose hope over fear, facts over fiction, fairness over privilege.\u201d\n\nKevin Lamarque, a Reuters photographer who was on the scene during Biden\u2019s speech in Wilmington, confirmed that it was, in fact, broadcast live (Lamarque\u2019s photographs from the event are visible here ).\n\nFalse. Joe Biden\u2019s speech accepting the Democratic nomination for president was not pre-recorded.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
