The UK government has also said the same, and the WHO has not come out to counter that Granato is alive.\n\nLast week, a blog post (archived here) widely shared online claimed that microbiologist Elisa Granato, one of the volunteers who took part in a coronavirus vaccine trial in Oxford, U.K., had died following complications after receiving the vaccine.\n\nOpera News, a Nigerian pop platform financed by Chinese media entrepreneurs, further added that it sourced the report from another blog. Meanwhile, the referenced blog\u2019s publication had within three days about 80,000 views, the highest it\u2019s attained since its debut two years ago.\n\nFurthermore, the piece referenced a statement by unnamed researchers that Ms Granato \u201cdied two days after the vaccine was administered,\u201d adding that four other volunteers were battling complications from the jab.\n\nDubawa gathered that scientists at the Oxford University first administered the trial vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 to Elisa Granato. She was reportedly the first of two volunteers \u2014 the other being Edward O\u2019Neill for the potential COVID-19 vaccine testing on Thursday, April 23rd.\n\nHowever, contrary to swirling news of her demise, Ms Granato, all smiles, came out to say she was \u201cvery much alive\u201d. A BBC Subsay video shared the revelation, featuring Granato sipping coffee.\n\nAlso, the UK Department of Health and Social Care has, in a tweet, debunked the reported \u201cdeath\u201d as \u201ccompletely untrue.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the World Health Organization, which is at the frontline of the fight against COVID-19, never attested to the demise of Ms Granato.\n\nMoreover, the Guardian UK and Reuters already debunked the false report, stating that the University of Oxford News Office confirms that Ms Granato was \u201calive and well\u201d.\n\nNot only does the blog that carried the report of Ms Granato\u2019s death not have any social media presence, but it also does not have an about page or any contact information. The same is true of its sole writer.\n\nDubawa\u2019s check on the site also showed that it is rife with false reports, one of which says Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari had contracted coronavirus. This information is, of course, wrong as Mr Buhari still addressed Nigerians Monday, April 27th.\n\nElisa Granato, a volunteer in a trial of a potential COVID-19 jab at Oxford University, said she is very much alive. The UK government has also said the same, and the WHO has not come out to counter that Granato is alive. Besides, the sheer amount of false reports present on the site questions its reliability.", "lang": "en"}
