No, that's not true: the news was invented by a Facebook page that was set up to troll conservatives and Trump supporters into sharing fake news so the fans of the page can then laugh at them. It is not real, the story did not happen.\n\nA meme making the claim originated in a post published on June 16, 2018 by Facebook page \"America's Last Line Of Defense\" (archived here) which describes itself as:\n\nWe were unable to identify the man in the picture but he's been used as a \"lawyer meme\" since at least 2017:\n\nWhy do I need \"Trial Lawyer?\" Aren't they all the same?
