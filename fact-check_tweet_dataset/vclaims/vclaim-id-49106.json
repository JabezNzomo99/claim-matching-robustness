Globally, there are more than 3 lakh confirmed cases and close to 15,000 deaths. This has caused people to fall for a variety of misinformation floating online \u2013 misleading images and videos rousing fear or medical misinformation promoting pseudoscience and invalid treatments. While your intentions may be pure, misinformation, spread especially during a global pandemic, can take lives. We request our readers to practice caution and not forward unverified messages on WhatsApp and other social media platforms.\n\nA photograph of several people fallen on the road has been linked to COVID-19 and shared on social media. These images have been posted with texts in Telugu, Hindi and Bengali.\n\nA Facebook user posted the viral image with a Hindi text, \u201cPeople are taking corona lightly but there aren\u2019t people who can get up in Italy.

According to the caption, \u201cPeople lay down in a pedestrian zone as part of an art project in remembrance of the 528 victims of the Katzbach Nazi concentration camp, in Frankfurt, March 24, 2014. The inmates of the Katzbach concentration camp, a part of the former Adler industrial factory, were forced into a death march to the concentration camps of Buchenwald and Dachau on March 24, 1945. Some 528 victims of Katzbach are buried at Frankfurt\u2019s central cemetery.\u201d\n\nThe people are therefore lying on the road as part of an art project in remembers of the Katzbach Nazi concentration camp.\n\nAlong with the viral image in the first claim, this Facebook page posted two other images. The second viral photo is a collage of three images which shows multiple coffins. The user wrote in Bengali, \u201cItaly\u2019s condition is very bad. If you use work as an excuse and unnecessarily step out of your house, keep this scenario in your mind.

The report added that most migrants were from Eritrea and Somalia.\n\nThe third image posted by Bengali social media users is of a burial site surrounded by military and medical staff. It also shows several dead bodies being buried by medical staff dressed in a white coloured protective gear. After performing another reverse image search, we found that the viral image is a still is from the 2011 Hollywood film Contagion. It can also be viewed in the film\u2019s official trailer at 2:19 mark. Several articles have been published which draw parallels about the global coronavirus pandemic crisis with the film.\n\nThus, the social media claims associated with all the images are false. None of them is related to COVID-19.", "lang": "en"}
