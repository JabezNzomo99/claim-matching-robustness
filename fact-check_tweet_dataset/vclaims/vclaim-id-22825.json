I could have freed a thousand more if only they knew they were slaves.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarriet Said It Best!!\u201d the caption proclaims.\n\nThere is no evidence that Tubman ever said this remark.\n\nWhile Tubman was renowned for her work in leading slaves to freedom via the Underground Railroad, she did not actually make this statement. Rapper Kanye West also attributed the quote to her in 2018 and was criticized for it.\n\nThere is no historical record of Tubman ever saying or writing this. The image did not provide a year or source, but according to etymologist Barry Popik, the quote only first began to appear in print in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cThis quote, all of it, is bogus,\u201d Milton Sernett, professor emeritus at Syracuse University and author of \u201cHarriet Tubman: Myth, Memory and History,\u201d told The Daily Caller in an email. \u201cHas been floating around the Internet, but is in none of the primary sources.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom my research this is not an accurate quote and one that surfaced only recently,\u201d Professor Kasi Lemmons, who is directing a biopic on Tubman, told the Caller.\n\nWhile it\u2019s commonly said that Tubman helped free around 300 slaves, American historian Kate Larson puts the number closer to 70. \u201cWe can name practically every person Tubman helped,\u201d she wrote in a blog post. \u201cIn addition to the family and friends, Tubman also gave instruction to another 70 or so freedom seekers from the Eastern Shore who found their way to freedom on their own.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
