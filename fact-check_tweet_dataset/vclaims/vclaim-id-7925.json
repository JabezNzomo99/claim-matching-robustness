We promised another 6 billion. \u201cIt needs, urgently, about 4 billion a year. It\u2019s getting 1.6 and that\u2019s set to go down.\u201d \u201cI mean, they\u2019re giving the NHS just 1% every year. Under Labour it was 4% every year. It needs more money, not less money.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s correct that spending on the NHS in England has increased by just over \u00a312 billion since 2010, in fact almost \u00a313 billion, and that a further \u00a36 billion was promised at the end of last year.\n\nPart of this \u00a36 billion includes \u00a31.6 billion in 2018/19. This has been welcomed by health experts, but will provide only around half of the \u00a34 billion they have said is needed next year.\n\nSince 2010 the NHS England budget has also increased by around 1% a year on average. Historically, this has been around 4% per year.\n\nSpending on the NHS this coming year\n\nIn the Autumn budget last year the government announced that the NHS in England would receive an additional \u00a31.6 billion in 2018/19 (in addition to spending already planned). Factoring in money also announced for more long-term investment in the infrastructure of the NHS this increases to \u00a31.9 billion.\n\nExperts at the King\u2019s Fund, Nuffield Trust and Health Foundation think tanks previously estimated that the NHS actually needed a spending increase of around \u00a34 billion that year, based on how spending has increased previously in the NHS and how much its costs are considered likely to increase by.\n\nFollowing the Autumn budget the King\u2019s Fund said that \u201cWhile providing some welcome relief for the NHS, the extra funding pledged falls well short of the amount that we estimate is required\u2026 the NHS next year will not be able to maintain standards of care and meet rising demand for services.\u201d It also estimates that there will be a gap in the budget of around \u00a320 billion by 2022/23.\n\nIn 2009/10 health spending in England by the outgoing Labour government was \u00a3112 billion (accounting for inflation since then). In 2017/18 the Conservative government plan to spend \u00a3124.7 billion. That\u2019s a difference of around \u00a312.7 billion, according to figures from the King\u2019s Fund.\n\nSpending is set to increase by a further \u00a33.3 billion up to 2020/21 when it will reach \u00a3128 billion on current plans (again accounting for inflation).\n\nMr Raab told us that he was referring to the government\u2019s commitment at the Autumn budget to spend an additional \u00a36.3 billion on the NHS in England up to 2022/23. These figures don\u2019t account for inflation and we don\u2019t know what will have happened to NHS spending overall by then.\n\nThe total budget for the Department of Health is set to increase by around 1.2% between 2009/10, the last year of the Labour government, and 2020/21. That\u2019s according to the King\u2019s Fund. Since the NHS was established the average increase in spending every year has been around 4%, though the King\u2019s Fund don\u2019t provide specific figures for the Labour years in this research.\n\nWhen we asked them for more information about Ms Butler\u2019s claim the Labour party pointed us towards the same King\u2019s Fund analysis and separate figures on health spending across the whole of the UK. These show that between 1998/99 and 2010/11 the average spending increase was 6.4% per year and since 2010/11 the increase has averaged 1.4% each year.\n\nHealth is a devolved area of spending so the UK government is only directly responsible for exactly how money is spent on this in England. We\u2019re planning on writing more about this soon.", "lang": "en"}
