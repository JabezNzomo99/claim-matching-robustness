This means that if the State Department issued entry visas to the persons under the travel ban, it would be violating U.S. law.\n\nAs for Poklonskaya\u2019s assertion that Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea is a \u201cfairy tale,\u201d that position is not shared by the United Nations itself.\n\nAs Polygraph.info previously reported, the UNGA on March 27, 2014 adopted Resolution 68/262, which stated that the \u201creunification\u201d referendum held on March 16, 2014, \u201chaving no validity, cannot form the basis for any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or of the city of Sevastopol.\u201d The U.N. resolution urged all countries \u201cnot to recognize any alteration of the status\u201d of Crimea.\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly reiterated that position in December 2018, when it adopted a resolution \u201curging the Russian Federation to withdraw its military forces from Crimea and end its temporary occupation of Ukraine\u2019s territory without delay.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s annexation of Crimea further violated post-Soviet agreements Russia signed establishing the sovereignty and borders of Ukraine. To this day, most countries still recognize the Crimean peninsula as an integral part of Ukrainian territory, while no major international organization has recognized the annexation of Crimea as legitimate.\n\nA number of states responded to the illegal annexation by imposing sanctions against Russian companies, banks and individuals. Many more have issued statements in support of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity.\n\nIn 2017 Russia announced it would permanently leave the so-called Group of Eight (the G7 including Russia), following the 2014 move by member states to suspend their own participation in the forum following the Crimean land grab.\n\nBeyond those legal hurdles, there are more practical reasons why Crimea would not be a good fit to host the UN.\n\nWriting for the European Council on Foreign Affairs, Ridvan Urcosta, a research fellow at the Institute of International Relations at Warsaw University, notes that aside from the lack of legal recognition of Crimea as Russian territory, the severe infrastructure challenges that would likely stifle any such move.\n\nUrcosta said Russia has yet to create a self-sustaining economy in Crimea, adding that, much like the Soviet Union, \u201cit is highly militarized, but it cannot solve basic questions of water and food.\u201d\n\nMassive power outages have seen the entire peninsula go dark, while infrastructure problems have continued to hamper energy security.\n\nDue to the sanctions regime, Russian banks will not open branches in Crimea, while investment projects to build critical tourist infrastructure like hotels have dried up.\n\nIn 2018, the American hotel chain Best Western Hotels & Resort reportedly pulled out of Crimea over sanctions-related concerns.\n\nThe legal and economic repercussions of Russia\u2019s illegal seizure of Crimea are anything but a fairy tale. Therefore, Polygraph.info finds Poklonskaya\u2019s statement to be false.", "lang": "en"}
