Excommunication is meant to make sinners realize their wrongdoing and repent, thus leading them to return to the Church eventually.\n\nLike Reyes, there are many other nuns and priests in the Philippines who have been vocal about politics. In September 2017, nuns and priests joined a rally to protest the killings due to the drug war.\n\nThe photo used in the Facebook post with the false claim was also of Catholic priests and nuns at a rally at Luneta, calling for the abolition of the pork barrel system and for the prosecution of those involved in the scam. Through Google reverse image search, we found that the photo was posted on the CBCP\u2019s website on September 13, 2013.\n\nPriests and nuns in India have also taken to the streets to protest issues like sexual assault, while nuns in the US have joined rallies to advocate for issues like women\u2019s rights and the protection of undocumented immigrants. \u2013 Vernise L Tantuco/Rappler.com\n\nIf you suspect a Facebook page, group, account, a website, or an article is spreading false information, let Rappler know by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
