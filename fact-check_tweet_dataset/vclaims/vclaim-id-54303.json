An image being shared on Facebook seems to try to support that theory by connecting Wayfair to Ghislaine Maxwell, who was recently arrested on grounds she helped financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse minors.\n\n\"Wayfair president of operations Bill Hutcherson with Ghislaine Maxwell a known sex trafficker who was involved with Epstein,\" reads a description of the photo, which shows Maxwell and a man.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe photo was taken by Getty Images photographer Mark Mainz in December 2003 in New York City. The caption says: \"Socialite Ghislaine Maxwell with an unidentified male companion attends the opening of the Asprey Flagship store on 5th Avenue.\" (See other photos from that night here.)\n\nTatler identifies the man as George Bamford, founder of Bamford Watch Department.\n\nWayfair doesn\u2019t list a president of operations on its website though there is a \"vice president of operations product innovation\" named Doran Robinson, a different person than the man who appears in the photo with Maxwell. It also lists a chief operating officer named Thomas Netzer. No one named \"Bill Hutcherson\" is listed among Wayfair\u2019s executive leadership team.\n\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
