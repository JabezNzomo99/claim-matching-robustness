(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It\u2019s true that a 97-year-old was killed\u2014but was she a Holocaust survivor?\n\nOnly one of the people murdered was that age: Rose Mallinger, the eldest victim. She was among many older members of the synagogue who were killed, according to the New York Times. \"Some, like Rose Mallinger \u2026 were alive while the Holocaust was devastating Jewish communities around Europe, the paper reported. \"They were the steady anchors of a faithful community that had changed over the years but persisted as a source of devotion, camaraderie and memory.\"\n\nProfiles of Mallinger in publications including the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette don\u2019t describe her as a Holocaust survivor.\n\nBut other media did\u2014and then retracted the information. Forward, a Jewish publication, corrected an Oct. 28 story about Mallinger on Oct. 30. \"An earlier version of this story erroneously stated that Rose Mallinger was a Holocaust survivor,\" the editor\u2019s note says. People magazine also corrected a story that \"incorrectly identified Rose Mallinger as a Holocaust survivor.\"\n\nYahoo News reported on Oct. 29 that census records \"appear to show she was the fourth of six children of Yiddish-speaking parents who had themselves arrived in the U.S. from Lithuania as children.\"", "lang": "en"}
