The claim is that with increased gold price and no customer, this is how employees are passing time.\n\nSeveral Facebook users like \"Different Things\" and \"Rama Kulkarni\" have posted this video with the caption \"Gold Rs 40,000. No Customers...so employees time pass\".\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War room ( AFWA) found this to be a misleading claim.\n\nThe employees in the jewellery store are not dancing to pass time because there is no customer due to high gold prices.\n\nThis one-year-old video is of a famous jewellery shop in Delhi, where it is a regular custom for the sales-staff to start the day's business joyfully with song and dance.\n\nHow we found the truth\n\nThis video along with similar claims is viral on WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter.\n\nThe two-minute-long viral video shows a jewellery shop where men and women in office uniform are dancing joyfully to a song.\n\nOn Twitter, many people were curious about the song being played in the background since it was not in Hindi. Some commented that this is a very popular \"pahadi\" song, \"chaita ki chaitwal\", particularly from Uttarakhand.\n\nWe found that it was indeed the same song \"chaita ki chaitwal\"- a popular Gadwali number on YouTube.\n\nSome people have also commented that this could be one of the stores of Tanishq jewellery.\n\nWith the combination of the keyword search \"Chaiti ki Chaitwal Uttarakhand Tanishq\", we found two similar videos on YouTube.\n\n\n\nYouTuber \"Uttarakhand Pahari Video online\" and \"Garwal villager Praveen Singh Panwar\" both had uploaded the same video on September 18, 2018.\n\nBoth of them claimed in the caption of the video that this was the Tanishq showroom in Cannaught Place, Delhi.\n\nWe got in touch with the Tanishq showroom, Cannaught place who refuted saying that the video was not of any Tanishq showroom, because the \"unforms the employees are wearing in the viral video are not of Tanishq\".\n\nThey gave us a hint that this video could be of another famous jewellery brand \"Manohar Lal jewellers\".\n\nWe looked for videos related to Manohar Lal jewellers on YouTube and found the same viral video on YouTube, published on September 19, 2018, with the caption \"Morning routine at Manohar Lal jewellers\".\n\nThe office of Manohar Lal Jewellers confirmed to us over the phone that the viral video was indeed shot in their office. But the claim made about the video, that employees are dancing to pass time because there was no customer to buy gold, is completely wrong.\n\nAccording to them, this is a regular custom in every Manohar Lal store to start the business of the day joyfully by dancing and singing.\n\nThis video was shot last year in September at the Preet Vihar store of Manohar Lal Jewellers in New Delhi.\n\nAccording to the newspaper report, the gold prices have increased from Rs 30,000 to Rs 40,000 in the last 12 months. This has affected the gold sale in the country.\n\nBut the viral claim made on social media for this particular video is misleading. The dancing video of the jewellery store is old and has nothing to do with the rising prices of gold.", "lang": "en"}
