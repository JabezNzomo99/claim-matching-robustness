Let\u2019s try to analyze the veracity of that video. \n\n\n\nClaim: Video of Modi Government using excessive security forces on civilians in Kashmir Fact: The video shows lathi-charge by the Indian security forces in Haryana on the supporters of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh. In August 2017, several supporters of Ram Rahim took to streets and were involved in violence following the conviction of Ram Rahim in a rape case. So, the claim made in the post stands FALSE.\n\nWhen the video in the post is run through \u2018InVid\u2019 plugin, several keyframes were obtained. On subjecting these keyframes to reverse image search technique, a certain keyframe directed to the same video on YouTube. The video was found to be uploaded on August 30, 2017, and had the title \u201cBaba ram rahim ke gundo ki pitai \u0930\u093e\u092e \u0930\u0939\u0940\u092e \u0915\u0947 \u0917\u0941\u0902\u0921\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0940 \u092a\u093f\u091f\u093e\u0908\u201d. \n\n\n\nWhen searched on YouTube with keywords, many results of the same video were found describing it to be belonging to lathi charge on Dera supporters in Panchkula(a city in Haryana). Those results can be seen here, here, and here.\n\nAll those videos obtained during the search process have the same audio in the background unlike the video posted. The video posted has a woman\u2019s voice in the background. So, the audio of that video must have been tampered with a separate track.\n\nThe articles reporting about the violence that took place in Haryana following the conviction of Dera Baba can be seen here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, an old video related to an incident in Haryana is falsely shared as that of Modi government using excessive forces in Kashmir.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
