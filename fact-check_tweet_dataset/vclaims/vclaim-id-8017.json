Following an agreement made between the UK and France on Thursday, that figure is thought to now be around \u00a3150 million.\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen the briefing behind these figures, so we aren\u2019t able to say yet how accurate they are.\n\nThe \u00a3100 million figure apparently comes from a government briefing\n\nMs Mirza told us her claim came from a BBC News report which says \u201cThe UK government is already thought to have spent more than \u00a3100m on security in the area [around Calais] over the past three years.\u201d The BBC told us that their information came from a report by the Press Association, which was apparently based on a government briefing.\n\nThe Press Association report says that UK funding towards security measures at French border points is thought to have been over \u201c100 million\u201d\u2014reported elsewhere as \u00a3100 million\u2014 in the past three years, which would be about \u00a333 million a year.\n\nThe report adds that an agreement was made between the UK and France this week for an additional \u00a344.5 million contribution from the UK, bringing the total funding to around \u00a3150 million since three years ago. We don\u2019t know if this \u00a344.5 million is to be spent over a single year or over several. The report says the additional funds are to be spent on security fencing, CCTV and \u201cdetection technology\u201d in Calais and other French ports on the Channel.\n\nTheresa May confirmed on Thursday that the two countries had agreed \u201cfurther investment\u201d and \u201cadditional measures\u2026 increasing the effectiveness of our cooperation\u201d. She said they would \u201creinforce the security infrastructure\u201d. The sum agreed on Thursday has been widely reported as \u00a344.5 million.\n\nThe UK and France have cooperated on border controls for years\n\nSince 2004, the UK and France have cooperated on border controls according to a treaty informally known as the Le Touquet agreement. Both governments yesterday reaffirmed their commitment to its legal framework.\n\nThis treaty allows for \u201cjuxtaposed controls\u201d where UK border enforcement officers may carry out immigration checks on those seeking to enter the UK at French sea ports (and vice versa). This means the UK border effectively begins at French sea ports on the Channel, and both countries invest in security measures across the border.\n\nGiven that the majority of undocumented migrants seeking to cross the channel are believed to enter the UK from France, rather than the other way round, it has been argued by some in France that the treaty is too favourable to the UK, because French authorities have to manage most of the effects of controlling the joint border.\n\nAttention has been drawn to the migrant camp around Calais that was known as the \u201cJungle\u201d. Several French politicians, including Emmanuel Macron when he was Minister for the Economy, have called for the juxtaposed border arrangement to be ended, citing the Calais migrant camp as a key reason.\n\nThe Home Office has published data too\n\nIn April 2017, the Home Office responded to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request asking how much it had \u201cspent since 2010 to deter illegal immigration in Calais and the surrounding region.\u201d\n\nThe government response says that it spent \u00a3316 million from 2010/11 to 2015/16. The sum was \u00a340 million in 2013/14, \u00a349 million in 2014/15, and \u00a3112 million in 2015/16.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much of this spending is counted within the \u00a3150 million spent in the last three years, reported by the Press Association.\n\nThe Home Office figures cover \u201cday to day activities\u201d including \u201cpassport checks on all passengers\u201d and \u201csearching for illicit goods\u201d, which UK border officers carry out on French soil.\n\nThe spending also covers \u201crecent investment to reinforce security through infrastructure improvements at Border Force\u2019s controls in Northern France\u201d, as well as \u201cstopping and deterring illegal immigration\u201d through a range of \u201cwider activity\u201d.\n\nThe large increase in spending between 2014/15 and 2015/16 is put down to \u201ca combination of increased migrant pressures in Calais, new operational and technological improvements at the juxtaposed controls and improvements to infrastructure in the region.\u201d\n\nThe spending is part of a joint commitment between the UK and France to manage the border between the two countries.", "lang": "en"}
