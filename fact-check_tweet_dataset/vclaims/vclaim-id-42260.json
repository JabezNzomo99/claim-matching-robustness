The Air Force Times article, written by Kyle Rempfer, was headlined: \u201cNew in 2019: Airmen will continue stepping up to deter Russia in Europe.\u201d\n\nIn the Svobodnya Pressa piece, the words attributed to the U.S. Air Forces were within quotation marks as a direct citation: \u201c\u2018Thanks very much to the Russians for taking Crimea.\u201d Svobodnya Pressa attributed the quote the commander of the U.S. Air Forces in Europe, General Tod Wolters.\n\nHowever, while the original Air Force Times article refers to statements made by Gen. Wolters during a conference call with the reporters last March, he never thanked the Russians for taking Crimea.\n\nAccording to a transcript and video of Wolters\u2019 comments during that conference call, he spoke about deterring Russian aggression and the need for the U.S. to continue its efforts under the U.S. European Deterrence Initiative, aimed at bolstering U.S. allies in Europe.\n\nThe Svobodnya Pressa article twice introduced the notion that Wolters was thanking Russia, as part of a wider polemic against allied military spending, forward NATO deployments and U.S. involvement.\n\nThe quotation attributed to the Air Force and Gen. Wolters was entirely a fabrication.", "lang": "en"}
