The claim is false; the images have circulated in separate reports about attacks against Hindus in the neighboring country of Bangladesh.\n\nThe photos, which show a charred structure and vandalized Hindu statue, were published on Facebook here on February 15, 2020. The post has been shared more than 5,400 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Hindi-language caption translates to English as: \u201cThis is the state of Hindu temples. Rohingya Muslims in Bengal are making the lives of Hindus very difficult. You have to think, Mamata Banerjee or Narendra Modi. Glory to India, glory to Hindutva.\u201d\n\nThe post names two prominent Indian politicians: Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal, and Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister. It also references Hindutva, which is a far-right Hindu political movement advocating Hindu nationalism and the establishment of a Hindu state.\n\nThe photos were also shared alongside similar claims on Facebook here, here and here; and on Twitter here and here.\n\nHowever, the claim is false.\n\nA reverse image search found that the photo of a defaced Hindu statue was published here on January 13, 2019, in an Indian news report about a vandalized temple in Jessore, a district in southwestern Bangladesh.\n\nThe article notes that the \u201c200-year old Temple is the pride of the community\u201d and \u201cwas ransacked by a preparator named Yasin.\u201d It also quotes Gobinda Chandra, the secretary-general of the National Hindu Grand Alliance Bangladesh, who confirmed and condemned the attack.\n\nBangladesh police chief Tajul Islam confirmed to AFP on the telephone on March 17, 2020, about the incident.\n\n\u201cThe incident happened in 2019 in a village named Mahakal which is under Abhaynagar\u2019s jurisdiction in Bangladesh,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nThe image of a charred structure was published here on December 28, 2018, in a report by bdnews24.com, a Bangladeshi news website, about an arson attack on homes that belonged to Hindus in Thakurgaon, a district in northwestern Bangladesh.\n\nOne of the photo also has a watermark that says \u201cbdnews24.com\u201d.\n\nBelow is a comparison of the photos in the misleading post (L) and the images published in the media reports (R):", "lang": "en"}
