It is being claimed that the images of the Earth being circulated have been taken by the Chandrayaan-2.\n\nThere are multiple photographs floating on social media. We are testing some of them.\n\nIndia Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim with the viral images is not true. So far, Chandrayaan-2 has not sent any pictures of the Earth.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nAmong others, a Facebook user \"Priyabrata Dasgupta\" uploaded a set of photographs of the Earth with the caption: \"First photograph of earth, sent by Chandrayaan-2What an eye-catching visual it is.\" The photographs are being widely shared on Facebook as well as Twitter.\n\nIndian Space Research Organisation (Isro) launched Chandrayaan-2 from the spaceport of Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh. As per the latest update by Isro, the second earth-bound orbit-raising manoeuvre of the Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft has been successfully performed early on Friday (July 26) morning.\n\nChandrayaan-2 will be subjected to a series of orbit maneuvers over the coming weeks to take it to the vicinity of the Moon. The rover would touch down on the Moon's surface on September 7. Also, its objective is to land closer to the South Pole of the Moon and not to take photographs of the Earth in space.\n\nThis image was taken by astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) of a large pluma of smoke, steam and ash erupting from the Sarychev volcano in Kuril Islands, Russia.\n\nThis image is a screengrab from an animated video posted on Shutterstock with a title \"flight over the morning Earth\".\n\nThis image is available on the internet since 2014, used by several websites and social media. However, the origin of the image is not clear.\n\nWe found this image on the website of Nasa. It was posted on March 2, 2007, with the caption: \"Solar Eclipse from the Moon.

The caption to this photograph says \"Planet earth with sunrise and moon in space\".\n\nThis photo has been cropped.
