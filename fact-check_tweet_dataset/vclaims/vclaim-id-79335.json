Apparently no one in his family volunteered to carry his body to the crematorium, therefore, local Muslim youths volunteered and performed his last rites.\n\n\n\nBelow is the entire WhatsApp Forward that is doing the rounds: Today MBBS Dr. in Pune. Ramakant Joshiji has died of Corona. He has a boy but he lives in America and wife is 74 years old and Dr. They wanted to go on the shoulders of 4 people, but no family was ready to come to them because of Corona. This incident came in front of Muslim youths connected to Tabligh Jamaat who are engaged in religious preaching, and then they made all the arrangements and put the dead body on their shoulders to the cemetery and perform the funeral rites. * This is my country and Maharashtra of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Muslim society is considered bad but once you show affection towards Muslims they will give their life for you The Muslim community is considered bad, but the one who ran for the most help during the Corona period is the Muslim community. A report by kohraam.com which carries the viral photo also reported the same incident. The report was published on August 28.\n\nFuneral procession of a Hindu Doctor From Pune was conducted by local Muslim youths in absence of his family members. The claim is false. The photo is from a separate incident that occurred in April, 2020. A reverse image search of the image led to a report by Asianet News from May 1, 2020, which carried the viral photo.\n\n\"My father had a tumour in his food pipe. The treatment was going on for long. But, suddenly on Tuesday afternoon, he passed away leaving us distraught. My elder brother, who was in Delhi, could not reach home on time as there was some difficulty in arranging the pass. Relatives, too, could not come due to lockdown. This is when the neighbours came out for our help and took the funeral for last rites to crematorium,\" Times Of India quoted Chandar Mauli Mathur, the younger son as saying. This report also carried the viral image.\n\nTherefore, the photograph is unrelated to the narrative that is being shared on social media. In relation to the narrative being shared, no such reports were found. \n\n If you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343.
