Then why should anyone vote for Lekhi ji?\n\nWith the above message, Congress leader from Delhi Ajay Maken tweeted a video on May 2 of BJP president Amit Shah speaking at a rally. The video clip is 18 seconds long. In it, Amit Shah can be heard appealing to the audience not to vote for the two BJP candidates present on the dais- Meenakshi Lekhi and Ramesh Bidhuri. Maken has also tagged Vishal Kundra, a Congress leader, crediting him for the video.\n\nThe exact words of Amit Shah in this video clip are,\n\nTranslation: \u201cBut our two parliamentary candidates- Behen Lekhi and Ramesh Bidhuri, dont give them your vote for any of this work, I am saying this, as BJP president I am saying that for my two candidates, don\u2019t vote them for any work\u2026\u201d\n\nThe video clip of Amit Shah has been mischievously edited and taken out of context, to make it seem as if Shah is bizarrely appealing to the crowd to not vote for his own party candidates. The video was streamed live by the Bharatiya Janata Party on its YouTube page on May 2, 2019. Shah was addressing a rally at Vasant Kunj in Delhi. The capital votes on May 12, in the sixth phase of polling.\n\nThe entire video has been posted below. The relevant portion begins from 1:20:05 and ends at 1:21:00, placing Amit Shah\u2019s words in context.\n\nTranslation: \u201cFriends, Narendra Modi\u2019s govt has done a lot of work, a lot of work for the poor, (we) gave house, (we) gave electricity, (we) gave toilets, (we) gave gas connections, (we) gave clean drinking water, we have given a lot to Delhi, but our two parliamentary candidates- Behen Lekhi and Ramesh Bidhuri, dont give them your vote for any of these works, I am saying this, as BJP president I am saying dont vote for them for any of these works, Modi ji has spent 1 lakh crore rupees for Delhi, don\u2019t vote for that either. Vote for them certainly, Modi ji has secured the country, vote for that.\u201d\n\nTo sum it up, Amit Shah was appealing to the crowd to vote for the BJP candidates, not for the supposedly stupendous work done by the Modi govt, but on the issue of national security. One bit from this video was mischievously edited, and shared by no less than a senior leader like Ajay Maken, whose tweet has been retweeted close to 300 times. Maken\u2019s tweet is still online, hours after it was pointed out to him that the video is misleading.", "lang": "en"}
