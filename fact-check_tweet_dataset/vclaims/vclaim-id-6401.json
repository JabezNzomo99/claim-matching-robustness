Given that this ship is a refurbished former Soviet aircraft carrier, not the catamaran-style design shown here, and China reportedly plans to build \u201cup to three additional clones of the carrier\u201d in the long term, it\u2019s unlikely the pictures displayed below are conceptual images of \u201ca new ultra modern Chinese design concept aircraft carrier\u201d currently under construction. We could find no documentation that China is currently engaged in building a craft like the one shown here, or has any plans to do so. The origin of these images is unknown to us and may have no connection with the Chinese military:\n\nChina\u2019s new aircraft carrier! Wow!These aircraft carriers look formidable and of ultra modern design. There are reports the 1st Chinese aircraft carrier is under construction and could enter service around 2015 or earlier. It won\u2019t be long before we see the real thing. Defense analysts are waiting; watching anxiously.\n\nTHIS IS QUANTUM LEAP ABOVE ANYTHING WE HAVE ON THE DRAWING BOARD. THEY HAVE THOUGHT \u201cOUTSIDE THE BOX\u201d ON THIS ONE. BETTER SPEED, LARGER CAPACITY, MUCH MORE STABLE, ETC. DEFINITELY A \u201cBLUE-WATER\u201d LONG REACH VESSEL.\n\nPLUS THEY CAN SERVICE THEIR NUKE SUB FLEET IN-BETWEEN THE TWIN HULLS (SIGHT UNSEEN) OR EVEN LAUNCH AMPHIBIOUS OPPS FROM SAME. IT WILL BE LAUNCHED IN HALF THE TIME IT TAKES THE USA AT JUST ONE-THIRD THE COST. ADD THE NEW CHINESE STEALTH FIGHTER BOMBER (NAVAL VERSION ALREADY FLIGHT TESTING) IN THE MIX AND YOU HAVE THE MAKINGS OF A FORMIDABLE WEAPONS SYSTEM INDEED..\n\nALSO LOOK AT THAT EXTRA \u201dPARKING AND READINESS\u201d STATION BETWEEN BOTH HULL STRUCTURES.. AND OF COURSE THE LAUNCHING AND LANDING CAPABILITIES FROM THE UTILIZATION OF TWIN FLIGHT DECKS AT ONCE\n\nP.S. SOME THOUGHT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO ADVISING YOUR GRANDCHILDREN TO LEARN TO SPEAK MANDARIN (FORGET SPANISH) MY \u201cVERY, VERY BRIGHT\u201d 15-YEAR OLD 3rd COUSIN HAS ALREADY BEEN ADVISED TO DO SO BY PEOPLE WHO KNOW ABOUT SUCH THINGS.\n\nP.P.S SIX OF THESE VESSELS (TWO PACIFIC, TWO ATLANTIC, ONE INDIAN OCEAN AND ONE MED SEA) WOULD BE A PRETTY GOOD DIPLOMATIC \u201cBIG STICK\u201d. NOTE: THE CHINESE ARE ALREADY DRILLING FOR OIL OFF CUBA, BRAZIL AND VENEZUELA.\n\n CAN THEY BUILD A FLEET OF THESE THINGS???\n\nA FEW FACTS: THE CHINESE HAVE COMPLETED THE WORLD\u2019S BIGGEST DAM (THREE GORGES), THE WORLD\u2019S LONGEST OVER-WATER BRIDGE (65 TIMES AS MUCH STEEL AS IN THE EIFFEL TOWER). CONSTRUCTED A 15,000\u2032 HIGH RAILROAD INTO TIBET (ALL CONSIDERED MAJOR ENGINEERING FEATS).\n\nTHEY ARE THE ONLY NATION OTHER THAN RUSSIA THAT CAN LAUNCH MEN INTO OUTER SPACE (OUR CAPABILITY ENDS WITH THE LAST SPACE SHUTTLE LAUNCH THIS MONTH). THEY HAVE ALSO SHOT DOWN A SURVEILLANCE SATELLITE (ONE OF THEIR OWN) FROM THE GROUND. PLUS THEY \u201cOWN OUR ASS\u201d IN THE INTERNATIONAL DEBT GAME.\n\nCHINA\u2019S NEW A/C CARRIER COULD BE TWICE AS FAST AS ANYTHING WE HAVE, PLUS THE STABILITY OF A CATAMARAN TYPE HULL WILL GREATLY REDUCE THE PITCHING, YAWING AND SWAYING COMMON TO OUR PRESENT DESIGNS.", "lang": "en"}
