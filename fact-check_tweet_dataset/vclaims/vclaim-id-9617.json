Johnson was among four soldiers killed in Niger when terrorists attacked his unit and ever since his death his mother, Cowanda Jones-Johnson, has been attacking Trump on liberal news programs. If you've wondered why she has been trying to keep attention focused on the President instead of her son, we now have answers. Breitbart News discovered that Mr. Johnson wasn't the perfect soldier that his mother wants us to believe: According to members of Johnson's unit, he had disappeared days before the attack. It is unknown if he met anyone in the multiple days he was gone, but the attack occurred when three other members of his unit went out searching for him. \"I don't want to raise the alarm yet, but it seems that he was trying to pull a Bergdahl,\" said the soldier, who discussed the situation on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk about it. \"It seems suspicious that these terrorists were waiting for them.\" At least two other soldiers voiced the same concerns.\n\nThe accusation is not true at all. Sgt. La David T. Johnson did die in Niger but there is no indication at all he was a deserter. Breitbart News did not report that he was and the fact that the supposed members of his unit are anonymous should be a red flag too.\n\nOn top of that Freedum Junkshun carries a satire disclaimer at the bottom of the page which reads:\n\nWe believe that there is nothing more precious than the mind of an aging conservative. Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate. Reality is often in the eye of the beholder. You won't find any of it here. Join the fun in the comments on our Facebook page where you too can watch David Hasselhoff running over someone's poodle magically transformed into a crime against humanity by Barack Obama or yet another murder the Clintons got away with.\n\nSlandering a fallen soldier could be considered as satire by some (although we wouldn't agree with those people). And doing it while knowing the accusation will probably get picked up by 'real' fake news sites is another thing. However that seems to be just what happened here.\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites such as asamericanasapplepie.org, ourlandofthefree.com and nunadisbereel.com (formerly thelastlineofdefense.org). Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". He has at least one accomplice who writes under the pen names \"Freedom\", \"Captain Jellypants\", \"Butch Mannington\" or \"Captain Buck Atlantis\".\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.", "lang": "en"}
