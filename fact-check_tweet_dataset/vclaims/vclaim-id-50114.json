All in the name of professional victims that don\u2019t understand the consequences of their ignorance.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Reagan ever uttered those words. A Google search for the quote does not turn up any reliable sources, with the top results being various social media and meme pages. Michael Pinckney, an archivist for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, had also never heard of the quote. Pinckney told The Dispatch Fact Check: \u201cThis quote states President Reagan said this in 1987. We have all his official speeches and I could not find this quote for that year or any other between 1981-89.\u201d\n\nBased on all available information, this quote is inaccurately attributed to Reagan, and posts that continue to propagate it are false.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
