Tajinder Bagga is the latest in the new crop of BJP workers who made their name in the age of social media and have been promoted to the higher league. Some of the others are Akhilesh Mishra who was the former director of MyGov, Amit Malviya who is the in-charge of BJP\u2019s national Information & Technology, etc. Tajinder Bagga announced the news of his appointment via his Twitter account which has a following of close to 200k.\n\nSo, what does it take to become a spokesperson of BJP? Listing down the highlights of Tajinder\u2019s \u2018career\u2019 will throw some light on what it takes to make it to the higher league in BJP. Tajinder Bagga first became popular when he announced on his Twitter account that he beat-up Prashant Bhushan in his Supreme Court chamber on 12th October, 2011.\n\nThe text of the three tweets is as follows:\n\nGod give us power to complete our mission. he try to break my Nation, i try to break his head. Hisab chukta. Congrats to all. operation Prashant Bhushan successfull. we hit prashant bhushan hard in his champer in supreme court. if you will try to break my nation, i will break ur heads.\n\nTajinder Bagga has deleted these tweets but Outlook had used the Storify service to archive the tweets and the tweets can be seen here. DNA also wrote an article about it. He\u2019d also stated that he would repeat this act of physical assault if and when required.\n\nWhile usually, such boisterous claims of physically assaulting another person leads to a jail sentence, in BJP, that seems like is a qualification for better career opportunities. A FIR was also filed against Tajinder Bagga for the attack on Arundhati Roy at a program where she launched her essays Broken Republic on May 20, 2011.\n\nTajinder Bagga also clicks the boxes when it comes to other attributes often found in the right-wingers namely misogyny and rumour mongering. Here\u2019s his tweet when Sania Mirza married Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik. Sania Mirza who has brought multiple accolades for the country became unacceptable for Tajinder Bagga because she married someone from Pakistan. Oh, and he\u2019s deleted this tweet too. He does that often. Can\u2019t seem to stand by his words.\n\nAnd then rumour mongering. Following is a tweet posted from Tajinder Bagga\u2019s account alleging that the man in the picture is Sanjiv Bhatt, an IPS officer from Gujarat, who testified against Modi in 2002 riots cases. The picture is not one of Sanjiv Bhatt and Bagga as usual deleted the tweet.\n\nAfter all the \u2018hard work\u2019, the first recognition was when PM Narendra Modi invited him to the PMO.\n\nAnd then came the appointment as Delhi BJP Spokesperson. Many people congratulated including Ministers. Here\u2019s Suresh Prabhu congratulating Tajinder Bagga for his promotion.\n\nSo, that is how Tajinder Bagga progressed from being a guy who boasted about physically assaulting people to the social media warrior who indulged in rumour mongering to becoming the Delhi BJP Spokesperson. Many congratulations. Well deserved.", "lang": "en"}
