Let\u2019s try to analyze the claims made in the post.\n\nClaim: Cool drinks were contaminated with HTC poison and their consumption led to the death of people Fact: Few of the photos posted are the ones taken when District Food Authority officials raided a fake soft drinks factory in Gujranwala of Pakistan in 2015. Hence, the claim made in the post stands FALSE.\n\nWhen the photos in the post are run through Google Reverse Image Search, few of them were found to be taken when District Food Authority officials raided a fake soft drinks factory in Gujranwala of Pakistan in 2015. In 2017, when these photos were circulated with the narration that cool drinks were contaminated with the Ebola virus, Check4spam had written a fact-check article on it. These images were also circulated as the poisonous drinks in Nigeria, South Africa and other countries.\n\nA video of a bleeding woman is also being circulated, suggesting it as the effect of consuming cool drinks mixed with HTC poison. But the video is from Telangana State wherein a woman was beaten by his husband for questioning him over his extra-marital affair.\n\nTo sum it up, photos of the raid on a counterfeit soft drink factory in Pakistan are circulated as public affected due to the consumption of contaminated cool drinks.\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
