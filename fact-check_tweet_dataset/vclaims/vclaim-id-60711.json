It experienced a technical glitch in late May that affected the view counts of a variety of hashtags on the \u201cCompose\u201d screen only.\n\nIn the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis police custody, people around the world have engaged in online activism, including showing support for the Black Lives Matter movement. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and other platforms have been flooded with posts that include #BlackLivesMatter.\n\nMultiple social media users alleged that the hashtag had been banned on TikTok, a platform that allows its many users to watch, create and share short videos. One viral Facebook post read, \u201cTikTok banned #BlackLivesMatter hashtag. Delete that app,\u201d for instance.

While the app did experience a technical glitch that affected the view counts on hashtags such as #BlackLivesMatter and #GeorgeFloyd, it was limited to the \u201ccompose\u201d screen. The view counts of hashtags on other areas of the platform were not affected, according to a tweet from the verified TikTok Support account.\n\n\u201cWe found & fixed an issue that widely affected the view count displayed on hashtags in the upload stage,\u201d the tweet reads. \u201cThis bug temporarily affected view count displays on hashtags in the Compose screen only; it did not affect hashtags, videos, or discovery of uploaded content.\u201d\n\nThe glitch prevented users from seeing the number of views each hashtag had accumulated prior to posting content but did not prevent users from using the hashtag at any point. Once a video was uploaded, the hashtag functioned normally, according to New York Times technology reporter Taylor Lorenz.\n\n\n\n The TikTok Support account tweeted that the glitch appeared \u201cto affect words at random, including terms like #cat and #hello.\u201d The glitch was found and fixed on May 29, according to another tweet from the TikTok Support account.\n\nThe app shows #BlackLivesMatter has over 10.8 billion views as of press time.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
