But a bit more context is needed to interpret this properly.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-5511", "url": "https://fullfact.org/europe/has-uk-created-more-jobs-rest-eu-combined/", "vclaim": "Has the UK created more jobs than the rest of the EU combined?\n\nThe UK did see a larger increase in employment than the rest of the EU combined between 2010 and 2015, provided you compare between the first three months of each of these years. But it's not correct to describe these as 'jobs created'. The figures show the difference between people moving into and out of work.\n\nUsing figures from Eurostat, if you compare the first three months of 2010 and 2015, UK employment rose by just over two million. The net increase in employment across the rest of the EU was 1.8 million over the same period.\n\nThat's because in some EU countries\u2014like Italy and Spain\u2014employment fell, dragging down the rest of the EU's overall change.\n\nGermany alone had higher employment growth than the UK over this period, of about 2.4 million.\n\nThe picture changes slightly if you take different periods for comparison. Comparing the second three months of 2010\u2014covering the general election\u2014to the same period in 2015, the UK's growth comes in at just under two million, with the EU's combined growth just over.\n\nThe picture has also changed more recently. Employment growth in 2015 was much larger in the combined EU outside the UK, partly because employment levels in Spain and Italy have been recovering.\n\nWe've updated this piece, previously published in 2015, with the latest figures.", "lang": "en"}
