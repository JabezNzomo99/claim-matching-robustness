The pictured article appears to be fabricated.\n\nThe image appears to show a screen grab of an article from G1, a news website associated with the Brazilian television network Globo. The alleged article, titled \u201cTaylor Swift Says We Should Remove The Statue of Liberty,\u201d is dated June 18 in the photo.\n\n\u201cHow can you have a moment (sic) to freedom that was built by slaves,\u201d reads the alleged subheadline. \u201cRacist monuments make me sick.\u201d (RELATED: Has The 9/11 Memorial In New York City Recently Been Defaced With Graffiti?)\n\nBut there is no evidence Swift has called for such action. No statement about the Statue of Liberty being removed could be found on Swift\u2019s social media pages. When reached for comment, a representative for Swift directed the Daily Caller to a USA Today article debunking the claim.\n\nG1 does not appear to have published the article featured in the Facebook post. A search of the G1 website turned up no articles about Swift and the Statue of Liberty. The use of the Portuguese phrase \u201cAtualizado ha 1 hora\u201d in the screen grab, while the rest appears in English, indicates it is likely photoshopped.\n\nWhile there is no record of Swift calling for the Statue of Liberty\u2019s removal, she did ask the state of Tennessee to remove the statues of \u201cracist historical figures\u201d in a June 12 tweet.\n\n\u201cAs a Tennessean, it makes me sick that there are monuments standing in our state that celebrate racist historical figures who did evil things,\u201d tweeted Swift. \u201cEdward Carmack and Nathan Bedford Forrest were DESPICABLE figures in our state history and should be treated as such.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
