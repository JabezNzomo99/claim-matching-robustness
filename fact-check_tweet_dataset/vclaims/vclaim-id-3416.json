This programme, which started in 2008, focuses in particular on talking therapies for people with anxiety and depression.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to see an increase of nearly 3,000 more staff in talking therapies in both the specific programme Jeremy Hunt is talking about, and in separate data for NHS psychotherapy staff.\n\nWe haven\u2019t been able to reach Ralf Little to confirm what data he is referring to. Separate data for NHS psychotherapy staff (including some but not all who are part of the IAPT programme) can be used to show an increase of closer to 3,000.\n\nNeither source is perfect, but we\u2019ve found no reason to doubt that talking therapy staffing is increasing.\n\nTalking therapies are a range of \u201cevidence based treatments\u201d that involve talking to a therapist. These can involve Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, counselling, and mindfulness, for example.\n\nImproving Access to Psychological Therapies is a programme which began in 2008, providing psychotherapy treatment to people with anxiety and depression. Most of this treatment is based on a range of talking therapies, although some of it uses books and computers.\n\n567,000 people referred to IAPT finished a course in 2016/17.\n\nIAPT services are not the only talking therapy services available on the NHS. The mental health charity Mind told us that \u201ctalking therapies\u201d is an umbrella term for all sorts of services. The NHS\u2019s page on talking therapies refers to multiple \u201ctalking therapy\u201d treatments. Some of these can be, but aren\u2019t always, provided through IAPT.\n\nUnfortunately we don\u2019t have any data for all staff working in talking therapies.\n\nHow does Jeremy Hunt get his number?\n\nIn November, Jeremy Hunt claimed that 2,700 more people are employed in talking therapies. When later providing links to his sources he quoted the number as \u201cover 2,000\u201d\u2014the Department of Health told us that this is a generalised way of expressing the same 2,700 figure.\n\nThe two NHS reports that Mr Hunt linked to are about IAPT services in England in a period between 31 August 2012 and 30 April 2015. No more recent report on IAPT staff has been published.\n\nIn October, the government said the number of staff had increased by 2,278 between 2012 and 2015, referring to the reports cited by Mr Hunt. The statement has since been corrected to 2,728\u2014very close to Mr Hunt\u2019s claim of 2,700.\n\nThese figures are headcounts, meaning each individual is counted rather than the amount of time they spend at work. \u201cWhole time equivalent\u201d (WTE) figures give a better indication of staff availability. Under WTE, two half-time workers would add up to one full-time role, and so count as one member of staff. But the 2012 report only provides figures for headcount, so we can\u2019t compare the change in the whole time equivalent workforce.\n\nThe government\u2019s 2015 figure also excludes employment support workers, who were included in the total figure for 2012\u2014so the comparison is not exact.\n\nThe 2015 report does give a figure for these workers separately\u2014127 staff\u2014but only as whole time equivalent.\n\nThe WTE figure for 2015 suggests that, once we count employment support workers, the total increase in staff is at least 127 more than 2,728, so it could be up to at least 2,855. This could be what Mr Little was referring to.\n\n2,855 should be treated as a slightly rough figure: this data may not be entirely accurate, and each year is missing data from some service providers.\n\nHow does Ralf Little get his number?\n\nHe could either be referring to the higher number for the IAPT staff, or it\u2019s possible he is referring to separate data\u2014based on NHS staff records\u2014for the number of \u201cpsychotherapy\u201d staff. It\u2019s possible to find increases of at least 2,800 staff (WTE) with this data, depending on the dates used.\n\nThis covers a wider range of services than just IAPT, but is still not all of the \u201ctalking therapies\u201d listed by the NHS. It also has less complete data on the IAPT workforce than the reports Mr Hunt was referring to, according to NHS Digital.", "lang": "en"}
