Others read between the lines of her sarcasm to comment on what she may be implying.\n\n\u201cNot just lowest flu death, but also cancer deaths, diabetes deaths, heart disease deaths, and many other know(n) diseases,\u201d one Facebook user wrote. \u201cWhen hospitals are guaranteed payment from the federal government if it is classified as covid19 hospitalization, it becomes a business plan.\u201d\n\nAccording to CDC data, none of Owens\u2019 statistics is correct.\n\nOwens did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nThe CDC uses mathematical estimates to retroactively measure the burden of each flu season. \u201cThe model uses a ratio of deaths-to-hospitalizations in order to estimate the total influenza-associated deaths from the estimated number of influenza-associated hospitalizations,\u201d the CDC states, describing its methodology.\n\nThis in-hospital mortality FluSurv-NET data is the basis from which larger, annual estimates are made. This data excludes all influenza-associated deaths that are misdiagnosed or occur outside a hospital.\n\nAfter each flu season, the CDC considers in-hospital death data and investigates death certificates to account for the total flu deaths. \u201c(B)ecause not all deaths related to influenza occur in the hospital, we use death certificate data to estimate how likely deaths are to occur outside the hospital,\u201d the CDC website explains.\n\nFlu seasons vary from year to year and don't have a strict timeline. Last year, flu season was the longest in a decade, lasting 21 weeks.\n\n\u201cIn the United States, flu season occurs in the fall and winter. While influenza viruses circulate year-round, most of the time flu activity peaks between December and February, but activity can last as late as May,\" the CDC website explains.\n\nTo account for this ambiguous period the CDC releases weekly U.S. influenza summary updates from October through May.\n\nInfluenza-associated deaths last year were much lower than claimed\n\nAccording to the CDC\u2019s 2018-2019 estimates, there were 34,200 influenza-associated deaths from October 2018 to May 2019 \u2013 not 80,000 as Owens claimed on Facebook.\n\nThe CDC estimated 61,000 influenza-associated deaths in the 2017-2018 season.\n\nSo where did Owens\u2019 80,000 statistic come from?\n\nFor the preliminary 2017-2018 season estimates the CDC approximated 79,400 influenza-associated deaths, which it later updated to 61,000 deaths and archived for historical purposes.\n\n\"All estimates from the 2017-2018 influenza season are preliminary and may change as data from the season are cleaned and finalized,\" the CDC estimated disclosed.\n\nThe National Foundation for Infectious Diseases estimated 80,000 deaths for the same season. This NFID\u2019s estimate came from unpublished CDC data and used estimation methodology that the CDC has since altered for better accuracy.\n\nThe NFID is a nonprofit \"dedicated to educating the public and healthcare professionals about the burden, causes, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infectious diseases across the lifespan,\" its website states.\n\nThe FluSurv-NET data for 2020 has not dipped after January as Owens claimed. It increased in February.\n\nThe CDC reported fewer than 2,000 influenza-associated deaths in January \u2013 not 20,000 as Owens claimed. Since January, the CDC reported more than 5,000 influenza-associated deaths \u2013 not 4,000, as claimed.\n\nKeep in mind, this data only accounts for the patients who died in a hospital from diagnosed influenza. The CDC\u2019s anticipated estimates for the season will be much larger than the 7,000 documented cases so far.\n\nFrom October 2018 to May 2019 the FluSurv-NET data accounted for about 7,000 influenza-associated deaths, which CDC ultimately used to estimate 34,200 total deaths for the 2018-2019 flu season.\n\nHow this flu season compares so far\n\nFluSurv-NET data shows there have been nearly as many influenza-associated deaths to date in 2020 as there were in all of 2019.\n\nThis year\u2019s total will continue to rise as the U.S. enters the 2020-2021 flu season in October, but it\u2019s unlikely that increase will be significant since the majority of annual flu seasons decrease at the beginning of each year.\n\nThe 2017-2018 flu season was the most deadly in the past decade with a CDC estimate of 61,000 deaths. The FluSurv-NET data for 2018 totaled nearly 15,000 in-hospital influenza-associated deaths.\n\nIn the last decade, 2011-2012 was the least deadly, with 12,000 deaths, according to CDC data.\n\nThe early FluSurv-NET data indicates that this 2019-2020 flu season isn\u2019t shaping up to be the decade\u2019s most or least deadly.\n\nWe rate the claim that the CDC has stopped reporting flu deaths because the death rates are so low as FALSE because it is not supported by our research. The CDC continues to report weekly on the 2020 influenza season. Its data shows this season's rates are similar to rates of past years. Further, the rate of flu deaths did not decrease in January, as stated, nor was the total number of deaths in 2018-19 as high as claimed.\n\u2022 CDC \"How CDC Estimates the Burden of Seasonal Influenza in the U.S.\"\n\u2022 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \"Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report\"\n\u2022 USA TODAY \"U.S. flu season is now the longest in a decade\"\n\u2022 National Foundation for Infectious Diseases \"INFLUENZA AND PNEUMOCOCCAL DISEASE CAN BE SERIOUS, HEALTH OFFICIALS URGE VACCINATION\"\n\u2022 CDC \"Archived Estimated Influenza Illnesses, Medical Visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths in the United States-- 2017-2018 influenza season\"\n\u2022 NCBI \"Influenza Illness and Hospitalizations Averted by Influenza Vaccination in the United States, 2005\u20132011\"\n\u2022 USA TODAY \"This flu season is the worst in nearly a decade \u2013 and it's not getting better\"\n\u2022 USA TODAY \"Fact check: Hospitals get paid more if patients listed as COVID-19, on ventilators\"", "lang": "en"}
