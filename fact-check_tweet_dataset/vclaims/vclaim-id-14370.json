And such figures are already on the horizon. Presidential candidate Yuriy Boyko is open about his intention to soften relations with Russia. And while his chance of winning is slim to none, there are others like former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko who may be willing to cut a deal with Russia, or showman Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whose lack of experience means that his tenure would be marked by utter chaos.\u201d\n\nShe added that Russia-friendly candidates would prove useful in \u201cblocking reforms,\u201d with three parties \u201cwith a Russian-leaning orientation \u2026 geared up for parliamentary elections in the fall.\u201d\n\nSo, is Poroshenko\u2019s only path to victory through falsification?\n\nKiselyov correctly cited Gallup\u2019s conclusions regarding the unpopularity of Poroshenko\u2019s government and public perceptions of it being corrupt.\n\nGallup further reported widespread cynicism regarding the upcoming election: \u201cJust 12% of adults in Ukraine in 2018 said they have confidence in the honesty of elections, representing a decline from the 26% who held this sentiment in 2014, indicating growing distrust toward the electoral system in the country.\u201d\n\nAccording to the non-governmental polling organization RATING, Poroshenko is currently in third place among Ukrainians planning to vote in the March 31 election, at 17.4 percent. He trails Batkivshchyna Party head Tymoshenko (18.8 percent) and Servant of the People candidate Zelenskiy (24.9%).\n\nHowever, 39 candidates are running in the March 31 race, with For Life Candidate Boyko (10.2 percent), Civil Position Party candidate Anatoliy Hrytsenko (9.4%), Radical party candidate Oleh Liashko (5.8 percent) and Opposition Bloc candidate Oleksandr Vilkul (3.5 percent) rounding out the top six.\n\nAccording to RATING\u2019s latest polling, support for all remaining candidates runs below 2%, while every fourth person polled had not made up her or his mind. Nearly 50% percent of people said they would not vote for Poroshenko under any circumstances.\n\nAnother poll released on March 27 by the non-governmental Razumkov Centre found that 18.8% of those surveyed planned to vote for Zelenskiy, along with 24.8% of decided votes. But Poroshenko came in second in that poll, attracting the support of 15.7% of those surveyed and 22.1 percent of decided votes (Tymoshenkjo came in third, at 11.5% and 14.8% , respectively). A second place showing on March 31 would advance Poroshenko to the second round.\n\nAnd so, inconsistent polling results, the large number of candidates in play and other factors provide Poroshenko with a potential legitimate path to the second round.\n\nWriting for the European media platform EURACTIV, Bal\u00e1zs Jar\u00e1bik said the fact that Zelenskiy\u2019s support equals the number of undecided votes, coupled with the fact that \u201chis own base is weak,\u201d is an \u201cadvantage for Poroshenko.\u201d\n\nJar\u00e1bik says that while the \u201ceither Poroshenko or Putin\u201d campaign message appears to be working, dirty tricks might also be afoot.\n\n\u201cTo boost his image, and tarnish his opponents, the [Ukrainian] presidential administration is employing trolls, bots, and experts. Political opponents also claim that pressure is applied through the country\u2019s special services (SBU) and the General Prosecutors Office (GPO), institutions directly under the president\u2019s control,\u201d wrote Jar\u00e1bik.\n\nBut Jar\u00e1bik argued that ultimately, with perceptions of Western support and a relatively loyal base, Poroshenko has a chance despite the unpopularity of his government.\n\n\u201c[Poroshenko\u2019s] supporters are the most committed of the country\u2019s voters. His campaign reinforces urbanites\u2019 fear of chaos with the fiery Tymoshenko or the novice Zelenskiy. No wonder that 24 percent of Ukrainians actually think that the president will win,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOtilia Dhand, senior vice president at the advisory firm Teneo Intelligence, said in a March 25 note that there is a 60 percent chance that Poroshenko and Zelenskiy will face each other in a second round of voting in April, as Tymoshenko \u201chas begun to fade.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kyiv Post chief editor Brian Bonner, the weakness of the anti-Poroshenko opposition, together with Poroshenko\u2019s international support and status as a war-time president, a visa-free regime with the EU and a free trade agreement with the European bloc, could give the incumbent Ukrainian president a path to victory, just as anti-oligarchic/authoritarian sentiment, among others factors, could sink him.\n\nLikewise, Konstantin Skorkin, writing for the Carnegie Moscow Center, said a Poroshenko victory is no longer an \u201cimpossibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoroshenko\u2019s rapid advance was possible because, today, the incumbent president is essentially the only noteworthy politician appealing to patriotic voters,\u201d Skorkin wrote.\n\nAnd so combining varying poll results with the independent analysts, Polygraph.info finds Kiselyov\u2019s claim, that Poroshenko can win only through vote-rigging to be misleading.", "lang": "en"}
