She has attended AIPAC the past two years and spoke there in 2017. We always consider invitations for where to share her message of supporting a two-state solution and a mutually agreed upon peace and decrying the rising tide of anti-Semitism.\u201d\n\nThis seems to fall in a gray area. You can\u2019t really say someone is boycotting the organization if she is meeting with representatives. (Pence said they were \u201cboycotting this conference.\u201d) Still, the conference was being held just a few minutes\u2019 drive from Capitol Hill. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) met with AIPAC representatives in a side room at the Convention Center, the conference site, though he did not attend the conference, according to an aide.\n\nDelaney\u2019s national press secretary, Michael Starr Hopkins, said \u201cwe did not boycott AIPAC; we had a scheduling conflict.\u201d He passed along a quote from Delaney: \u201cI am disappointed that a preexisting commitment prevents me from attending AIPAC this year. In no way should my schedule conflict be viewed as me not standing with Israel. \u2026 Israel is being unfairly attacked and is subject to an effort to delegitimize its existence with the BDS movement. As President I intend to be a strong supporter of Israel and a strong voice in condemnation of anti-Semitism.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for Buttigieg said he was not invited. But potential independent candidate Howard Schultz also originally was not invited. \u201cHe did not speak but visited the conference and met with and talked to people there informally after organizers said he was welcome to drop by,\u201d spokeswoman Erin McPike said. She said Schultz spent four hours at the conference.\n\nUntil 2007, AIPAC allowed candidates to hold salons on the convention campus \u2014 no fundraising allowed, but an opportunity to meet and greet folks who might want to give once they get away from the convention. In 2007, the buzz at [Barack] Obama\u2019s salon was, well, buzzier than at Hillary Clinton\u2019s, a harbinger of what was to be. AIPAC has ceased the practice, which means just stopping by the convention is wasted time for an eager campaigner. (AIPAC since 2015 has stopped its roll call, when executives and lay leaders would read out the names of the politicians in attendance.)\n\nHow one evaluates the accuracy of Pence\u2019s claim turns in part on definitions. There is only one active Democratic presidential candidate \u2014 Booker \u2014 who showed up at the convention center. But he only met with constituents, just like three of his colleagues who did so on Capitol Hill. Aides said they were acting as senators, not presidential candidates.\n\nOf the other candidates, only two clearly refused to attend the conference or meet with AIPAC representatives. Two cited scheduling conflicts, with one offering a fulsome statement of praise for AIPAC. One said he was not invited \u2014 though he could have shown up. And four refused to respond to questions, suggesting the issue was not a high priority for them.\n\nDepending on how you do the math, you might get to eight. But it stretches the meaning of \u201cboycott.\u201d Pence would have been on more solid ground if he said: \u201cThis is a moment of peril for the pro-Israel forces, and no one should claim they have a scheduling conflict or did not get an invite to avoid being seen here, among friends.\u201d But instead he said something quite different.", "lang": "en"}
