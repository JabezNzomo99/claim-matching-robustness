Facebook page President Rodrigo Duterte Solid Supporters also shared the meme on April 6, accumulating around 1,000 reactions, 554 comments, and 422 shares. Facebook user Ely Fabella Jr, meanwhile, shared it last April 5 on the Facebook group Solid Sarah Z Duterte 2022.\n\nThe meme was shared by these various pages and groups during the water shortage that first hit parts of Metro Manila and Rizal in early 2019. A reader emailed the meme on July 1 to Rappler's fact-checking unit for verification.\n\nSpeaking during her radio show Biserbisyong Leni on April 14, the Vice President said the quote is false. She told Ely Saludar, her co-anchor, that she felt the posts were being shared in order to make her appear stupid.\n\nRobredo previously questioned the need for the Philippine government to borrow from China for the P12.2-billion Kaliwa Dam project, which is being eyed as a solution to the water crisis. (READ: Robredo on China-funded Kaliwa Dam: Bakit uutang tayo?)\n\nRappler reached out to Facebook group Netizen On Watch.Ph to inquire about the source of the quote they posted, but the group has yet to respond.\n\nThe group was created in May 2015. Its About Page claims it was created to spread awareness among Filipinos about politicians who only serve their personal interests. Its more than 4,700 members mostly share posts supporting the Duterte administration. \u2013 Addie Pobre/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
