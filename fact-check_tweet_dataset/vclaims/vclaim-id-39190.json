Since then, the AAP leader has been suspended from the party and is now under police custody. The reportage around Tahir Hussain and communal riots in Delhi comprises several reports that weren\u2019t journalistically sound.\n\nOne such report was published by Sudarshan News. On February 27, the channel tweeted (archived link) a two-minute \u201cground report\u201d from Tahir Hussain\u2019s house. In the video, the reporter introduced an unnamed person as \u201cwitness\u201d. According to this witness, a girl was dragged into Hussain\u2019s residence, murdered and dumped into a drain nearby. The camera pointed at burnt clothes on the ground. The witness and the reporter claimed that these belonged to the girl whose corpse was found by the police on February 27.\n\nSudarshan News tweeted, \u201cGirl\u2019s burnt clothes, bag and undergarments found at Tahir Hussain\u2019s house. It is speculated that something untoward had happened with the girl. As per sources, police found the girl\u2019s dead body in a drain. Chances are that the girl was dragged into Tahir\u2019s house and brutally killed.\u201d This video has been retweeted over 9,500 times and gained close to four lakh views.\n\nThe Sudarshan News broadcast or the claim that a girl was murdered at Hussain\u2019s residence was shared by multiple BJP members \u2013 Amit Malviya (archive link), Kapil Mishra (archive link), Abhijat Mishra (archive link), Jawahar Yadav (archive link) and Arun Yadav (archive link).\n\nAlt News was unable to locate any reports by mainstream media claiming that a female dead body was recovered near Tahir Hussain\u2019s house. However, several social media users and right-wing websites had shared an image of a minor girl, asserting that her corpse was found in a drain close to his place. Alt News found that the photograph was of a girl who was found dead in her house in an unrelated incident in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nSpeaking with Alt News Alok Kumar, joint commissioner of police, eastern range New Delhi, said, \u201cNo female dead body has been recovered from the Chand Bagh drain, where IB staff Ankit Sharma was found, in our ongoing investigations.\u201d\n\nNitisha Kashyap, special correspondent, CNN News18, was reporting from Chand Bagh on February 27. At 4:20 minutes into the broadcast below, she informed, \u201cThe police briefed that no female dead body has been found from the Chand Bagh drain where Ankit Sharma was found.\u201d\n\nOnly one elderly woman identified so far among Delhi riot victims\n\nOver 50 victims have been identified who died in the communal violence in Delhi. On March 2, The Polis Project, a non-profit research and journalism organisation, published a report which lists the names of the ones who died during targeted violence in northeast Delhi between February 23 to 29. According to the report, only one female dead body was recovered \u2013 an 85-year-old woman. The ScrollandThe Quint reported on it. The list also includes Ankit Sharma\u2019s name.\n\nAlt News spoke with Vasundhara Sirnate, co-founder and director of research at The Polis Project. She said, \u201cSo far, Akbari is the only confirmed female victim on the list.\u201d\n\nA witness who did not \u2018witness\u2019 the crime\n\nOxford dictionary defines the word witness as \u201ca person who sees something happen and is able to describe it to other people.\u201d So how did Sudarshan News find a witness to a crime that has been denied by the police?\n\nAlt News analysed the two-minute broadcast and here\u2019s what we observed:\n\u2022 At the 19-second mark, the anchor addressed an unidentified man as a \u2018witness\u2019 and asked, \u201cWhat do you know about this? Here we have clothes of a woman, maybe something is even burnt.\u201d The \u2018witness\u2019 responded, \u201cThey belong to a madam\u2019s dead body which was found\u2026and these clothes\u2026she dragged and brought here. They killed her and put her clothes here\u2026and threw her into the drain.\u201d\n\u2022 Ironically, when questioned \u201cWho was the girl?\u201d at the 45th second, the \u2018witness\u2019 said, \u201cHer dead body has been taken by the police. I haven\u2019t seen her.\u201d Therefore, the man was essentially witness to a crime that he did not see happen.\n\u2022 The anchor kept referring to him as \u2018witness\u2019 even though he had neither seen the dead body inside Hussain\u2019s residence nor in the drain.\n\u2022 Both the reporter and the so-called witness claimed that the corpse was taken away by the police. However, the police have denied that a female dead body was recovered from the area.\n\nIn conclusion, Sudarshan News ran a broadcast claiming that a girl (or a woman \u2013 the channel doesn\u2019t clarify) was murdered at Tahir Hussain\u2019s house during communal riots in Delhi. Oddly enough, the \u2018witness\u2019 used by the channel hadn\u2019t witnessed the crime at all, yet his statements were held as the gospel of truth. The police have denied that a female corpse was found in the drain near Hussain\u2019s residence but the channel hasn\u2019t taken down its broadcast or clarified/ apologised for misleading viewers at a time of communal violence.\n\nThe provocative misinformation circulated by Sudarshan News is a reminder of a similar report carried by Gujarati daily Sandesh at the time of the 2002 Gujarat pogrom. The outlet published a false story about the breasts of two Hindu women chopped off in Godhra.\n\nThe broadcast was shared by Divya Kumar Soti (archive link) and Vikas Saraswat (archive link), writers at right-wing media platforms OpIndia and Swarajya respectively.\n\nAlt News found that many unverified yet influential social media accounts also shared the video/claim.
