The figures do not show this and it is too early to say how the number of suicide deaths changed during the pandemic.\n\nWhile the figures quoted by Mr Hancock are the latest reported by the ONS, it has clearly said that this data \u201ccannot be used to show the number of suicides with a date of death in 2020, including those that occurred during the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic\u201d.\n\nThe provisional data, released on 1 September, shows the rate and number of suicide deaths registered up to June 2020. This data reported 10.3 suicides per 100,000 people between January and March (equivalent to 1,262 registered deaths), and 6.9 suicide deaths per 100,000 people between April and June, equivalent to 845 registered deaths.\n\nIt is important to note that these figures show when these deaths were registered, not when they happened.\n\nThe 845 suicides registered in the second quarter of 2020 is the lowest number of any quarter since the figures began in 2001, and the ONS said it is \u201cunlikely that the reduction in registered deaths reflects a genuine reduction in the number of suicides\u201d.\n\nIt warns: \u201cThe lower number of deaths registered caused by suicide in Quarter 2 of 2020 should be interpreted with caution; this likely reflects delays to inquests because of the impact of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic on the coroner\u2019s service.\u201d\n\nAll suicides are investigated by a coroner, and it often takes around five months to hold an inquest before the death can be registered. The ONS said the current figures cannot be used to show the actual number of suicides that took place in 2020, as less than one in four suicides registered so far this year also happened in 2020.\n\nThe ONS said this means that we \u201cdo not currently know the total number of suicides that occurred\u201d during the pandemic.\n\nFor example, from April to June 2020\u2014during the peak of the coronavirus crisis in England\u2014 51% of the deaths registered took place before 2020, and 43.7% occurred during Quarter 1. Just 5.3% of the 845 suicides registered in those months actually took place during this period (45 deaths).\n\nResponding to the ONS figures, Ruth Sutherland, chief executive of Samaritans, said it was important to \u201cuse this data responsibly and remember we don\u2019t yet have a clear picture of what has happened this year, because of the persistent problem of reporting delays for suicides.\u201d\n\nThis means Mr Hancock was wrong to say that suicide deaths fell during the peak of the pandemic, as it is too early for the evidence to show what happened. Labour MP Liz Twist has asked for the record to be corrected in the House of Commons.\n\nThe Samaritans\u2019 helpline is available at all hours and can be contacted free on 116 123, or you can email jo@samaritans.org.", "lang": "en"}
