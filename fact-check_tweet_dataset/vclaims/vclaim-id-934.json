However, the DUP said the proposal was \u201cnot going to be acceptable\u201d as it would create a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of Great Britain, in order to keep the border open between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nNothing has yet been agreed. Claims that there will or won\u2019t be border controls on the island of Ireland are predictions, not facts, at this stage.\n\nWe can show why it\u2019s been raised as a real possibility, though.\n\nMovement between Ireland and the UK now\n\nNorthern Ireland being part of the United Kingdom, there\u2019s a land border between the UK and another country, the Republic of Ireland.\n\nIn the past, the need for customs and security checks meant that the border was a physical as well as legal and political reality. Nowadays, it isn\u2019t a barrier in any practical sense.\n\nPeople can also move freely around the UK, Ireland, Isle of Man and Channel Islands within the Common Travel Area. That means there are no official passport checks for someone travelling from Dublin to Belfast to London.\n\nThe Common Travel Area, despite the capital letters, is a pretty informal arrangement that existed before the UK and Ireland joined the EU in 1973.\n\nWhy might the open border change when we leave the EU?\n\nIreland has no plans to leave the EU like the UK is in the process of doing. Brexit means that the UK\u2019s only land border will also be an external border from the EU\u2019s point of view.\n\nThat matters for two reasons. One is immigration and the other is trade in goods, neither of which have many controls on them within the EU.\n\nWe don\u2019t know yet what arrangements will be worked out on these issues, so whether border controls would have to be re-established is still a matter of speculation.\n\nWhat\u2019s been happening in the latest negotiations?\n\nIn March 2018, the EU published a draft withdrawal agreement, effectively setting out its preferred deal, and highlighting text that it understands to already be agreed with the UK. The passages relating to the Irish border have not been agreed to by the UK.\n\nThe EU proposed a \u201ccommon regulatory area\u201d comprising the EU and Northern Ireland, and that the \u201cterritory of Northern Ireland\u201d (excluding territorial waters) be considered to be inside the Customs Union. This would mean that Northern Ireland would still effectively be inside the customs union, even if the rest of the UK was out. This would mean there would be no need for checks at the Irish border, but there could be checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nIn the same month, Theresa May said: \u201cJust as it would be unacceptable to go back to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland [after Brexit], it would also be unacceptable to break up the United Kingdom\u2019s own common market by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea.\u201d She described this as her \u201cpersonal commitment\u201d.\n\nThe Prime Minister also said that \u201cThe UK has been clear it is leaving the Customs Union\u201d and \u201cWe are leaving the single market\u201d. These two arrangements underpin the free movement of goods across the Irish Border. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said in February \u201ca UK decision to leave the single market, and to leave the customs union, would make border checks unavoidable.\u201d\n\nThe government and the EU were apparently close to a deal on the issue in December 2017. We don\u2019t know exactly what the draft proposals were.\n\nHowever, upon seeing a draft of the agreement, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the largest party in Northern Ireland, said it felt that the agreement \u201cwas not going to be acceptable\u201d for them as the terms were \u201cmaking a red line down the Irish Sea\u201d.\n\nThis term refers to there being border controls between Northern Ireland and the rest of Great Britain. The DUP thinks such controls would occur because of the proposal\u2019s intention for Northern Ireland to have some \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d with the rest of Ireland in order to keep the border free of controls.\n\nThis would mean that there would be different conditions in Northern Ireland, closer to Irish (and therefore EU) standards, compared with the rest of the UK.\n\nOthers, including the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, have called for such regulatory alignment with the EU to apply to the UK as a whole.\n\nChecks on immigration are possible but it\u2019s hard to forecast\n\nWorld War II aside, there have never been controls on migration between the UK and Ireland.\n\nThe Common Travel Area means \u201cminimal or non-existent border controls\u201d, in the words of an Irish parliamentary report.\n\nIn practice the land border is almost completely open, but airlines and ferry operators still require photo ID, which doesn\u2019t always have to be a passport. Passengers are always asked for passports at airports where immigration officers can\u2019t tell that they\u2019ve come from within the Common Travel Area.\n\nNevertheless, people can use the open border to travel illegally from Ireland to Northern Ireland and on to the rest of the UK, and likewise in the other direction.\n\nThis is currently addressed by \u201cOperation Gull\u201d, in which immigration officers check passengers on routes between Northern Ireland and the island of Great Britain. This is designed to compensate for the lack of checks on unauthorised travel across the north/south border.\n\nIt depends what restrictions the UK puts on EU immigration\n\nClaiming this won\u2019t change after Brexit assumes that these measures will still be enough to police the open border. Leave campaigners pointed out during the referendum that the Common Travel Area was in place before the EU even existed, and this has since been echoed by the Brexit Secretary.\n\nThis is true, but there\u2019s never been a situation where Ireland accepted free movement of people and the UK didn\u2019t.\n\nIf the UK wants to put restrictions on EU immigration or short visits, that might generate more illegal cross-border movement. At the moment, Operation Gull only has to catch unauthorised migrants from non-EU countries.\n\nIt\u2019s at least possible that increased pressure on the border force will lead to a demand either for passport checks at the north/south border, or passport checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nEither would be politically difficult, but we really don\u2019t know at this stage whether it would be thought necessary.\n\nTo be clear, a beefed-up border to keep out people who aren\u2019t from the British Isles is different to there being restrictions on migration for British and Irish citizens. There\u2019s been no suggestion that Irish people might lose the right to live and work in the UK, or vice versa.\n\nChecks on goods are a more likely outcome\n\nThe official government position has been that \u201coutside the EU\u2019s Customs Union, it would be necessary to impose customs checks on the movement of goods across the border\u201d. This is echoed by researchers at Open Europe and FactCheckNI, while there have also been concerns raised in Ireland.\n\nThis is because if there is no EU-UK agreement on free trade in goods, there would be some British taxes on imports from Ireland, and vice versa.\n\nIf there is such a deal, it would be confined to goods originating in the UK or the EU. This is the pattern for the EU\u2019s free trade agreements with countries such as Norway and Canada.\n\nWithout these \u2018rules of origin\u2019, and a way of enforcing them, goods made in a country like China could be imported through Ireland, avoiding UK import taxes.\n\nSo with or without a trade deal, you would need some way of checking on the goods being taken across the border, either to work out the taxes due on them or to verify that they don\u2019t need to be paid.\n\nThese checks could be fairly light touch. Because Sweden is in the EU and Norway is not, there are customs checks between those two countries.\n\nThey are spot checks, though, and don\u2019t involve the checking of all vehicles.\n\nVans and lorries carrying imports could be told to attend a customs depot, which needn\u2019t be at the border, with spot checks of commercial vehicles near the border as a deterrent against evasion. It might also be possible to use technology to reduce or eliminate the burden of physical checks.", "lang": "en"}
