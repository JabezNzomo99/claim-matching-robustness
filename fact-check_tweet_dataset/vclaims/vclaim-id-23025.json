It\u2019s a trade tax,\" Harris claimed at the California Democratic Party Convention in San Francisco earlier this month. \"I like to call it Trump\u2019s trade tax. And his trade tax is taking $1.4 billion out of working people\u2019s pockets every month.\"\n\nWe reported on this claim earlier. But we did not initially attach a rating to it.\n\nHarris isn\u2019t the only one to describe Trump\u2019s tariffs as a tax. Economists and tax reform advocates have done the same. By definition, a tariff is a tax or duty to be paid on a class of imports or exports.\n\nPolitiFact National examined who pays for the tariffs on Chinese goods, for example, and concluded: \"In many if not most cases, those costs are passed on to American consumers, whether it\u2019s directly on the products hit by the tariffs or through an impact on U.S. companies who use raw materials hit with tariffs.\"\n\nFor this fact check, we wanted to know whether Trump\u2019s actions are costing as much as Harris claims. So, we focused on the second portion of her statement, that the tariffs are \"taking $1.4 billion out of working people\u2019s pockets every month.\"\n\nThe senator\u2019s claim is supported by a March 2019 study titled \"The Impact of the 2018 Trade War on U.S. Prices and Welfare.\" It was conducted by the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a London-based think tank.\n\nIt concluded: \"Overall, using standard economic methods, we find that the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018.\"\n\nIt doesn\u2019t say, however, that the impact was limited to \"working people.\"\n\nStephen Redding, one of the report\u2019s authors and an economics professor at Princeton University, told us by email that Harris\u2019 claim \"is a correct characterization of our research.\" He clarified that \"the impact is for the US economy as a whole, which includes all consumers.\"\n\nThe CEPR study includes research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Princeton and Columbia universities. It reviewed all Trump administration tariffs imposed in 2018 on several countries, including China, on imports from solar panels to washing machines to steel and aluminum.\n\nThe $1.4 billion figure does not include any impact from Trump\u2019s recent threat to place tariffs on Mexico.\n\nHarris told McClatchy this month she opposes the free trade deal Trump signed with Mexico and Canada last year, which updates the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.\n\n\"I\u2019m not in favor of the USMCA, what I call NAFTA 2.0,\" she told the news organization, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n\nShe has previously said she would not have voted for the original NAFTA deal, saying in an interview on CNN in April, \"I believe that we can do a better job to protect American workers.\"\n\nHarris also came out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP, an Obama-backed trade deal between 12 Asian and Pacific nations, during her 2016 Senate race, McClatchy reported. Trump ultimately pulled the country out of TPP after he was elected.\n\nSeveral economists not affiliated with the CEPR study on the cost of Trump's tariffs told us it is reliable.\n\n\"It is a very credible piece of work. For the moment, it is the defining economic evaluation of Trump\u2019s trade policies,\" Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow, Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in an email.\n\nHe added that Harris\u2019 statement may understate the effect of Trump\u2019s tariffs on households, noting a $3 billion per month cost cited in the report.\n\nRedding, the report\u2019s co-author, described the $3 billion as an additional tax cost, \"which is a transfer from importers and consumers to the US government.\" He maintained, however, that the $1.4 billion is the most correct figure to use when referencing the impact on consumers, describing that as the \"welfare cost (reduction in real income) to the US economy as a whole.\"\n\nA spokesman for Harris\u2019 campaign cited a CNBC.com article that summarized the CEPR study.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris recently claimed President Trump\u2019s tariffs are \"taking $1.4 billion out of working people\u2019s pockets every month.\"\n\nA March 2019 study by the Centre for Economic Policy Research generally supports her claim. It notes, however, that was the impact for 2018 and that all consumers felt the effect of the tariffs not just working people. There\u2019s no way yet to know the full impact of the president\u2019s tariffs this year.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
