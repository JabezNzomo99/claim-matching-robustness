Yet in his most recent term he not only got Russia involved in two wars, Ukraine and Syria, but also living standards and the economy have taken a major hit amid sanctions and depressed oil prices.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "May 07, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-4160", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/is-russia-more-peaceful-and-prosperous-under-putin/29213697.html", "vclaim": "In his inaugural address for his fourth term in office, Russian President Vladimir Putin said it his duty is to ensure that Russia is \u201cpeaceful and prosperous.\u201d Based on his last term alone, it\u2019s fair to say his statement is misleading. Russians are involved in wars in two countries and, after a period of recession, Russia\u2019s gross domestic producti (GDP) remains at \u201cstagnation\u201d levels.\n\nDuring Putin\u2019s early years as president, particularly in the mid-2000s, Russians experienced a significant rise in living standards. High oil prices and sensible domestic and foreign policies led to the creation of a Russian \u201cmiddle class.\u201d \n\n\n\nBut in Putin\u2019s last term alone, he used his military to take control of and completely annex the Crimean peninsula in 2014. In Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Putin fomented a war disguised as a \u201cseparatist uprising.\u201d To this day the Kremlin keeps the war going by supplying arms, material, and money to two self-proclaimed \u201crepublics\u201d in the region. The International Criminal Court has ruled that the annexation of Crimea and the war in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region constitute an international armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nPutin\u2019s rhetoric has been anything but peaceful as well. During his March 2018 address to the Federal Assembly, Putin spent a large portion of his speech boasting about Russia\u2019s new nuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cNo one was listening,\u201d Putin said in his speech. \u201cThey will listen now.\u201d\n\nPutin\u2019s presentation even included a video depicting nuclear warheads hitting the state of Florida.\n\nAt the same time, the Russian economy has been hit hard, poverty is on the rise and the gains of the mid-2000s are starting to wane. Also, while Putin claimed he was duty-bound to bring prosperity to every Russian household, the country\u2019s wealth inequality suggests that a few households are prospering far more than others.", "lang": "en"}
