(RELATED: Did Mark Twain Pen This Quote On Kindness?)\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation searched a collection of Twain\u2019s written body of work, as well as \u201cThe Quotable Mark Twain,\u201d which contains more than 1,800 verified quotes, but found no record of the statement.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence the quote originated with Mark Twain,\u201d says Barbara Schmidt, a Twain researcher and writer for the Center for Mark Twain Studies that lists the quote as \u201cunverified\u201d on her website, in an email to the DCNF.\n\nThe website Quote Investigator traced the earliest strong match of the expression back to a 1914 periodical, though conceptually-related phrases appeared earlier. The unattributed quote was utilized in an attempt to stop people from throwing away the advertisement without reading it, according to Quote Investigator.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
