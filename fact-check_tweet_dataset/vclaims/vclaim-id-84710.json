However, AFP found the video is a compilation of shots from various Chinese cities but not Wuhan.\n\nThe captions accompanying the video - which is being shared on social media in several countries including Nigeria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic - say that the footage represents Wuhan.\n\nThe version shared on March 27 by a Nigerian YouTube channel (archived here) is captioned \u201cWatch: How Beauty is WUHAN City In China, Before The COVID 19 (sic)\u201d. It was shared more than 1,200 times on Facebook, according to data from social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle.\n\nIn Slovakia, the video was first shared on March 25, 2020 by the vice chairman of the Communist Party, Jalal Suleiman. His post reads: \u201cThis is the Chinese city of Wuhan, the first place struck by coronavirus. Yes, this is Communist China. I do not know why the West, to which we have been pushed for the past thirty years, claims to be the top of the civilized world. East we are, friends, and to the East we shall turn.\u201d\n\nSlovak site Hlavn\u00fd Denn\u00edk shared the same footage with a similar claim on April 10. This site has previously published false information debunked by AFP (here in Slovak).\n\nThese two versions of the video were shared by more than 6,500 Facebook users.\n\nWhat the video actually shows\n\nThe claim that the video shows the city of Wuhan is false.\n\nIt is actually a compilation of aerial shots from across China and taken from multiple sources. Some of the footage was taken from the Chinese version of the video-sharing platform TikTok, called Douyin, while other parts were taken from Twitter or from years-old YouTube videos.\n\nAfter an extensive online search, which included the use of reverse image search tools and maps, AFP was able to identify all the skyscrapers, which are all located in China, but none in the city of Wuhan. We were also able to track down most of the other landmarks and highways, which are also located in other Chinese cities.\n\nWuhan, home to around 11 million people, saw the epidemic claim more than 3,800 lives there. It has a number of its own modern skyscrapers, but none were featured in this video.\n\nHere are the locations of the buildings and landmarks shown in the video:\n\n\n\nThis building is the Beauty Crown Grand-Tree Hotel in the city of Sanya on China\u2019s southern island of Hainan. It consists of nine buildings resembling trees and contains theatres, bars and restaurants.\n\nThis is the Sunrise Kempinski Hotel on Yanqi Lake, around 70 kilometres northeast of Beijing in Huairou district.\n\nThis artificial waterfall stands 108 metres tall on the outside of the Liebian Building in Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou province in southern China.\n\nThis is the Sheraton Huzhou Hot Spring Resort, nicknamed \u201cHorseshoe Hotel\u201d. It lies on the shore of Lake Tai in the city of Huzhou, not far from Shanghai.\n\nThis is the 604-metre Canton Tower on the banks of Pearl River in Guangzhou, in southern China. In the background of the picture, on the northern side of the Pearl River, we see the Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre and Guangzhou International Finance Centre.\n\nThis pagoda is in the ancient city of Xi\u2019an, one of the former Chinese capitals. It is called Bell Tower and was built in 1384 during the Ming dynasty. Together with the neighbouring Drum Tower, which is also featured in the video, these are somes of the most famous sites of Xi\u2019an.\n\nThis is the Liede Bridge in Guangzhou. Opened for traffic in 2009, it crosses the Pearl River and connects the Tianhe district with Haizhu district.\n\nThe Yachi River Bridge spans 800 metres of motorway in the province of Guizhou.\n\nThis street is in the city of Xiangyang in Hubei province. Taking note of features like the \u201cHVH\u201d sign in the lower right corner and what appeared to be a golden dragon statue in the lower left corner, we were able to identify the street using Baidu maps.\n\nFinished in 2017, this is Shijiazhai Bridge, a part of the Yongshun-Jishou expressway in Hunan province.\n\nThis is the Qianchun Interchange in the southern city of Guiyang.\n\nThis is Xingkang bridge on the Ya'an-Kangding expressway in southwestern Sichuan province.\n\nThis is part of a 15-second clip originally uploaded to Facebook in November 2018 by the People\u2019s Daily, the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. It features a giant portrait of \u201can ethnic minority girl\u201d made out of flowers in the mountains of Yunnan province.\n\nSometimes dubbed the \u201cVenice of the East\u201d, Suzhou in Jiangsu province lies between the Yangtze river and Lake Tai and draws tourists from all over the world.\n\nOur team of international fact-checkers has not yet been able to identify the location of these illuminated rooftops which appear around the 2:10 mark in the video. AFP\u2019s Hong Kong and Beijing bureaus suggested the image could show Yuyuan Garden in Shanghai or Hankouli building complex in Wuhan (satellite map). However, AFP Fact Check was unable to verify this.\n\nIf you know where these illuminated rooftops are located, get in touch!", "lang": "en"}
