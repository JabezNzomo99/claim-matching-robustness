It\u2019s a part of an ongoing effort by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy to publicly \u201csupport birth control and all that it makes possible for individuals and society,\u201d and the impacts of \u201cthe ability to plan, prevent, and space pregnancies.\u201d\n\nSince the election of Donald Trump as president, reproductive rights advocates have argued women\u2019s access to birth control and abortions will be restricted under his administration. After years of saying that he is in favor of abortion rights, Trump now says he opposes abortion. Trump also says that he plans to repeal parts of President Obama\u2019s health-care law, which could affect the requirement for insurance companies to provide free contraception to women.\n\nResearchers found 88.2 percent of women aged 15 to 44 had used contraception (some women use contraceptive hormones for health benefits unrelated to pregnancy). Of the women they interviewed, aged 15 to 44, 86.6 percent had had vaginal intercourse. They were counted as \u201csexually experienced.\u201d Among the \u201csexually experienced\u201d population of women aged 15 to 44, 99 percent had used one contraceptive method at some point in their lifetime.\n\nIn other words, a woman may have had sex only once, or she may have had a partner who only used a condom once, and she would be placed in the 99-percent category. A woman may have had sex once and used the withdrawal method, and she would be counted in the same category as the woman who has sex regularly and takes birth control pills or has an IUD.\n\nBut the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit organization that promotes reproductive health and had started as an arm of Planned Parenthood, in an April 2011 study estimated that, under current contraceptive use, 31 percent of women used the pill or other hormonal contraceptive, 5 percent used an IUD, and 14 percent used condoms. Another 33 percent relied on either female or male sterilization, while 17 percent used natural family planning, other methods or no method. The figures were based on 2006 to 2008 NSFG interviews, so it\u2019s similar to the data in the CDC report.\n\nThis is the third time The Fact Checker has examined fishy claims about the use of birth control methods by women. Each time, the same problems with the data arise. In 2012, we gave Two Pinocchios to the claim that \u201c98 percent of Catholic women\u201d use birth control. In 2014, we gave Two Pinocchios to the claim that \u201c99 percent of women use birth control in their lifetime and 60 percent use it for something other than family planning.\u201d It\u2019s an easy talking point, but it\u2019s still a problematic one.\n\n[Update: In a response to our fact check, National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unwanted Pregnancy\u2019s spokesperson, Julian Teixeira, said the campaign typically uses the talking point that \u201c99 percent of sexually active women have used birth control.\u201d It is a simplified version of the research because the social media campaign relies on brevity and the underlying data is much longer and more complex, Teixeira said.\n\nOn the use of the word \u201cbirth control,\u201d Teixeira said: \u201cWhile in some circles \u201cbirth control\u201d is used to mean only the pill, that\u2019s not based on any official definition. Our Thanks, Birth Control campaign has always been part of a larger narrative that includes the importance of having access to the full range of contraception, and the notion that many women have access to some methods but not others. Our resources are all carefully worded, carefully footnoted, and carefully researched. The suggestion that we are being irresponsible or misleading by using \u201cbirth control\u201d and \u201ccontraception\u201d interchangeably is simply not true.\u201d]\n\nWe find two issues with the talking point that \u201c99 percent of women have used birth control,\u201d or \u201c99 percent of women use birth control at some point in their lives.\u201d First, the 99 percent figure refers to the population of women who are of reproductive age who have had sex with a man at least once. This is important because there are women who use birth control for reasons unrelated to pregnancy.\n\nBut especially in the current debate over the effect of Trump\u2019s policies on coverage for contraceptives for women, and in the context of affordability and accessibility to reproductive health care, it\u2019s an important point to make. This claim doesn\u2019t capture all the caveats that come with the research. And so for the third time, we award Two Pinocchios to this talking point.", "lang": "en"}
