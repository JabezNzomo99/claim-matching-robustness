The article\u2019s title was a quote ascribed to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal \u2013\u201cIndia should concede its right on Kashmir as Kashmiris want independence.\u201d The post was shared nearly 5,000 times.\n\nA Twitter user @RaviNEGI4BJPwho identifies himself as a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party and is followed by Railway Minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s Office had shared the same newspaper clip in June 2018. He wrote an accompanying caption that said \u2013 \u201cIf it were to be left to Kejri Ali, even Delhi would be sold.\u201d\n\nAnother Twitter handle followed by Piyush Goyal\u2019s Office shared the newspaper clip in June 2018. A few other individual users and Facebook pages/groups circulated the same earlier this year.\n\nThere are certain observational hints that call the bluff of the fake e-paper clip. First, it does not include a date and second, has some serious grammatical flaws. In the first paragraph, the article addresses CM Kejriwal as \u201c\u0915\u0947\u091c\u0930\u0940 (Kejri)\u201d which is uncharacteristic of a mainstream newspaper. In the subsequent paragraph, a statement by Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif is not written in the form of a direct quote. As one reads further, similar slights can be identified. However, the most significant indicator of the falseness of the clip is the fact that it says nothing about Kejriwal\u2019s quote; it is only mentioned in the title.\n\nAlt News found the possible origin of the fake clip. In 2014, Rishi Bagree had posted the same clip with a changed title and Pakistan\u2019s former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s photograph instead of Kejriwal.\n\nObserving the clips juxtaposed together, the similarity is evident. Not only are the articles exactly the same (with just the title changed), but the report on the right \u2013 \u201c\u092a\u093e\u0915\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u091c\u0932\u093e\u090f \u0917\u090f \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u0927\u094d\u092f\u091c (Indian flags burned in Pakistan)\u201d \u2013 is identical as well.\n\nSince there are two versions of the same e-paper clip circulated at different points in time, there could be two possibilities \u2013 either the clip is completely manufactured or the original e-paper clip has been morphed more than once. To establish if a similar report exits and might have been photoshopped, Alt News searched for the article on Google using keywords from the report and found a February 5, 2014 article by Dainik Jagran. The earliest instance of the e-paper clip that we found on social media was posted by Rishi Bagree on February 7, 2014.\n\nIf one goes through the Jagran report, it is evident that its online e-paper version has been morphed. The article reads exactly the same, apart from its altered title and the word \u201c\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 (Bharat)\u201d replaced with \u201c\u0915\u0947\u091c\u0930\u0940 (Kejri)\u201d in the body of the report. When this article is juxtaposed with the one viral on social media, the modifications are clearly visible.\n\nIt was, therefore, evident that the e-paper clip was fake and used to propagate misinformation. In 2016, websites like mobilenews24.com had written articles on the fake clip but later deleted them.\n\nA Twitter user followed by Piyush Goyal\u2019s Office and fake news website Postcard Newshad also shared the news clip last year.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t an isolated incident of a morphed e-paper clip being circulated on social media to spread disinformation. In July 2017, BJP MP Pratap Sinha had tweeted a Times of India story with a distorted headline. Earlier in June, a fake quote was ascribed to former President Pranab Mukherjee using a manufactured newspaper clip. That same month, another fake e-paper clip was circulated in the name of former HU student Rohith Vemula.\n\nAs consumers of daily news on the internet, we are attuned to believe e-paper clips because they carry within them an inherent genuineness. However, with instances of manufactured or morphed news clips emerging on social media, a self-fact-check is important. To establish the authenticity of such clips, any sentence picked from an article on the paper can be searched on Google. Most media outlets with e-papers have online versions of their reports and these would show up if the news is genuine.\n\nAs misinformation is easy to spread, a quick fact-check prevents further circulation of fake news.\n\n[This article has been updated to include Rishi Bagree\u2019s (@rishibagree) tweet, which we found was the earliest instance of the fake e-paper clip shared on social media.]", "lang": "en"}
