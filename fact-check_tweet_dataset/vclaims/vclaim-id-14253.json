The blog is not linked to the media group and it has manufactured false news using a doctored headline and an old photo.\n\nThe headline of the March 2 blog post from tribuninf0.blogspot.com translates as: \u201cHome minister: regional leaders, from village heads to governors, cannot remain neutral. They must do whatever Mr. Jokowi wants\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nWidodo, who is seeking re-election in April, is best known in Indonesia by his nickname, Jokowi.\n\nThe blog post has a photo of Indonesia's Home Minister Tjahjo Kumolo. Here is his official website.\n\nThe blog\u2019s name and logo resemble those of Tribunnews, an Indonesia-based news organisation.\n\nLinks to the blog post showing the purported article have been shared thousands of times after it appeared on Facebook, such as here, here, here and here. The last post said in its caption that Widodo, \u201cas time went by, has become increasingly authoritarian\u201d.\n\nThe tribuninf0.blogspot.com blog that hosted the purported article has since been removed. However, screenshots of the misleading blog post continue to be shared on Facebook, such as here and here.\n\nThe post\u2019s first paragraph translates to: \u201cHome minister Tjahjo Kumolo prohibits civil servants from being neutral ahead of the 2019 presidential election. Civil servants are required to obey their superior. What does this order from Tjahjo mean?\u201d\n\nA Google search result found that the blog post copied this March 2 report by Indonesian news website Detik.com.\n\nThe headline of the Detik.com report, however, does not say: \u201cThey must do whatever Mr. Jokowi wants\u201d -- the words found in the blog post title. The original headline translates as: \u201cHome minister: Civil servants cannot be neutral, please disseminate Mr. Jokowi\u2019s programs\u201d.\n\nThe photo used in the blog post can be traced back to major Indonesian news portal Liputan6.com, credited to \u201cLiputan6.com/Johan Tallo\u201d.\n\nUsing Google reverse image search, AFP found the photo in this 2014 article on Liputan6's website, headlined: \u201cThese are the short-term programs of home minister Tjahjo Kumolo\u201d.\n\nThis 2014 post on Kumolo's website has the same picture.", "lang": "en"}
