It is a deliberate attempt by vested interests to spread misinformation and cause misunderstanding between the friendly people of Bhutan and Assam, \u201d the post read.\n\nThe post also stated that due to COVID-19 lockdown, Indian farmers could not enter Bhutan to maintain the irrigation channels. However, the channels were later repaired by Samdrup Jongkhar District Officials and general public.\n\nMoreover, we found that the picture attached to the post is from 2015. We found the picture on the official website of the Bhutanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forest. The picture was taken during the inauguration of the Taklai irrigation channel.\n\nHence, from the above information, we can conclude that Bhutan did not stop the water flow and hence the posts are misleading.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
