An argument over the reasons behind these decisions dominated Prime Minister\u2019s Questions today:\n\nThe court in question is the Upper Tribunal. It made two decisions in November 2016, the effect of which the government is now reversing with new PIP regulations. That\u2019s expected to affect people with mental health conditions in particular.\n\nIn making the first decision, Upper Tribunal Judge Mesher said that it \u201cillustrates once again the gaps left in the drafting of [the original PIP regulations], requiring a large expenditure of effort to render its provisions coherent\u201d. And in the second, three judges pointed to \u201ca difference of opinion within the Upper Tribunal\u201d on what the regulations mean.\n\nSo Ms May is correct in that sense. The regulations (introduced by the Coalition government) are ambiguous enough that even judges struggle to apply them consistently to real-life cases.\n\nThe second of these decisions was about \u201coverwhelming psychological distress\u201d, and how this related to someone\u2019s ability to \u201cfollow the route\u201d of a familiar or unfamiliar journey. This isn\u2019t a phrase that the judges introduced. It\u2019s from the original PIP regulations.\n\nFor example, people are awarded four points towards their entitlement to PIP if they need \u201cprompting to be able to undertake any journey to avoid overwhelming psychological distress\u201d.\n\nThere are also scores of 10 for those who can\u2019t \u201cfollow the route of an unfamiliar journey\u201d without assistance, and 12 for those who can\u2019t \u201cfollow the route of a familiar journey\u201d without assistance. You need at least 8 points to get this part of PIP at the standard rate, and 12 for the enhanced rate.\n\nWhat the Upper Tribunal had to decide was whether the regulations allowed for someone being unable to \u201cfollow the route\u201d of a journey because of overwhelming psychological distress.\n\nThe government had argued that such distress couldn\u2019t be considered for the purposes of these particular scores. It said they were focused on \u201csensory or cognitive impairment\u201d.\n\nThe Upper Tribunal rejected this argument, saying that the government had been correct to concede the point in a prior case. It reasoned that someone might be overtaken by psychological distress while trying to follow a route, if he or she didn\u2019t have assistance.\n\nThat means someone might be entitled to four, 10 or 12 points because of psychological distress\u2014which the tribunal thought was fine: \u201cthere is no reason why there should not be an overlap\u201d.\n\nThe judgment was a highly technical analysis of the language and logic behind these regulations.", "lang": "en"}
