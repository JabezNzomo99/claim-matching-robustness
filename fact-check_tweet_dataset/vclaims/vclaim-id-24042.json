In the video, people are seen to take rocks and throw them onto a motorway.\n\nHowever, the video is not of Palestinians or from Palestine. The footage is taken from protests in July 2019 in Israel around the death of an Ethiopian-Israeli teenager Solomon Tekah. Solomon Tekah was shot dead by an off duty police officer, igniting ongoing tensions between Ethiopian-Israelis and law enforcement.\n\nThe Facebook page that shared the post originally claimed that the footage was of migrants in Calais. They updated the caption after posting to say it was Palestinians. Other versions of the video across social media have also claimed it is Calais, including Tommy Robinson\u2019s telegram channel.", "lang": "en"}
