Stephens purportedly bragged about the murder on Facebook Live, subsequently claiming to have shot several additional victims. Cleveland.com reported:\n\nSteve Stephens remained at-large early Monday morning, accused of a killing that unsettled Northeast Ohio and garnered national attention. Police say Stephens, 37, of Cleveland, walked up to Robert Godwin Sr., a 74-year-old father of nine and grandfather of 14, on Sunday afternoon and fatally shot him on a sidewalk in the city\u2019s Glenville neighborhood. Stephens posted a recording of the shooting on Facebook, then later posted another video laughing about the incident and claiming that he had killed more than a dozen other people. Police said there is no evidence of other shooting victims.\n\nThe blog ClashDaily shared the doctored image in a 17 April 2017 post, claiming it was authentic:\n\nWhen a description of a suspect is given, political correctness shouldn\u2019t EVER enter into it.

Steve Stephens, 37, is wanted for aggravated murder for the death of a senior citizen, Robert Godwin Sr., 74, of Cleveland.\n\nOn 16 April 2017, a Twitter user tweeted to the WJW-TV account to ask about the circulating photograph:\n\nThe news station confirmed that the image was doctored, providing the unaltered version side-by-side with the fake:\n\nIn a statement to Snopes.com, a representative for WJW-TV forwarded both versions of the image and confirmed:\n\nSteve Stephens remains at large as of 17 April 2017.", "lang": "en"}
