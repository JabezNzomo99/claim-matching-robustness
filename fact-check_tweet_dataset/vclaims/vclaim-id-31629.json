This is misleading; the rule is not new and only applies to early caucus voters.\n\n\u201cThe Nevada Democratic Party made a last min rule change to toss ballots that only name one choice,\u201d according to a tweet from February 15, 2020. \u201cCan someone explain to me how this *isn\u2019t* voter suppression?\u201d\n\nThe tweet was posted by a supporter of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. It was deleted but lives on, mainly via screenshots shared on Facebook, including by pages supporting the US senator from Vermont.\n\nSupporters of Sanders believe that the Democratic Party cheated him out of the nomination in 2016, stacking the deck in favor of his rival Hillary Clinton, and fear that such a scenario could be repeated in 2020.\n\nThe western US state of Nevada will hold caucuses on February 22 as part of a nationwide process to select the Democratic nominee, who will take on US President Donald Trump in a November 2020 national election.\n\nThe Nevada State Democratic Party (NSDP) published rules for early voting -- including the requirement that three candidates be listed -- in October 2019.\n\n\u201cAll early vote participants are required to make three presidential preference choices when voting early before submitting their preferences,\u201d according to the rules.\n\n\u201cThey have to choose three candidates and that can be the same candidate three times, it just has to be three selections,\u201c Molly Forgey, a spokeswoman for the Nevada Democrats, told AFP.\n\nThe NSDP, as well as Sanders and others sought to alert early Nevada voters to the requirement, but did not attribute it to a last-minute rule change.\n\nThe three choices are required because of the nature of the Nevada caucuses, during which voters express their support for their preferred choice by physically standing with other backers of the candidate.\n\nParticipants whose candidate receives less than 15 percent of the votes must disband and stand with supporters of another, viable candidate.\n\nIf an early voter\u2019s first choice is not viable, their second or third choice can be used as necessary, in the same way a physically present voter would have joined a different group of supporters.", "lang": "en"}
