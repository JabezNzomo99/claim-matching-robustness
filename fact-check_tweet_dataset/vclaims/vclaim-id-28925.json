While it is true that wax is added to apples to extend shelf life, apples are naturally coated in a fruit wax that is lost after picking and washing. The wax added by producers causes no health issues in humans. Apples are also not the only fruit or vegetable to go through this process\u2014things like lemons, cucumbers, and peppers are also commonly waxed.\n\nNext, a white napkin is shown to turn orange when soaked in orange soda, removing the food colouring, and later in the video, a bottle of Mountain Dew is filtered to remove the colour.\n\nIt\u2019s true that sodas, soft drinks, and a myriad of other food products contain artificial colouring and that these are listed on products. In the UK, the government and the EU issues strict guidelines around what can be added to food. Some artificial colours have also specifically been linked to hyperactivity in children.\n\nAs pointed out by Snopes, the next part of the video shows a cupcake being washed and broken apart until only a stringy substance is left. The video incorrectly suggests these are \u201csynthetic fibres\u201d. Snopes identified the substance as gluten (you can see gluten behaving in a similar manner in this video). Gluten occurs naturally in many foods, including flour based cupcakes, and for everyone apart from those with coeliac disease or a gluten sensitivity, is fine to consume.\n\nThe video also shows a number of food products being mixed with iodine, including two types of mayonnaise and cottage cheese. As correctly shown in the video, iodine turns black when it comes into contact with starch. But the video then seems to claim that mayonnaise containing starch is \u201charmful\u201d.\n\nThis is incorrect. Starch is a naturally occurring carbohydrate in plants and, far from being harmful to consume, is recommended as part of a healthy, balanced diet.\n\nAnother part of the video includes someone cutting open an instant noodle cup to reveal empty space below the dried noodles. It\u2019s not clear what point the video is making here. This space helps with cooking and transportation and allows the noodles the space to expand when they are cooked.\n\nThere is a test in the video that shows both butter and margarine being mixed in hot water. It then says that high-quality butter is made from cream or milk while margarine is made from palm oil and doesn\u2019t melt. Again it\u2019s not clear what point is being made here; it\u2019s correct that butter and margarine are different things. Butter is a dairy product made up from primarily animal fats, while margarine is primarily vegetable fats (not just palm oil, although most kinds of margarine available in the UK do contain some palm oil). While we do not know the brands of butter or margarine used in the video, it is most likely that their different behaviour in hot water is due to different melting points.\n\nThe video also shows a test for \u201cnatural honey\u201d (honey that has not been diluted with sugar syrup). The video incorrectly suggests that if honey swirled in water reveals a honeycomb pattern, it suggests this shows the honey is pure as the honey\u2019s \u201cgenetic memory\u201d is being revealed.\n\nA honeycomb-like pattern can appear if you mix honey in water, but this isn\u2019t because honey has a genetic memory.\n\nIt is correct that some cheaper honey products (or \u201cfake honey\u201d) are mixed with syrups, and food standards authorities can undertake scientific tests to detect this. But scientists have questioned the reliability of the water method from this video (and many other DIY honey \u201cpurity tests\u201d found online), as natural honey has a wide range of characteristics.\n\nDiluted honey is still safe to eat and all ingredients should be listed on the packaging.\n\nIn summary, this video purports to show concerning facts about the food we eat, while in truth almost all the claims are either incorrect, misleading, or unclear.", "lang": "en"}
