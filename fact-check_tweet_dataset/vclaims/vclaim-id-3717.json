So, there\u2019s no truth to a story circulating online with the headline: \u201cCalifornia Governor Signs Order To Use ARABIC Numerals In Public Schools.\u201d\n\nFacebook users flagged the story as potentially false. It is.\n\nThe website that originally posted the bogus story, America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, is part of a network of sites that describe its content as \u201csatire\u201d aimed at provoking conservative readers. The story also claims that California law now \u201crequires that students in 4th grade learn about Islam and Sharia Law, saving Christianity for the 7th Grade.\u201d\n\nThat network of websites frequently publishes stories about Islamic culture, which are often copied by other sites and re-posted without a satire disclaimer.\n\nRecent examples that we\u2019ve written about include a false story that the U.S. Supreme Court had banned public schools from teaching about Islam, and a made-up story about a mosque being raided in Michigan.\n\nAt least two sites \u2014 one called Times Feed and one called USA Politics Feed \u2014 republished the phony story about Hindu-Arabic numerals without a disclaimer.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nEncyclopaedia Britannica. \u201cDevelopment Of Modern Numerals And Numeral Systems \u2014 The Hindu-Arabic system.\u201d Accessed 16 Mar 2018.\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. \u201cAncient History Math Mystery.\u201d Accessed 19 Mar 2018.\n\n\u201cCalifornia Governor Signs Order To Use ARABIC Numerals In Public Schools.\u201d TheLastLineOfDefense.online. 13 Mar 2018.", "lang": "en"}
