A few Facebook fan groups dedicated to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s Anant Kumar Hegde, shared the video over the weekend on March 10th.\n\nSince then, the video has gone viral on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube with many using it to troll the chief minister and the Congress party.\n\nA Google search for 'Siddaramaiah' shows that the video of him dancing is one of the most searched queries.\n\nSeveral Kannada news outlets such as Public TV and FirstNews had already debunked the video during the course of the week or had alternatively reported it as a 'fan dance'.\n\nChannamahagowda, a farmer by profession, from Mysore performed the dance at a workshop organised for farmers at Kaggalipura's cultural center in Bengaluru's suburb on March 6th.\n\nAnekatte Vishwanath, a participant at the workshop and the man who shot the video on March 6th posted his dismay about how fan groups dedicated to Anant Kumar Hegde stole his video and used it to spread disinformation.\n\nThe video below is Vishwanath's Facebook Live. It is the first instance of the video being published to the Internet. It is also the longest clip of the dance, which is preceded by two individuals singing a Kannada song.\n\nVishwanath has not responded to BOOM's message for a comment.\n\nSuvarna News' spoke on camera to the man in the video in an exclusive interview.", "lang": "en"}
