One version of the video, which shows a grandparent gifting a copy of Adolph Hitler\u2019s \u201cMein Kampf\u201d to a grandchild who requested the video game Minecraft, racked up more than 5.5 million views in just a few days:\n\nThis video does not document a grandparent\u2019s genuine attempt to gift a grandchild a copy of the Hitler manifesto. This is actually a staged comedy bit created by humorist Yann Stotz.\n\nStotz posted the original video to his Instagram page on Christmas Eve. Soon after, uncredited versions started to circulate on Snapchat, Facebook, and Twitter, where they were often presented as if they showed a genuine Christmas mix-up.\n\nStotz told the French news outlet 20 Minutes that he didn\u2019t intend to deceive anyone with this video, adding that those who encountered it on his own social media pages would have seen that it was created by a comedian.\n\nOriginally, I put the video on Instagram on the evening of the 24th, to make a joke on this pun between Mein Kampf and Minecraft \u2014 which I am not the first to have done, in my opinion. Someone took it up and shared it on Snapchat without crediting me and without the \u201cYann Stotz \u2013 humorist\u201d link which gave the video context: the problem is that people took it seriously, and it made my family like something it is not. Of course it is a fake, but there was no intention to deceive, otherwise I would have posted an advertisement for my show!\n\nStotz added that he first noticed the aural similarities between \u201cMinecraft\u201d and \u201cMein Kampf\u201d when he gifted a copy of the video game to his godchild a few years ago. When Christmas rolled around this year, he decided to make a funny video about a grandparent mishearing his grandchild\u2019s request.\n\nThree years ago we gave Minecraft as a gift to my godchild, and I said to myself \u2018it\u2019s funny, it looks like Mein Kampf,\u2019 so this year I printed the cover of Mein Kampf and put it on a book by Jules Verne and then I shot the video.\n\nThe original version of Stotz\u2019 video featuring a grandparent gifting \u201cMein Kampf\u201d to a grandchild who requested Minecraft can be seen below:", "lang": "en"}
