The initial report on the designation, in the Daily Beast, referred repeatedly to \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s State Department,\u201d which then got translated through political shorthand as \u201cHillary Clinton.\u201d (Indeed, the Daily Beast was less subtle in its headline on a video: \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s Boko Haram Fail.\u201d)\n\nThere is a defined process in the law for designating a foreign terrorist organization (FTO). The starting point is the Bureau of Counterterrorism, which monitors the activities of terrorist groups to decide whether any should merit designation. The bureau builds up an administrative record \u2014 something that would stand up in court \u2014 and has to pick its priorities. (The bureau also has to keep track of all existing foreign terrorist organizations to determine whether they should remain on the list.)\n\n1. It must be a foreign organization. 2. The organization must engage in terrorist activity or terrorism, or retain the capability and intent to engage in terrorist activity or terrorism. (The definitions of \u201cterrorist activity,\u201d \u201cterrorism,\u201d and so forth are set forth in law.) 3. The organization\u2019s terrorist activity or terrorism must threaten the security of U.S. nationals or the national security (national defense, foreign relations or the economic interests) of the United States.\n\nIf the Bureau of Counterterrorism decides a designation may be warranted, then the State Department\u2019s regional bureaus weigh in. The regional bureaus, of course, deal directly with the ambassadors of the affected country and, thus, can provide perspective on the political impact of a designation. Ultimately, if a recommendation goes to the secretary of state that the groups should be designated, then the attorney general and the Treasury Department are asked to concur. Officials at the White House are also generally kept informed if it looks as if a group is going to be designated.\n\n\u201cOur government is working hard to defeat the motley band of criminals popularly known as Boko Haram, a group that is likely to try to capitalize on the recent wave of unrest,\u201d wrote Nigerian Ambassador Adebowale Adefuye in the Hill newspaper. \u201cIn order to effectively combat Boko Haram, we need American help to be complementary \u2014 not contradictory \u2014 to our own efforts. The current well-intentioned efforts by a few members of Congress to classify the Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) actually risk deepening and entrenching the Boko Haram movement, thereby endangering more lives.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cRecognition through FTO designation by a sovereign the size and stature of the United States would give Boko Haram the title they seek and status they desire, stimulating a fundraising effort that has not yet been attainable from their current perch in northern Nigeria. Make no mistake \u2014 Nigeria will continue to collaborate with the United States in the fight against Boko Haram. Yet a unilateral designation of the group as an FTO by the United States would risk undercutting our shared goal of a secure and prosperous Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian concern was echoed by academic experts on Nigeria, who signed a joint letter to the State Department arguing against a premature designation. \u201cIf economic development is to play a role in alleviating tensions in northern Nigeria, we should not hamper access by USAID [the U.S. Agency for International Development] or private NGOs [nongovernmental organizations] in providing aid and assistance in the region,\u201d the experts wrote, noting that the designation would make it illegal for NGOs to communicate with members of Boko Haram to urge them to renounce violence \u2014 or even to conduct independent scholarly inquiries about the group.\n\nFrom the perspective of the State Department, designating Boko Haram as a foreign terrorist organization was not a simple choice, even with the pressure from Congress. The host government was adamantly opposed to the idea \u2014 and its military was doing a very poor job in handling the threat. So officials decided to see whether there was a way to use the situation to send a signal to Boko Haram and pressure the Nigerian military to clean up its act, without angering the Nigerian government with a unilateral designation that it opposed.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s record of atrocities perpetrated by some of its security forces during operations against Boko Haram have been widely documented. As we have advised the Nigerians, consistent with U.S. law and policy, we review security force units who may receive assistance, and we cannot and do not provide assistance when we have credible information that those units have committed gross violations of human rights. With this important consideration in mind, we have worked to engage where and how we are able to, in viewing our engagements and training efforts with human rights and law of armed conflict modules and emphasizing the importance of the broad counterinsurgency approach that we ourselves have spent so much blood and treasure fulfilling.\u201d\n\nIn other words, it was a step-by-step diplomatic process. It was made clear that formal designation of the group could come later \u2014 and it did, the very next year. But in the meantime, the State Department hoped it could use the threat of designation \u2014 and the pressure from Congress \u2014 to induce better behavior by the Nigerian military and a more serious approach to the threat by the Nigerian government. By contrast, officials feared that going immediately to a designation would forfeit that potential leverage and upset the Nigerian government.", "lang": "en"}
