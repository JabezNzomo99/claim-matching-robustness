(Rahul has found the women who give birth to 52 children every year. After he loses the election, he\u2019ll marry one of these women and make 52 children every year -translation)\u201c.\n\nIn the video, Rahul Gandhi can be heard saying, \u201cUP mein aisi mahilae hai ho har saptah ek bachcha paida kar sakti hai, aisi mahilae hai jo saal mein 52 bachhe de rahi hai (UP has such women who are giving birth to a child every week, there are such women who are giving birth to 52 children per year)\u201d\n\nThis video is viral on all platforms including Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp.\n\nRenuka Jain, who is followed by PM Modi on Twitter, and has shared misinformation many times in the past also posted the video.\n\nOneIndiareported that BJP Candidate from Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh, Nandkumar Singh Chouhan, also made a similar claim.\n\nIn one of the frames in the above video, Rahul Gandhi talks about the issue of corruption in Uttar Pradesh. Searching for the keywords \u2018rahul gandhi up corruption\u2019 on India TV\u2019s YouTube channel, we came across a 7 year old video of Rahul Gandhi\u2019s speech in Phoolpur, Uttar Pradesh on November 14, 2011.\n\nAt 5:25 in the video below, Rahul Gandhi talks about Janani Surakha Yojna under National Rural Health Mission, where pregnant women get an incentive of Rs 1400 for institutional delivery. In that context, he claims that according to a RTI response, there is corruption in this scheme and that women with the same name were getting the incentive every week.\n\nHis exact words were, \u201cHumne RTI manga, RTI mein jo hamein report mili, UP mein aisi mahilae hai, jo har saptah ek bacha paida kar sakti hai, aisi mahilae hai jo saal mein 52 bachha de rahi hai, ek hi naam hai, 1400 rupay har saptah uske jeb mein, aur ek hi ek mahila nahin hai, hazaro mahilae hai (We filed an RTI, according to the RTI response, UP has such women who are giving birth to a child every week, there are such women who are giving birth to 52 children per year, all have one name, 1400 rupees in their pocket every week, and there are thousands of such women. -translation)\u201d\n\nThe relevant portion of the video can be seen below.\n\nFrom his speech, the part where he says, \u201cUP mein aisi mahilae hai ho har saptah ek bachcha paida kar sakti hai, aisi mahilae hai jo saal mein 52 bachhe de rahi hai (UP has such women who are giving birth to a child every week, there are such women who are giving birth to 52 children per year)\u201c, was clipped and circulated thus leading to a false impression.\n\nThis claim was earlier debunked by Dainik Bhaskar. Even though the pattern of clipping videos and circulating them on social media sans context is very common, two senior BJP functionaries fell for the same video. Rahul Gandhi\u2019s \u2018Aloo-Sona Machine\u2019 video and more recently, Narendra Modi\u2019s \u2018I am son of Pathan\u2018 video are examples of this category of misinformation.", "lang": "en"}
