It often takes more than a week for counties around the country to count mail-in, absentee and provisional ballots. What\u2019s unusual is that these ballots could tilt the results one way or the other. And in Florida, a mandatory recount has already been triggered in the elections for U.S. Senate and for governor.\n\nNonetheless, the president and other Republicans have been muddying the national dialogue and spinning the facts:\n\u2022 Trump claimed Republicans \u201cwon\u201d the Florida elections for Senate and governor, and that Democrats are trying to go back and \u201csteal\u201d them by improper means. But the results on election night were preliminary, and election officials are still counting absentee and provisional ballots, and conducting a mandatory recount in the razor-close races.\n\u2022 Trump has repeatedly referred to election officials suspiciously \u201cfinding\u201d votes for Democrats. But there is no evidence that vote counts have been influenced by anything other than legally cast ballots. Rather, the changing vote totals have been due to officials laboriously counting mail-in and provisional ballot votes, some for Democrats and others for Republicans.\n\u2022 Trump tweeted that mismatched signatures on Arizona ballots spell \u201celectoral corruption.\u201d And Florida Gov. Rick Scott alleged that Sen. Bill Nelson \u201chas gone to court to say that fraudulent ballots \u2026 should be counted.\u201d Tens of thousands of votes were not counted due to mismatched signatures, but there\u2019s no evidence those votes were cast fraudulently. Election experts say signatures often change over time.\n\u2022 Scott claimed a lawyer for Nelson thinks \u201ca noncitizen should have the right to vote.\u201d But that is thinly based on the lawyer registering an objection to a vote being discarded because the voter was deemed to be \u201cnot a citizen.\u201d We don\u2019t know why the lawyer objected to the rejection, and the Nelson campaign\u2019s lead recount attorney later said the lawyer was \u201cnot authorized to make such an objection\u201d and that \u201cnoncitizens cannot vote in U.S. elections.\u201d\n\u2022 Trump suggested that Fusion GPS, the research firm that hired a former British intelligence officer to research Trump during the 2016 campaign, was involved in the Florida recount. It isn\u2019t.\n\nIn his claims, the president has alleged the Florida vote count has been \u201cmassively infected\u201d with \u201clarge numbers of new ballots\u201d showing up \u201cout of nowhere\u201d while other ballots are \u201cmissing or forged.\u201d And he has claimed election officials are suspiciously \u201cfinding votes in Florida and Georgia\u201d after the election. But there is no evidence of any of that.\n\nIn Florida, where Trump has focused much of his ire and Gov. Scott warned \u201cthere may be rampant fraud happening in Palm Beach and Broward Counties,\u201d election officials say there has been no evidence to date of any criminal tampering with election results.\n\nOn Nov. 12, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of State, which supervises elections, reiterated that it was overseeing the certification of election results and to date had seen \u201cno evidence of criminal activity.\u201d The department is headed by Secretary of State Ken Detzner, a Republican appointed by Scott. And despite Scott and State Attorney General Pam Bondi urging the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to look into potential voter fraud, FDLE says so far it hasn\u2019t seen anything to investigate.\n\n\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there haven\u2019t been some problematic election issues in Florida. For example, CNN reported that a North Florida county hit by Hurricane Michael allowed about 150 ballots to be submitted by fax and email, contrary to Florida Department of State guidelines. And it is possible that some incidents involving fraud may come to light, such as a person with a felony conviction voting even though their voting rights have not been restored, said Lorraine Minnite, a professor at Rutgers University and author of \u201cThe Myth of Voter Fraud. But Minnite said that she is not aware of evidence of any kind of voter fraud in Florida, Georgia or Arizona.\n\nDuring an emergency hearing on Nov. 12, Circuit Chief Judge Jack Tuter said he had seen no evidence of illegal activity in the vote-counting in Broward County, and he urged both sides to \u201cramp down the rhetoric.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything the lawyers are saying out there at the elections office is being beamed out across the country,\u201d Tuter said. \u201cWe should be careful what we say. These words mean things these days.\u201d\n\nTrump says that the races in Florida for Senate and governor were \u201cwon\u201d on election night by the Republican candidates, Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis, respectively, and now the Democrats are trying to go back and \u201cSTEAL two big elections.\u201d But the president simply got out in front of the final tallies, which won\u2019t ultimately be known until all of the absentee and provisional ballots are counted.\n\nAnd, because the races are so close, an automatic recount also has been triggered.\n\n\u201cRick Scott \u2026 won by a comfortable margin,\u201d Trump told reporters on Nov. 9. \u201cHe easily won, but every hour it seems to be going down.\u201d\n\nAsked on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Nov. 11 if the president had any evidence that Democrats are trying to \u201csteal\u201d the elections, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, said, \u201cWell the evidence is that Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis have won. In fact, Andrew Gillum conceded on the night of the election, now we\u2019re going backwards.\u201d (Gillum withdrew his concession a day earlier on Nov. 10.)\n\nBut election night results are always preliminary, and provisional and absentee ballots take more time to process. When elections aren\u2019t particularly close, the public doesn\u2019t notice that it usually takes more than a week to certify election results.\n\n\u201cThe count is final on election night \u2013 each state has a deadline for certifying the election, and counties (and in some states, towns) are crossing i\u2019s and dotting t\u2019s until then,\u201d Loyola Law School Professor Justin Levitt, an expert in election fraud, told us via email.\n\n\u201cMore generally, what is happening in these three states [Florida, Georgia and Arizona] is that various elections for Senator and Governor were really close, and so a lot of attention has focused on absentee ballots and particularly provisional ballots, and on checking the tallies of ballots from election night,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cBut that same process is going on in elections all across the country: election officials are assessing absentee and provisional ballots to see whether they were properly cast by eligible, properly registered voters each voting once, and double-checking the tallies of regular ballots cast at the polls.\u201d\n\nNever mind that some networks will project the winner of a close race, as some did for DeSantis on election night.\n\n\u201cWhen the networks \u2018call\u2019 the election on election night, what they\u2019re doing is assessing the likelihood of a final result based on exit polls and early tallies from polling places (and from absentee ballots that the jurisdiction may have already counted), and making statistical assessments of the likelihood that once all ballots are cast, the person who won could have actually lost,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cBut election results are instantaneous, and every single one of the network\u2019s announcements is a preliminary estimate. \u2026 [T]he results from election night for some of the races were really close \u2026 and so crossing each \u201ct\u201d and dotting each \u201cI\u201d may matter a lot in who wins. But the process that\u2019s going on in Florida and Georgia and Arizona is pretty much the same thing that\u2019s happening even for races where the result is more certain, all across the country.\u201d\n\nLorraine Minnite, at Rutgers University, said most people probably pay little attention to election administration, such as the \u201coften intricate rules that govern election procedures, including ballot counting.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, most elections are not tight nail-biters,\u201d Minnite told us via email. \u201cI can understand why the average citizen might be confused about why the elections in Georgia, Florida and Arizona have not yet been decided. But, no one should worry yet \u2013 close elections take longer to count, and all ballots must be accounted for.\u201d\n\nAt this point she said she has seen no evidence of election fraud.\n\nTrump has repeatedly referred to election officials suspiciously \u201cfinding\u201d votes for Democrats. But there is no evidence to date that vote counts have been influenced by anything other than legally cast ballots. Indeed, most of the changing vote totals have been due to officials tallying mail-in, provisional and absentee ballots not counted on Election Day.\n\nTrump told reporters on Nov. 9 that in Florida, \u201call of a sudden, they\u2019re finding votes out of nowhere.\u201d In Arizona, he said, \u201call of a sudden, out of the wilderness, they find a lot of votes.\u201d And, Trump said, \u201cDo you notice, the votes never go the other way [in Republicans favor]?\u201d\n\nIn the case of Arizona, it simply takes longer to count ballots because about 75 percent of Arizona voters cast ballots by mail. Although Republican Senate candidate Martha McSally appeared to be winning the race on election night, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema pulled ahead by about 2,000 votes after Maricopa County released the results of 120,000 outstanding ballots available two days after the election. By Nov. 12, Sinema\u2019s lead had grown to more than 32,000 votes, CNN reported. That night, the Associated Press projected Sinema as the winner of the race, and McSally called Sinema to concede the race.\n\nIn Florida, the vote differentials have changed as counties began to submit tallies from provisional and absentee ballots.\n\n\u201cThe election officials aren\u2019t finding votes \u2013 they\u2019re counting votes that were not cast as regular ballots on election day,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cThe ballots were already there: they\u2019re revealing for whom those ballots were cast. That\u2019s a whole lot different from \u2018finding\u2019 new votes.\u201d\n\nIn fact, it is possible that not all ballots have even arrived. The state accepts ballots from military and overseas voters until Nov. 16, provided they are postmarked Nov. 6.\n\nThe president is also wrong to say election officials have not been \u201cfinding\u201d Republican votes as well.\n\n\u201cThere are many tens of thousands of ballots being evaluated, some of which reveal votes for Republicans, some of which reveal votes for Democrats, some of which reveal votes for both (for different offices), some of which reveal votes for neither,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cThe reports in the press generally only give the differential margin, and in this case the Democratic candidates have been narrowing the margin as more votes are counted. But that does not mean that only votes for Democrats have been counted. In reality, there have been many votes for Republicans counted since the election as well.\u201d\n\nIn Florida, a teacher at Miramar Elementary School in Broward County said she came across a box labelled \u201cProvisional Ballot Box.\u201d Republican Sen. Marco Rubio retweeted a report of what he called the \u201cleft behind\u201d box and criticized Broward County officials for \u201capparently\u201d misplacing ballots. \u201cJust let that sink in for a moment,\u201d Rubio tweeted. But county election officials say the boxes at the school contained no ballots \u2014 just election supplies.\n\nElection experts say mismatched signatures on mail-in and provisional ballots, compared with voter registration documents, are actually fairly common, and aren\u2019t necessarily evidence of fraud. Rather, handwriting can change over time, so a legal voter could be deemed to have a mismatched signature from when he or she registered to vote years before.\n\nBut in a tweet, Trump said reports that \u201cSIGNATURES DON\u2019T MATCH\u201d on some ballots in Arizona meant there had been \u201celectoral corruption\u201d and may be grounds to consider a new election.\n\nAnd on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d on Nov. 11, Scott alleged his Democratic opponent has \u201cgone to court to say that fraudulent ballots, fraudulent ballots that were not properly delivered, sign, whatever should have \u2014 should be counted, OK? Senator Nelson is clearly trying to find \u2014 to try and commit fraud to try to win this election. That\u2019s all this is.\u201d\n\nStates have different procedures to check if the signatures on absentee and provisional ballots match the signatures the voters gave when registering to vote, and what to do about it if they don\u2019t.\n\nA lawsuit filed by the Nelson campaign against the Florida secretary of state argues that tens of thousands of Floridians who voted via provisional ballot are at risk of disenfranchisement due to a \u201cstandardless signature matching process.\u201d The suit seeks to prevent the state from rejecting ballots with mismatched signatures. It is scheduled to be heard this week.\n\nAccording to the suit, the state\u2019s \u201centirely standardless, inconsistent, and unreliable signature matching process\u201d has \u201ca disparate impact on People of Color and young, first time voters, violates the prohibition against undue burdens on the right to vote \u2026 and subjects Florida voters to disparate treatment and inconsistent standards in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2016 survey by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, 1 percent of absentee ballots nationally were rejected in the 2016 election, and \u201cnon-matching signature\u201d was the top reason (27.5 percent). See Table 1.\n\n\u201cIt is not unusual to find signatures that don\u2019t match,\u201d Minnite said. \u201cHandwriting can change over time, and a voter who has been registered at the same address for many years who votes irregularly may find him or herself in a situation where the elections office asks for an updated signature.\u201d\n\nStates have different procedures to check signatures on ballots. Some states have automated systems that do initial screens of signatures, followed by a human review of rejected ballots due to mismatches. In some states, Minnite said, if a signature on a mail ballot doesn\u2019t match, the voter may be contacted to come into the election office to provide an updated signature.\n\nIn Arizona, only a handful of counties allowed voters to verify their signatures after the election, and a legal battle between Democrats and Republicans resulted in a settlement that will allow all Arizona counties to verify ballot signatures until 5 p.m. on Nov. 14.\n\nIn Florida, it\u2019s misleading for Scott to call ballots with mismatched signatures \u201cfraudulent ballots.\u201d Indeed, former Florida Rep. Patrick Murphy tweeted on Nov. 9 that he discovered his absentee ballot wasn\u2019t counted in Palm Beach County \u201cdue to \u2018invalid signature\u2019 match.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s signatures change over time, and in different situations,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cYour signature on a supermarket checkout machine is probably not the same signature as on the deed to a house.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note, Levitt said, that \u201cthe signatures on provisional and absentee ballots are all evaluated anyone knows who the ballot is cast for: the signature is on the outside of an envelope, and the ballot is on the inside, and you can\u2019t tell who the votes were cast for looking at the outside of the envelope. So the decisions on counting or not counting provisional or absentee ballots are made independent of the identity of the voter\u2019s preferred candidates.\u201d\n\nNelson Attorney Didn\u2019t Say Noncitizens \u2018Have the Right to Vote\u2019\n\nOn \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Scott claimed, \u201cSen. Nelson\u2019s lawyer said that a noncitizen should have the right to vote.\u201d But that\u2019s not clear from the evidence.\n\nIn a brief exchange during a canvassing board meeting, a lawyer representing Nelson objected after a provisional ballot was disqualified because the voter was deemed to be \u201cnot a citizen.\u201d\n\nThe Nelson campaign\u2019s lead recount attorney later said the lawyer was \u201cnot authorized to make such an objection\u201d and that \u201cnoncitizens cannot vote in U.S. elections.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s claim came during an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d on Nov. 11. Host Chris Wallace asked him, \u201cYou\u2019re accusing Bill Nelson of trying to commit fraud?\u201d\n\nScott responded, \u201cHis lawyer said that a noncitizen should vote.\u201d\n\nFox News, Daily Caller and The Blaze all obtained a transcript of a Palm Beach County Canvassing Board proceeding on Nov. 9 when officials were reviewing provisional ballots. According to the transcript, provided by a court reporter hired by the Palm Beach County GOP, when one provisional ballot was discarded, Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher explained, \u201cNot a U.S. citizen; not counted.\u201d The transcript states that lawyer Jack Scarola responded, \u201cObjection Nelson.\u201d\n\nNo explanation was provided for the objection, and the ballot was quickly disallowed after a 2-1 vote in which Bucher and Judge August Bonavita voted not to count it. We could not reach Scarola to determine why he objected, or if he was attempting to argue the person was misidentified as a noncitizen. It is a leap from that brief exchange to claim the attorney \u201csaid that a noncitizen should have the right to vote.\u201d\n\nAs the stories note, Marc Elias, recount attorney for the Nelson campaign, later issued a statement saying, \u201cThe lawyer who was present was not someone we had authorized to make such an objection. Noncitizens cannot vote in U.S. elections.\u201d\n\nThe president suggested that Fusion GPS, a research firm that hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to investigate Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, had something to do with the vote counting in Florida. It doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe tenuous connection is that the attorney for Nelson\u2019s campaign in Florida, Elias, also represented the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2016, when he hired Fusion GPS to research Trump.\n\nTrump made the claim during remarks to reporters before he departed for Europe on Nov. 9.\n\nDuring his remarks, a reporter asked if Trump had any evidence of fraud. The president responded: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, you tell me. It\u2019s always the Democrats. It\u2019s always GPS Fusion. It\u2019s always crooked stuff.\u201d\n\nFusion GPS was founded by former Wall Street Journal reporters Glenn R. Simpson and Peter Fritsch. In 2016, the law firm Perkins Coie, and specifically Elias, represented Clinton\u2019s campaign and the DNC and hired Fusion GPS, which subsequently hired Steele. (Previously, the conservative Washington Free Beacon had hired Fusion GPS to investigate Trump and other Republican primary candidates.)\n\nSteele\u2019s research made up the dossier, a series of memos on supposed contacts between Russian officials and members of the Trump campaign. It alleged the Kremlin has compromising information on Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Nelson would want to hire Elias during the recount. Elias\u2019 bio says \u201che is a preeminent counselor in the areas of federal and state campaign finance law \u2026 as well as recounts and election contests. He is also a nationally recognized authority and spearheads litigation efforts in the areas of voting rights and redistricting.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
