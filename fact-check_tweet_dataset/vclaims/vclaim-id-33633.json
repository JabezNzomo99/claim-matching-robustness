Among the actor's many fans wishing him Dubai's Emaar Properties organised a light display on its iconic Burj Khalifa skyscraper.\n\n'Happy birthday to the king of Bollywood Shah Rukh Khan' was illuminated on the Burj Khalifa followed by a fountain show.\n\nThe actor even tweeted a video of the same.\n\nBut as the video went viral several posts spreading misinformation cropped up.\n\nThe posts in Hindi translate to, \"in two crores he got his name written on the Burj Khalifa but when it came to paying, Shah Rukh Khan did not receive any calls.\"\n\nBOOM used a keyword search on NDTV India's official website and found that the news organization had published several articles on Khan's birthday.\n\nThe original article, the headline of which had been morphed, was published on November 3, 2019.\n\nThe original headline is: \"Burj Khalifa was being painted in Shah Rukh Khan's shade, a huge crowd witnessed the event... watch viral video\"\n\nBOOM also reached out to Emaar Group, the real estate developer responsible for organising the light show.\n\n\"The display of birthday greeting on Burj Khalifa for Shah Rukh Khan was not a paid event\"- Chandni Jayakumar Chugh, Emaar told BOOM.\n\nBOOM has also compared the viral screenshot with the original article. We found several discrepancies in the font and spacing.\n\nIn the above two photos, one can see the difference in the Hindi alphabets such as '\u0916' and '\u092c'. We looked for several NDTV India articles and found that the organization does not use 'Purna Viraam' (|) in their headlines.\n\nALSO READ: No, SRK Did Not Say \u2018I Would Leave India If Modi Becomes PM\u2019\n\nALSO READ: No, Shah Rukh Khan Did Not Threaten To Leave India If Pak Artists Are Boycotted", "lang": "en"}
