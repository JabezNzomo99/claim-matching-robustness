What is your opinion?\u2019 He started with the national security adviser, the secretary of state, and he ended with me,\u201d Biden said. \u201cEvery single person in that room hedged their bet except [CIA Director] Leon Panetta. Leon said, \u2018Go.\u2019 Everyone else said, 49, 51. He got to me. He said, \u2018Joe, what do you think?\u2019 And I said, \u2018You know, I didn\u2019t know we had so many economists around the table.\u2019 I said, \u2018We owe the man a direct answer. Mr. President, my suggestion is, don\u2019t go. We have to do two more things to see if he\u2019s there.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cBiden remained skeptical,\u201d wrote former secretary of state Hillary Clinton in her memoir \u201cHard Choices.\u201d \u201cI respected Bob and Joe\u2019s concerns about the risks of a raid, but I came to the conclusion that the intelligence was convincing and the risks were outweighed by the benefits of success.\u201d (Bergen, in his book, said Clinton gave a lawyerly presentation in which her final conclusion was not evident till the end: \u201cIt\u2019s a very close call, but I would say: Do the raid.\u201d)\n\nPanetta, in his book \u201cWorthy Fights,\u201d also says Biden wanted to take more time: \u201cBiden argued that we still did not have enough confidence that bin Laden was in the compound, and he came out firmly in favor of waiting for more information.\u2019\u201d And Gates, in his book \u201cDuty,\u201d agreed that he and Biden were the \u201ctwo primary skeptics, although everyone was asking tough questions. Biden\u2019s primary concern was the political consequences of failure.\u201d\n\nMark Bowden reports in his 2012 book, \u201cThe Finish: The Killing of Osama Bin Laden\u201d: \u201cThe only major dissenters were Biden and Gates and, by the next morning, Gates had changed his mind.\u201d Former deputy CIA director Mike Morell confirmed that in his memoir, \u201cThe Great War of Our Time,\u201d saying Obama polled the principals in the final meeting: \u201cThe vice president and Bob Gates voted no; everyone else voted yes,\u201d but then Gates called the next morning and switched to yes.\n\n\u201cI walk out of that meeting, as I usually do,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI get to be the last guy to be with the president. We walked up toward the residence, toward his office. And I knew he was going to go. And what I always tell him, when he said \u2014 looked at me again, I said, \u2018Follow your instincts, Mr. President. Your instincts have been close to unerring. Follow your instincts.\u2019 I wanted him to take one more day to do one more test to see if he was there.\u201d\n\nAs Biden explained in an interview a week later with CBS: \u201cEverything I said was completely accurate. I just never until last Tuesday night told the whole story.\u201d He claimed that he did not say \u201cdon\u2019t go\u201d but instead had said, \u201cTry one more thing.\u201d He argued that since Obama had not made a final decision, he did not want to be on record in front of other administration officials as urging the mission. \u201cWe walked up to the Oval. I said: \u2018Mister President, follow your instincts. I know you should do it, but follow your instincts.\u2019\u201d\n\nAntony Blinken, a former deputy secretary of state who in 2011 was Biden\u2019s top foreign policy adviser, told The Fact Checker that he had learned of the private conversation between Obama and Biden shortly after it happened. Biden had argued in the Situation Room meeting for taking more time to get positive identification of bin Laden, but in the private conversation with Obama, Biden said, \u201cFollow your instincts, they are always good,\u201d according to Blinken\u2019s recollection. (Blinken is a campaign adviser to Biden.)\n\nSo it appears that there was a second conversation between Obama and Biden, after the Situation Room meeting, in which he urged the president to follow his instincts. Whether Biden delivered a firm \u201cgo\u201d message \u2014 or Obama heard one \u2014 remains unconfirmed. Obama has not commented, but perhaps he will address this question in his upcoming memoir. (Update, Nov. 28: Obama\u2019s memoir describes the Situation Room debate as others have, saying he appreciated Biden\u2019s willingness to offer a contrary viewpoint, but he makes no mention of this supposed conversation with Biden afterwards.)", "lang": "en"}
