This is false; Hitler\u2019s National Socialists did not eliminate police, and a historian said the link between murderous Nazism and today\u2019s largely-peaceful demonstrators is misplaced.\n\n\u201cIn 1933 Hitler appointed Hermann Goring Minister of the Interior. His first orders were to defund and eliminate the police departments so that they would not interfere with his Brown Shirts,\u201d says the post shared 19,000 times on Facebook. It has also been shared in slightly different form, here and here, as well as on Twitter including here, and Instagram here.\n\nThe post claims the Brown Shirts\u2019 mission was to \u201criot, burn, beat up and kill citizens in an effort to sway the elections to ensure their National Socialst agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow today\u2019s American socialist leaders want to defund and eliminate the police?\u201d it says, asking if history is repeating itself.\n\nThe post contains several falsehoods.\n\nAs the Nazis began establishing their dictatorship in early 1933, Goering was the interior minister of Prussia, the largest state. He was not head of the paramilitary Brown Shirts, which were also known as Sturmabteilung (SA) or Storm Troopers, and were led by Ernst Roehm.\n\nThe SA became so powerful that their ambitions threatened the Nazi regime itself. Goering and top Nazis then conspired against Roehm, executing him and other SA leaders on the Night of the Long Knives that began on June 30, 1934, according to the Holocaust Encyclopedia from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.\n\nIt is true, as the post says, that the Brown Shirts used violence to sway elections, \u201cbut BEFORE the Nazis took over\u201d and dominated the government, said Itai Sneh, associate professor of history with John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York.\n\nThe Nazis also \u201ccoaxed and exploited\u201d the police rather than choosing to \u201celiminate\u201d them, Sneh told AFP by email.\n\nMany police had initially been skeptical of the Nazi party and its intentions, but the Nazis took measures that appealed to them, the Holocaust Encyclopedia added.\n\n\u201cThe Nazis centralized and fully funded the police to better combat criminal gangs and promote state security,\u201d it said.\n\nThe Facebook post implies an equivalency between the Nazi agenda and that of American protesters, who President Donald Trump has called \"terrorists\" and \"socialists\", as part of efforts to bait his Democratic rivals.\n\nThat comparison is made more explicit in comments such as those attached to posts here and here.\n\n\u201cARE WE REALLY GOING TO ALLOW THIS NAZI-MINDED BUNCH OF THUGS & THE DEMONRATIC PARTY TO DESTROY OUR COUNTRY\u201d one Facebook user asked, alluding to statues and monuments torn down or defaced, and other violence associated with some protests.\n\nThe May 25, 2020 death of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for almost nine minutes, has prompted one month of mostly peaceful protests across the US against racism and police abuse.\n\nAfter numerous police killings of African Americans, Floyd\u2019s death led to increasingly broad support for the Black Lives Matter movement as part of a national reckoning over the country\u2019s history of racism and slavery.\n\nSome left-leaning activists want to \u201cdefund the police,\u201d which refers to moving funds away from police towards other areas such as social services.\n\nSneh called it \u201claughable\u201d to suggest, as the post does, that Nazism is comparable to American \u201csocialism,\u201d and added that likening today\u2019s protesters to Nazis is misplaced for two reasons.\n\n\u201cThe Nazis' agenda was racist and murderous whereas the BLM agenda is to secure justice through politics and legal process; the Nazis were mainly violent, while most protesters are peaceful,\u201d said Sneh, who has written on genocide.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked numerous cases of misinformation linked to Floyd\u2019s death.", "lang": "en"}
