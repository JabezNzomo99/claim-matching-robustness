The plague refers to diseases caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis.\n\nThe tweet, which was screen grabbed and posted on Facebook, masquerades as a breaking news alert from a news outlet, saying, \u201cBREAKING: World Health Organization officially declares the Coronavirus as a plague.\u201d An estimated 340,000 people in China have been infected and 75,000 have died, it claims.\n\nAt first glance, the news alert appears authentic, as it mimics the breaking news format used by some outlets on Twitter. But a closer inspection of its claims reveal that it is not credible.\n\nThe Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any media reports about the WHO designating the new coronavirus, which has killed some 170 people, as a plague. No press releases making such an announcement appear on the organization\u2019s website. The WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency Jan. 30.

It comes in two main forms, bubonic and pneumonic, with the most endemic countries being the Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar and Peru.\n\nThere have been 7,736 confirmed cases and 12,167 suspected cases of coronavirus in China to date, according to the WHO\u2019s Jan. 30 situation report. The novel virus, which gained international attention in December, has since spread to 18 other countries, including the U.S.", "lang": "en"}
