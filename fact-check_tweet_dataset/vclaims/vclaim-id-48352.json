But, FACTLY has found the image to be photoshopped. In the original image, both the leaders are seen sitting on separate chairs. The image was taken when Maumoon Abdul Gayoom had met Sonia Gandhi during the former\u2019s visit to India in 2015. When the same image went viral last year, FACTLY has debunked it and has written a fact-check article. Now, the image has been revived in the wake of \u2018Republic TV\u2018 Editor Arnab Goswami\u2019s comments on Sonia Gandhi in the context of Palghar lynching incident.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
