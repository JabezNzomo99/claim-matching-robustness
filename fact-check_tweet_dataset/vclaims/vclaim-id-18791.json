Issues related to implementation and compliance, as well as any measures for violations, are equally applied to all nations and the athletes representing these nations.\n\nThe \u201cLausanne Declaration on Doping in Sport\u201d, adopted on February 4, 1999 in Switzerland, later provided the basis for The World Anti-Doping Code, as well as the creation of the independent international anti-doping authority \u2013 the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).\n\nThe first code was approved in Copenhagen, Denmark in January 2003 at the World Conference on Doping in Sport.\n\nCurrent signatories to the code include the world Olympic movement, national anti-doping agencies, as well as organizations and nations outside of the Olympic Movement. Russia\u2019s state anti-doping agency (RUSADA), Russia\u2019s National Olympic Committee, and Russia\u2019s Paralympic Committee are also signatories.\n\nThe Russian foreign minister did not give any details supporting his \u201cpower battles\u201d claim, but two doping-related processes could have laid the groundwork for the conspiracy theory.\n\nFirst, the Russian government has been involved in a prolonged doping scandal, which WADA said was \u201cstate-sponsored doping.\u201d\n\nMoscow has employed the tools of a hybrid war to fight against Wada\u2019s accusations, from waging a global disinformation campaign to hacking WADA\u2019s Web servers.The WADA hack was carried out by the same hacker unit of the GU (Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces) that was indicted in the U.S. for hacking the Democratic Party\u2019s servers.\n\nNext, the code is currently under review, with the new draft to be discussed and implemented at the World Conference on Doping in Sport in November 2019 in Katowice, Poland.\n\nThat code review, however, is part of a standard process. When the first code was adopted in 2003, WADA said it is \u201ccommitted to ensuring that the code would be a living document, subject to periodic review.\u201d\n\nIn February 2006 and November 2011, WADA\u2019s Foundation Board initiated review processes with amendments incorporated within the 2009 and 2015 codes, respectively.\n\nThe review process is transparent, the three-phase action plan is publicly available, and multiple draft versions of the proposed amendments have been circulated for discussions.\n\nThe WADA Foundation Board also published the names of the seven experts chosen for the code drafting team. The members of that team, an international group of professionals, are:\n\u2022 Ben Sandford, New Zealand, Attorney and Member of WADA Athlete Committee Olympic Committee Athlete Commission;\n\nPolygraph.info therefore finds Lavrov\u2019s claim of an \u201cAnglo-Saxon\u201d anti-doping conspiracy to be false.", "lang": "en"}
