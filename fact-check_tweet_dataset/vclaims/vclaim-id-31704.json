This means that the legislature, consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives, is the only authorized branch of government that can make, amend, and repeal laws.\n\nThe Supreme Court can also repeal an existing law by declaring it unconstitutional. But the High Court already junked petitions to declare RA 10533 unconstitutional in November 2018, saying that it is \u201can exercise of the State's police power.\u201d (READ: Supreme Court declares K-12 constitutional)\n\nThe Department of Education also issued a statement dispelling the claims on Monday, May 20. \u201cSentiments and questions on social media pertaining to the supposed plan to scrap the K to 12 Basic Education Program are clearly based on misinformation and lack of critical discernment,\u201d DepEd said.\n\nOut of the 9 Facebook accounts that shared this information, only one of them indicated the basis of its post in the comment section. Rappler reached out to the others but none of them responded.\n\n\u201cWe have said time and again that the K to 12 program will not answer the country's declining quality of education. In fact, Chairman De Vera's revelations proved that this program only yielded more problems,\u201d Elago said in a statement.\n\nDepEd backed this up, saying: \"The claims circulating online came after news of the CHED's plan to \u2018review and change\u2019 the system for its K to 12 Transition Program was misconstrued to mean the implementation of the entire K to 12 Program. These two are not one and the same.\" \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
