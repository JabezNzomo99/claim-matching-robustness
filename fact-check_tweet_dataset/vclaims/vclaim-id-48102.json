The claim is false; the image has been doctored from a photo of a building in the South Korean city of Paju to include Arabic writing.\n\nThe doctored photo was published in this Facebook post on September 30, 2019. It has been shared more than 1,800 times.\n\nThe words on the building, translated from Arabic to English, comes from the first line of the Shahada, one of the Five Pillars of Islam: \u201cThere is no god but God. Muhammad is the messenger of God.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe same image was shared on Facebook here, here, here and here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false. A reverse image search on Google found the original photo of a building in South Korea published here on the website for London-based design studio DaeWha Kang Design.\n\nA lengthy description on the web page states in part: \u201cThe Rainbow Building is a mixed-use building in Paju Book City, South Korea. The simple block of stone and glass creates a bold visual statement with its simple lines and rich texture, standing out from the eclectic surrounding buildings. As the home of a publishing house intent on telling the stories of the unsung people of twentieth century Korea, the building\u2019s key feature is the hundred-year stair, a glazed stairwell wrapping around a bookcase with one shelf for every year of the last century.\n\n\u201cThe new Rainbow Publishing Headquarters has a gallery on the ground floor, office spaces on the middle levels, and a residence on the top floor.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the manipulated photo in the misleading posts (L) and the original image on the DaeWha Kang Design website (R):\n\nThe Rainbow Publishing Headquarters is located here in Paju Book City, a publishing complex in the city of Paju.\n\nThe architect DaeWha Kang replied to an email from AFP on October 8, 2019, saying that the image in the misleading posts was \u201ca photoshop of our photo of the real building.\u201d\n\nThe owner of the building, Lee Hwan-Gu, who is also the secretary general of the Book City Culture Foundation in Paju, told AFP by email on October 10, 2019, that the photo manipulation was \u201cdeeply disconcerting\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
