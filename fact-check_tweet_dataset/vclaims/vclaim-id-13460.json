Si Leni pala ang distributor ng mga tsinelas sa mga Rebeldeng NPA... (It turns out Leni is the distributor of rubber slippers for the NPA rebels...).\"\n\nThe claims by the netizen and politicsfavradio.fm are fabricated.\n\nThe photo of the slippers was actually taken by Inquirer photographer Nino Jesus Orbeta on March 14, 2016 during the birthday celebration of Quezon City Vice Mayor Joy Belmonte, who distributed the free slippers bearing Robredo's - and her - name that day to residents of Bahay Toro district, QC as part of the celebration.\n\nThe netizen's fake post was published two days after Robredo's camp urged the Supreme Court, sitting as Presidential Electional Tribunal, to junk former senator Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr.'s opposition to the use of decrypted ballot images in the ongoing vote recount between them. The recount comes as a result of Marcos' filing in June 2016 of an electoral protest contesting Robredo's win over him in the May 9 national polls that year.\n\nThe fake post has been shared by over 4,500 people.", "lang": "en"}
