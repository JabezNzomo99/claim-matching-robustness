She doesn\u2019t. I want to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. She wants $12 an hour. I voted against the war in Iraq. She voted for the war in Iraq. I believe we should ban fracking. She does not. I believe we should have tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change. That is not her position. Those are some of the issues that I am campaigning on.\"\n\nSanders is right about Clinton\u2019s Iraq war vote and where she stands on breaking up banks, a $15 minimum wage and fracking. (For more of their policy differences, read this.) But is he also right about their differences on carbon tax and climate change?\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Sanders\u2019 rhetoric on climate change and his plan to deal with it are aggressive and, unlike Clinton, he has advocated for a carbon tax. Clinton does, however, have a climate change plan. While some environmentalists have said it isn\u2019t tough enough, others have given it positive reviews.\n\nBoth the Sanders and Clinton campaigns referred us to each candidate\u2019s climate change plan.\n\nSanders\u2019 plan is long and comprehensive. Beyond a tax on carbon, it includes an array of proposals from banning certain drilling and mining practices to improving the national public transit system.\n\nClinton\u2019s plan is shorter and, though it doesn\u2019t include a tax on carbon, contains similar provisions on renewables. Here\u2019s an overview:\n\nAs in her plan, Clinton prefers to focus on renewables on the stump. In a January Medium post responding to the Sanders camp, Clinton\u2019s campaign manager highlighted her pledge to \"make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century\" in her launch speech. Clinton, who played a role in negotiating the Paris climate change agreement, herself touted her goals for more solar panel and clean electricity as \"big\" and \"bold.\"\n\nClinton has gotten her best reviews from the League of Conservation Voters, who endorsed Clinton last fall (to some controversy). The green group considers Clinton\u2019s plan strong and aggressive and, more importantly, achievable, Tiernan Sittenfeld, its senior vice president of government affairs, told PolitiFact.\n\n\"Hillary is focused on practical solutions,\" Sittenfeld said, pointing out that there are many lawmakers in Congress who still deny climate change science. \"So (a carbon tax) is pretty remote possibility.\"\n\nBut some are skeptical of Clinton\u2019s \"boldness.\" Pulitzer Prize-winning website InsideClimate News called Clinton\u2019s plan ambitious but said it \"falls short of bold.\" The Washington Post\u2019s editorial board said her ideas are \"second best.\" Environmental news magazine Grist summed up her positions as not bad but \"not quite the climate hawkishness we need.\"\n\nSanders said, \"I believe we should have tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change. That is not her position.\"\n\nUnlike Sanders, Clinton doesn\u2019t advocate for a carbon tax. And while Clinton doesn\u2019t go as far as Sanders in her climate change plan, she does have one. The League of Conservation Voters supports her plan as realistic and achievable.", "lang": "en"}
