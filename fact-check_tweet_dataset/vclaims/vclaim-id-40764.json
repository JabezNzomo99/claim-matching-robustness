No, that's not true and he's not dead either. Some prankster spread the rumor by using a website that allows anyone to upload any headline for pranking purposes. No reliable news source is talking about it so it is not true.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on React365 on October 23, 2018 titled \"Metal Legend, Rob Halford Found Unresponsive in San Diego Home.\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so they may have thought it was real news:\n\nRob Halford, best known for being the lead vocalist of the heavy metal band Judas Priest was found unresponsive in his San Diego home at 2:44 PM. He was taken to the nearest hospital and is receiving treatment. Investigators found Opiates not too far from where Halford was laying. The band asks that you respect his privacy at the time.\n\nBut no reliable news outlets are reporting on the story and the official Judas Priest band twitter is also silent on the issue.\n\nThe site that published the story is a prank website where users can submit their own headline, description and photo to create realistic looking prank news articles.\n\nUsers don't even need to upload their own image, there is a built-in search function that will pull an appropriate image from Google image search.\n\nThe site is part of a larger network of prank sites all using the same basic layout but sometimes in different languages. It appears to be run by a Belgian company named Mediavibes or Media Vibes which is managed by a man named Nicolas Gouriou according to registration records.\n\nEach site in the network comes with a disclaimer (sometimes translated into a different language) that reads:\n\nSo don't fall for this prank now that we've warned you about it!\n\nWe wrote about react365.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Did NOT Cut Off His D*ck To Show Faithfulness To Estranged Girlfriend\n\u2022 Fake News: Williamsburg, Kentucky NOT Voted Methamphetamine Capitol Of The State\n\u2022 Fake News: Two Great White Sharks NOT Found Swimming In Laurel Lake Near London, Kentucky\n\u2022 Fake News: Louisville, Kentucky NOT Having Emergency Outbreak Of Deadly Virus", "lang": "en"}
