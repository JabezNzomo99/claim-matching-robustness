It was originally presented as a reproduction of a newspaper editorial harshly critical of those who had voted for Obama in 2008, one supposedly published in \u201cthe Prague newspaper, Prager Zeitungon.\u201d That mention appeared to be a misspelled reference to Prager Zeitung (\u201cPrague Newspaper\u201d), a German-language weekly newspaper from the Czech Republic which is also circulated in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Later versions of this same item attributed that editorial to V\u00e1clav Klaus, a Czech politician who served as the first prime minister of an independent Czech Republic from 1993 to 1998 and then as the second President of the Czech Republic from 2003 to 2013.\n\nThe attributions of both publication and author were unverifiable, however. The initial version of this item (which was circulated at least as far back as April 2009) provided no contextual information such as a publication date or headline that would facilitate verification of its publication in Prager Zeitung. A search of that newspaper\u2019s website at that time pulled up only one article that mentioned Barack Obama, and that article included only an incidental reference about the level of security provided to a U.S. president. No evidence documented that this editorial had been published in either the print or online version of the Prager Zeitung.\n\nMoreover, not only did no evidence exist showing that V\u00e1clav Klaus penned this editorial, it was exceedingly unlikely that he have written anything like it. V\u00e1clav Klaus and Barack Obama appeared to have a reasonably good working relationship while both were in office, and Klaus had not been otherwise been recorded as writing or saying anything (in public or private) nearly so harshly critical of President Obama as the editorial attributed to him here.\n\nMarcus Hundt, the editor-in-chief of Prager Zeitung, confirmed that the newspaper \u201chas never published such an article \u2026 about Joe Biden nor about Barack Obama\u201d and that it \u201cprimarily reports on events in the Czech Republic and Europe and not on domestic affairs in other counties\u201d.\n\nThis piece has been repurposed to reference a number of other national leaders and politicians from around the globe, including South African president Jacob Zuma, Australian prime minister Julia Gillard, New Zealand prime minister John Key, Northern Mariana Islands governor Benigno Fitial, and Nigerian Delta State governor James Ibori.", "lang": "en"}
