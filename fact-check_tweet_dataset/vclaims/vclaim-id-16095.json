So whoever is installed in the White House, we\u2019re going to have to work with them.\u201d\n\nThere are three claims here. One about the USA\u2019s importance as a trading partner, one about the size of its economy, and one about its importance as a military and diplomatic ally.\n\nThe USA is the UK\u2019s second largest trading partner\n\nIt\u2019s correct that the US is the UK\u2019s second largest trading partner after the EU, if you combine together the value of imports and exports.\n\nAmerica is also the UK\u2019s second largest export market. It accounted for 19% of the value of UK exports in 2016/17, second only to the EU as a whole, which bought 44% of UK exports.\n\nIt's also the second largest import market in 2016/17. 11% of the value of our imports came from the US, compared to 53% from the rest of the EU.\n\nThe USA is the first or second largest economy in the world...\n\n...depending on how you measure it.\n\nIf you measure GDP in terms of the dollar value of the economy, the US is the largest economy in the world.\n\nIf you measure GDP in terms of what those dollars can buy you in that country - what\u2019s called purchasing power parity (PPP) - then the US is the second largest, after China.\n\nThe US and the UK have a so-called \u2018special relationship\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s often said that the UK and the USA have a \u2018special relationship\u2019 when it comes to foreign affairs, and statements from both governments often re-assert this. Chatham House, a think tank, has said that although the meaning and implications of the \u2018special relationship\u2019 are often debated in the UK, they are unquestioned in mainstream US politics.\n\nThe relationship between UK security and our relations with the US is a complex issue, and not something we can write about conclusively.", "lang": "en"}
