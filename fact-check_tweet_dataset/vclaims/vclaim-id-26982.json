Yogi Adityanath's chopper never entered Bengal on Tuesday. This viral video is a year-old when Yogi visited Tripura for election campaigning.\n\nThe three-minute-long video shows a chopper landing at a temporary helipad in some remote village. Yogi gets down from the chopper and joins his cavalcade before being welcomed by a few Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) supporters. This post was shared by more than 1,500 users and viewed by more than 1,00,000 people till the time of writing this article.\n\nMost of the people believed this viral post and cheered up Yogi's defiance against the political arch-rival Mamata Bannerjee on Facebook.\n\nSeveral media reports said that since West Bengal government refused to give permission to land Yogi Adityanath's chopper anywhere in the state, he took the land route from Bokaro to reach the public rally venue in Purulia.\n\nSuspicious of this viral claim we watched each and every frame of the video, carefully. We found that Yogi Adityanath's car has a number plate beginning with \"TR\", which is not a registration number for West Bengal but of Tripura.\n\nWe also found \"Tripura\" written on the pilot car and the fire brigade van present in Yogi's cavalcade.\n\nFrom several newspaper articles we found that Yogi Adityanath visited Tripura in February last year during the assembly poll. As per an article by \"The Financial Express\", Yogi Adityanath, during his two-day election tour to Tripura, visited places like Dharamnagar, Kanchanpur and Jubrajnagar.\n\nWe searched YouTube videos with keywords \"Yogi Adityanath Dharamnagar copter\" and found a same video uploaded as \"Yogi Adityanath in Kanchanpur\". It was uploaded on February 12, 2018.", "lang": "en"}
