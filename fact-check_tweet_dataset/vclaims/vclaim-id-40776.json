And it wasn\u2019t the consistent message of those that were leaving that we would leave the customs union.\u201d\n\nKey figures from both the Remain and Leave campaigns said before the referendum that voting to leave meant leaving the single market. The customs union itself was rarely mentioned before the referendum, as far as we\u2019ve seen.\n\nThere are some cases where Leave campaigners appeared to suggest the UK could stay in the single market after a vote to leave, although these examples aren\u2019t all necessarily as straightforward as they look. In any case, they are rare exceptions, rather than the rule.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see how the debate around this issue would have been confusing to many people, however. For one thing, there were multiple campaigns that did not necessarily have consistent positions.\n\nAlso, the terminology used arguably invites misunderstanding. Campaigners often distinguished between maintaining \u201caccess to\u201d the single market and being \u201cfull members\u201d\u2014a distinction with an unclear meaning that would be easy to miss, or misconstrue.\n\nThe customs union and single market are different things\n\nThe EU\u2019s customs union is a free trade area in which countries can\u2019t put tariffs on imports from each other, and set the same tariffs and rules for countries outside the union. The single market is more wide-ranging: member countries sign up to the free movement of goods, services, people and money across their borders. All EU members are part of both, some countries outside the EU are members of one or the other.\n\nSome countries are in a customs union with the EU but not the single market, like Turkey. Other countries are in the single market but not the customs union, like Norway.\n\nThe customs union was rarely mentioned by Leave campaigners\n\nMr Starmer\u2019s office pointed us to a list on Vote Leave\u2019s website of what the campaign considered \u201ckey speeches, interviews and op-eds\u201d and pointed out the customs union was hardly mentioned in any of them.\n\nThis is correct. Several of the speeches made arguments against the single market, but one of the only references to a customs union was by businessman John Longworth, who said in a speech:\n\nLabour\u2019s argument that the messaging on the customs union was inconsistent also rests on a speech by prominent Leave campaigner Michael Gove, in which he said:\n\n\u201cThere is a free trade zone stretching from Iceland to Turkey that all European nations have access to, regardless of whether they are in or out of the euro or EU. After we vote to leave we will remain in this zone. \u201cThe suggestion that Bosnia, Serbia, Albania and the Ukraine would stay part of this free trade area - and Britain would be on the outside with just Belarus - is as credible as Jean-Claude Juncker joining UKIP. \u201cAgreeing to maintain this continental free trade zone is the simple course and emphatically in everyone\u2019s interests.\u201d\n\nTurkey is in a partial customs union with the EU, but none of the other countries mentioned by Mr Gove are. He appears to be referring to a number of European countries which have some level of trading arrangements with the EU, without being customs union members, as examples of a possible post-Brexit situation for the UK.\n\nAs far as we\u2019ve seen, Leave campaigners hardly mentioned the customs union in explicit terms at all, so there was generally little clarity about what leaving might mean in that regard.\n\nCampaigners did often say the UK should be able to set its own trade policy, and this could imply leaving the customs union as well. Being part of a customs union can restrict a country\u2019s ability to form an independent trade policy. At the same time, though, certain sectors of an economy can be left out of a customs agreement, so it\u2019s not a straightforward in or out issue.\n\nReferences to the single market and the UK\u2019s broad trading relationship with the EU after Brexit are much more common.\n\nKey figures in both campaigns often said Brexit meant leaving the single market\n\nA fortnight before the referendum in 2016, then Prime Minister David Cameron (who was campaigning for Remain) said during an interview:\n\nKey Leave figures made similar points. Michael Gove was asked by the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr \u201cDo you want us to say inside the single market?\u201d to which he responded:\n\nFellow Leave campaigner Boris Johnson later said he agreed with Mr Gove\u2019s comments that the UK would be out of the single market following a Brexit vote. It is unclear what was meant by having \u201caccess\u201d to the single market.\n\nThe government\u2019s leaflet supporting Remain during the referendum said leaving meant there was a risk the UK could lose \u201cfull access\u201d to the single market, but didn\u2019t rule it out. It highlighted that, in terms of striking a trade deal if we left the EU, \u201cno other country has managed to secure significant access to the Single Market\u201d without significant trade-offs, including having to \u201cfollow EU rules over which they have no real say, pay into the EU, (and) accept EU citizens living and working in their country.\n\nBut given the sheer volume of debate around the EU referendum, it\u2019s unsurprising that there were times when claims about our possible future relationship to the single market became unclear.\n\nSome people have pointed out cases where other Leave campaigners appeared to suggest the UK should stay in the single market.\n\nFor example, Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan said during an interview in 2015 that: \"To repeat, absolutely nobody is talking about threatening our place in the single market\".\n\nThat is a different stance compared to the main claims of Leave campaigners, and Mr Hannan\u2019s wording isn\u2019t consistent across the interview itself either. Earlier on, he said \"absolutely nobody is suggesting we would give up our position in the free market in Europe\".\n\nAgain, because of this loose use of terminology, it\u2019s easy to see why people would have taken different messages away after seeing this interview. On one reading, this is another case of talking about having a continued trading relationship with the EU after Brexit, as distinct from being a member of the single market.\n\nThere are also examples of leave campaigners claiming the UK could adopt a position similar to Norway\u2014which is still part of the single market while not being an EU member.\n\nArron Banks, a founder of the Leave.EU campaign tweeted in November 2015 \u201cIncreasingly the Norway option looks the best for the UK\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that these examples are the exception rather than the rule when it comes to claims about the single market, but it makes the case again that the discussion before the referendum wasn\u2019t entirely consistent on the kind of relationship the UK could have with the EU after leaving.", "lang": "en"}
