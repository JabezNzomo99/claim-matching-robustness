The first of the Scorpene class of submarines, INS Kalvari was inducted with much fanfare after extensive sea trials by the navy were a success. The Defence Minister through her official twitter handle a day before on December 13 celebrated the induction as a success of Prime Minister Modi\u2019s \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative.\n\nPrime Minister Modi in his speech hailed the induction of Kalvari as an \u2018excellent example of Make in India\u2019. He said,\n\n\u201cInduction of INS Kalvari in the Indian Navy is a big step taken by us in the direction of national security. This is the best example of \u2018Make in India'\u201d\n\nOn his twitter handle, PM Modi reiterated that the commissioning of the submarine was illustrative of the success of \u2018Make in India\u2019\n\nHow true is this claim made by the official handle of the Defence Minister that INS Kalvari is a product of PM Modi\u2019s \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative? Alt News conducted a quick fact check on the claim and here is what we found:\n\u2022 The construction of INS Kalvari, designated as MDL Yard 11875 had commenced in December 2006\n\u2022 The five separate sections of the submarine were welded together, called \u2018Boot Together\u2019, on 30 July 2014\n\u2022 In October 2015, the submarine was \u2018launched\u2019 and christened as INS Kalvari\n\u2022 Sea trial of the submarine started on May 1, 2016\n\u2022 On September 21 2017, INS Kalvari was delivered to the Indian Navy by Mazgaon Docks Ltd.\n\nFurther details about the submarine can be read in this press release by the Press Information Bureau dated December 13, 2017.\n\nINS Kalvari is a Scorpene-class submarine which is the first of six diesel-electric attack submarines that India is constructing under the programme which is known as Project 75. The submarines have been designed by the French naval defence and energy company DCNS and are being constructed by Mazgaon Docks Ltd. in Mumbai under a technology transfer agreement. The Scorpene deal was finalised by India and France in2005.\n\nThe Scorpene deal was signed between the two countries with an agreement for transfer of technology, which made it possible for an Indian shipbuilding company to commence production. The technology transfer agreement came as a shot in the arm for the indigenous defence industry and a huge fillip for defence manufacturing. In April 2013, France\u2019s ambassador to India Francois Richier had said, \u201cThe first submarine would be ready by 2014, heralding an important and strategic tie-up between both the nations on the defence front. It is a full transfer of technology, something we don\u2019t do with everybody. Defence component of India-French relations is very important to us\u201d.\n\nThe \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in September 2014 with the objective of making India a global hub of manufacturing. While it is a commendable initiative and a continuation of the National Manufacturing Policy of 2011, the construction of the Kalvari-class submarines was initiated in 2006 following the agreement between India and France in 2005. It is correct that the submarine is being constructed in India by Mazgaon Docks Ltd., a Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) of the Govt of India. However, the programme does not technically fall under the \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative which is the brainchild of the NDA government, as claimed by the Defence Minister.", "lang": "en"}
