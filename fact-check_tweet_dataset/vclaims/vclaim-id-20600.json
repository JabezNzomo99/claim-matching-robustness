It has now achieved the unprecedented role of a quadruple superpower: industrial superpower, agricultural superpower, military superpower and geopolitical superpower. Russia now has the world\u2019s most self-sufficient and diversified economy\u2026 .\u201d\n\nAleksei Pankin, a political commentator with Rossiya Segodnya (Russia Today), the state-owned international media conglomerate, embraced the study in a RIA Novosti article.\n\nRussia, he claimed, had overcome its dependence on oil. \u201cOf crucial importance is that Russia got off the oil needle. The share of hydrocarbons and other raw materials in the GDP fell from 22% in 2000 to 10% in 2015. Their contribution to the fulfillment of the budget does not exceed 17%. ... [I]ndustrial production has not suffered, increasing by 5.3% in May of this year,\u201d he wrote.\n\nWhile the Russian economy fared better in 2017 than in preceding two years, it has suffered significantly overall during the last three years.\n\nThe sanctions and low oil prices have actually impeded Russia\u2019s emergence as an \u201cindustrial superpower,\u201d let alone a \u201cquadruple superpower.\u201d Russia has focused on the non-oil sectors because of sanctions, but it has not become the country with \u201cthe most diversified economy.\u201d It also remains heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, the sanctions and the decline in oil prices \u201cdrove Russia\u2019s economy into a deep recession.\u201d In November 2014, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said that the sanctions cost the country's economy $40 billion (2% of GDP), while lower oil prices cost it $90-100 billion (4% to 5% of GDP).\n\nRussian economists suggested the sanctions would decrease the GDP by 2.4% by 2017, and Putin admitted in 2016 that the sanctions were \u201cseverely harming Russia.\u201d And the lack of economic diversification has been a major culprit here.\n\nSome estimates suggest the oil and gas industry accounts for up to 70% of Russia\u2019s GDP and up to 50% of the Russian government\u2019s budget revenue.\n\nAlexei Kudrin, a former finance minister, stated in 2016 that Russia is \u201ctoo dependent on oil,\u201d highlighting the need for economic diversification.\n\nWhile non-energy exports have been growing under sanctions, Russia\u2019s overall exports remain largely undiversified. Moreover, the weak ruble, not major innovations, has helped boost non-oil exports.\n\nAnd while increased military expenditures have boosted industrial production, most other areas of production have stagnated. Furthermore, calculated on a monthly basis, industrial production rose by only 1.2% in 2017, recovering from a 2.3% decline in April and falsely making the May growth rate of 5.3% look like manna from heaven.\n\nThe claim that Russia is an \u201cindustrial superpower\u201d is clearly false when one considers global GDP rankings, Deloitte\u2019s 2016 Global Manufacturing Competitive Index, and manufacturing value added (MVA) indicators.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Russia\u2019s economy accounts for only 1.8% of the global GDP. In 2016, Russia slid in manufacturing competitiveness to 32nd place, from 20th in 2010. And Russia\u2019s MVA in 2014 was lower compared to many other countries, indicating that it could not have overtaken others to become \u201can industrial superpower\u201d while in a recession.\u200b\n\nIn 2017, Russia\u2019s economy has indeed started performing better, as it has emerged from the recession. However, the number of people in poverty remains high, after increasing by 3.1 million in 2015, and the projected GDP growth rate of 1.3-1.4% for 2017-2019 appears insignificant.\n\nMoreover, the impact of sanctions, sluggish economic diversification, and corruption will continue to \u201csubdue\u201d growth prospects.", "lang": "en"}
