Coal-producing states, particularly West Virginia, responded with strong support.\n\nSo when Trump came to Wheeling, W.Va., for a rally on Sept. 29, it was no surprise that he touted the nation\u2019s record in harnessing its energy resources.\n\n\"The United States is now the No. 1 energy producer in the world,\" Trump said at the rally. \"That happened just recently.\"\n\nAccording to the Energy Information Administration, the federal office that collects energy statistics, 2017 data -- the most recent available -- shows that the United States ranks first in production of petroleum and other liquid fuels. The United States has a sizable lead over both Saudi Arabia and Russia.\n\nIt\u2019s been a tighter contest for a subset of petroleum production -- crude oil production -- but the United States has a case for the top spot as well.\n\nEIA projections released in September 2018 show that the United States likely edged past Saudi Arabia and Russia in crude oil production sometime this summer.\n\nThe United States also ranks first in natural gas production, according to EIA data for 2015, the most recent year available. Russia is the only close competitor in this category.\n\nThis is the one category where the United States is not the leader.\n\nAccording to 2016 data from the Energy Information Administration, the United States ranked third, behind China -- the world\u2019s clear leader -- and India.\n\nBeyond the question of who\u2019s No. 1, Trump also said that this achievement \"happened just recently.\"\n\nWith the exception of the recent shift in crude oil, that\u2019s not the case.\n\nAs we noted in a 2015 fact-check, the United States has been the world\u2019s largest oil producer since 2012, and the largest natural gas producer for years.\n\nTrump said, \"The United States is now the No. 1 energy producer in the world. That happened just recently.\"\n\nThe United States does rank first internationally in petroleum, crude oil, and natural gas production, though it ranks third in the world in coal production. Meanwhile, only for crude oil was the No. 1 spot achieved recently. For petroleum and natural gas, the United States has ranked first for years.", "lang": "en"}
