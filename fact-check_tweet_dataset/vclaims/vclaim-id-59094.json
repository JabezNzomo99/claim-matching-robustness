Coronavirus antibodies have been in the vaccines since H1N1.\u2019 This would account for all of \u2018tested positive (with no symptoms) results.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe reached out to medical experts about the post.\n\nDavidson Hamer, a global health and medicine professor at Boston University as well as a faculty member of the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory, called it \"nonsense.\"\n\n\"Coronaviruses have a completely different antigenic (surface protein and glycoprotein structure) from influenza viruses,\" he told PolitiFact in an email. \"They both cause similar syndromes but they are distinct classes of viruses and there is no evidence that I am aware of that would lead to cross reactions between immune responses to the two vaccines.\"\n\nPlus, he added, there\u2019s \"definitely no trace of coronaviruses in influenza vaccines.\"\n\nRichard Watanabe, a preventive medicine professor at the University of Southern California, told us that since there\u2019s no evidence the novel coronavirus existed in humans before last year, \"there is no way antibodies existed before then and therefore could not have been identified and isolated.\"\n\n\"But more importantly,\" he said, \"this post seems to imply that vaccines work by directly giving you antibodies against whatever bug. That\u2019s not how vaccines work. Vaccines give you an inactive form of the bug to allow your immune system to create antibodies.\" (You can read more about how vaccines do work here.)\n\nSeveral other fact-checkers have also investigated whether a flu shot can result in false positives for COVID-19, and all came to the same conclusion: no.\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital in Philadelphia, told FactCheck.org that there\u2019s no cross reaction between influenza and the new coronavirus, meaning flu traces wouldn\u2019t cause someone to test positive for COVID-19.\n\nA spokesperson for the Food and Drug Administration also told FactCheck.org that all FDA-approved COVID-19 tests are checked for cross-reactivity with influenza virus and influenza antibodies and so far, no cross-reactivity has occurred.\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
