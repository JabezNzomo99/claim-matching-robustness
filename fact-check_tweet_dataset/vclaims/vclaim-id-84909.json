My personal view is, is that we need to maximize the audience, and that\u2019s going to be either a Tuesday, Wednesday or a Thursday night. \u2026What we\u2019re saying is: Having a debate on a Sunday night or a Monday night is not the ideal time. And we should revisit it.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d July 31, 2016\n\nDonald Trump and his allies have suggested that there is something wrong about the dates that have been chosen for the presidential debates by the nonpartisan Commission of Presidential Debates \u2014 perhaps a deliberate effort to suppress viewership by scheduling two of the debates at the same time as National Football League games on Sunday and Monday. Here\u2019s a tweet by former House speaker Newt Gingrich:\n\nFor the record, neither political party had a role in setting the debate schedule. The dates were announced Sept. 23, 2015, four months before the first primary contests. The NFL schedule for 2016-2017 was not in place then, either.\n\nMoreover, it is not unusual for a presidential debate to be held on a Sunday or Monday, in conflict with NFL games, or on a Friday. Only one debate round \u2014 in 2000 \u2014 took place only on mid-week days. No presidential debates since 1992 have been held on a Saturday night.\n\nHere are the dates for the debates since 1992, along with audience ratings. In all but one case \u2014 1996 \u2014 a debate held on a Sunday, Monday or Friday received somewhat lower viewership than debates held in the middle of the week, based on data from Nielsen Media Research.", "lang": "en"}
