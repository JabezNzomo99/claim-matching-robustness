It also omits the fact that Russia recognized South Ossetia as an independent county after invading Georgia in August 2008.\n\n \n\n The joint peacekeeping operation in South Ossetia was \u201cabsolutely unsuccessful,\u201d Batu Kutelia, vice president of the Atlantic Council of Georgia and former Georgian Ambassador to the United States, said in a written statement to Polygraph.info. \u201cThe primary reason for this [failure] was an incorrectly designed mandate \u2013 a party of the conflict (Russia) was designated to be a mediator.\u201d\n\n \n\n Due Moscow\u2019s dual role, Kutelia said, that the peacekeeping operation turned into a \u201ctool of political manipulation by Russia.\u201d\n\n \n\n The Joint Peacekeeping Force (JPKF) created by the June 24, 1992 agreement, known as the Sochi agreement, defined a zone of conflict and a security corridor along the border of the South Ossetian region. The agreement also created the Joint Control Commission (JCC) and Joint Peacekeeping Force (JPKF).\n\n \n\n The tripartite JPKF was under Russian command and comprised of 1,320 troops from the Russian Federation (500), Georgia (320), and the Russian region of North Ossetia (500). Since the separatist South Ossetian authorities were not recognized by the mediators as a side in the conflict at the time, South Ossetian peacekeeper units served in the North Ossetian contingent.\n\n \n\n The Russian Defense Ministry\u2019s assertion that the operation in South Ossetia stands as \u201cone of the most successful peacekeeping operations in the world,\u201d is false, experts told Polygraph.\n\n \n\n \u201cThe success of any peacekeeping operation is determined by how well it is able to ensure the environment necessary for the peaceful and political resolution of a conflict,\u201d Georgian Brigadier General Amiran Salukvadze said in an email to Polygraph.info. \u201cThis peacekeeping was not a failure until Russia became a side in the conflict. It stopped being a peacekeeping operation in 1993, when they [the Russians] fostered suitable conditions for the Ossetian authorities to declare so-called independence.\u201d\n\n \n\n The JPKF failed in accomplishing its primary goal, which was to contribute to a peaceful resolution of the Georgian-Ossetian conflict by monitoring for any ceasefire violations and facilitating diplomatic negotiations.\n\n \n\n The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which at various times until 2008 had up to eight monitors stationed in the conflict zone, co-chaired the Geneva international discussions between the Georgians and South Ossetians. Russia also took part in these talks.\n\n \n\n In an email response to Polygraph.info, Ina Parvanova, head of the OSCE\u2019s Communication and Media Relations Section, said that \u201cno two conflicts are the same,\u201d which makes it \u201cdifficult to compare peacekeeping operations one to another.\u201d\n\n \n\n Parvanova said that the overall purpose of a peacekeeping operation is keeping the peace. While there were regular exchanges of fire within the conflict zone, \u201cthe peacekeeping operation [in South Ossetia] was successful for many years in avoiding a major outbreak of hostilities,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAt the end of the day, notwithstanding its presence, another conflict broke out in 2008, which led to the end of the peacekeeping operation.\u201d\n\n \n\n The OSCE monitoring mission in Georgia ended in June 2009, after Russia vetoed a plan for keeping a 56-nation OSCE monitoring mission in South Ossetia.\n\n \n\n According to Salukvadze, there were ongoing hostilities in the enclave. \u201cFor years, even before the August 2008 invasion, Russia trained and armed the Ossetian army,\" he said. \"Sometimes for months the Georgian population [in the Tskhinvali region] was fired upon. At a minimum, Russia could have ensured [the] ceasefire. They had all the necessary tools and a mandate for that.\u201d\n\n \n\n While Russia considers the South Ossetian conflict was resolved after it invaded Georgia in August 2008, and it unilaterally recognized South Ossetia's (and Abkhazia\u2019s) independence later that month, the international community \u2013 with the exception of Russia itself, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Nauru - still considers South Ossetia and Abkhazia as parts of Georgia. This means the conflict remain unresolved.\n\n \n\n The Russian Defense Ministry claimed in its statement that the South Ossetian peacekeeping operation model \u201cwas subsequently used in settling other conflicts.\u201d Russia was \u2013 and, in some case, still is \u2013 involved in peacekeeping operations in South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Moldova\u2019s Transnistria, Tajikistan, Angola, Chad, Sierra Leone, the Middle East, Western Sahara, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, Sudan, South Sudan, and Syria.\n\n \n\n It is unclear which of these conflicts the ministry regards as having been \u201csettled.\u201d In addition to peacekeeping functions in these countries and territories, the Russian military is directly involved in fighting in Syria, has annexed Crimea and is continuing to support secessionist regions in eastern Ukraine. The Russian Federation is also one of the mediators in Azerbaijan\u2019s 25-year-long Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.\n\n \n\n \u201cSince invading Georgia in 2008, Russia is trying to legitimatize its illegal actions and occupation of Georgian sovereign territory by creating propaganda narratives,\u201d Kutelia told Polygraph.info. \u201cOne can only speculate, but the abuse of the word \u2018peace\u2019 brings back memories of Soviet propaganda, when in the name of \u2018peace\u2019 the Soviet Union conducted extremely brutal actions against civilian populations in other independent countries or its own territory.\u201d\n\n \n\n Brigadier General Salukvadze believes the Russian Defense Ministry\u2019s claim has no credibility and only serves to justify Russia\u2019s actions. \u201cToday Russia is using NATO aspirations against us [Georgia],\u201d he said. \u201cBut from 1994-2009, Georgia was a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States. And where did it get us? Any conflict can be \u2019successfully\u2019 resolved with a conventional army intervening on behalf of one side.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
