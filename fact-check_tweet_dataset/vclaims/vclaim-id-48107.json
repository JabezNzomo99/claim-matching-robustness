Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., speaks during the Democratic presidential primary debate hosted by CNN/New York Times at Otterbein University on Oct. 15, 2019, in Westerville, Ohio. (AP)\n\n\"Back when I was studying it, two out of three families that ended up in bankruptcy after a serious medical problem had health insurance.\"\n\nIn a back-and-forth about Medicare For All and the cost of health care, Warren directed the discussion back to medical debt and bankruptcy \u2014 citing her own work from Harvard Law School. Her wording is precise, but the paper itself is controversial. We rated this statement Mostly True.\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign directed us to research published in 2009 in the American Journal of Medicine. Co-authored by Warren, it looks at a random sample of 2,314 bankruptcy filers from 2007.\n\nThe paper examined what debtors reported as their cause of bankruptcy. Warren is referring here to people who either cited significant direct medical debt, remortgaging a home to pay medical debt, or lost income due to illness.\n\nIn that category, more than two-thirds of families had health insurance \u2014 in fact, three-quarters did. So from that simple standpoint, the number checks out.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t necessarily that simple. This specific paper has long been the subject of controversy. In part, it\u2019s because it focuses on people who have declared bankruptcy, rather than looking at the financial impact of medical debt at large.\n\nWhat\u2019s more suspect is whether this finding \u2014 even if accurate \u2014 supports her next point: that the cost of health care is what\u2019s driving people\u2019s financial problems, and that a generous single-payer plan would ameliorate this issue.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden speaks during the Democratic presidential primary debate at Otterbein University on Oct. 15, 2019, in Westerville, Ohio. (AP)\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s claim about cost of Medicare for All\n\n\"For people making between $50,000 and $75,000 a year, their taxes are going up about $5,000 because the fact is, they will pay more in new taxes\" for Medicare for All.\n\nThis is Mostly False.\n\nBiden used an unusual level of specificity in describing how Medicare for all would affect families making between $50,000 and $75,000 per year. His numbers don\u2019t come out of thin air, but they are based on too many assumptions to be reliable.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign told us the figure was derived from approximating the impact of a 4% income tax, plus a 7.5% payroll tax \u2014 financing mechanisms they said have been proposed under Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All plan.\n\nWhen you do the math, that suggests a family making $60,000 would indeed see the tax increase Biden surmised. But this math is problematic on many levels.\n\nFor one thing, Sanders\u2019 bill doesn\u2019t actually propose financing Medicare for All through a combined 4% income tax and 7.5% payroll tax. The bill doesn\u2019t include any financing mechanism at all.\n\nAnother problem is that highlighting the potential tax burden of Medicare for All without discussing overall costs is misleading.\n\n\"Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs, not gained them.\"\n\nFalse. Official government figures show that each state gained jobs between July 2019 and August 2019, the latest month-over-month period available. To arrive at his job-loss figure, Castro cherry-picked a time period that he didn\u2019t mention in his remarks \u2014 a time period that ignores the existence of the most current data.\n\nHis assertion that employment levels have been crumbling in these states is belied by data showing that each state has seen job gains both in the past year and since Trump took office.\n\nTulsi Gabbard claims the New York Times, CNN called her a Russian asset\n\n\"Just two days ago The New York Times put out an article saying I\u2019m a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning a CNN commentator said on national television that I am an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.\"\n\nThe accuracy of Gabbard\u2019s claim is mixed.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the New York Times, which co-hosted the debate with CNN. Gabbard appeared to be referring to an Oct. 12 article that carried the headline, \"What, Exactly, Is Tulsi Gabbard Up To?\"\n\nPolitical reporter Lisa Lerer\u2019s article characterized Gabbard as injecting chaos in the 2020 race, citing the Hawaii congresswoman\u2019s threat to boycott the debate over her claim that Democrats and corporate media are trying to \"rig\" the election.\n\nThe article does not explicitly call Gabbard a Russian asset. Rather, it explores why she has garnered support from alt-right and white nationalist activists, and notes that some Democrats \"worry about supportive signs from online bot activity and the Russian news media.\"\n\nGabbard is right that a CNN commentator called her a Russian asset. Bakari Sellers, a former state legislator in South Carolina, leveled the charge during an Oct. 15 panel discussion.\n\n\"There is a chance that Tulsi is not just working for the United States of America,\" Sellers said, later adding, \"There is no question that Tulsi Gabbard \u2014 among all the 12 \u2014 is a puppet for the Russian government.\"\n\n\"We are in a state that has had two Planned Parenthoods close.\"\n\nBooker is right. Two Planned Parenthood clinics, which provide reproductive planning services such as abortion, announced they were closing in Cincinnati, Ohio, in early September. Their last day of service was Sept. 20, and neither provided abortions.\n\nThe move came less than a month after Planned Parenthood said it would stop participating in a federal program that supports family planning services. The organization received about $60 million annually through Title X, a federal grant program.\n\nPlanned Parenthood pulled out of the program after the Trump administration issued a rule that forbids clinics with Title X funding from referring women to abortion providers. The Washington Post reported that, where the withdrawal didn\u2019t force the closure of health centers, it did result in higher fees and waiting times for some.\n\nThere are still 24 Planned Parenthood health centers around Ohio. Five are operated by Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio, where the two locations recently closed.\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang speaks during the Oct. 15, 2019, Democratic presidential primary debate in Westerville, Ohio. (AP)\n\n\"A wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principle. The problem is it's been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden and all those countries ended up repealing it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they projected.\"\n\nYang was responding to Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s proposal to directly tax the wealth of American billionaires. His claim is accurate, but it\u2019s unclear whether the same problems would extend to the United States.\n\nWarren\u2019s Ultra-Millionaire Tax, the first of its kind, would tax fortunes of more than $50 million at 2% annually. She has touted the proposal as a way to pay for universal childcare and universal college tuition programs, but we have found reasons to doubt her math.\n\nYang\u2019s claim about the failure of wealth taxes in Europe is similar to one we fact-checked in April. We rated that claim Mostly True.\n\nData from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international body based in Paris, show that 12 or 13 countries collected revenues from net wealth taxes in 1996. (The tally differs slightly based on how you measure it.)\n\nNine European countries have ended their wealth taxes since then. (Today, six or seven European nations have some form of wealth tax.) And the reason why has to do with how difficult it is to levy them.\n\nA 2015 review of the wealth tax option by the European Commission found that determining the value of people\u2019s assets was difficult and that cheating was easier. A 2018 report from the OECD said revenues collected from wealth taxes were generally low and that there were several \"efficiency and administrative concerns.\"\n\nHowever, we\u2019ve spoken to experts who say the same thing wouldn\u2019t necessarily happen in the United States. There\u2019s a difference in the overall tax regimes, and OECD analysts said that arguments for and against wealth taxes depend on how other tax laws would work with Warren\u2019s proposal.\n\nBusinessman Tom Steyer answers a question during the Democratic presidential primary debate Oct. 15, 2019, in Westerville, Ohio. (AP)\n\n\"People haven\u2019t had a raise \u2014 90% of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years.\"\n\nA study by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, found that between 1979 and 2015, the top 1% of earners did see the fastest gains, but the three other income ranges \u2013 the lowest 20%, the middle 60%, the 81st percentile to the 99th percentile \u2013 did see gains. (These figures were adjusted for inflation and federal taxes, but not for state and local taxes.)\n\nIn April, Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, told us that the data since 2015 would likely show additional increases, since incomes across all the income distribution have improved since 2015.\n\nWe did find a different statistic that makes Steyer\u2019s claim closer to the mark, though still not accurate. The share of national income taken by the bottom 90 percent has indeed declined since 1973.\n\nThe dueling statistics show that people can see their share of the pie decrease yet still receive a raise in absolute terms.\n\nSouth Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg speaks during the Democratic presidential primary debate hosted by CNN/New York Times at on Oct. 15, 2019, in Westerville, Ohio. (AP)\n\nAmericans \"say that what they want is a choice\" to join a single-payer system like Medicare rather than ending private insurance.\n\nButtigieg sparred with Elizabeth Warren over how to expand health insurance coverage for all Americans.\n\nButtigieg said he favors allowing Americans younger than 65 to enroll in Medicare if they wish. Warren, by contrast, prefers to transition all Americans from their current insurance plan to government coverage.\n\nAnd Buttigieg said Americans support his approach more than they support Warren\u2019s.\n\nPolls from 2019 bear out his argument.\n\nNotably, a poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in January 2019 found 56% support for a Warren-style plan, with 42% opposed. By contrast, the Buttigieg approach won support from 74% of respondents, compared to opposition from just 24%.\n\nIndeed, Kaiser\u2019s polling shows a steady rise in support for the Buttigieg approach and a steady decline for Warren\u2019s approach over the course of the year.\n\nGabbard claims Hillary Clinton said abortion should be \u2018safe, legal, and rare\u2019\n\n\"I agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing, disagree with her on many others. But when she said abortion should be \u2018safe, legal and rare,\u2019 I think she\u2019s correct.\"\n\nClinton did say that, but it needs context. It\u2019s worth noting that the line appears to have been publicly used first by her husband, President Bill Clinton, in 1996, and adopted by Hilary Clinton when she was First Lady. Also, Clinton appears to have dropped the \"rare\" part of the line in 2016.\n\n\"Despite our differences, there are certain core beliefs and values that tie us together and set us apart as Americans,\" she said during remarks in January 1999 before the abortion rights group NARAL. \"And it is those beliefs that can guide us in reaching our goal of keeping abortion safe, legal and rare into the next century.\"\n\nDuring Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, she took a question from a voter who asked how she would bridge the divide on abortion. Clinton replied that her longstanding position is that \"abortion should be safe, legal and rare \u2014 and by \u2018rare,\u2019 I mean rare.\"\n\nShe dropped the word \"rare\" from her policy pronouncements when she ran for president again in 2016 during an interview: \"You know, I've been on record for many years about where I stand on abortion, how it should be safe and legal, and I have the same position that I've had for a very long time.\"\n\n\"I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having to do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have. We've always kept everything separate.\"\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s claim slightly contradicts what Hunter Biden said during a new interview with ABC News, when he confirmed reporting from the New Yorker that the two had shared one brief exchange about his work for Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nHunter Biden told the New Yorker that his father briefly mentioned his work with Burisma only once. Here\u2019s how the younger Biden characterized the conversation to the New Yorker: \"Dad said, \u2018I hope you know what you are doing,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I do.\u2019\"\n\nStill, it\u2019s not clear that the two ever spoke at length about the matter. When ABC\u2019s Amy Robach asked Hunter Biden if he and his father had ever discussed Ukraine, the younger Biden said their one chat didn\u2019t amount to a full-fledged discussion.\n\n\"As I said, the only time was after a news account, and it wasn\u2019t a discussion in any way,\" he said. \"There\u2019s no but to this. No. We never did.\"\n\nRobach then asked specifically about his quote in the New Yorker story, and Biden confirmed that the quote was accurate: \"I said, \u2018I do,\u2019 and that was literally the end of our discussion.\"\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misreported the number of Planned Parenthood centers still in Ohio. The correct number is 24, Planned Parenthood told us.", "lang": "en"}
