The frame can be viewed around 25 seconds into the video.\n\nAt the time, L\u00f3pez Obrador was criticized for continuing to hold large rallies and meet with crowds, where he shook hands, exchanged hugs and kissed cheeks as the coronavirus started to ramp up in Mexico.\n\nSocial media users shared a photo that they claim shows Joe Biden kissing and biting a young girl\u2019s cheek.\n\nThe photo is authentic, but it shows Mexico\u2019s president, not Biden.", "lang": "en"}
