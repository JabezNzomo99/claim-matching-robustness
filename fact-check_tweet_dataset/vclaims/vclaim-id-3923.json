Saudi Arabia is giving something like 1%, Japan is giving 1%, Russia is giving 0.3%, France is giving 0.2%. It is a very patchy situation.\u201d\n\nWorld leaders are meeting in London today to discuss financial aid for Syria. The aim is to agree \u201csignificant new funding\u201d towards the $7.7 billion the UN says is needed in 2016 to deal with the crisis in the region.\n\nAs the Minister says, about half of the $7.2 billion asked for last year was funded.\n\nThat money is for two UN humanitarian aid plans\u2014one for Syria, and another for neighbouring countries which are struggling with large numbers of Syrian refugees.\n\nMs Husain\u2019s figures are pretty much correct for the fund that sends money directly to Syria. Looking at funding for both the UN\u2019s plans together the percentages are a bit different, with commitments from the USA and UK adding up to 38% of the total rather than just under half of it.\n\nThe UN is asking for $7.7 billion for two plans to deal with the Syrian humanitarian crisis\n\nThis year it has asked for $3.18 billion to pay for its \u2018Humanitarian Response Plan\u2019, which aims to deliver humanitarian aid \u201cto save lives, alleviate suffering and maintain and protect human dignity\u201d in Syria.\n\nAnd it\u2019s asked for another $4.55 billion for the \u2018Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan\u2019, which gives aid to Syrian refugees and other affected groups in neighbouring countries; Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Turkey, and Egypt.\n\nLast year funding was about half of what the UN had asked for\n\nIn 2015 governments, international organisations and private donors committed $4 billion of the $7.2 billion the UN asked for, or 56% of it.\n\nA quarter of that money came from the United States. The UK put in 12.8%, and Germany put in 12%.\n\nMishal Husain\u2019s figures are broadly correct for the funding commitments to the Humanitarian Response Plan, rather than both plans together. Saudi Arabia committed around 1% of the money to that plan, Japan committed 2%, Russia 0.4% and France 0.1%.", "lang": "en"}
