The claim is false; the pictures date back to October 2013 when hundreds drowned in a boat tragedy in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe photos have been circulating on Facebook and Twitter in various countries, including Australia, Pakistan and South Africa.\n\n\u201cStill think corona is a joke????\u201d reads the caption on one Facebook post, shared more than 190 times since it was published on March 23.\n\nThe accompanying photos show rows of coffins lined up in a warehouse-style building, as bystanders look on.\n\nThe photographs have been widely shared alongside pleas to \u201cprotect your families\u201d or \u201cstay home\u201d to curb the virus, which has killed more than 20,000 people and forced one third of the world\u2019s population into lockdown.\n\nAFP ran a reverse image search and traced the three photographs circulating on social media to news reports from October 2013, when more than 360 people died after their boat capsized near the Italian island of Lampedusa.\n\nThe mostly Eritrean victims were among approximately 500 African migrants travelling on a boat heading for the shores of Europe.\n\nSince 2014, more than 20,000 people have died while making the perilous Mediterranean crossing, according to the UN\u2019s International Organization for Migration.\n\nThe first of the three photographs in the montage was taken by Italian photographer Roberto Salomone on October 9, 2013. According to AFP archives, the picture shows Italy\u2019s then-prime minister Enrico Letta and Lampedusa\u2019s mayor Giusy Nicolini standing by coffins of victims of the disaster.\n\nThe second image was captured by AFP photographer Alberto Pizzoli. He said he was shocked to learn his picture was being shared in a \u201cfake\u201d context.\n\n\u201cThis image was taken in Lampedusa on October 5, 2013. I was there and I remember that place, which is an airport hangar,\u201d he told AFP Fact Check.\n\nAFP traced the third photo to the archives of news agency Reuters. It was taken by photographer Antonio Parrinello on October 5, 2013, also in a hangar of Lampedusa airport.\n\nSome of the misleading posts also include captions claiming that Italy is \u201crunning out of coffins\u201d and struggling to cope with demand for cremations.\n\n\u201cCremation takes about an hour meaning only 24 bodies a day not, just a drop in the ocean (sic),\u201d the caption reads.\n\nMore than 8,100 people have died from COVID-19 in Italy, making it the country with the most reported deaths from the disease.\n\nA journalist from AFP\u2019s Rome bureau said claims that Italy could only cremate 24 bodies per day were \u201cfanciful\u201d, as the country has a large number of cremation facilities.\n\nThe Altair Spa group, which runs 17 cremation facilities in north-central Italy, covering the worst-hit areas, said on Facebook on March 24 that the situation was \u201cdifficult\u201d but \u201cstill manageable with professionalism and seriousness\u201d.\n\nAFP reported that the flood of victims has forced the city of Bergamo in Italy\u2019s northern epicentre of the pandemic to send bodies to less burdened crematoriums in neighbouring towns.\n\nItalian newspaper La Reppublica published a photograph of army trucks transporting coffins out of Bergamo\u2019s cemetery last week.\n\n\"The large number of victims has meant that Bergamo\u2019s crematorium could not cope on its own,\" mayor Giorgio Gori said in a statement.\n\nAFP has previously debunked social media posts purporting to show the coffins of novel coronavirus victims.", "lang": "en"}
