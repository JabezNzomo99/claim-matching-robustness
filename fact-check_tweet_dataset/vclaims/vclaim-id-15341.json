The enclosed article states that Rahul Gandhi in his election speech during Rajasthan State Assembly Elections 2018, has referred \u2018Baniyas\u2019, a merchant community, as \u2018robbers\u2019. Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the newspaper clip and also the claims made in it.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nClaim: Congress President Rahul Gandhi has called people of \u2018Baniya\u2019 community as \u2018robbers\u2019 in his election speech during Rajasthan State Assembly Elections 2018. Fact: When searched for any newspaper article regarding Rahul Gandhi\u2019s disgraceful remarks on the \u2018Baniya\u2019 community, no such information was found. Even there was no such news reported by the media houses that covered Rahul Gandhi\u2019s election speeches during Rajasthan State Assembly Elections 2018. Hence the claim made is FALSE.\n\nWhen googled for any news regarding such bizarre remarks made by Rahul Gandhi on the \u2018Baniya\u2019 community, no information is found either in the print or the broadcasting media that covers the election speeches. On looking for any other information, it was found that similar newspaper clip was in circulation last year with the same claims on BJP President Amit Shah which was later on proved to be false. So, the last year fake newspaper clip on Amit Shah is now edited and circulated on the name of Rahul Gandhi.\n\nHence, the newspaper article clip claiming Rahul Gandhi degraded \u2018Baniyas\u2019 by calling them as thieves is a fake one.", "lang": "en"}
