But was that a come-from-behind win?\n\nDuring a campaign stop to the AFL-CIO Convention in Philadelphia on Wednesday, Hillary Clinton riled up the crowd with a quip about Villanova\u2019s buzzer-beating final shot that clinched the Wildcats the national championship.\n\n\"I love those come-from-behind victories,\" she said.\n\nSure, it was an off-the-cuff remark about a basketball game. But, given the enthusiasm of Philadelphia sports fans, we decided to check the claim: Was Villanova\u2019s win really of the \"come-from behind\" variety?\n\nWildcats fans may have been sweating the last few minutes, but Villanova never trailed in the closing stages.\n\nWithin minutes, Clinton\u2019s campaign defended the remark, saying UNC was leading at the half and, citing FiveThirtyEight, added that the Tar Heels were about twice as likely to win the game at that point before 'Nova came back to take the lead in the second half.\n\nPrior to tip-off, \u2018Nova was a three-point underdog in the final game of March Madness, despite coming off a 44-point win over Oklahoma in the semi-finals. Villanova was down to North Carolina 39-34 at the half, then trailed by seven points with 19:16 to play in the game before, yes, mounting a comeback.\n\nThat said, the last lead the Tar Heels held came at the 15:20-minute mark of the second half. The game was tied a few times, but Carolina never held another lead the entire game. Villanova, however, had a 10-point lead with 5:29 to play.\n\nThe Wildcats\u2019 lead at that time was seemingly so insurmountable, that Nate Silver\u2019s FiveThirtyEight tweeted there was a 96 percent chance Villanova would would win the game.\n\nAs UNC chipped away to tie things up with seconds left, \u2018Nova held on for dear life before Kris Jenkins hit the game winning shot. That three-pointer that went in as the final second on the clock ticked away won the game, 77-74, for Villanova.\n\nClinton said during a campaign stop at the AFL-CIO Convention in Philadelphia that she loves \"those come-from-behind victories.\"\n\nWe do, too.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t one of them.\n\nVillanova didn\u2019t trail in the last 15:20 of the game. Yes, the Cats made a last-second shot to win. But if they missed, the game would have moved onto overtime.\n\nTo steal another basketball cliche, this claim is a bit of a brick. We rate it Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
