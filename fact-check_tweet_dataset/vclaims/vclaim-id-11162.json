However, that site noted that despite the popularity of the image (and the mountain of shame heaped upon it), no one was sure the photograph actually captured a high school age \u201cgirl\u201d attending a school prom:\n\nTwo radio stations \u2014 105.9 Kiss FM in Detroit and Old School Cincy in Cincinnati \u2014 posted onto their respected Facebook pages the same photo of what they claimed to be a high school student on her way to prom in a \u201crevealing\u201d black dress \u2026 Mic called both stations to verify that the person in the photo is in fact a high school student, but has yet to hear back.\n\nThe radio station that shared the image included no details or other information about the woman pictured, the date of the photograph, the location of the purported prom, or how they determined that the picture depicted a prom attendee and not a grown woman dressed for a night out:\n\nOne potential hole in the story was that a reverse image search performed before the \u201cprom\u201d angle started to catch on returned \u201cfashion model\u201d as a descriptor of the image, not \u201cprom dress\u201d:\n\nThe photograph also lacked all other stock-standard elements of prom pictures: a date in a tuxedo, fellow attendees, a corsage, a limousine, a pleasantly-planned background (such as a garden or gazebo), or anything other than a revealing dress. The image seemed to be more of a paparazzi-style photograph than a prom portrait, and some commenters pointed out that the woman did not appear to be of high school age.\n\nNot all social media shares of the photograph claimed the woman was a prom attendee, either, querying as to whether a guy would \u201callow\u201d his partner to wear such attire out on the town for a girls\u2019 night out:\n\nThe earliest appearance of the photograph we were able to locate was posted to Tumblr and dated 9 April 2016. The user who posted it speculated that the pictured dress was for a prom but did not offer any information substantiating that statement.\n\nAlthough social media users were quick to condemn the pictured woman here and her parents based solely on captions, no solid proof or even circumstantial information suggested the photograph was one of a high school student in a risqu\u00e9 prom dress.", "lang": "en"}
