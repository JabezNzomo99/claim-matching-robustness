Whose words inspire dissension and hatred can't possibly 'Make America Great Again.'\"\n\nA few days after Kobe Bryant\u2019s sudden and tragic death in January 2020, a quote ostensibly uttered by the NBA legend circulated on social media, including via the Facebook page of the liberal site Occupy Democrats.\n\nThe full quote reads: \u201cA #potus whose name alone creates division and anger. Whose words inspire dissension and hatred can\u2019t possibly \u2018Make America Great Again.'\u201d\n\nThis was a genuine quote from Bryant. The basketball star posted this message to his Twitter account in September 2017, an apparent reference to U.S. President Donald Trump whose campaign slogan was \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Trump was calling on NFL team owners to fire any players who protested during the National Anthem. The commander-in-chief had also just disinvited the Golden State Warriors basketball team from visiting the White House after star player Stephen Curry said he was not interested in attending the traditional event:\n\nTrump\u2019s comments drew the ire of several NBA stars. Lebron James and Draymond Green, for instance, both responded to Trump:\n\nWhile Bryant did not specifically name Trump in his tweet, he commented amid a controversy involving the current occupant of the White House, and he invoked Trump\u2019s campaign slogan. About a month after posting this message, Bryant was asked during a news conference if he would attend an event at Trump\u2019s White House. Bryant responded: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go. Simple. No.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
