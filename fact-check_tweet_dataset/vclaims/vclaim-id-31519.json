Or contact Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741.\n\nIn early February 2020, just a few days after Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna Bryant were killed in a helicopter crash along with seven other people, a hoax video started to circulate on social media which falsely claimed that Bryant\u2019s wife, Vanessa, had died by suicide. On Feb. 19, we came across a carbon copy of this hoax, only this time it was Bryant\u2019s daughter, Natalia, who supposedly died by suicide.\n\nA video report made up to look like it came from BBC News was widely circulated on social media. While this video carried the BBC logo, it was published on suspicious looking websites, such as w0rldnews.g0ldenbuzzers.com and t0pstories.caldomns.com, which have absolutely no affiliation with the British Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nThis was not a genuine news report.\n\nIn addition to this video being hosted at suspicious websites, the actual video report also contained some major red flags. For instance, it starts with a screenshot containing the words \u201cR.I.P. Natalia Bryant.\u201d After a few seconds it cuts to a news anchor at a desk saying \u201cthe shock is still raw for fans of the late.\u201d The video then cuts back to the screenshot before the news anchor can finish her sentence.\n\nAs was the case with the Vanessa Bryant death hoax, the video of the news anchor comes from an unrelated incident. Although we haven\u2019t been able to pinpoint the exact segment that was pilfered by these hoaxsters, the news anchor appears to be Dawn Hasbrouck from Fox 32 Chicago (not the BBC).\n\nNo genuine news outlets have reported on Natalia Bryant\u2019s alleged death. Furthermore, Natalia\u2019s mother, Vanessa, has made no such announcements on her social media pages.\n\nNatalia Bryant did not die by suicide in February 2020. This is just another death hoax aimed at exploiting a tragedy.", "lang": "en"}
