Christopher Dodd says that the cost of the Iraq war for three months equals the cost the expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program that President Bush vetoed on Oct. 3, 2007.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service reported in July 2007 that the cost of the war in Iraq for the first half of the budget year 2007 is estimated to be about $10 billion a month. Three months of the war would cost $30 billion.\n\nThe expansion if SCHIP is estimated to cost $35 billion over five years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nSo, SCHIP costs $5 billion more than three months of the war. To most of us, $5 billion is big bucks. In Washington, it's not.", "lang": "en"}
