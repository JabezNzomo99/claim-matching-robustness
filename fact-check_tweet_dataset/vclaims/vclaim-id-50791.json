The message requests people to plan accordingly. Let\u2019s find out if the bank are really closed all through the mentioned dates.\n\nClaim: Banks are closed continuously from 26th September 2019 to 30th September 2019. Fact: Not all bank employees are involved in the strike announced on 26th and 27th September 2019 and there is no Half Yearly Closing holiday for banks on 30 September 2019. Hence, the claim that all banks are continuously closed for 5 days is Misleading.\n\nWhile it is true that four bank unions namely, All India Bank Officer\u2019s Confederation (AIBOC), All India Bank Officer\u2019s Association (AIBOA), Indian National Bank Officer\u2019s Congress (INBOC) and National Organisation of Bank Officers (NOBO) have given a strike call from the midnight of 25th September to midnight of 27th September protesting against the amalgamation of 10 public sector banks announced by Finance minister on 30 August 2019, not all bank employees may participate in the strike and the private banks may be functioning normally.\n\nState Bank of India (SBI) in its regulatory filing said \u201cWhile bank has made all arrangements to ensure normal functioning in its branches and offices, it is likely that work in our bank may be impacted to some extent by the strike\u201c\n\nAnother day claimed as holiday in the post is 30 September 2019 owing to \n\nBanks\u2019 half-yearly closing of accounts. The list of Holidays on the RBI website does not list 30 September 2019 as a Holiday. While the the banks are closed on the 1st of April every year due to yearly closing of accounts, there is no such holiday for half yearly closing of accounts.\n\nTo conclude, public sector bank operations may be affected due to the strike call given by four unions but operations will run normally on other days. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Indian Rivers?", "lang": "en"}
