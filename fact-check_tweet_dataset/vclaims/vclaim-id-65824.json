The accompanying Tweet accused an anti-fascist group, Antifa, and \"professional anarchists\" of domestic terror through \"staging bricks and weapons to instigate violence\". It didn't provide any evidence to support this claim.\n\nEarlier in the week, we investigated some of the videos in the montage, and found that the bricks had been there before the protests started, often at construction projects in different cities.\n\nOne recent video from Dallas of this type has been watched more than seven million times on Twitter. It shows a masked protester in front of some bricks saying, \"This is a set-up\", and that there is \"no construction\" nearby.\n\nBut Chicago police say the rumours are \"false\" and explain that the officer was helping the victim of a burglary nearby, and the images show the detective helping to load goods into the shop owner's car. The shop has confirmed that the video shows police returning looted goods.\n\nA video of an African-American man pleading with people not to destroy his business has been widely shared on TikTok. The posts imply it's from the recent protests, but the video is actually from 1992.", "lang": "en"}
