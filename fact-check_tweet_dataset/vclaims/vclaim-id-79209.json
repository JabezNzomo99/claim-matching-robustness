Scott Walker during his sixth State of the State, given Jan. 19, 2016.\n\n\"In our state, fourth- and eighth-grade reading scores went up again in 2015,\" the governor said. \"And according to the most recent report, Wisconsin\u2019s high school graduation rates are also up again -- to the third-best in the country.\"\n\nGiven the nature of his speech, Walker clearly was taking some credit for the graduation rate apparently rising and the ranking being so high.\n\nWalker made a similar statement in April 2014. He said the state\u2019s high school graduation rate and third-grade reading scores had improved on his watch.\n\nOur rating was Mostly True. Both numbers were up since 2010, the year before Walker took office. But some credit could have been to due prior elected officials, and the trend lines hadn\u2019t changed much going back to prior to 2010.\n\nThe graduation rate covers students in public high schools who earn a regular diploma within four years of starting high school.\n\nTo back Walker\u2019s new claim, his office cited an October 2015 news release from the state Department of Public Instruction about the latest graduation data.\n\nThe release said federal data released that month showed Wisconsin\u2019s graduation rate for the 2013-\u201914 school year was 88.6 percent.\n\nThat rate was up 0.6 percentage points from the previous year, ranking Wisconsin third in the country, according to the release.\n\nHere\u2019s how the federal data listed the top states:\n\nNow the federal data for the previous school year:\n\nSo, Wisconsin\u2019s graduation rate did improve, but its rank did not.\n\nWalker said: \"According to the most recent report, Wisconsin\u2019s high school graduation rates are also up again -- to third best in the country.\"\n\nThe latest-available graduation rate for public high school students in Wisconsin was 88.6 percent in the 2013-\u201914 school year. That\u2019s up sixth-tenths of a percentage point from the previous year. But Wisconsin\u2019s rank -- third -- did not change.\n\nWisconsin Democratic Party: Wisconsin dropped \"from second in the country to 41st\" among states where more than half the students took the ACT exam. Pants on Fire.\n\nActivist Scot Ross: Under Scott Walker, Wisconsin \"moved from 16th to third in percentage of people with student loan debt.\" Mostly False.\n\nLawmaker Jennifer Shilling: A \"voucher school that closed after 9 days this year collected $5.4 million in taxpayer subsidies since first opening.\" Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
