Edith Wilmans of Dallas, elected to the House in 1922 before losing re-election two years later, was the state\u2019s first female legislator. In 1926, Margie Neal of Carthage proved the first woman elected to the Texas Senate, where she served until 1933.\n\nBut women did not hold more than a few legislative seats until the 1980s. The Legislative Reference Library\u2019s listing of women members shows that the 70th regular session, in 1987, included 21 female House members and four women in the Senate. From then, the number of female House members escalated -- reaching a record 38 members in 2009 and dipping after that -- while the number of female senators stayed in the low single digits until the 2007 session began with five female senators; that body has had a record eight females since 2015.\n\nSo, is male dominance just as Annie\u2019s List declared in a November 2016 press release?\n\nLet\u2019s first consider the group\u2019s contention about the minority status of men in the state\u2019s population. We turned to the Texas Demographic Center at the University of Texas at San Antonio, which says in its latest available estimate that the state\u2019s total 2014 population of 26.9 million people broke out to 13.4 million men (48 percent) and 13.5 million women (51 percent).These estimates, which are posted on the center\u2019s website, are the product of baseline projections from the 2010 Census population of each county.\n\nSecond, we checked the Legislature\u2019s makeup. Given the somewhat fluid nature of its membership -- some lawmakers retire, others are defeated -- we looked first at its composition on Jan. 13, 2015, the first day of the 2015 regular session.\n\nThe 2015 counts bear out the Annie's List contention: About 80 percent of Texas lawmakers were men, 20 percent were women. The mix is narrowly poised to change in early 2017 due to the results of the 2016 elections, with the House netting one additional woman and the Senate continuing with eight women, according to a library list of members-elect posted online after the November 2016 elections. The 2017 Legislature, whose members will be sworn in on Jan. 10, 2017, the first day of the 140-day regular session, will include 23 first-time members, the list shows. Men account for 65 percent of the first-termers, women about 35 percent:\n\nMembers by Gender of the 85th Legislature, Jan. 10, 2017\n\nAnnie\u2019s List said that \"though men comprise 49% of the population, they hold 80% of the lawmaking power in the Legislature (144 of 181 seats).\" In 2014, 51 percent of the state\u2019s residents were female, 48 percent were male. Of late, men account for 80 percent of Texas legislators, women comprise 20 percent. After members are sworn in for the 2017 regular session, there also will be an 80-20 split. TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.
