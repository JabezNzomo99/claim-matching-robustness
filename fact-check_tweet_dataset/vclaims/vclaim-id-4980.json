They\u2019re also a fascination of photoshoppers, particularly those at Worth1000, a site devoted to hosting contests in which entrants show off their skills at manipulating photographs using digital editing programs:\n\nThe above image falls into the latter category: It does not show giant human skulls that were revealed after a massive earthquake struck South America, but rather a digital creation entitled \u201cGiant Discovery\u201d that claimed 4th Place in Worth1000\u2019s (now DesignCrowd) Archaeological Anomalies 12 contest back in 2008:\n\nIn this contest you will create a hoax archaeological discovery, maybe Atlantis, a 2,000 year-old Coca-Cola can or a giant\u2019s skull. Be open minded, there are many mysteries buried beneath the earth.The rules of this game are thus: You are to create an archaeological hoax. Your job is to show a picture of an archaeological discovery that looks so real, had it not appeared at Worth1000, people might have done a double take.\n\nIn any case, we don\u2019t need to know the specific origins of this image to definitively determine that it\u2019s a fake. The square-cube law makes it a physical impossibility that humanoids of the size represented by these skulls could ever have existed.", "lang": "en"}
