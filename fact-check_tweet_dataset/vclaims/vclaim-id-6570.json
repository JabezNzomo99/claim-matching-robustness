Polish authorities participated in the Russian probe and conducted one of their own.\n\nThe Russian-led Interstate Aviation Committee released its investigation report in January 2011. It mainly blamed the Polish crew and alleged pressure from Polish officials aboard on the pilot to land the plane in poor conditions.\n\nThe Polish report by the previous government, concluded in July 2011 that Polish pilot error, poor guidance by the Russian air tower controller, and poor visibility due to a heavy fog caused the crash.\n\nPolish President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, his wife, and dozens of high-level military and civilian officials were among 96 people killed in the crash.\n\nA new investigation was launched after Kaczynski's twin brother Jaroslaw, and his conservative Law and Justice party, won the majority in both chambers of the Polish parliament in 2015.\n\nWaclaw Berczynski, the Subcommittee Chairman for Accident Investigation at the State Aviation Air Investigation Board in Poland, told Polygraph.info by email that \u201cthe new Polish government found new facts which warranted reopening the investigation.\n\n\u201cPolish government officials submitted over 200 questions/remarks to\u201d Russian investigators, Berczynski wrote. \u201c(The Russians) were required to answer and include Polish remarks in the report they submitted to the international community...They never did.\u201d\n\nBased on international aviation probe standards - known as the Convention on International Civil Aviation Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation - the \u201cState of Occurrence shall release custody of the aircraft, its contents or any parts thereof as soon as they are no longer required in the investigation, to any person or persons duly designated by the State of Registry or the State of the Operator, as applicable.\u201d\n\nBerczynski said that Russia is in violation of this regulation.\n\n\u201cThe wreckage of the plane is stored in Smolensk and to our knowledge nobody is doing any investigation,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMoscow says its investigation of the wreckage is not finished, meaning Russia meets international aviation investigation standards since the wreckage remains \"required in the investigation.\"\n\nPolish officials say they are not \"politicizing\" the probe, as Zakharova claims.\n\n\u201cThe Polish government does not try to politicize the issue,\u201d Berczynski told Polygraph.info. \u201cThe plane is the property of the Polish government. In what sense is requesting the return of Polish property to Poland political?\u201d", "lang": "en"}
