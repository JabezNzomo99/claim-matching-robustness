Mohd Ali Road 3. Bhindi Bazar 4. Dongri 5. Madanpura 6. Kala Pani 7. Saat Rasta ! The blacklisted areas are beyond police control so the police has called in the military. now the military will keep a strict vigil on these areas and can use baton and rubber bullets to bring things under control.

No such measures are being taken. This message is entirely fake,\" he said.\n\nWe further looked for media reports of such an announcement and did not find any report. There is also no official government notification about such an alert in the area.\n\nBOOM also found that the army and paramilitary forces have not been deployed for curfew control in Mumbai.
