The report found that Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government and Washington Post columnist, was the target of \u201ca premeditated extrajudicial execution, for which the State of Saudi Arabia is responsible.\u201d\n\nKhashoggi\u2019s killing followed columns in the Post that reportedly angered the Saudi regime and came six months after a meeting in which Bezos and the crown prince traded phone numbers and began connecting on WhatsApp.\n\n\u201cThe information we have received suggests the possible involvement of the Crown Prince in surveillance of Mr. Bezos, in an effort to influence, if not silence, The Washington Post's reporting on Saudi Arabia,\u201d Callamard and Kay said in a joint statement. \u201cThe allegations reinforce other reporting pointing to a pattern of targeted surveillance of perceived opponents and those of broader strategic importance to the Saudi authorities, including nationals and non-nationals.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, Mohammed bin Salman invited Bezos to a private dinner in Washington, D.C., on Apr. 4, 2018, at which the exchange of numbers occurred.\n\nLess than a month later, the U.N. experts said, a message consisting of \u201can encrypted video file\u201d was sent from the crown prince\u2019s WhatsApp account to Bezos\u2019 phone. That triggered an \u201canomalous and extreme change in phone behavior, with cellular data originating from the phone increasing by 29,156 percent,\u201d they said, citing an in-depth forensic study of the phone.\n\n\u201cData spiking then continued over the following months at rates as much as 106,031,045 per cent higher\u201d than was normal, the statement said.\n\nThat forensic analysis was overseen by Anthony Ferrante of the business advisory company FTI Consulting, who was hired by Bezos\u2019 security adviser, Gavin de Becker. FTI Consulting\u2019s full report of that analysis also is public.\n\nReacting to early news reports, the Saudi embassy called the hacking allegation \u201cabsurd.\u201d Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, the foreign minister, stuck to that characterization after the statement was released: \u201cI think \u2018absurd\u2019 is exactly the right word,\u201d he told Reuters at the 2020 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nBut the U.N. experts said FTI Consulting\u2019s forensic analysis established \u201cgrounds for a reasonable belief (medium to high confidence) that Mr. Bezos was subjected to intrusive surveillance via hacking of his phone as a result of actions attributable to the WhatsApp account used by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the statement said, the Saudi Royal Guard had \u201cacquired\u201d Pegasus-3 spyware in November 2017 from the Israeli cyber security firm NSO Group. That spyware was a likely suspect in the Bezos hack, the statement said, and the ability to install it via WhatsApp had been \u201cwell-documented.\u201d\n\nIn October 2019, WhatsApp owner Facebook sued the NSO Group for compromising users\u2019 private data.\n\nAccording to the U.N., the same malicious code was used by the Saudis to hack the phones of three Khashoggi associates earlier in 2018. The hacking was \u201cconsistent with the widely reported role of the Crown Prince in leading a campaign against dissidents and political opponents,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cFollowing the hacking of Mr. Bezos' phone, the Crown Prince sent WhatsApp messages to Mr. Bezos, in November 2018 and February 2019, in which he allegedly revealed private and confidential information about Mr. Bezos' personal life that was not available from public sources,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cDuring this period, Mr. Bezos was widely targeted in Saudi social media as an alleged adversary of the (Saudi) Kingdom,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cThis was part of a massive, clandestine online campaign against Mr. Bezos and Amazon, apparently targeting him principally as the owner of The Washington Post.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
