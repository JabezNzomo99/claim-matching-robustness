The various signs below the plaza\u2019s name, however, were digitally altered for humorous effect. The real Cum-Park Plaza consists of stores such as Food Lion, Citi Trends, Boost Mobile, and Shoe Show.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the original photograph of this sign (left) and the altered version (right):\n\nCum-Park Plaza is located in Burlington, North Carolina. You can see an image of this sign via Google Street View here.\n\nWhile this plaza\u2019s name may have certain NSFW (\u201cnot safe for work\u201d) connotations for some, this name actually refers to the two people who developed the plaza in the 1960s: Carl Parks and Hugh Cummings. While the name of this plaza is displayed as \u201cCum Park Plaza\u201d on the sign, news reports about the shopping center add a hyphen between \u201cCum\u201d and \u201cPark.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Times News, Cum-Park Plaza was Burlington\u2019s first \u201cretail Mecca\u201d when it opened up in 1963:\n\nCUM-PARK PLAZA turns 51 this week, the shopping center still plugging along at middle age. It was developed by Carl Parks and Hugh Cummings, who were brothers-in-law. Neighboring Cummings High School is named for Cummings, who donated land for the school. What\u2019s easily forgotten is the milestone the collection of shops and businesses represented when the center opened in August 1963. Long before Tanger Outlets, Alamance Crossing or, even, Holly Hill Mall, Cum-Park presented buyers an alternative to downtown shopping, to stores that closed at 5 p.m., to paid parking. \u201cOn Friday nights, especially, the stores were packed,\u201d Parks said. \u201cThey had to have police officers directing traffic, there were so many people trying to get in.\u201d Carl Parks died in 2010. Cummings passed in 1984. Carl Parks\u2019 wife, Dorothy, and Cummings\u2019 wife, Rebecca, are sisters. Both women are still alive.\n\nAn Aug. 6, 1963, a newspaper clipping from the Burlington newspaper the Daily Times-News shows the ribbon-cutting ceremony at Cum-Park Plaza:\n\nIn sum, Cum-Park Plaza is a real shopping center that first opened in the 1960s in Burlington, North Carolina. However, the image showing various sexually suggestive store names on its sign was digitally manipulated.", "lang": "en"}
