In all, there have been a total of four cloture votes concerning Supreme Court nominations \u2014 the successful blocking of the 1968 nomination of Abe Fortas, and unsuccessful filibusters of William H. Rehnquist in 1971 and 1986 (for chief justice) and also Samuel A. Alito Jr. in 2006.\n\nBut those have been the exception, not the rule, as Sanders claims. Two members of the current court were confirmed with fewer than 60 votes. Alito won the cloture vote, 72 to 25, but then was confirmed by a vote of 58 to 42. Clarence Thomas, another current justice, was confirmed by a vote of 52 to 48 in 1991.\n\nThere are only two ways to end debate on a Supreme Court nomination: 1. By voting to invoke cloture which needs 60 votes.\n\n 2. By unanimous consent. Both of President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominees received more than 60 votes. Since Senate Republicans understood that President Obama\u2019s nominees would receive at least 60 votes, they did not object to ending debate.\n\n\u201cAlthough cloture affords the Senate a means for overcoming a filibuster, it is erroneous to assume that cases in which cloture is sought are always the same as those in which a filibuster occurs. Filibusters may occur without cloture being sought, and cloture may be sought when no filibuster is taking place. The reason is that cloture is sought by supporters of a matter, whereas filibusters are conducted by its opponents.\u201d\n\nAnother CRS report says that there are \u201cno specific rules for filibustering,\u201d but it is often used to refer to senators \u201cholding the floor in extended debate. More generally, however, filibustering includes any tactics aimed at blocking a measure by preventing it from coming to a vote.\u201d\n\nSanders appeared to be evoking the image of extended debate \u2014 \u201cpeople are going to be there standing for months and months, bringing down the government.\u201d But in reality, he and other senators have generally used filibuster to mean one group of senators preventing a matter from coming to a vote. That\u2019s how he framed it on his website \u2014 and other Democrats have also referred to a filibuster of Gorsuch.\n\nSanders is using the technical language of arcane Senate procedures to an absurd extreme. He claims that Democrats are not engaging in a filibuster when they demand 60 votes from the Senate before a vote on the nomination can be held. Instead, he says that Republicans need to \u201cinvoke cloture\u201d to bring the nomination to a vote \u2014 which is a technical way of saying they need to bring a filibuster to an end before a vote can take place. (Only in rare circumstances anymore do senators seek to hold the floor in continuous debate.)", "lang": "en"}
