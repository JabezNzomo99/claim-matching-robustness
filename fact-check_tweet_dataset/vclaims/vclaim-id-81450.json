The crowd gathered at the Sunday market mistook them for a child kidnapping gang, dragged them to the village panchayat office and beat them. Rainpada is a tribal dominated village and WhatsApp rumours on child kidnapping were going around in the village.\n\nThe victims were Raju Bhonsle, Dadarao Bhonsle, Bharat Bhonsle, Bharat Malve and Agnu Ingole who belonged to the Nath Panthi Davari Gosavi nomadic tribe from Solapur\u2019s Khewa village.\n\nThe families of the victims had refused to receive the bodies and have demanded for justice and compensation. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis have said that the families would receive Rs 5 lakh as compensation.\n\n4) Police investigation has led to arrest of 23 people and the accused have been booked for murder under IPC 302 and rioting.\n\nMaharashtra DGP Datta Padsaligkar also made an appeal to the public to not believe rumours and to inform the police about such incidents.\n\n5) Within hours of the Dhule incident, another mob attack happened at Malegaon in Nashik district of Maharashtra. Again based on suspicions of child rumour, a family of five including a 2 year old boy were beaten up by a mob. BOOM accessed two unrelated videos that were circulating in Malegaon which have created fear among the villagers about child abduction.

The apex court would give guidelines to the states and centre to tackle the issue.", "lang": "en"}
