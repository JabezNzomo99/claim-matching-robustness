No, that's not true: A conspiracy theory on Facebook claims that the coronavirus outbreak is a move by the government against the so-called \"Deep State\" - a phrase common to right-wing conspiracy theorists that has not been proven to be true. This is a made-up theory with no backing other than the imaginations of people who refuse to believe the novel coronavirus is anything other than a real, global medical threat that started in Wuhan, China.\n\nThe claim appeared in a post (archived here) published by Ben Grady on Facebook on March 13, 2020, under the title \"Latest Intel\". It opened:\n\nSocial media users saw this on Facebook:\n\nAs evidence of the situation's seriousness, President Trump, as well as leaders around the world, have taken drastic actions to try to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus - which has been declared a national emergency in the United States, deemed a pandemic by the World Health Organization, caused countries to lockdown populations and sickened and killed thousands of people.\n\nSimply put, the medical crisis sweepig the globe has nothing to do with the right-wing conspiracy about sex-trafficked children, as the post suggests. Still, Grady's Facebook page is filled with many such posts.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, Grady posted this to Facebook:\n\nUsers on Grady's Facebook page have called out his rants, including the post on March 13, 2020, laying out the supposed scripted narrative.\n\nOne user simply said; \"Laughable. This is,some weird,conspiracy theory shit.\"\n\nIn fact, the National Institutes of Health released a statement on March 17, 2020, imploring people to follow medical guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus - which has no known cure at this time. The orgnizations's website has this written on top:\n\nContagion, a 2011 scripted movie that did fictionally depict a deadly outbreak, has soared into iTunes' top-10 movie rental charts since January, the month when the coronavirus first was diagnosed in the United States.\n\nWhile hoaxes and conspiracies have gone viral amid the coronavirus outbreak, Lead Stories has debunked a great many of them.
