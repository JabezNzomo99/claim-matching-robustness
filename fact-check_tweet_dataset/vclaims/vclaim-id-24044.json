It may be noted that Aarey colony was recently in the news after tribals had protested in May 2019 against infrastructure projects in the area, and later in June 2019, there was another protest over the proposal to set up a zoo inside the colony. Aarey colony is a neighbourhood situated in Goregaon (East), on the outskirts of Mumbai. The area has thick vegetation and is home to leopards.\n\nThe video has also been shared on Facebook with the same claim. According to the accompanying message, the lion was seen at Aarey colony.\n\nThe video being shared on Facebook and Twitter, is actually from Gujarat and NOT from Mumbai.
