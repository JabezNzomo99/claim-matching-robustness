Also, according to the claim the time capsule is not supposed to be opened until the year 2957 under any circumstances. Through this article lets fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: A time capsule is buried 2000 feet below in the vicinity of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. Fact: According to a tweet by Champat Rai, General Secretary, Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra, no time capsule is being buried below Ram Mandir construction site in Ayodhya. Also, the image in the claim is the image of a time capsule which was unearthed in 2015 while laying the foundation for a new building in America\u2019s prestigious MIT University. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen we searched for more information regarding the claim, we came across a tweet by Champat Rai, General Secretary, Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra clearing the air about the issue. According to his tweet, news that a time capsule is being buried under Ram Mandir construction site is fake and he advised not to believe such news. News article which reported his tweet can be read here.\n\nWhen we ran a reverse image search of the image in the claim, we found that the image was of a time capsule which was unearthed in 2015 while laying the foundation for a new building in America\u2019s prestigious MIT University. On the time capsule, it was written: \u201cPlease do not open until 2957 A.D\u201d. Video related to this can be seen here.\n\nShowing this image, news that a time capsule has been buried under 2000ft in the vicinity of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya and under any circumstances the time capsule should not be opened until the year 2957 is being falsely shared. with this, we can conclude that the image in the claim has nothing to do with the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.\n\nTalking to media Kameshwar Chaupal, another member of Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust said that \u2018a time capsule will be placed 2000ft under Ram Mandir construction site\u2019 on 27 July 2020. News article which reported this can be read here and video of the interview can be seen here. It is in this background news like that of in the claim are being widely shared on social media platforms. But like it is explained earlier in this article, this was debunked by the official twitter handle of the trust.\n\nTo sum it up, we can say for sure that a time capsule is not being placed under the Ram Mandir construction site.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
