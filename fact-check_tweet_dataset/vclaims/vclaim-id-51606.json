Among these photographs is one from Lal Chowk, Srinagar where the tricolour can be seen atop Ghanta Ghar. Leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have been sharing the image since the morning of August 15. Below is a tweet by BJP Delhi leader Kapil Mishra which garnered over 40,000 likes and more than 7,000 retweets.\n\nOn August 5 last year, prime minister Modi-led government abrogated the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. Since then, the region has been attempting to return back to normalcy even as high speed internet remains inactive.\n\nBJP MP and the party\u2019s state president from Ladakh Jamyang Tsering Namgyal and BJP MP Kirron Kher also shared the picture.\n\nThe image also found a place in a report by News Nation. \u201cLal Chowk used to see bloodshed due to hoisting of the national flag. Now the country\u2019s flag rises there with pride,\u201d read the report. Dainik Jagran claimed, \u201cOn the occasion of India\u2019s 74th Independence Day, the tricolour was reportedly hoisted at the historic Lal Chowk in Srinagar,\u201d in both English and Hindi reports. ABP News journalist Astha Kaushik also tweeted the photograph.\n\nA simple reverse image search brings out the truth. The national flag has been morphed into an old picture of deserted Lal Chowk. A blogpost on mubasshir.blogspot.com carried the picture in 2010. The cars on the left and the man walking can be seen in both the pictures, thus indicating that it is the same.\n\n\n\nMubasshir Mushtaq, the person who runs the blog, quote-tweeted Kapil Mishra and said that he had shot the photograph on June 22, 2010.\n\nJournalist Ahmer Khan shared a picture of the clock tower in Lal Chowk with Alt News. The photograph has been shot today and the tricolour flag isn\u2019t visible.\n\nKhan had also tweeted a video of deserted Lal Chowk area.\n\nAs of this writing, there have been no reported sightings of the Indian national flag in Lal Chowk, Srinagar. According to a report in The Kashmir Monitor, the main Independence Day function was held at SK Stadium in Srinagar where Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha hoisted the tri-colour. \u201cAuthorities suspended the 2G mobile internet service across Kashmir on Saturday as I-day functions were held in district headquarters in the valley. Kashmiris woke up to see the service barred even as mobile telephony was working,\u201d the report adds.\n\nSeveral prominent users shared the photograph falsely claiming that the national flag was hoisted in Lal Chowk. Among them were BJP Delhi IT cell member Sandeep Rajliwal, president of fringe group Azad Sena Abhishek Azad, Friends of RSS, parody account of Republic TV founder Arnab Goswami (@arnew5222) and Gaurav Pradhan.\n\n[Update: Mubasshir Mushtaq\u2019s tweet has been added to the report.]", "lang": "en"}
