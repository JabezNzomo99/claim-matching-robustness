The New York Department of Labor confirmed that the claim is false.\n\nEssential workers are considered \u201cthose who conduct a range of operations and services that are typically essential to continue critical infrastructure operations,\u201d according to the Department of Homeland Security. Starting in late March, many states issued stay-at-home orders, allowing only essential businesses to continue operating, in an effort to help curb the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThe post being shared claims the New York Department of Labor \u201cfinally authorized up to $4,800.00 in hazard pay for qualified essential workers\u201d that worked during the pandemic. It features an image of the department\u2019s logo and includes a purported link to a website with more information about the compensation.\n\nHowever, the provided link is a hoax. It directs users to an image of a gorilla with its middle finger extended, rather than a state government website.

Andrew Cuomo has called for federal funding to give essential public workers hazard pay, it has not been given as of press time. There is no mention of such $4,800 hazard payments on the New York Department of Labor\u2019s website. The New York Department of Labor confirmed to the Daily Caller News Foundation in an email that \u201cthe rumor is false.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the link to the gorilla photo has been used in a post making a claim about coronavirus-related government payments. Earlier this month, the DCNF debunked a post claiming people can apply to receive a second, $1,000 stimulus payment from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
