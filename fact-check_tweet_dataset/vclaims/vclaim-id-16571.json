Let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of the image in the post.\n\nClaim: The image in the post shows Modi bowing down to touch the feet of Saudi\u2019s King Salman. Fact: Modi\u2019s image of bowing down to touch the feet of Advani, back in 2013, was photoshopped to add Saudi King\u2019s photo in Advani\u2019s place. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image in the post is cropped and ran through Google Reverse Image Search, newspaper article on this issue can be found in the search results. According to the Business Standard article, Modi\u2019s photo of bowing down to Advani, in 2013, at a rally in Bhopal has been photoshopped to place Saudi King\u2019s photo in place of Advani. This photo went viral in 2016 when a News18 journalist has tweeted the morphed photo. The BJP then had filed a formal complaint on the journalist for which he had apologized.\n\nTo sum it up, an old photoshopped image of Modi bowing down to Saudi king is being shared again.\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
