Regular readers know that we\u2019ve often warned about accepting at face value numbers concerning illicit activities, such as human trafficking or smuggling, so we were curious to learn how this figure was developed.\n\nThe math is pretty simple. A Homeland Security official explained that the agency assumed that transnational criminal organizations receive an average of $5,000 per person smuggled, a number based on interviews with undocumented immigrants who are caught. DHS apprehends about 300,000 people a year who try to illegally cross the border each year, so the agency took one third of that number \u2014 100,000 \u2014 and multiplied it times $5,000, yielding a figure of $500 million.\n\n\u201cWe think the number of people paying smugglers is actually much higher but wanted to provide a conservative estimate,\u201d the official said. \u201cThis, of course, also does not include those who pay to be smuggled across our borders and are not caught.\u201d\n\nSome might say it\u2019s conservative. Others might say it\u2019s arbitrary. There\u2019s really no rhyme or reason for why one-third of the people caught are being counted, especially since presumably people who are not caught also might rely on smugglers.\n\nSanchez said one problem with Nielsen\u2019s figure is that it assumes a $5,000 smuggling fee. That\u2019s a reasonable figure for getting across the border between the United States and Mexico, which she said is between $4,500 and $5,500, though in March smugglers were offering a 20 percent discount because they were not getting enough clients.\n\nBut there\u2019s another wrinkle: Many people will never finish paying off their fees. \u201cThe facilitators are flexible because if not, they know a client can go to someone else, so they cut prices to get clients and then clients vanish,\u201d she said.\n\nMoreover, she said, the money paid to smugglers stays along the trail, as smugglers need to pay rent, too, contrary to the image conjured up by Nielsen of \u201ctransnational criminals.\u201d Smugglers are often just low-level independent operators, loosely connected to others, trying to make a buck. She said the biggest cost in the smuggler operation was corruption \u2014 the fees paid to police and border agents.\n\nOne smuggler told Sanchez his profit margin was just 25 to 30 percent. The Pulitzer Prize-winning report by the Arizona Republic on the impact of President Trump\u2019s proposed border wall quoted a smuggler, \u201cAlexis,\u201d as saying he kept about $2,500 of the $5,000 to $6,000 fee, with the rest going to pay off helpers and police.\n\nInterestingly, Nielsen\u2019s figure appears to be a lowball estimate. It is much lower than a previous estimate from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), from 2003, that global profits from human smuggling amount to $9.5 billion. ICE never explained how that figure was calculated, and it later morphed into the incorrect claim that child sex trafficking in the United States yielded profits of $9.5 billion, but that\u2019s another story.\n\nMore recently, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimated in a 2010 report that human smuggling into the United States earned revenue of $6.6 billion in 2008. But those numbers were based on previous high rates of migration by Mexicans \u2014 661,000 apprehensions a year, with a probability of being apprehended at 20 percent \u2014 and the report noted that the Mexican market had been in sharp decline since 2005. But it also assumed smugglers charged $2,000 per person.\n\n\u201cUndocumented migration from Mexico has been negative for 10 years: More people are going back to Mexico than are entering the U.S.,\u201d said Douglas Massey, of Princeton University, co-director of MMP. \u201cIn fact, the number of apprehensions reported by the DHS is very small \u2014 the lowest number of since 1971 \u2014 and in that year there were only 1,500 Border Patrol Officers, whereas today there are 19,000 officers. The number of apprehensions per officer are at their lowest point since 1942. In 2016, less than half of all apprehensions were Mexicans. Illegal migration from Mexico is effectively over.\u201d\n\nNielsen\u2019s $500 million estimate is not wildly off base but it appears derived from arbitrary metrics. It is based on smuggling costs at the border, even though many illegal immigrants these days have a longer route to travel. She\u2019s only counting one-third of those apprehended, even though many people who use smugglers are not caught. So the overall figure of smuggler revenue could be higher.\n\nBut at the same time, it\u2019s unclear how much of these fees end up in the pockets of \u201ctransnational criminal organizations,\u201d as she claimed. As Sanchez noted, the fees often are not fully paid \u2014 or actually mostly go to corrupt border police or agents. The actual amount that goes to criminal gangs could be well below $500 million, especially since many smugglers are independent operators.", "lang": "en"}
