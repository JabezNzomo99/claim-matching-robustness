The claim is false; this is a doctored image; Queensland Health told AFP there had been no relevant warning issued against specific suburbs as of January 29, 2020.\n\nThe image was shared here in a Brisbane-based Facebook group with nearly 3,000 members on January 26, 2020.\n\nThe text in the screenshot reads, in part: \u201cDepartment of Health media releases | Queensland Health\n\n\u201cQLD issues level 3 health warning for coronavirus, advises against nonessential travel to Wuhan, China, Sunnybank, Sunnybank Hill, Runcorn, Eight Mile Plains and all populated areas with Chinese nationals of ratio of 1 to 3 non-Chinese Australians.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nSunnybank, along with its neighbouring suburbs Sunnybank Hill, Runcorn and Eight Mile Plains, is described as \u201chome to Brisbane\u2019s biggest Asian community\u201d by Australian real estate website Domain.com.au.\n\nAs of January 30, 2020, the novel coronavirus has killed at least 170 people and infected thousands others in China since it first emerged in early December 2019 in the central city of Wuhan, AFP reported here. The World Health Organisation notes that the virus, officially known as \"2019-nCoV,\" is in the \"family of viruses that include the common cold, and viruses such as SARS and MERS.\"\n\nThe same misleading image was also shared here, here, here and here on Facebook, and in other languages, such as here in Korean and here in Vietnamese.\n\nThis claim is false; Queensland Health confirmed that no such warning was every issued.\n\n\u201cThe only accurate health information regarding coronavirus in Queensland will come directly from Queensland Health,\" a Queensland Health spokesperson told AFP in an email on January 28, 2020.\n\nThe spokesperson also urged people to visit the Queensland Health official website for information about the virus, as well as guidelines for the general public, health professionals and various industries in face of the outbreak.\n\nA keyword search on Queensland Health's website also found no suburb-specific warning over the new virus.\n\nQueensland's Chief Health Officer Dr. Jeannette Young also announced on January 29, 2020 the state's first confirmed coronavirus case involving a Chinese national from Wuhan.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of a section of the statement:\n\nQueensland health minister Steven Miles also tweeted about the news on January 29.\n\nIncluding the new Queensland case, the total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia has reached seven, the Sydney Morning Herald reported on January 30.\n\nThe outbreak also led Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to issue a travel advice on the Smarttraveller website.\n\nFor China as a whole, the agency issued a level three \u201creconsider your need to travel\u201d advice, the second most severe on the government\u2019s four-tier warning system. The most serious \u201cdo not travel\u201d warning was handed down to Hubei province, where Wuhan is located.\n\nDuncan Pegg, the Labor Member of Parliament for Stretton, Queensland, also tweeted about the fake Queensland Health warning on January 27, 2020.\n\nThe tweet reads: \u201cThis media release is 100% FAKE!!! FAKE!!! FAKE!!! I don't normally like to give any credence to ppl who seek to malign our community but wanted to make things clear this time. To get latest updates go to the Queensland Health website & FB page. Any questions call 13HEALTH.\u201d\n\nFears sparked by the new coronavirus have prompted hoaxes about \u201ccontaminated\u201d foods and locations in Australia, as debunked by AFP here.", "lang": "en"}
