No such record currently exists in the list of Guinness World Records.\n\nThe image has circulated repeatedly over the past few years, but this particular post linked to an article from the website I Cook I Eat that claimed the pictured woman was Anita Sullivan, a 36-year-old Michigan woman who had 14 children by 14 different men.\n\nThe article said that she had set a Guinness World Record as the first person to conceive children with more than 13 different men.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely proud to have broken a World Record,\u201d she was quoted as saying. \u201cMy mother always told me that I was lazy and worthless, and that I would never accomplish anything in my life. Now, I\u2019ve shown everyone that she was wrong, and that I can even be the best in the world when I put my mind to something. In fact, I\u2019ve just accomplished something that no one had done before!\u201d\n\nHowever, not only does such a record not exist in the catalog of Guinness World Records, the pictured woman is not 36 years old or the mother of 14 children.\n\nRachel Gluck, a public relations coordinator with Guinness World Records, told The Daily Caller that the organization does not monitor such a record.\n\nThe story has appeared on other websites, including World Daily News Report, a site that publishes \u201csatirical\u201d and \u201cfictional\u201d content according to its disclaimer.\n\n\u201cAll characters appearing in the articles in this website \u2013 even those based on real people \u2013 are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle,\u201d the website says.\n\nRather, the image is actually of Bennett, who is in her early twenties. She welcomed her first child with partner Elder Marroquin in Milford, Connecticut, back in January 2015. Bennett\u2019s picture was taken and publicized because her son was the first baby born in the hospital that year.\n\nAfter the fake news story went viral, Bennett said it impacted her personally because, having been tagged on Facebook, she witnessed many people posting derogatory comments about her.\n\n\u201cWhen people are really starting to make comments about your person, calling you ugly, calling you fat, those were the comments that really started to hurt me a lot. That\u2019s where I started to break down, seeing comments from 30,000 people,\u201d Bennett told ABC News back in 2016.", "lang": "en"}
