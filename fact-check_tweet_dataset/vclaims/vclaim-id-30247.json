The accompanying post also suggests that this is the case in the UK.\n\nThe image shows a real advert from Nando\u2019s which says \u201cWe\u2019re officially halal now for real!\u201d but the ad was released in Singapore, not the UK.\n\nNando\u2019s clarified in September 2019 that it had 434 UK branches, of which 76 were serving halal chicken only. This is still the case according to the company\u2019s UK website.\n\nIt adds: \u201cA small proportion of chicken sold in our other restaurants may also be Halal. This may happen on rare occasions if there are, for example, issues with supply.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook post also claims that halal slaughter means an animal\u2019s throat is slit \u201cwithout any kind of stunning or sensory restrictions.\u201d\n\nNando\u2019s says its chickens are stunned before being slaughtered and this is the case for most halal meat produced in the UK.\n\nHowever, some animal rights campaigners have argued that stunning in accordance with Islamic law is not as effective at preventing animal suffering as other forms of stunning.\n\nThis article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this\u2014and find out how to report Facebook content\u2014here. For the purposes of that scheme, we\u2019ve rated this claim as partly false because while some Nando\u2019s restaurants in the UK serve only halal chicken, this is not the case in most of its UK restaurants. The ad shown in the screenshot is real but comes from Singapore rather than the UK as is suggested by the accompanying Facebook post.", "lang": "en"}
