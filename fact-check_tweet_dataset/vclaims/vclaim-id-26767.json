It\u2019s likely something similar is happening here.\n\nThere are other reasons why many of these repeated posts don\u2019t look like the work of bots. We found that similar comments on Mr Johnson\u2019s posts often feature variations and misspellings, and were not mass posted at the same time (which some believe is an indication of bot activity).\n\nAlso, some of the \u201cevidence\u201d used to support the theory that posters are bots are messages that appear to be malfunctioning bots. For example one comment reads \u201c//\u201dBrilliant Fantastic\u201d &name=\u201dBoris\u201d.\u201d\n\nHowever, Full Fact spoke to several accounts behind these apparently malfunctioning bots, all of whom said they were posting such comments as acts of satire in response to the claim that Mr Johnson\u2019s Facebook supporters were largely bots.\n\nOne of the first Twitter accounts to claim that there were malfunctioning bots went on to retract their claim.", "lang": "en"}
