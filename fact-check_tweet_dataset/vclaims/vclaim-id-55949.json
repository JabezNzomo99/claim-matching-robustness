The tweet is from the Twitter handle \u2018@Realmukeshamban\u2019 and has a profile picture of Reliance Industries Chairman and Director Mukesh Ambani. The tweet states that by taking the public sentiment of the countrymen into consideration, Shahrukh Khan was removed from the \u2018Jio\u2019 sim card ads, and was replaced by Akshay Kumar. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Mukesh Ambani tweeted that Shahrukh Khan was removed from \u2018Jio\u2019 sim card ads and was replaced by Akshay Kumar. Fact: Reliance Industries Chairman and Director Mukesh Ambani does not have an official Twitter account. The tweet is from an impersonating account of \u2018Mukesh Ambani\u2019. Also, no information was found about the removal of Sharukh Khan from \u2018Jio\u2019 sim card ads. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for the twitter profile (\u2018@Realmukeshamban\u2019) mentioned in the screenshot, the description of the account is in improper English language and is as follows \u2013 \u2018Chairman and director of reliance industries. This account is handling mukesh ambani\u2019s media panel team\u2019. When the account was analyzed on \u2018Foller me\u2019, a Twitter analytics tool, the account was known to be created recently on 4 June 2020, and had 10.5k followers till the time of writing this article.\n\nThe Twitter account (\u2018@Realmukeshamban\u2019) has many tweets with personal comments on several Bollywood actors. If those tweets were really made by Mukesh Ambani, they would have surely been reported in the media, but no such news was found on the internet. There are no media reports about Akshay Kumar replacing Sharukh Khan in Jio advertisements as well. Also, Mukesh Ambani does not hold any official account on Twitter.\n\nTo sum it up, a fake Twitter account impersonating Mukesh Ambani has tweeted that Sharukh Khan was removed from \u2018Jio\u2019 sim\u2019s ads.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
