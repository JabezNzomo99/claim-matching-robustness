He was arrested because he allegedly attempted to kidnap a child in front of North 90 street at Gate no 8 at Cairo Film festival. The article quoting Egyptian reports mentioned that the man was hiding while being dressed in a woman\u2019s clothes when some people complained about him to the authorities.\n\nAlt News also found a news article published by Sharkia Today on the same incident. Google reverse search also showed up articles that claimed that the same image was viral in September in Lebanon as well. An official had then clarified that the man in the image was not arrested in Lebanon and was arrested in another country about two years ago. Evidently, not only is the image old, it also does not show a protester from Jamia Milia Islamia university. Rather, it is from Cairo in Egypt when the man dressed in woman clothes was arrested for allegedly attempting to kidnap a child.", "lang": "en"}
