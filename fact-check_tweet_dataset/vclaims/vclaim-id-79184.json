Very few children. Strong, powerful men. Young. And people are looking at that and saying, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 \"\n\nTrump made a similar claim in October. It was False then, and it\u2019s False now.\n\nWe asked Trump\u2019s campaign for more information about his claim but did not hear back. However, there are two databases that track the movements of migrants in Europe and Syrian refugees. Neither supports his statement.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees registers and tracks Syrian refugees in camps spread over several nations, including Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and North African countries. According to numbers as of Dec. 31, 2015, the total comes to more than 4.6 million.\n\nOf those 4.6 million, 50.7 percent are female and 51.8 percent are children (boys and girls) 17 years old or younger.\n\nSo the majority of refugees are:\n\nIn all, only 22.7 percent of refugees across the Middle East and North Africa being counted by the U.N. were men older than 18.\n\nLooking at the migrant crisis more broadly only slightly helps Trump\u2019s case.\n\nThe U.N. also tracks so-called \"sea arrivals,\" refugees and migrants who cross the Mediterranean Sea to continental Europe. The counts a little more than 1 million people who have crossed into Europe since the start of 2015, with almost 3,800 dying during the journey.\n\nThe U.N. breaks those migrants into three categories: Adult men, 49 percent; Adult women, 19 percent; and children, 31 percent.\n\nTrump said that among Syrian refugees and migrants coming into Europe, \"there look like very few women. Very few children.\"\n\nThe data in no way supports that claim.\n\nThe majority of more than 4.6 million Syrian refugees entering Europe are women and children 17 and younger. Of migrants arriving by sea -- about 1 million people -- 31 percent are children and 19 percent are women.", "lang": "en"}
