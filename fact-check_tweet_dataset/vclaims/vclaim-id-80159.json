The photo is fake and was created by an Indonesian Photoshop expert.\n\nWowshack, an Indonesian website specialising in viral content, published the photo in November 2017 in an article meant to show \"30 Rare Historical Pictures\" about Indonesia.\n\nThe black and white image appears to show Monroe, Kennedy and Taylor sharing a joke with the late Indonesian leader, who is dressed in a crisp military-style jacket, black tie and peci cap favoured by Muslim males in Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nOld Pics Archive also posted a tweet to its 588,000 followers in April 2018 stating the image was \"Circa 1960s\".\n\nHowever the photo is a digitally manipulated fake by Indonesian artist Agan Harahap, who told AFP in a phone interview that he created the scene by stitching together five different images using the digital editing software Photoshop.\n\n\u201cI put that particular image [together] during the 2013 Jakarta Biennale. The big theme of the Biennale was about tactics, strategy. So I manipulated history. We always hear stories about Sukarno that he is an alcoholic and a womaniser, etc, but we\u2019re lacking visual evidence. So I made one,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nHarahap said the original photo of Sukarno was taken during a 1961 visit to the United States, where the Indonesian leader met President John F. Kennedy.\n\n\u201cI found Sukarno's picture first, then I was thinking who would be the women? Of course Marilyn Monroe, then I found an image of her chatting. Then who would be next to her? I kept looking and no one seemed to fit in until I found image of JFK's wife,\u201d said Harahap, who also added in Taylor and a background image.\n\nHarahap emailed a copy of the photo to AFP to use in this blog post and an inspection of the image's metadata using the Invid plug-in showed Photoshop was used to modify it in April, 2014.\n\nThe image is just one of dozens that Harahap has manipulated to fool social media users and news outlets in recent years.\n\nHarahap said he created the fake-paparazzi photos to highlight the problem of untrusworthy viral internet content and poor digital literacy in Indonesia -- and to warn social media users not to believe everything they see.\n\n\u201cBecause what makes an impact on social media, it affects real life, especially in religion and politics. That\u2019s not okay,\u201d he said.\n\nOther viral photos created by Harahap include one of him drinking cheap vodka with Metallica singer James Hetfield, and actress Angelina Jolie looking broody after apparently being arrested by Indonesian police.\n\nIn another, US President Donald Trump is singing Indonesia\u2019s most popular music, Dangdut, at a packed nightclub.\n\nMany of his manipulated images can be seen on his Instagram account. Harahap's work has made him an internet celebrity in his own right: he has nearly 67,000 followers on Instagram.\n\nHere are more excerpts from AFP's interview with Harahap.", "lang": "en"}
