The guidance suggests that all health services and councils providing adult social care in England should follow a set format and way of collecting the information if they ask patients about their sexual orientation.\n\nThe information standard issued by NHS England says that \u201cThis standard does not mandate implementation and will not monitor conformance.\u201d The guidance does say that NHS England recommends that health services and councils use it. NHS England says it predicts all organisations will be doing so by April 2019.\n\nNHS England told us it wasn\u2019t compulsory for health services and adult social care providers to comply with the new rules and that it was up to individual organisations to collect the information.\n\nWhat the guidance does say is that \u201cwhere dataset owners and health and social care organisations decide to record patient/service user sexual orientation, the data should be recorded as per this standard.\u201d\n\nSo it seems that if health and social care professionals are going to record information about a patient\u2019s sexual orientation, the guidance sets out the way they have to do it.\n\nA Welsh government spokesperson told us that \u201cThere are currently no plans to introduce a similar approach in Wales. GPs in Wales would know their patients and will ask about their sexuality if it is relevant to their medical condition.\u201d\n\nA Scottish government spokesperson told us that \u201cThere are various reasons why individual boards or services collect information on patients\u2019 sexual orientation. It could help them to improve patients\u2019 experience of care, or to better plan services for future needs. There is national guidance to advise boards, but it is of course entirely up to the individual whether they want to disclose this information.\u201d We\u2019ve asked them for more information on what kind of guidance they provide.\n\nThe guidance applies to all health services and council run adult social care services in England. If your health service or the council providing social care follows this new guidance then you may be asked:\n\nWhich of the following options best describes how you think of yourself?\n\u2022 Person asked and does not know or is not sure\n\nIf a patient chooses not to answer then this is recorded. If the patient is unable to answer and the information is not known, then it won\u2019t be recorded.\n\nThe information standard came into effect on 5 October and NHS England says it wants all health services and councils providing social care to follow it (if they are going to ask about sexual orientation) by April 2019.\n\n\u201cWe recommend that this standard is used to record sexual orientation at every face to face contact with the patient, where no record of this data already exists\u201d according to the guidance. It also says that this information will be updated every so often along with other information collected about a patient \u2013 like their home address.\n\nSome services already collect this information\n\nSome services in the NHS already collect information about sexual orientation. Those services using three specific data sets already had guidance on asking patients about sexual orientation. These included two datasets related to mental health and one linked to sexual health services.\n\nNHS England says that \u201cRecording sexual orientation will allow policy makers, commissioners and providers to better identify health risks and will help support targeted preventative and early intervention work to address the health inequalities for people who are Lesbian, Gay or Bisexual.\u201d It also says that collecting the information will allow providers of health and social care to identify health risks and show that LGBT people get equal access to services.\n\nThe Health and Social Care Act 2012 describes an information standard as \u201ca document containing standards that relate to the processing of information.\u201d\n\nThe NHS has information standards on a wide variety of topics, from how to record a patient\u2019s name, gender and sex to how information about paediatric care or meningitis vaccinations should be recorded.", "lang": "en"}
