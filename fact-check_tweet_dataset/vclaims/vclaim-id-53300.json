It is actually a line from orator Robert G. Ingersoll.\n\nThis quote has been falsely attributed to Paine for years. In fact, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey credited Paine as the source of the quote in a 2013 tweet.

It appears nowhere in his collected works.\n\nThe Daily Caller reached out to several experts, all of whom confirmed that the quote did not originate with Paine. Two experts \u2013 Thomas Paine National Historical Association Secretary Gary Berton and Yale University Library Associate Editor Philipp Ziesche \u2013 did note, however, that Paine probably would have agreed with its sentiment.\n\n\u201cThis is not Paine, but it is his philosophy,\u201d Berton told the Caller in an email. \u201cI believe it is Robert Ingersoll, a great orator of the late 19th century who wrote and spoke in support of Paine\u2019s philosophy.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the statement does come from Ingersoll\u2019s 1877 work \u201cThe Liberty of Man, Woman, and Child.\u201d In this work, Ingersoll writes, \u201cThis is my doctrine: Give every other human being every right you claim for yourself.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
