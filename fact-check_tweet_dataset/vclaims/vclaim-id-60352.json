The picture shows Biden briefly kissing his 19-year-old granddaughter on the lips.\n\n\u201cAMERICA; This is 76 year old Senile Joe Biden!!!\u201d the caption claims. \u201cThat is a 15 year old girl with whom he\u2019s making out!!!\u201d\n\nWhile it is a real picture of the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, the description of it in the Facebook post is inaccurate. It shows Biden briefly kissing his granddaughter, Finnegan, on the lips during a February campaign rally in Iowa, according to the caption from the European Pressphoto Agency. Biden was 77 at the time, not 76, while Finnegan was 19, not 15.\n\n\u201cBut granddaughters not only love their grandpops but they like them,\u201d Biden said before giving her a peck, per the New York Post. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the great thing. Thank you, baby.\u201d\n\nReactions to the quick peck varied online, with some feeling unsettled and others perceiving it as a normal display of affection, the New Zealand Herald reported.
