What say you!\u201d\n\nTwo days later, Trump tweeted: \u201cThe Democrats took the word GOD out of the Pledge of Allegiance at the Democrat National Convention. At first I thought they made a mistake, but it wasn\u2019t. It was done on purpose. Remember Evangelical Christians, and ALL, this is where they are coming from-it\u2019s done. Vote Nov 3!\u201d\n\nIn reality, the pledge was recited in full during the prime-time convention programming events every night, beginning at 9 p.m.\n\nC-SPAN videos of each of the four nights all show the pledge said in full: See night one (clip begins at 3:10), night two (11:15), night three (4:40), and night four (24:38).\n\nThe claim is instead based on the fact that two DNC caucuses omitted the words \u201cunder God\u201d during daytime meetings \u2014 a point that Trump correctly conveyed in a subsequent tweet and while speaking during the first day of the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe fact was first raised on Twitter by David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network and then reported in outlets such as the Washington Times.\n\nA video of the Muslim Delegates and Allies Assembly\u2019s virtual meeting Aug. 18 shows that the words were left out during the pledge (clip begins at 1:10:48).\n\nThe same day, the LGBTQ caucus meeting\u2019s recitation included a pause in place of the words \u201cunder God\u201d (clip begins at 1:55). Another LGBT caucus meeting on Aug. 20 also omitted the words (at 1:30).\n\nThe meetings were among 30 caucus and council meetings that took place during the convention.\n\nThe words \u201cunder God\u201d were not officially added to the pledge until 1954, the National Constitution Center notes.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
