That said, statistics do exist on the quality of roads in England and Wales\u2014we\u2019re trying to find out how comparable the two sets of figures are.\n\nMaintenance needed to be considered on 4% of Buckinghamshire\u2019s A roads in 2016/17, according to the Department of Transport. 5% of the county\u2019s B and C roads were designated as roads where maintenance should be considered.\n\nAcross the whole of England, the figure that year for A roads was 3% and for B and C roads, it was 6%.\n\nThis data is collected using a number of automated road condition survey machines, called SCANNER vehicles, and there can be variability between results from each machine machine, so caution should be taken when comparing the figures across years. The Department of Transport specifies that each year at least two fifths of roads need to be surveyed, the exact figures vary slightly depending on the type of road.\n\nRather than specifically recording whether or not there are potholes in a road, the machines look for various levels of deterioration.\n\nA slightly different type of survey is done to check unclassified roads. These are \u201clocal roads intended for local traffic\u201d, and make up 60% of the UK\u2019s thoroughfares. In 2016/17, the survey found maintenance should be considered on 28% of Buckinghamshire\u2019s unclassified roads.\n\nIn Gwynedd, North Wales\u2014where Question Time was this week\u201411% of A, B and C roads were \u201cin poor condition\u201d in 2016/17. That figure for the whole of Wales was just under 11%.\n\nAlthough the two countries phrase it slightly differently, both figures are for roads that have scored RED (100 or higher) on the SCANNER survey. They are comparing roads differently\u2014for England the figures are split into A roads, B and C roads, then unclassified roads, while the Welsh figures group A, B and C roads together.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked the Welsh government for more information on how comparable the figures between England and Wales are.", "lang": "en"}
