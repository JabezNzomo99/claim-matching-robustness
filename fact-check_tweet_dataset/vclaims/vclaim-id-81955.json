We found many of the products through Trump\u2019s website, which has a page for the Donald J. Trump Collection, which includes suits, accessories and eyewear. We then explored the country for origin for each one.\n\nWe found Trump shirts on Amazon that were made in Bangladesh and China, as well as some listed simply as \"imported.\"\n\nWe saw a \"made in China\" label on a Trump tie for sale on eBay.\n\nWe actually found quite a few Trump suits on Amazon that were made in the United States. But we also found ones made in India and China. We couldn\u2019t immediately find an example of a suit made in Mexico for sale, but Trump has acknowledged he has made some of his clothing line there.\n\n(Update: After we published this fact-check, the Clinton campaign sent us an example of an individual who posted a picture on Facebook of a Trump suit with a \"made in Mexico\" label.\n\nWe found some cufflinks that were made in China and others listed as imported.\n\nClaim: Trump Vodka is made in the Netherlands.\n\nYes, Trump Vodka was distilled there, according to online liquor sellers.\n\nSlovenian glassware producer Steklarna Roga\u0161ka partnered with Trump to sell their product under his name in the United States.\n\nTrump\u2019s wife is also from Slovenia, which prompted Jeong to cry out her name: \"Holy Melania!\"\n\nBut not all Trump products are made overseas.\n\nIn a previous fact check, we found Trump-brand bedding, cologne, Trump Natural Spring Water and Trump Wine are all made in the United States.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re wondering, some Trump products also are made in the United States, including the candidate\u2019s iconic \"Make America Great Again\" baseball cap, which is manufactured in California. We gave a Pants on Fire rating in October to a claim made by Twitter users that the hats were made in China.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, too, that 97 percent of all clothes sold in the United States are made overseas, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association.\n\nThe Funny or Die video said Trump shirts are made in Bangladesh, Trump suits in Mexico, Trump Vodka in the Netherlands, Trump crystal barware in Slovenia and his cufflinks and ties in China.\n\nWe found examples of all of these products made in the countries Jeong and Goolsbee mentioned, with the exception of a suit made in Mexico. But we did find suits made in other countries, and there are examples of other Trump clothing products made in Mexico. Some suits, in fact, are made in the United States.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
