It\u2019s that moment that has been widely shared online in memes expressing outrage that Trump didn\u2019t have his hand over his heart.\n\nSome of those pictures have a big red circle around Trump and some have an arrow pointing at him. Other pictures have circles around each person\u2019s hand to emphasize that Trump\u2019s hand is at his side.\n\nBut no matter how they\u2019re presented, they\u2019re misleading. Trump did, indeed, have his hand over his heart when the casket passed by him as it was entering the cathedral, and when it was leaving, as can be seen in official White House photos. Getty Images captured a nearly identical photo of Trump properly paying his respects at that point in the funeral.\n\nWhile it isn\u2019t a requirement, placing the hand over the heart is a sign of respect that is recommended as part of military funeral etiquette for civilians.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that the decorum of a public figure has been misrepresented through deceptive photo or video editing.\n\nLast year, conservative websites falsely accused Democratic leaders of remaining seated during a standing ovation for a Navy SEAL widow at Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress. There were two ovations and a video of the event shows Democratic leaders stood for both. However, they did not remain standing as long as Republicans \u2014 just as Trump did not keep his hand over his heart as long as others at Bush\u2019s funeral.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nHarrer, Andrew.
