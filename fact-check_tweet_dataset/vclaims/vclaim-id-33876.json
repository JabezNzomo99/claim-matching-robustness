Such headlines that claim to cure deadly diseases attract hundreds of readers who click on it and sometimes fall prey to it. The viral post on social media claims that wild aubergine can cure diseases such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, kidney cancer, and asthma. Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is fake.\n\nA viral post on Facebook shared by a user named Gbenga Fasole GSc reads: \u201cGOOD NEWS FOR CANCER PATIENTS THE CURE IS HERE WILD AUBERGINE (a sought-after plant, a wealth to preserve). Breast cancer control, Fight against prostate cancer, Stomach cancer control, Fight against liver cancer, Fight against kidney cancer, In short, fight against all types of cancer, Asthma control.

Your cancer will disappear. Crush, whether it is the fruit or the leaf, and pass over the cancerous breast. Anyone who has his external cancer, and who even sores, and even if the rotten wound, crush that wild eggplant or it\u2019s leaves and pass over the wound while drinking the decoction.

Many herbalists testifies of using my remedies to treat all kind of sicknesses.\u201d\n\nWhen Vishvas News started investigating we found that the story is shared by a lot many users on Facebook.\n\nWe further investigated and found that this viral claim is supposedly endorsed by doctors. A Facebook post dated October 20, 2019, on the page named Dr. Gilliard Pharmacy claims that drinking wild aubergine mixed with water will make cancer disappear.\n\nThe page named Dr. Gilliard Pharmacy endorsed the use of aubergine for cancer cure.\n\nVishvas News further investigated by performing the Google reverse image search of the profile photo of the page which shows a man wearing a stethoscope.\n\nWhen we performed Google Reverse Image search we found a number of posts with the same picture.\n\nOn further research, we found that the photo of the person is not of Dr Gilliard but actually an American doctor called Paul Rivas.\n\nMany comments on the viral post expressed gratitude for the advice and have asked for more information about the recipe.\n\nWhen Vishvas News contacted Dr. Manish Singhal who is an oncologist at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, he denied any connection between the treatment of cancer with aubergine.\n\nWhere did the claim originate from?\n\nVishvas News further investigated by performing keyword search on Google. We landed on a post on the page named Truth About Cancer.\n\nThe post features a video on \u201cEggplant Cancer Cure\u201d. In the video, it was mentioned \u201cWatch as Dr. Wright shares how Dr. Bill Cham discovered the eggplant extract cream known as BEC5 or Curaderm.\u201d\n\nThe video promotes the eggplant extract cream known as BEC5 or Curaderm.\n\nOn the official website of BEC5 or Curaderm, it is mentioned that it is \u2018The Eggplant Skin Cancer Cream\u2019.\n\nWhen Vishvas News further investigated we found that in 2015, on the official website of US Food and Drug Administration, a warning letter was issued reprimanding the company behind Curaderm for marketing the product without their approval.\n\nThis means, that \u2018eggplant skin cancer cream\u2019 has not been approved by the FDA but is still in the market.\n\nThe post claiming that consuming the decoction of wild aubergine can cure any type of cancer is fake.", "lang": "en"}
