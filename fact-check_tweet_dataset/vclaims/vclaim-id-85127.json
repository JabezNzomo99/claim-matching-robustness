His supporters have argued that Trump losing a billion dollars of his own money is not as bad as Clinton losing $6 billion of taxpayer money.\n\nIn the context of the $3.8 trillion annual federal budget, a few billion dollars is a rounding error. But by itself $6 billion is a hefty chunk of change \u2014 and certainly taxpayers should expect the money is properly spent.\n\nTrump\u2019s use of the number appears to have its roots in recent reporting of the right-leaning media, which reported on a Freedom of Information Act request in August 2016 by a self-described government watchdog (also right-leaning) called the Cause of Action Institute. The FOIA request sought information about whether State has implemented recommendations in a management alert issued by State\u2019s Office of Inspector General in March 2014.\n\nThe management alert, which used the $6 billion figure, summarized a variety of recent audits that indicated paperwork deficiencies in closing out contracts that were issued in Iraq, Afghanistan and Africa. The FOIA request asserted, without evidence, that \u201cmany of these cases arose during the tenure of Secretary Hillary Clinton.\u201d In the Daily Caller, this got translated as \u201cClinton\u2019s State Department Blew $6 Billion In Contracts.\u201d\n\nActually, the 2014 alert is an old story. Steve Linick, the inspector general, was sufficiently concerned about media reporting on the figure that he sent a letter to The Washington Post, published April 13, 2014, explaining that it was wrong to assume $6 billion was \u201cmissing.\u201d The alert, he wrote, \u201cdid not draw that conclusion.\u201d Instead, he wrote, the point of the alert was that \u201cthe failure to adequately maintain contract files \u2014 documents necessary to ensure the full accounting of U.S. tax dollars \u2014 \u2018creates significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the Department\u2019s contract actions.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSo, for the past two years, it was known that taxpayer money was not lost or misplaced. So what about the claim that the problem was Clinton\u2019s fault?\n\nThe State Department is a vast bureaucracy, and it\u2019s silly to blame Clinton for some missing paperwork in the Baghdad embassy. But we dug through the footnotes of the alert and read the original audit reports to figure out the time period in question. Recall that Clinton was secretary of state from January 2009 to January 2013.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the $6 billion stems from a set of contracts issued in Iraq. The IG looked at 115 contracts, worth about $7.5 billion, that were issued between October 2004 and October 2011. The report does not give a breakdown, but it\u2019s safe to assume that more than half were issued before Clinton took charge of the State Department.\n\nAnother $1 billion, transferred to State from the Defense Department between October 2006 and April 2009, concerned a civil police contract in Afghanistan. The problem in this case was contract files were not complete and could not be easily accessed.\n\nThat adds up to $6 billion. Easily two-thirds, or perhaps more, concerned contracts that predated Clinton\u2019s tenure at State. (The management alert also mentioned a handful of cases of deliberate fraud, such as $52 million in contracts awarded to a company headed by the spouse of a contracting employee\u2013a scam first exposed by the Daily Caller.)\n\nThe $6 billion was not lost or misplaced; it\u2019s that $6 billion in contracts had missing paperwork. On top of that, the majority of contracts with missing or incomplete paperwork stemmed from the Bush administration, before Clinton became secretary of state. So it\u2019s ridiculous to claim Clinton was in any way responsible for the problems with the contracts.", "lang": "en"}
