We\u2019ve debunked some, such as the claim that investigators found the remains of missing women in steel barrels on Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s property. Or that a doctor was murdered after criticizing the Clinton Foundation. (There are more.)\n\nOn Aug. 13, a Facebook post alleged yet another victim of the political family.\n\n\"I\u2019m Suzanne Coleman,\" reads the text above a black-and-white photo of a woman. \"After having an affair with Bill Clinton I became pregnant. Then my body was found with a gunshot wound to the back of my head. It was ruled a suicide and no autopsy was allowed. I was 7 months pregnant.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThat\u2019s because there\u2019s no credible evidence supporting the idea that Coleman was killed after having an affair with Bill Clinton. In fact, the rumor was discredited as early as the 1992 presidential campaign. Here are the facts.\n\nSusan Coleman, not Suzanne Coleman as the Facebook post says, was a former law student of Bill Clinton at the University of Arkansas. Clinton taught there after earning his law degree in 1973. Coleman committed suicide in 1977, according to numerous published reports.\n\nDuring the presidential election that year, a young conservative named David Bossie \"was dispatched to sniff around Bill Clinton\u2019s sex life by the Republican operative Floyd Brown, the founder of Citizens United,\" according to a 2016 story in the Atlantic.\n\nBossie and a retired police officer named Jim Murphy were working for Brown as they tried to confirm Coleman shot herself \"following a love affair with her law professor, Bill Clinton, that left her pregnant,\" CBS reported, according to the Washington Post.\n\nMurphy and Bossie, who helped run Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, followed Coleman\u2019s mother to an Army hospital in Georgia, according to CBS, and \"burst\" into the room where her husband was being treated for a stroke \"and began questioning the shaken mother about her daughter\u2019s suicide.\"\n\nCBS Evening News reported that the investigation stemmed from an anonymous letter mass mailed to news organizations but that Coleman\u2019s family \"maintained there was no truth to this, and said reporters who had investigated the letter found it to be a nasty hoax,\" according to UPI.\n\nAfter reading a transcript of the CBS News report, then-president George H.W. Bush ordered his campaign to file a complaint with the Federal Election Commission against Brown, \"the hard-ball political ad man who has gone from being seen as (an) asset to a liability,\" UPI reported.\n\nSearching the Nexis news archive for stories that could corroborate the allegations made in the Facebook post, we found none. We rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
