It appears to show a shelf cloud over Navarre Beach in Florida.\n\nThe claim that the video shows Hurricane Laura near the Gulf Coast started circulating as the storm approached the Louisiana-Texas border. Hurricane Laura, which weakened to a tropical depression after making landfall, inflicted damaging winds and flooding on the area, killing at least 14 people, according to USA Today.\n\nHowever, the video predates the hurricane making landfall as a Category 4 storm on Aug. 27. CBS affiliate WRGB and Greg Pollak, a meteorologist for NBC affiliate WOAI, shared the video on Facebook in mid-July, crediting Stephanie Weller.

In the video, an ominous shelf cloud looms over what appear to be beach houses. The buildings visible in the video match those that can be seen in a Google Maps street view of Navarre Beach Marine Park.\n\n\u201cA shelf cloud will usually be associated with a solid line of storms,\u201d the National Weather Service explains on its website. \u201cThe wind will come first with rain following behind it. It may appear to rotate on a horizontal axis.\u201d\n\nWeller did not respond to a request for comment.", "lang": "en"}
