And there\u2019s almost no other data on skin lightener use in Nigeria. \n\n\n\nThree in four women in Nigeria regularly use skin-lighteners, claim a host of international media reports.\n\nin the US,\n\nin Nigeria and the pan-African platform\n\nall say 77% of women in the west African country use the potentially harmful products.\n\nclaims this is \u201cby extrapolation, more than 60 million people\u201d.\n\nto treat pigmentation disorders and to lighten skin for cosmetic purposes.\n\nPowerful lightening compounds are available on prescription for treating blemishes and other conditions, but can have serious side effects if made or used incorrectly,\n\nDo this many women in Nigeria use skin lighteners? We checked.\n\non inorganic mercury in skin lightening soaps and creams and its unsafe health risks.\n\nThe WHO said the number came from a 2008 \u201cmercury awareness pack\u201d by the\n\n(Unep). But the document is now missing from the UN environment agency\u2019s website.\n\nwith Africa Check, but other than the dangers of mercury in certain products it did not have any information on skin lightener use in Africa.\n\nWe traced the statistic to\n\non the use of skin lightening cosmetics among traders in Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s\n\nThe research was carried out in three markets in Lagos from May to July 1998.\n\n77.3% (348) said they used skin lightening cosmetics, some of which contained mercury. The users were made up of 252 females and 96 males.\n\n, the researcher who carried out the survey, said the findings did not represent all of Nigeria.\n\nMy study was conducted among traders in Lagos. Hence, the right interpretation of the prevalence of skin lightening cream of 77% should be limited to the traders and not generalised to all Nigerians,\u201d she told Africa Check.\n\nAdebajo added that her study was cross-sectional (a snapshot of events at a particular time), so it also did not represent behaviour over a period of time.\n\nThe wide use of the 77% figure was due to the lack of data, Prof Lester Davids, the\n\non skin lightener use in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult to quote anything else in the face of not having the latest statistics. We (scientists, researchers) have all used the figures of between 70% to 77% of Nigerian women but knowing full well that this is a very small sample of women in a particular region,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat is why when we do refer to it we will say \u2018a study\u2019 so that you can go into it and see it was only one specific region.\u201d\n\nWhat does other data show?\n\nat a skin clinic at the\n\nhospital in Enugu found that 58.7% of patients, most of them (75%) women, were using skin lightening products. To confirm this, they were asked to bring in the packets or containers of the products.\n\n, 64% of those interviewed said skin bleaching was \u201chighly predominant\u201d in Nigeria. The poll was of 1,000 phone-owning Nigerians who the researchers said had been \u201crandomly selected\u201d.\n\nThey said the results backed up the WHO\u2019s finding \u201c\n\nthat Nigeria has the highest number of women that use skin-lightening products in the world\u201d.\n\nFinding reliable information on skin lightening in Nigeria is difficult, Prof Yetunde Olumide, who has studied the practice, told Africa Check.\n\nShe pointed out problems in studies made so far, including the ones discussed in this report.\n\n\u201cIn some studies, participants were recruited at hospitals and clinics, and many of the studies included small sample sizes. These selection biases may limit \u2018generalisability\u2019 of findings.\u201d\n\nStudies in hospitals may have overestimated skin bleaching prevalence, she said. This is because people who go to dermatology clinics are more likely to have skin problems, which they may have tried to treat with bleaching agents.\n\nAnd many studies relied on participants to self-report, which may have skewed the findings.\n\nThis data problem is made worse by a lack of awareness that many products contain harmful ingredients, while labels might not show the product\u2019s chemical composition.\n\nAdded to all this was a fear of being stigmatised, Olumide said.\n\nMany skin lightening products are unregulated and may contain harmful substances.\n\nSo there isn\u2019t a public health danger \u201cper se\u201d in overestimating their use, said\n\n\u201cOverestimation may lead to increased scrutiny by policy makers or such because there\n\na harm associated with [unregulated] product use,\u201d she told Africa Check.\n\nthat regulation is easier said than done.\n\nConclusion: No data currently supports claim that 77% of women in Nigeria use skin lighteners.\n\nGlobal media reports claimed 77% of Nigerian women regularly used skin lightening products, giving a World Health Organization factsheet as the source of the figure.\n\nThe WHO\u2019s publication in turn said the 77% share came from a UN document. But the document didn\u2019t include the statistic.\n\nAfrica Check traced the statistic to a 1998 study of Lagos traders, published in 2002. It found that 77.3% (348) of 450 people surveyed had said they used skin lightening cosmetics.\n\nThe author of the study said the statistic only applied to these traders, not to all of Nigeria.\n\nThere is little other data on the use of skin lighteners in Nigeria.\n\nThe products are potentially harmful and the unsafe ones banned. So overestimating their use may not be a public health danger, an expert said.", "lang": "en"}
