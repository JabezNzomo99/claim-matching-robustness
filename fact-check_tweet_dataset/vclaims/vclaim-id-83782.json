The image is a doctored version of a generic CIA certificate available online from a printing store.\n\nThe doctored certificate was shared in a November 25 Facebook post with a caption saying: \u201cLooks like Dr Musadik Malik of PMLN (Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz) is a CIA agent.\u201d\n\nThe image has also been shared on Twitter and through WhatsApp messages.\n\nHere is a screenshot of a photograph of Malik and the doctored certificate being shared on WhatsApp:\n\nMalik is a close aide of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.\n\nA Google reverse image search showed that the certificate is an edited version of a generic CIA certificate that is available for sale online for $19.95 through this website.\n\nThe version in the misleading Facebook post has been edited to insert Malik\u2019s name and the \u201cKabul, Afghanistan\u201d location has been deleted.\n\nThe code of numbers running across the bottom of the doctored certificate is identical to the code of numbers on the certificate on the printing shop website.\n\nThe date on the two certificates -- 6 September, 2010 -- is also the same.\n\nOther versions of the doctored certificate have appeared online, for example here on Twitter with the name of Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan.", "lang": "en"}
