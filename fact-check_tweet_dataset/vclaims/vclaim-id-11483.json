Five months hence, Canadian author of Pakistani origin Tarek Fatah has tweeted the same image captioned as \u2013 \u201cNo, the Mullah is not playing \u2018knots & crosses\u2019. He is teaching Muslim girls in an Indian Islamic school the comparative superiority of Islam over Hinduism.\u201d In less than two hours, his tweet was retweeted nearly 700 times.\n\nAlt News reverse searched the image and found that it was from an April 10, 2018 report that depicts a Madrasa named Darul Uloom Husseini in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh.\n\nMany news organisations had reported the story and carried the original photograph, out of which an article from Outlook reported, \u201cThis Madrasa has become a centre for modern education, where along with Arabic and English, Sanskrit is also taught (translated from Hindi)\u201d. It further states, \u201cThe speciality of this Madrasa is that Sanskrit is being taught by a Muslim teacher. Probably, this is the first time ever that Sanskrit is also being taught in Madrasa\u201d. The original image can be seen below.\n\nANI had tweeted a few other photographs of the Madrasa in April 2018.\n\nAlt News has reported several instances in the past where Tarek Fatah has spread misinformation on social media. From claiming that a girl was assaulted for not wearing a hijab to falling for fake news on 2,000 Rohingya Muslims joining ISIS, Fatah has contributed significantly to the online misinformation system.", "lang": "en"}
