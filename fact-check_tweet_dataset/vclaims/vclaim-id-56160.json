But after news broke in April that the payments could be delayed to accommodate adding President Donald Trump\u2019s name to the checks, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed disgust at the decision.\n\n\"Delaying direct payments to vulnerable families just to print his name on the check is another shameful example of President Trump\u2019s catastrophic failure to treat this crisis with the urgency it demands,\" she said in a statement on April 15.\n\nAn image of Pelosi posted on Facebook that same day makes it appear that she had more to say about the matter.\n\n\"If you accept a check from Trump, you might as well vote for him,\" reads the quote printed on her picture.\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
