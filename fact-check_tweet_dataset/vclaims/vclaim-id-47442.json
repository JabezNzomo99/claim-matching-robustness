The claim appears to have originated on a satire website.\n\nNASCAR banned Confederate flags at its events and properties June 10 after Bubba Wallace, the sole Black driver in NASCAR\u2019s top circuit, called on the organization to do so. His call came following national unrest after George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died in Minneapolis police custody, according to ESPN.\n\nThe Facebook post appears to reference Wallace, who competed in a race June 10 at Martinsville Speedway in a special Black Lives Matter-themed car.

Had the organization done so, it would have been picked up by major media outlets, yet none have reported on it. Nor is there a statement on NASCAR\u2019s website announcing such a policy change.\n\nThe claim appears to stem from an article, titled \u201cNASCAR Prohibits MAGA Hats, \u2018Political\u2019 Clothing,\u201d published on Daily World Update. The website Daily World Update describes itself as part of a \u201cnetwork of parody, satire, and tomfoolery,\u201d and its articles include disclaimers informing readers of its satirical nature.\n\nNASCAR spokesman Mike Forde confirmed to The Associated Press that, except for the Confederate flag ban, people at NASCAR events can wear the political clothing that they want.", "lang": "en"}
