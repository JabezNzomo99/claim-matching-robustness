And no one could argue with such a decision,\" Spicer is quoted as saying in the story.\n\nThe story claims Spicer shared this information in a press briefing media outlets were banned from airing, in which he also announced Trump was sending his thoughts and prayers to the victims of a U.S. Navy ship wreckage and of a terrorist attack in London.\n\nThe press conference the post references indeed took place, on June 19. While it was not televised, a transcript was shared on the White House website. Spicer did offer the White House\u2019s condolences to the victims and said Mueller\u2019s fate was in Trump\u2019s hands, but he never suggested the president holds the power to disband the Supreme Court.\n\nIn fact, the Supreme Court was not mentioned during the briefing.\n\nThe story manipulated Spicer\u2019s quote that \"everyone who serves the president serves at the pleasure of the President,\" referring to the fact that Mueller\u2019s superior, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, ultimately answers to the president. The Supreme Court, however, does not.\n\nThe checks and balances put in place by the U.S. Constitution are designed to ensure equilibrium of power between the legislative, executive and judicial branches \u2014 that means one branch can\u2019t just shut down another.\n\nThe Constitution prohibits the president from firing a justice, much less all nine of them, or disbanding the institution they represent. It also hands power over to the courts to decide on the legality of an executive action.\n\nThe president may nominate Supreme Court justices, court of appeals judges and district court judges, although these must be vetted by the Senate. Neil Gorsuch is the only Supreme Court justice Trump has appointed so far.\n\nThe website that published the story did not respond to a request for comment, but it does contain a disclaimer published in the \"about us\" tab.\n\n\"USPOLN may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don\u2019t necessarily exist,\" the disclaimer reads. \"These articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.\"\n\nWhile some of the details about the press conference are correct, Spicer\u2019s comments about the presidential ability to disband the courts is complete and total baloney.\n\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
