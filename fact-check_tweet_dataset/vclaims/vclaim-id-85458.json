We were given access to the data under the understanding that the details would not be published and that we only use information that is publicly available or confirmed by the companies involved.\n\nThe claimed $110 billion in military sales has aroused great skepticism among experts, with Bruce Riedel of the Brookings Institution calling the claim \u201cfake news.\u201d He noted that most of the publicly announced items had been previously announced by the Obama administration and that there appeared to be few, if any, signed contracts. Rather, many of the announcements were MOIs \u2014 memorandums of intent.\n\nThe $110 billion list indicates that the delivery dates for many items are far in future \u2014 in some cases as late as 2028. Billions of dollars in bombs are scheduled for delivery in 2022. The list also includes at least $7 billion in sustainment agreements that ordinarily are not included in such announcements. Defense expert William Hartung said that including sustainment would have increased the value of President Barack Obama\u2019s deals. His research indicates that Obama offered Saudi Arabia $115 billion in deals, about half of which resulted in actual sales.\n\nAnother oddity is that some key elements have not been officially announced. Boeing said it\u2019s on track for as much as $50 billion in deals, including a plan to negotiate the sale of up to 16 commercial jumbo jets worth as much as $5 billion. Lockheed Martin said its deals amount to $28 billion, almost half of which are commercial items. But other big-ticket items on the list have not been announced, and few if any contracts appear to have been signed.\n\nThe spreadsheet suggests potentially huge deals for Raytheon, but a spokesman for the weapons and defense electronics manufacturer said only: \u201cThe MOU [memorandum of understanding] with Saudi Arabian Military Industries and our establishment of Raytheon Arabia are in their early days. We fully anticipate this work will enable us to expand our business in the Kingdom with new programs that will benefit both local and U.S.-based job growth.\u201d\n\nJones said the Blackhawk deal was part of the $110 billion in military sales, but it is listed as a commercial item in the White House spreadsheets (the helicopters will be manufactured and assembled in Saudi Arabia). A Lockheed spokesman said the agreement would \u201csupport\u201d 200 jobs at the company in Connecticut and another 250 through \u201cthe supply chain\u201d in North America, indicating these are not new jobs in the United States.\n\nFor instance, a huge chunk of the total \u2014 $100 billion \u2014 refers to a technology investment fund set up by SoftBank and Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, of which the Saudis were contributing $45 billion. But that fund was announced three weeks before the U.S. elections, when Trump was regarded as having little chance of winning. Softbank has said that $50 billion would be invested in the United States, so the $100 billion figure appears to be a double-count.\n\nAnother $40 billion comes from a Blackstone partnership with the sovereign wealth fund for infrastructure investments in the United States, though the State Department valued the Saudi investment as $20 billion in its news briefing. The official announcement made it clear the deal was still a long way from fruition: \u201cBlackstone and the Public Investment Fund (PIF) signed a nonbinding memorandum of understanding for the project, which will depend on further negotiations.\u201d\n\nCloser to home, ExxonMobil Chemical and Saudi Basic Industries. selected a site in Texas for a petrochemical project. This had already been announced in April. News reports said the project would cost $10 billion, but it is listed as being worth $22 billion in the White House document. In March, Trump had already claimed credit for ExxonMobil\u2019s $20 billion in investments in the Gulf Coast, even though they had been announced in 2013.\n\nBut a review of the deals shows that many deals are not concluded and are simply aspirational. Moreover, many of the investments are in Saudi Arabia, making it difficult to argue that these will create many jobs for Americans. Other deals, such as the SoftBank fund and ExxonMobil Chemical deal in Texas, had been announced months earlier and thus are not appropriate for inclusion on a list of achievements from the president\u2019s visit.", "lang": "en"}
