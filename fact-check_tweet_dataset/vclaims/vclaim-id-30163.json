Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of that claim.\n\n\n\nClaim: Protestors faking injuries with bandage over Hijab to play the victim card. Fact: The people in the images were portraying victims & showing solidarity with those who were injured during protests. One protest was held in solidarity with victims of pellet guns in Kashmir while the other was held in solidarity with Minhajuddin, a Jamia Student who lost an eye during the CAA protests. Hence the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe post has a screenshot of a tweet and that tweet can be found here. When the four photos in the tweet were subjected to Google reverse image search, they were found to be of persons portraying as victims who were injured during protests.\n\nThe images (1, 2 & 3) are that of Kashmiri doctors and paramedics with their eyes covered by patches to emulate the plight of victims of pellet guns who were injured during the protests in Kashmir sparked after the death of Burhan Wani in August 2016.\n\nThe last photo shows one of the protestors who wore bandages over an eye in solidarity with Minhajuddin, a Jamia student who lost an eye during the CAA protests. Earlier, when the same image went viral with the same claim of \u2018protestor faking injuries\u2019, FACTLY has debunked it and the fact check article can be found here.\n\nThe method of protesting by portraying the victims is not new. Many people around the world protest against various actions by dressing up to portray the victims. The news articles regarding those protests can be read here, here, here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, the people in the images weren\u2019t faking injuries. They were portraying victims who were injured during protests against some actions.\n\nDid you watch our video on the 10 Most Ridiculous Fake News of the Year 2019?", "lang": "en"}
