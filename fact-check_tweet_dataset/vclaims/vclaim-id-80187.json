This claim was proven fake after he appeared on a noontime television show aired live.\n\nMultiple websites, such as this one,reported that Vice Ganda, a highly popular cross-dressing comedian, was dead.\n\nWhen the reports are shared on Facebook, they are accompanied by a thumbnail image made to look like a still from a televised news report. The headline on the image reads: \u201cVice Ganda dead after he was shot in the head, as captured on CCTV\u201d.\n\nClicking on the link on Facebook leads to an online post with a different headline: \u201cVice Ganda, dead after he was carjacked in front of his house earlier - CCTV Report.\u201d\n\nSome of the sites carrying the reports also used URLs that gave the appearance of being linked to genuine, well-known news sites, such as \u201cwrappler.info\u201d, wrappler.info/#buyaem/535483, which is very similar to online Philippine news site www.rappler.com.\n\nDozens of false reports stating that Vice Ganda had died have been shared at least 90,000 times on Facebook in one week. They are apparently aimed at driving traffic to the sites and boosting their advertising revenue.\n\nHowever, since the reports surfaced online Vice Ganda has appeared in his noontime show \u201cShowtime,\u201d which is aired live on local broadcast network ABS-CBN.", "lang": "en"}
