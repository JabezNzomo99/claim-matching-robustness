It is also being claimed that, even after 75 years, the U.S. cannot even sell a needle in Japan. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: The U.S. is not allowed to sell any item in Japan as the attacked the country in 1945 by throwing a nuclear bomb. Fact: Japan was the fourth largest export market for the U.S. in 2019. On the \u2018Office of the United States Trade Representative\u2019 website, it can be read that the U.S. goods exports to Japan in 2019 were US$ 74.7 billion. Hence the claim made is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for \u2018US-Japan Trade\u2019 on Google, a link to the \u2018Office of U.S. Trade Representative\u2019 website was found in the search results. According to information provided on the website, the quantum of trade between the countries was around US$ 303 billion in 2019. Imports from the U.S. were around US$ 123.4 billion worth of goods and services (Goods \u2013 US$ 74.7 billion and Services \u2013 US$ 48.7 billion) in the case of Japan in 2019. Some of the goods imported by Japan from the U.S. in 2019 were mineral fuels, aircraft, optical and medical instruments, machinery, and electrical machinery. Also, a similar claim was dunked by FACTLY in March 2019.\n\nSimilar US-Japan trade statistics were also found on the \u2018Ministry of Finance \u2013 Japan\u2019 website.\n\nAlso, it is found that \u2018Amazon\u2019 (an American multinational technology company) is one of the most popular e-commerce websites in Japan. Many US companies\u2019 products can be found listed on the website.\n\nTo sum it up, Japan imports around US$ 74.7 billion worth of goods from the U.S. The Japanese citizens do buy goods from the U.S.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
