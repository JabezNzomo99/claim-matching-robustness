Giuliani said that Trump had repaid Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen to silence Daniels who alleges she had an affair with Trump in 2006.\n\nWhile the clickbait headline by The Political Voice could create the impression that Giuliani resigned from Trump\u2019s legal team, that\u2019s not the case. The story said that Giuliani resigned from his law firm, Greenberg Traurig.\n\nGiuliani took an unpaid leave of absence from the firm\u2019s New York office in April and then in May resigned to focus on his work as one of Trump\u2019s personal lawyers on the Russia investigation.\n\nRichard A. Rosenbaum, executive chairman of Greenberg Traurig, confirmed in statements to the media that Giuliani resigned.\n\n\"After recognizing that this work is all-consuming and is lasting longer than initially anticipated, Rudy has determined it is best for him to resign from the firm,\" he said.\n\nA headline said \"Official: Rudy Giuliani officially resigns, Trump\u2019s legal team on it's last leg.\" That headline creates the misleading and inaccurate impression that Giuliani quit Trump\u2019s legal team. In reality, he quit the Greenberg Traurig law firm to devote more time to his work for Trump. We rate this claim False.", "lang": "en"}
