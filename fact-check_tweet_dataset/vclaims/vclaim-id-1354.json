Colonel Allen West was present at the event and strongly disputed media accounts of the exchange, which began with a question from a Retired American Warriors town hall attendee:\n\nGood morning Mr. Trump. As you mentioned there is a tragic suicide epidemic among our veterans, among our military and their families. While the military and the V.A. are working on the problem, their efforts continue to fall short. There are a number of faith-based programs outside the DOD and the V.A., that are continuing to be successful in stopping suicide and divorce rates. Spiritual fitness works on these types of problems. The government is not taking advantage of these programs and services. So my question for you is, when you become president, will you support and fund a more holistic approach to solve the problems and issues of veteran suicide, PTSD, TBI and other related military mental and behavioral health issues and will you take steps to restore the historic role of our Chaplains and the importance of spiritual fitness and spiritual resiliency programs?\n\nTrump\u2019s complete response focused largely on committing to an increase in veterans\u2019 services, not on deriding disabled veterans. He indeed flattered \u201cfolks in this room\u201d for being \u201cstrong,\u201d but he also expressed empathy at length for those military personnel who had experienced \u201chorror stories\u201d which \u201cnobody would believe\u201d:\n\nYes I would. Look we need that so badly and when you \u2026 when you talk about the mental health problems, when people come back from war and combat and they see things that maybe a lot of the folks in this room have seen many times over and you\u2019re strong and you can handle it. But a lot of people can\u2019t handle it. And they see horror stories. They see events that you couldn\u2019t see in a movie, nobody would believe it. Now we need a mental health help and medical. And it\u2019s one of the things that I think is least addressed and is one of the things that \u2014 like your question \u2014 one of the things that I hear the most about when I go around and talk to the veterans. So we\u2019re going to have a very, very robust, level of performance having to do with mental health. We are losing so many great people that can be taken care of if they have proper care. You know when you hear the 22 suicides a day it\u2019s a big part of your question. But when you hear the 22 suicides a day that should never be. That should never be. So we\u2019re going to be addressing that very strongly and the whole mental health issue is going to be a very important issue when I take over and the V.A. is going to be fixed in so many ways but that\u2019s going to be one of the ways we\u2019re going to help. And that\u2019s in many respects going to be the number one thing we have to do. Because I think it\u2019s really been left behind. OK? Thank you very much.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks (at approximately the 0:55 minute mark) were not derisive: he maintained that veterans\u2019 mental health care was one of the issues he felt was \u201cleast addressed,\u201d and he held that he commonly received similar questions when meeting with service members.\n\nMost critical reporting on the event elided Trump\u2019s key contextual assertion that \u201cwe\u2019re losing so many great people that can be taken care of if they have proper care,\u201d So while it\u2019s true Trump described present veterans as \u201cstrong\u201d during the town hall event, he didn\u2019t also describe veterans dealing with mental health issues as weak or unfit.", "lang": "en"}
