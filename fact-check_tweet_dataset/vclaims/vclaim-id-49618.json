Rumors about Jawaharlal Nehru has always been a hot topic and best seller on social media. The latest in this line is a photo with Nehru\u2019s alleged quote \u201cI am English by education, Muslim by culture and Hindu by accident\u201d. In our fact check we found that this claim is absolutely wrong. The quote going viral in the name of Jawaharlal Nehru was actually said be Hindu Mahasabha leader N B Khare.\n\nWe started our investigation and found that this message was going viral on all social media platforms.\n\nWe searched this photo on Google Reverse Image, and found nothing. In order to extend our investigation, we searched this statement with keywords \u201cI am English by education, Muslim by culture and Hindu only by accident\u201d. In this search, we found a copy of the Hyderabad edition of the Deccan Chronicle newspaper, in which the statement was printed on 18 November 2018 stating this quote attributed as Nehru\u2019s statement.\n\nWe also found a copy of Deccan Chronicle news paper published on November 25 in which the paper had printed a correction and had apologized for mistake. They wrote \u2018The quote, \u201cI am\u2026 a Hindu only by accident of birth\u201d, was erroneously attributed to Jawaharlal Nehru on the \u2018360\u2019 page published on Nov 18. It was an allegation made by Hindu Maha Sabha leader N.B. Khare in 1959. We deeply regret the error\u201d. The screenshot of clarification and apology from Deccan Chronicle can be seen below.\n\nIn this explanation, N.B. Khare\u2019s name can be seen prominently. Basis this, we took our investigation forward and we found that viral statement can be found in the book written by historian Bal Ram Nanda, The Nehrus: Motilal and Jawaharlal. According to Nanda\u2019s book, NB Khare, leader of the Hindu Mahasabha, said \u201cNehru is English by education, Muslim by culture and Hindu by accident\u201d.\n\nIn the same investigation, we found Shashi Tharoor\u2019s book, Nehru: The Invention of India. The viral quote is mentioned in this book and it says that NB Khare had given this statement to spoil Nehru\u2019s image.\n\nThis post was recently shared by Facebook user Vedika Arya. We searched her profile on Stalkscan. Vedika Arya\u2019s Facebook intro is \u201cI am a Hindu saint\u2026. seculars should stay away from my ID. Om\u2026 Jai Sri Ram\u201d. She has a total of 1,093 followers on Facebook and she is a resident of Kaithal, Haryana.\n\nConclusion: In our investigation, we found that the post going viral in Nehru\u2019s name is wrong. It was not Nehru who gave this quotation. In fact Hindu Mahasabha leader NB Khare had said that \u2018Nehru is English by education, Muslim by culture and Hindu by accident\u2019.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
