In the letters, it is mentioned that a processing fee/legal charge must be paid so that the loan amount can be handed over. Let\u2019s check the authenticity of the letters.\n\nBefore checking the authenticity of the letters, let\u2019s understand a bit about the PM MUDRA Yojana (PMMY). On the MUDRA (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency) website, it can be read that \u2018the scheme was launched by the Prime Minister on April 8, 2015 for providing loans up to 10 lakhs to the non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises. These loans are classified as MUDRA loans under PMMY. These loans are given by Commercial Banks, RRBs, Small Finance Banks, MFIs and NBFCs. The borrower can approach any of the authorized lending institutions or can apply online through this portal www.udyamimitra.in. Under the aegis of PMMY, MUDRA has created three products namely \u2018Shishu\u2019, \u2018Kishore\u2019 and \u2018Tarun\u2019 to signify the stage of growth/development and funding needs of the beneficiary micro unit/entrepreneur and also provide a reference point for the next phase of graduation/growth\u2019. A detailed article by FACTLY regarding the PMMY scheme can read here.\n\nVarious people across the country have received similar MUDRA loan approval letters on their respective names. Some of those letters can be seen here, here, here, here, and here. There are a lot of clues in the letters which suggest that they are fake. Let\u2019s look at each of them one by one.\n\nIt can be seen that the design of the letterhead varies in the letters. The logos of \u2018EMI Finance\u2019 and \u2018Mudra Loan\u2019, and the watermarks are not consistent. Also, it can be seen in some letters that the logo of PMMY mentions \u2018True stories of achievement\u2019, which is picked up from the success stories page on the official MUDRA website.\n\nNeither \u2018Mudra Finance Private Limited\u2019 nor \u2018Mudra Finance Limited\u2019 can be found in the \u2018List of Partner institutions shortlisted to be partners of MUDRA\u2019. Also, there is no \u2018National Financial Corporation Act 1956\u2019, which is mentioned in the letter.\n\nIn one of the documents on the MUDRA website, it can be read that \u2018banks may consider charging an upfront fee as per their internal guidelines. The upfront fee/processing charges for Shishu loans are waived by most banks\u2019. For example, on the SBI website, it can be seen that the processing Fee is nil for Shishu and Kishore loans to MSE Units and for Tarun loans, it is 0.50% (plus applicable tax) of the loan amount. But the processing charges given in these letters are not uniform in the approval letters. For the same loan amount, the processing fee given is different.\n\nThere are a lot of other inconsistencies and grammatical mistakes in the letters, which are very rare in official bank letters. The account details given in the letters for depositing the processing/legal fee are different in each letter. The company addresses and the helpline numbers are also not the same. Most of the given phone numbers are not working. FACTLY (posing as a borrower who received a similar letter) was able to talk to a person on one of the phone numbers. The person on the phone demanded the mentioned amount (which he said will be refunded) to be deposited in the given account number so that the loan amount can be disbursed.\n\nThe official website of \u2018MUDRA\u2019 is \u2018https://www.mudra.org.in/\u2019. But, in one letter, a website address \u2013 \u2018www.financemudra.net\u2019 is given, which is not working now. The archived version can be seen here. In another letter, there is a website \u2013 \u2018http://mudrapmyojana.com/\u2019. The phone number given on the website is also invalid. On looking about the website on \u2018who.is\u2019, it was found that the website was registered recently in May 2020 and the phone number given for registering the website can be found on another website \u2013 \u2018Tata Fianance\u2019 (Another dubious website which was registered recently in March 2020). So, it is not a government website. The official website mentions that the borrowers can file an online application for MUDRA loans on Udyamimitra portal.\n\nAlso, many people across the country have complained on social media that they have received similar fake letters on WhatsApp. Some of them have also paid huge amounts and complained that they have been duped. Those complaint posts can be read here, here, and here.\n\nTo sum it up, these \u2018MUDRA Loan Approval Letters\u2019 asking borrowers to pay processing fee/legal charge for loan disbursement are fake.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
