Roy Cooper had vetoed", "author": "www.politifact.com", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-55372", "url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/sep/17/various-media-reports/nc-democrats-not-911-event-during-gop-budget-vote/", "vclaim": "Months earlier, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper had vetoed a GOP-authored state budget proposal. So, when Republican House Speaker Tim Moore noticed that many Democrats were absent that morning, he shocked political opponents by holding a vote to override Cooper\u2019s veto.\n\nNews of the vote spread across the internet like a bad game of telephone. Key details of the vote went missing, or were exaggerated.\n\n\"Republicans in North Carolina used a 9/11 memorial to trick Democrats into missing a key vote,\" the NowThis news service, which has 2.4 million Twitter followers, tweeted that day.\n\nThe tweet was later shared by Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic U.S. senator from Massachusetts who\u2019s running for president. She has 3.2 million followers.\n\n\"What happened today is beyond unacceptable. Calling a surprise vote on the budget \u2014 at the same time that many members were at 9/11 memorial services \u2014is flat-out wrong,\" NC Rep. Chaz Beasley, a Mecklenburg County Democrat, tweeted. Beasley paraphrased reporting by WTVD.\n\nThe Washington Post tweeted a misleading headline, too: \"North Carolina Republicans overrode a budget veto while Democrats were at a 9/11 ceremony.\"\n\nWhile the News & Observer\u2019s story and headline \u2014 NC House overrides budget veto in surprise vote with almost half of lawmakers absent \u2014 were accurate, the Raleigh-based newspaper posted a partly erroneous caption on Instagram: \"Most Democrats were absent for 9/11 ceremonies and were told there would be no vote during the morning session.\"\n\nBut these claims about the budget vote on Sept. 11 all get one thing wrong: Most Democrats weren\u2019t at a 9/11 memorial service.\n\nPolitiFact NC, which has had a reporter covering the story since the Sept. 11 vote, found only one House Democrat who said he was at a 9/11 event. That Democrat is Rep. Garland Pierce, who said he attended a 9/11 memorial event in Raeford.\n\nNo other Democrat has come forward \u2014 not after Speaker Moore slammed what he called \"fake news,\" and not after PolitiFact NC reached out to Rep. Darren Jackson, the House minority leader, to ask if other Democrats attended a 9/11 event.\n\nMost Democrats skipped the Sept. 11 morning session because they believed it would be a non-voting session, Jackson said in a press conference last week.\n\nThe budget was on the House calendar. But Jackson says Rep. David Lewis of Harnett County, a top Republican, told him there\u2019d be no votes that morning.\n\nLewis denies Jackson\u2019s claim. He has acknowledged texting a WRAL reporter to tell her he thought there would be no votes during the Wednesday morning session. But Lewis claims he didn\u2019t relay that prediction to legislators.\n\nBeasley, a Mecklenburg County Democrat who\u2019s running for lieutenant governor, later corrected his claim.\n\n\"One correction: at least one member, Garland Pierce, was attending a 9/11 memorial service, as was the Governor. The article originally noted that some members were, but it has since been updated. I hate that this budget fight has distracted from the true focus of 9/11,\" he tweeted later, sharing the WTVD story that had been updated.\n\nThe N&O corrected its Instagram post. The Washington Post also tweeted a clarification: \"An earlier version of this article overly generalized the reason for Democrats\u2019 absence from the General Assembly session. The story has been updated.\"\n\nBut some tweets and stories remain inaccurate. As of Tuesday morning, the NowThis tweet had been shared more than 700 times and got 1,600 \"likes.\"\n\nVarious media outlets said NC Democratic legislators were at a 9/11 memorial service when Republicans held a controversial budget vote. PolitiFact is aware of only one Democrat besides Gov. Cooper who claimed to be at a 9/11 event. We rate this claim False.\n\nThis story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab and PolitiFact.
