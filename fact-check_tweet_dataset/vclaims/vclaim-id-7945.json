Users of the social media site flagged it as potentially false. It is.\n\nAlthough the bogus story claims that Freeman made the remarks during a press tour in New York to promote his new documentary series, there is no record of him saying anything about Clinton going to jail.\n\nIn fact, the series, called \u201cThe Story of Us with Morgan Freeman,\u201d is intended to bridge the differences between people and reduce factionalism. In one recent interview, Freeman said, \u201cThe point of the show, the point of telling people about people, is so that we can, on some level, reduce the amount of tension between people who don\u2019t know each other.\u201d\n\nHe is not quoted anywhere outside of the made-up story as saying that President Donald Trump was elected specifically to \u201clock that bitch up!\u201d\n\nThere is one genuine quote in the story, though. Freeman made a promotional video for the Committee to Investigate Russia, a recently formed organization that aims to educate the public about the Russian cyber threat.\n\nIn that video, he says: \u201cWe need our president to speak directly to us and tell us the truth. We need him to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office and say, \u2018My fellow Americans. During this past election, we came under attack by the Russian government. I\u2019ve called on Congress and our intelligence community to use every resource available to conduct a thorough investigation to determine exactly how this happened.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not the first time that he\u2019s lent his iconic voice to political projects. Freeman also narrated campaign advertising for Clinton in 2016, and he did the voice-over for her biographical video at the Democratic National Convention, as well.\n\nIn 2012, Freeman also gave $1 million to Priorities USA Action, a Democratic super PAC that helped to re-elect President Barack Obama, and then worked to elect Clinton four years later.\n\nThe made-up story about Freeman is one more is a series that have claimed various celebrities are taking conservative stances.\n\nAnother popular story claimed that actor Kevin Bacon lavished praise on Trump. He didn\u2019t.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nDmitry, Baxter. \u201cMorgan Freeman: \u2018Jailing Hillary\u2019 Best Way To Restore Public Faith In Govt\u2019.\u201d Your News Wire. 29 Oct 2017.\n\nLynch, John. \u201cMorgan Freeman talks Pussy Riot, the keys to longevity, and his new National Geographic show.\u201d Business Insider. 10 Oct 2017.\n\nCommittee to Investigate Russia. \u201cMorgan Freeman warns Russia is waging war on the U.S.\u201d InvestigateRussia.org. 18 Sep 2017.\n\nConfessore, Nicholas. \u201cHuge \u2018Super PAC\u2019 Is Moving Early to Back Clinton.\u201d New York Times. 23 Jan 2014.", "lang": "en"}
