Let\u2019s try to find the authenticity of that notification.\n\n\n\nClaim: Recruitment notification for 88,585 jobs in South Central Coalfields Limited (SCCLCIL), a subsidiary of Coal India Limited, has been released. Fact: Coal India Ltd. has issued a public notice stating that they do not have any subsidiary with the name \u2018South Central Coalfields Limited (SCCLCIL)\u2019 and called the job notification as \u2018fake, fraudulent and fabricated\u2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe full text of the recruitment notification being circulated on social media can be read here.\n\nWhen searched on Google about the notification, it was found that even prominent newspapers like Times Now News (archived link), India Today (archived link), News18 (archived link), First Post (archived link) and DNA India (archived link) have also posted that SCCLCIL, a subsidiary of Coal India, is recruiting for over 88,000 posts.\n\nIn the notification, it is given that the applicants should apply on the SCCLCIL website: http://scclcil.in. But that website shows an error message when it is opened (as of 20 August 2019). So, when searched for the notification on the Coal India Ltd. website, it was found that Coal India Ltd. has issued a public notice stating that they do not have any subsidiary with the name \u2018South Central Coalfields Limited (SCCLCIL)\u2019 and called the job notification as \u2018fake, fraudulent and fabricated\u2019. They also asked the public \u2018not to fall prey to this dubious employment notice\u2019. The same notice was also uploaded by Coal India Ltd. on its Twitter account.\n\nTo sum it up, SCCLCIL Recruitment notification offering 88,585 jobs is fake. There is no subsidiary of Coal India Ltd. with that name.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
