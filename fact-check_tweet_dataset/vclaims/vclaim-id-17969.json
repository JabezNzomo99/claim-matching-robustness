To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\n\nAccording to an article in Slate, the photos adorning Kaepernick\u2019s shirt were taken during an historic September 1960 meeting between Malcolm X and Fidel Castro in Harlem, New York. Some observers, notably Cuban-Americans, have taken Kaepernick to task for expressing tacit approval of Castro, an unrepentant communist dictator whose own human rights record isn\u2019t exactly a shining beacon of liberty.\n\nThis is what Orlando Sentinel reporter George Diaz, whose family fled Cuba in 1961, had to say:\n\nThere is no question that racial inequality needs to be a topic of conversation in the United States. But that gets us back to Cuba, where such conversations can get you in prison. My family left there in 1961. We left our home, our furniture, most of valuables and our relatives behind because we were seeking freedom. It wasn\u2019t for money, nor the opportunity to visit Disney and Universal. We wanted to be free, and the United States, bless its soul, gave us that opportunity. So yes, I find it personally insulting that Kaepernick is oblivious to the fact that Castro is one of the most vile dictators of modern times with extensive human rights violations.\n\nContrary to what some sources have claimed, Kaepernick did not discuss his national anthem protest during this press conference.", "lang": "en"}
