But there\u2019s no evidence he ever said it.\n\nA popular meme revived on social media puts words in the mouth of President Theodore Roosevelt.\n\n\u201cTo anger a conservative, lie to him,\u201d the quotation reads. \u201cTo anger a liberal, tell him the truth.\u201d\n\nThat supposed quotation has circulated online for years \u2014 and others have tried to pass it off as the words of the late United Kingdom Prime Minister Winston Churchill or conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh.\n\nThe attribution to Roosevelt was promoted recently by the prominent young conservatives group Turning Point USA in the form of a Facebook meme with a caption that, ironically, reads: \u201cSO MUCH TRUTH! #BigGovSucks.\u201d\n\nThe group, known for supporting President Donald Trump, has more than 1 million followers on its verified Facebook page.\n\nBut there is no evidence the 26th president ever made that remark, and experts on Roosevelt cast doubt on its veracity.\n\nSharon Kilzer, project manager for the Theodore Roosevelt Center at Dickinson State University, told us in an email that the center is \u201ccontinually challenged by sayings attributed to [Roosevelt], for which we may or may not be able to identify a source.\u201d\n\nKilzer said it\u2019s difficult to \u201cdefinitively\u201d say that Roosevelt \u201cdid not say something,\u201d but she said the quotation \u201cis one we have not encountered in Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s speeches and writings.\u201d\n\n\u201cI question its validity, as the terms \u2018liberal\u2019 and \u2018conservative\u2019 were not used to describe opposing political views in early 20th century America,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe term \u2018progressive\u2019 was used more readily than \u2018liberal,\u2019 and \u2018conservative\u2019 did not mean what it does today. I don\u2019t believe Theodore Roosevelt would have used this rhetorical juxtaposition.\u201d\n\nRoosevelt was a Republican who rose from vice president to the presidency in 1901 following the assassination of President William McKinley. He was reelected in 1904.\n\nBut some of his policies \u2014 including his focus on income inequality, government regulation and conservationism \u2014 align with the agenda of today\u2019s Democratic party.\n\nIn 1912, Roosevelt again sought the presidency, challenging the Republican incumbent, President William Howard Taft, because he believed Taft was not progressive enough. Republicans renominated Taft, but then Roosevelt ran in the general election under a newly formed Progressive Party, or the \u201cBull Moose Party.\u201d Democrat Woodrow Wilson ultimately won that election.\n\nSidney Milkis \u2014 a professor in the Department of Politics at the University of Virginia, who co-authored the book Theodore Roosevelt, the Progressive Party, and the Transformation of American Democracy \u2014 also questioned the idea that Roosevelt said the quotation in question.\n\n\u201cI have never seen this, and doubt very much it is authentic,\u201d Milkis said in an email. Roosevelt \u201ccalled reformers Progressives, and ran [as] a third party candidate on the Progressive Party ticket. Not until the New Deal was the dimension of conflict between liberals and conservatives.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just social media posts that have wrongly attributed the quotation to Roosevelt.\n\nIt appeared, for example, in a December 2016 opinion piece about the 2016 election in the literary magazine the New Criterion. The relevant section mentioning Roosevelt was in turn republished by the Wall Street Journal and cited in a reader\u2019s submission to the Morning Call in Pennsylvania.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
