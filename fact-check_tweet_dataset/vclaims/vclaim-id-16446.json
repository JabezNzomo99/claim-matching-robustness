Only for a brief period in the last half-century has the government balanced the budget and even earned a surplus. That was during the Bill Clinton administration in the late 1990s, largely because of a combination of fiscal discipline and a gusher of revenue spawned by the dot-com revolution.\n\nPaul has long been a fan of the \u201cpenny\u201d plan \u2014 the idea that the budget could quickly be balanced if only a penny out of every dollar \u2014 1 percent of spending \u2014 were cut every year. When challenged by CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer about the potential size of the military cuts in his budget, Paul made it sound so painless \u2014 $13 billion a year in total spending cuts, a virtual rounding error in a $4 trillion budget. But Paul is offering his own smoke and mirrors. Let\u2019s explore.\n\nIt turns out that, first of all, Paul would repeal the recent spending deal passed by Congress and signed into law. That would wipe out more than $137 billion in spending in the first year, which obviously is far more than $13 billion a year. He would be resetting the entire budget.\n\nOn top of that, Paul\u2019s reference to $13 billion was only regarding discretionary spending. (One percent of $1.3 trillion in discretionary spending is $13 billion.) But the federal budget is mostly mandatory spending, for programs such as Medicare and Social Security, so after the $137 billion whack in 2019, Paul would cut between $30 billion and $31.5 billion each year.\n\n\u201cWhen Senator Paul is saying 1 percent is $13 billion a year, he is just giving an illustrative example of how this could be applied to discretionary spending,\u201d Hawes said. \u201cThere is no assumption on how Congress would achieve the necessary reduction in spending, so we cannot make an assumption about how the cut would break out between mandatory and discretionary.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not the same as simply believing that the dollars spent or raised remained the same. Inflation and population growth over time raises the cost of programs, while a growing economy will result in more taxes being collected. If you earned the same salary year after year, eventually you would feel pinched as costs for groceries and housing rise.\n\nHere\u2019s our favorite example of this phenomenon: Defense spending technically remained constant from 1987 to 1994: $282 billion a year. But look what happened to the military during those seven years: The number of troops fell from 2.2 million to 1.6 million, the number of Army divisions was reduced from 28 to 20, Air Force fighter wings dropped from 36 to 22 and Navy fighting ships declined from 568 to 387. That\u2019s because inflation over time ate away at the value of those dollars. By most measures, defense spending was trimmed in that period, although in theory, not a penny was cut.\n\nWhen Paul says he\u2019s just cutting $13 billion a year in discretionary spending \u2014 or $30 billion a year including mandatory spending \u2014 he\u2019s ignoring not only the fact that he would wipe out the recent spending bill; he\u2019s acting as if there is no baseline and 1 percent can be easily cut from the previous year\u2019s budget. But it\u2019s not really 1 percent; it\u2019s 1 percent plus the impact of inflation and population growth. Look at what happened to the military when spending was constant in raw dollars over seven years \u2014 and now imagine cutting even more.\n\nHawes, in defending Paul\u2019s statement, cited a study written by staff members at the St. Louis Reserve Bank that found CBO\u2019s forecasts \u201chave a troubling level of inaccuracy, which is magnified and made worse with each additional year. It makes much more sense to look at each year\u2019s cut/increase relative to the prior year instead of CBO\u2019s projections.\u201d (The study mainly faulted CBO\u2019s deficit forecasts. In terms of expenditures, the study found the CBO had the biggest misses in discretionary and defense spending, in part because of Congress\u2019s habit of passing supplemental spending bills that CBO could not predict.)\n\nHawes said that using a baseline of prior year\u2019s spending is \u201cintellectually honest and more accurate.\u201d He added that \u201cbaseline adjustments are often characterized by the budget community, the media, and partisans on both sides of the aisle as gimmickry.\u201d As for whether Paul\u2019s remarks were misleading, he said: \u201cYou\u2019re discounting our explanation to fit your wrongful conclusion.\u201d\n\nPaul is free to use whatever baseline he wants. But he should not go on television and pretend that the budget reductions envisioned in his budget are so small \u2014 or relatively painless. A \u201c1 percent cut\u201d is far more than $13 billion, even under Paul\u2019s math. And when adjusted for a baseline that takes into account population growth and inflation, it\u2019s trillions of dollars. His remarks on national television are highly misleading and worthy of Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
