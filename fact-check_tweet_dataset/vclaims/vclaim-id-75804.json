Castro said this action left Patrick out of step with Texas Democrats and Republicans who, he suggested, are more supportive of immigrants regardless of origin.\n\nPatrick, the Houston state senator in a May 27 runoff with incumbent David Dewhurst for the GOP lieutenant governor nomination, replied: \"No, mayor. That\u2019s a lie.\" Asked to elaborate, Patrick said: \"First of all, that bill, which didn\u2019t pass, would have only \u2026 come into play had police had suspicions that someone had committed a crime and then\" they would \"turn it over to\" the federal Immigration Customs Enforcement agency, he said, \"to try to keep us in line with Secure Communities,\" the program enabling fingerprints of arrested individuals to be checked against federal crime and immigration databases.\n\nPatrick further said he\u2019d decided, \"based on things the federal government has done, that that bill will not pass and will not be effective.\"\n\nWe wondered if indeed Patrick filed an Arizona-type \"show-me-your-papers\" proposal.\n\nLooks like it.\n\nBy email, Castro spokesman Jaime Castillo quoted Patrick\u2019s measure, which died without a hearing in the 2011 legislative session, and said it was similar to a vital part of Arizona\u2019s law.\n\nAs recapped by Castillo, Patrick\u2019s legislation specified: \"A peace officer shall inquire into the lawful presence of any person who is lawfully stopped, detained, or arrested on other grounds if the officer has a reasonable suspicion to believe the person has violated a criminal provision of the federal immigration laws (sic).\"\n\nCastillo said Arizona's law \"included language authorizing police officers to check immigration status if they have reasonable suspicion to believe that someone is here illegally and, before\" court rulings \"to arrest without a warrant, anyone \u2018the officer has probable cause to believe \u2026 has committed any public offense that makes the person removable from the United States.\u2019\"\n\nLet\u2019s look at both.\n\n, signed into law in April 2010, included provisions intended to \"work together to discourage and deter the unlawful entry and presence of aliens and economic activity by persons unlawfully present\" in the country.\n\nA key element of the law--which included state-level restrictions on human smuggling and workers congregating in search of day jobs--directed law officers at all levels to check the status of people stopped for various reasons who might appear to be in the U.S. illegally. Another section said the immigration status of arrested individuals must be checked before their release. The law also provided for officers to transport individuals lacking proof of legal residency to federal authorities.\n\nGenerally, as noted in a , the law required legal immigrants to carry papers that confirmed their legal status, though the U.S. Supreme Court later threw out parts of the law that would have made state crimes out of federal immigration violations, by The Associated Press in June 2012. According to the AP\u2019s account, the court rejected the law\u2019s mandate that immigrants obtain or carry immigration registration papers. It also tossed language making it a state criminal offense for an illegal immigrant to seek work or hold a job, the AP said, and voided a provision permitting police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without warrants.\n\nThe court let stand the law\u2019s requirement that police officers check the status of people stopped for various reasons who might appear to be in the U.S. illegally. Even then, the AP reported, the justices said the provision could be subject to additional legal challenges. Also, they removed some teeth by prohibiting officers from arresting people on immigration charges.\n\nAccording to a Texas , Patrick filed his measure, SB 126, on Nov. 8, 2010 in anticipation of the 2011 legislative session. The proposal called for revising the state\u2019s Code of Criminal Procedure by specifying that a \"peace officer shall inquire into the lawful presence of any person who is lawfully stopped, detained, or arrested on other grounds if the officer has a reasonable suspicion to believe the person has violated a criminal provision of the federal immigration laws.\"\n\nIf the officer has \"probable cause\" to believe as much, the officer could arrest the person and \"shall identify and report the person to\" ICE, the proposal said. Also, Patrick\u2019s measure voided any local ordinance, regulation or policy interfering with an officer carrying out the described duty, furthermore giving legal immunity to an officer, agency or other governmental entity for any cause of action connected to carrying out such duties aside from intentional misconduct, recklessness or gross negligence connected with the intended law.\n\nAt the time, news stories said Patrick had filed a proposal like the show-your-papers part of the Arizona law, though Patrick stressed in interviews that police officers would be required to ask a person if they were in the state legally only if they reasonably suspected otherwise. A Nov. 13, 2010, news story in the San Antonio Express-News quoted him as saying law agencies wanted the question to be required, instead of being optional, to avoid complaints of profiling.\n\nIn January 2011, Patrick separately told the Associated Press and an MSNBC host that he\u2019d been to Arizona to see its law in action. Patrick said on MSNBC: \"It's workable for our police. And then once a police officer says to someone, are you legally present, because they don't have any identification, we then give the discretion to the officer to take the next step. Is that an arrest, is it detaining that person on suspicion of another possible crime?\"\n\nLogan Spence, Patrick\u2019s lieutenant governor campaign manager, replied to our query about Patrick\u2019s proposal with an email suggesting Patrick\u2019s proposal was more narrow than the entire Arizona statute. By phone, Castillo said Castro didn\u2019t say in the debate that Patrick filed the entire Arizona law.\n\nPatrick\u2019s unsuccessful proposal was similar to, and modeled on, Arizona\u2019s show-your-papers provision. We rate this claim as True.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
