With a lot of noise coming from the cells nearby, Levashov was sleep-deprived and looked bone-tired. He wasn\u2019t allowed to shower, or time for a walk in the prison yard,\u201d Topolsky added.\n\n\u201cLevashov was isolated to be reviewed and evaluated for protective custody,\u201d Karen Martucci, the acting director of external affairs for the Connecticut Department of Corrections, told Polygraph.info. Martucci and a U.S. Marshal Service official confirmed that Levashov initially was placed in protective custody for his own safety while he was being evaluated, which they say is a typical procedure.\n\nDeputy Brian Taylor of the Marshal Service denied Levashov was in solitary confinement.\n\nLevashov arrived in the U.S. on February 2, after he was extradited from Spain. The U.S. Justice Department and media reports indicate he is accused of running a botnet that took over 100,000 devices that then distributed viruses, ransomware and phishing e-mails.\n\n\u201cThe reports in the (Russian) media are not matching up,\u201d Martucci added, referring to the reports on Levashov\u2019s incarceration conditions.\n\nAccording to the Russian officials, Levashov was prescribed medication for a cold but never received it. Martucci disputes that claim, referring to U.S. privacy laws that prevent her from commenting on an inmate\u2019s medical conditions. Topolsky claimed that Levashov was not provided with proper bedding or allowed to shower.\n\n\u201cHis basic needs were met,\u201d said Martucci.\n\nLevashov was first placed in the state prison in Bridgeport, where the Russian consulate officials visited him on February 6. About one day after the Russian visit and the media inquires into the situation he was moved to the state\u2019s New Haven Correctional Center. Officials say he is now in the general prison population, not confined to a cell.\n\nThe Connecticut Department of Corrections press officer said she was not aware of the reasons behind Levashov\u2019s transfer to New Haven, however, mentioned, that they were not certain whether he will stay there permanently.\n\n\u201cI am not certain,\u201d said Karen Martucci, spokesperson for the Connecticut Department of Corrections, \u201cbut if he were to be moved again, it would be driven by need.\u201d The Bridgeport and the New Haven correction centers are identical \u201cintake\u201d facilities that house pre-trial suspects without bond.\n\nIn a follow up statement on its Russian Twitter feed, the Russian consulate took credit for \u201cbetter conditions,\u201d although state prison officials are unclear that was the reason for any changes.\n\nA 1990 U.S. Department of Justice study of the management of protective custody in American prisons found that the top reasons for placing inmates in single cells for protective custody were that they were gang members, institutional informants or notorious criminals.\n\nAlthough the study is more than two decades old, it seemed to confirm some of the Russian claims regarding Levashov\u2019s \u201cprotective custody,\u201d particularly the size of his cell. The average size of a single cell in protective custody, according to the study, was 70 square feet or about 2.5 square meters. Consular officials said he was in a two-meter-square cell.\n\nThat study also found that only 53% of single occupancy cells had outside windows, 73% of cells had toilets and 43% had lighting controlled by the inmate.\n\nWhile TASS and Sputnik reported the Russian Consulate sent a note to the U.S. State and Justice departments, Topolsky said he only communicated with Connecticut officials. He said Sputnik did not seek comment but only published information taken from other media sites.\n\n\u201cWe did not send a note to the Department of Justice,\u201d Topolsky told Polygraph.info. \u201cWe sent a request to the management of the correctional facility.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
