Joe Biden said 150 MILLION were lost to gun violence AND we just lost ANOTHER 120 million to covid-19. So I\u2019m reaching out to my friends to see if ANY of you are still alive\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook).\n\nThis is obviously a joke, but it raises a question about Biden\u2019s comments. Did he really claim both of those statistics at some point?\n\nYes, Biden made these claims on two separate occasions, though for one he corrected himself immediately.\n\nBiden made the claim regarding the U.S. COVID-19 death toll on June 25, 2020, at a campaign event in Pennsylvania. He was talking about health care coverage with families.\n\nAn ABC News Facebook Live video shows an attendee at the event mentioned the stress she felt over finances in addition to stress from hospital treatments, and how it all lowered her already low mental health at that time. Biden answered he intended to invest in mental health.\n\n\"That\u2019s why we have a major multibillion dollar investment in mental health,\" Biden said. \"What people drastically underestimate is the impact on the mental health of people who now, everything is complicated. People don\u2019t have a job. People don\u2019t have anywhere to go. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do.\"\n\nHe went on to say \"Now we have over 120 million dead from COVID, I mean, 120,000 dead from COVID,\" according to audio obtained by Snopes.com.\n\nBiden made the gun violence claim in the final Democratic primary debate on Feb. 25, 2020, in South Carolina, where he said that 150 million Americans died since 2007 due to gun violence.\n\n\"In addition to that, I passed the Brady Bill with waiting periods. I led that fight. But my friend on my right,\" Biden said, gesturing to U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, \"and others have in fact also gave in to the gun manufacturers absolute immunity. Imagine if I stood here and said we give immunity to drug companies. We give immunity to tobacco companies. That has caused carnage on our streets; 150 million people have been killed since 2007 when Bernie voted to exempt gun manufacturers from liability. More than all the wars, including Vietnam, from that point on.\"\n\nSo, the Facebook post is correct in that he made these claims, though it omits the date range Biden used and doesn\u2019t give Biden credit for immediately correcting the COVID data error.\n\nIn both cases, Biden or his staff acknowledged he intended to say thousands, not millions.\n\nAs Biden noted a moment after referencing millions of COVID deaths the current death toll remains in the thousands. As of June 25, 2020 when he made this statement, the death toll was more than 119,000, according to the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center dashboard.\n\nOn the gun violence claim, a member of Biden\u2019s campaign said Biden meant to say 150,000 people. Biden has previously referenced that stat correctly.\n\nData from the CDC shows from 2007 to 2018 there were 148,182 firearm homicides.\n\nA Facebook post said Biden said 120 million Americans died from COVID-19 and that 150 million Americans died from gun violence since 2007.\n\nBoth of those numbers are drastically wrong. Biden meant to say \"thousands\" in both cases, not \"millions.\"\n\nThe post is correct that Biden did make these claims, but after misstating the COVID stat he immediately corrected himself, a detail the post omits.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
