No, that's not true: the story was made up by a fake news site designed to look like a local news website. It is part of a larger network of sites that regularily posts fake stories set in various towns and cities in the United States. None of the stories are real.\n\nThis one appeared in an article published by usdaily-news.com on January 7, 2019 titled \"Elgin, IL: White woman gives birth to a black child and blames the coffee her husband drinks\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe events occurred last Thursday at the Advocate Sherman Hospital, where a young woman, white and 24 years old, gave birth to a beautiful child who weighed 4.2 kg.

The setting of the events is often some small town somewhere in the United States and in many cases the main illustration used is a picture found on the internet showing a police car from the local police force or a sign with the town's name on it. The same story is often re-used by changing the location and/or names of the people involved.\n\nThis particular story seems to have been copied from satirical website There Is News which had a big hit with it last year:\n\nTheir version went viral to such an extent that it made BuzzFeed News' list of top viral hoaxes of 2018. Analysis by Lead Stories revealed no fact checking sites debunked the story last year:\n\nThis is also not the first time fake stories from the network were set in Elgin, here are some earlier examples:\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes usdaily-news.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
