A jawan rescued an elephant\u2019s baby -translated). The caption purports that a baby elephant was rescued by the army during Kerala floods.\n\nGujarati edition of the same newspaper Divya Bhaskarhad also published the image on August 23, 2018.\n\nIndividual users have circulated the image as well, one Facebook user John Morris posted the same image on August 20, 2018.

An article published by the BBC on December 29, 2017 quoted Sarathkumar saying, \u201cThe caller informed me that a female elephant was blocking the road near the Vanabhadra Kaliamman temple.\u201d The BBC report further states that Sarathkumar and his colleagues managed to drive the elephant back in to the jungle using fire crackers. Scouting for other elephants in the area, the team came across a calf stuck inside a small ditch. They realised the calf was the reason for the female elephant\u2019s distress. However, the calf was too weak to walk.\n\nSarathkumar was further quoted saying, \u201cWe wanted to take it to the other side of the road to reunite it with its mother. But there was a danger of being attacked as she was still nearby. So, instead of all four of us being put at risk, I decided to carry the calf by myself across the road.\u201d\n\nThe faux pas by Dainik Bhaskar was first discovered by Twitter user Sneh Bhavsar.\n\nA baby elephant was rescued near Athirapally, Thrissur in Kerala on August 13, 2018. However, this was not the same one as reported by Dainik Bhaskar. In an article published by The News Minute on August 16, 2018, an image of the rescued elephant is provided. \u201cIn a heartwarming rescue operation, the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) officials closed down the shutters of a dam to save a baby elephant from drowning in the overflowing river,\u201d stated the report.\n\nWe have observed a lack of due diligence from many reputed media organisation while reporting Kerala floods.
