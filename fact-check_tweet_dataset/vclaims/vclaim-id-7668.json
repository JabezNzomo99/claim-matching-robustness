Among T-shirts available on the website, for example, are options for those supporting Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign (\u201cMake Liberals Cry Again,\u201d one says) and, yes, some for voters hoping Michelle Obama will seek the presidency in 2020.\n\nBut there\u2019s no evidence that Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has \u201cgiven Michelle Obama his full support for a 2020 Presidential run by placing full page \u2018Michelle Obama for President\u2019 ads on the Amazon website,\u201d as Your News Wire claimed in a story shared on Facebook.\n\nThe May 28 article, headlined, \u201cJeff Bezos: Michelle Obama Will Be Our Next President,\u201d also has been reproduced as videos on YouTube.\n\nThe false statement about Bezos is not supported by the rest of the story, which was copied wholesale from a post on The Unz Review that doesn\u2019t say Bezos published ads supporting an Obama candidacy. Instead, that website asked: \u201cWhy is Amazon running a full [web] page of \u2018Michelle Obama for President\u2019 T-Shirts?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that such shirts are available on Amazon, where individuals and businesses sell millions of products to customers. The specific Obama T-shirt pictured on Your News Wire and Unz Review has been sold by the online shop Brave New Look since September 2015, according to the product description. The company, one of the many independent vendors on Amazon, sold shirts with the same design for Obama\u2019s supporters during the 2016 election.\n\nIn fact, as of May 31, a search for \u201cMichelle Obama 2020\u201d on Amazon produced 471 results for shirts, socks, mugs and other items being sold by different vendors. But those product listings don\u2019t mean that Bezos is advertising for Obama, or urging her to run for president.\n\nOn the same day, a search for \u201cDonald Trump 2020\u201d on Amazon returned more than 600 results, including shirts, magnets and \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats. We also found 2020 T-shirts on the site for Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey. That doesn\u2019t mean Bezos is backing them as presidential candidates, either.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Obama has said she has no intentions of running for the highest office \u2014 a fact that receives only a passing mention in the Unz Review and Your News Wire posts (\u201cShe says she\u2019s not interested, but I\u2019m not buying it,\u201d the author says).\n\nIn April, at the Simmons Leadership Conference, Obama said: \u201cThe reason why I don\u2019t want to run for president \u2026 is that, first of all, you have to want the job. You just can\u2019t say, \u2018Well you\u2019re a woman, run.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never had the passion for politics, I just happened to be married to somebody who has the passion for politics,\u201d she added. \u201cJust because I gave a good speech and I\u2019m smart and intelligent, doesn\u2019t mean that I should be the next president.\u201d\n\nAnd while Bezos and Trump have publicly criticized each other over the years, we could find no record of the Amazon chief making any public remarks about the former first lady potentially challenging the president in the next election.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\nAdl-Tabatabai, Sean. \u201cJeff Bezos: Michelle Obama Will Be Our Next President.\u201d Your News Wire. 28 May 2018.\n\nWhitney, Mike. \u201cWhy Is Amazon Running a Full Page of \u201cMichelle Obama for President\u201d T-Shirts?\u201d The Unz Review. 25 May 2018.", "lang": "en"}
