It is the Holi Ritual of enlightenment to feel the Magical Existence of Holi Jesus at the end of the act.\u201d While posting the screenshot, one Facebook user Rajesh Anubhav commented, \u201c\u092d\u093e\u0908 \u0924\u0930\u094d\u0915 \u0924\u094b \u0932\u093e\u091c\u0935\u093e\u092c \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u094b\u0930\u094d\u091f \u0928\u0947 \u092d\u0940 \u092e\u093e\u0928 \u0932\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e? (Brother\u2019s logic is amazing. Did the court also agree? -translated)\u201d. Franco Mulakkal, a bishop with a Jalandhar diocese, accused of raping a nun at a convent, will be reportedly facing trial at a Kerala court this November.\n\nA few more users on Facebook shared the image with an identical narrative.\n\nAlt News had earlier debunked this fake quote ascribed to Mulakkal in September 2018. Parody handle Unpaid Times was the first to tweet the screenshot that carried the quote attributed to the Bishop. The Twitter biography of Unpaid Times clearly states that it is an \u201cIndian Satirical News Website\u201d. However, as it happens ever so often, many people fall for such satire and circulate the information believing it to be true.\n\nIn 2018, Madhu Kishwar had also tweeted the screenshot. The tweet has still not been deleted.\n\nIn conclusion, a screenshot attributing a fake quote to rape-accused Franco Mulakkal that was first shared by a parody handle is again circulating on social media.", "lang": "en"}
