Social media posts claimed his unmistakable, sometimes ironically worn \" \" hats are not made in the USA.\n\nHere\u2019s an example from , which was picked up by on Facebook:\n\nMade in China?! Say it ain\u2019t so, Donald.\n\nHold onto your plastic snap enclosure. It\u2019s not true.\n\nThe hat that launched a barrage of snarky social media posts after its July debut at campaign event has also launched a host of imitations.\n\n\"The image you shared is not an official campaign product,\" Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told PunditFact in an email. \"All product for sale on DonaldJTrump.com is made in the USA.\"\n\nHicks confirmed a couple of other facts about the authentic Trump campaign hat, sold for in patriotic and camouflage shades at the campaign store.\n\nThe hats are made by Cali Fame of Los Angeles, which makes the brand. Trump\u2019s hat is based on the , and no surprise, it\u2019s been a bestseller this year, though not a bestseller of all time. Cali Headwear co-owner Brian Kennedy told us that hats his company made for Von Dutch and Ed Hardy sold better.\n\nOh, and they are made in the USA.\n\nKennedy\u2019s company, which his family has owned since 1977, has been making this style since the 1970s. Trump has been wearing it and selling it on his golf courses for years, but it\u2019s been big with the hipster market since the summer (well, so has the \" ,\" he said).\n\n\"It\u2019s just the same old story that what goes around comes around,\" Kennedy told us by phone from inside his factory, machines whirring in the background.\n\n\"But there\u2019s news every day on the hat,\" he added.\n\nFrom there, the hats are distributed by Ace Specialties LLC, a Lafayette, La., company that normally deals with gear for the oil and gas industry.\n\nAce Specialties president and owner said she had seen a similar meme on Facebook, \"and that\u2019s not even his hat.\"\n\n\"Definitely everything on our side is made in the USA,\" said Mahfouz, who is also on the board of the Eric Trump Foundation, the philanthropy started by one of Trump\u2019s sons for children with terminal illness.\n\nA few years back, before he entered politics as a candidate, there was more truth to claims that Trump gear was not made in America.\n\nFormer Late Show host David Letterman brought out a number of buttoned shirts and slick ties from the Trump brand clothing line for Macy\u2019s (which dumped him after his fiery statements about Mexicans in July) in a 2011 interview.\n\nLetterman pointed out that his ties and shirts were made in China, according to the label. At the time, Trump was supporting Republican Mitt Romney for president and had been accusing China of taking American manufacturing jobs.\n\nTrump smirked as the crowd cheered before he defended himself, saying \"it\u2019s very hard to get product that\u2019s not made in China\" because of the country\u2019s currency manipulation.\n\nTweets aim to paint Trump as a hypocrite for hawking \"Make America Great Again\" hats with \"Made in China\" labels from his campaign store.\n\nThose hats are knockoffs. Trump has even trademarked the phrase \"Make America Great Again.\" Trump\u2019s hats are made by a California company that says they are, indeed, American made.\n\nWe rate the claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
