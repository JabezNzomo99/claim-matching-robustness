A new study may produce a more accurate number for children newly infected with HIV in Nigeria. \n\n\n\nUnder the headline \u201cNigeria highest producer of HIV-infected babies\u201d, the\n\nreported on a new project to prevent the virus from being passed from HIV-positive mothers to their babies.\n\nmother-to-child transmission of HIV as the transmission of the virus from an HIV-positive mother\n\no her child during pregnancy, labour, delivery or breastfeeding.\n\nAdewole told Africa Check he was referring to UNAids data which showed that in 2016, Nigeria had\n\n(26.9%) of new mother-to-child HIV infections among the organisation\u2019s 23 priority countries.\n\n\u201cThis was based on available data at the time using the existing figures for national HIV prevalence, total population, fertility rates and the actual coverage of antenatal care and HIV services,\u201d he said.\n\n, told Africa Check the organisation uses such data to feed into statistical modelling software.\n\nFor 2016, UNAids estimated that 37,000 children younger than 15 were newly infected with the virus in Nigeria. Mozambique followed with 9.6% of new infections (13,000 children) and South Africa with 8.6%, or 12,000 children.\n\nBut the estimated number of newly infected children in Nigeria could be as low as 22,000 or as high as 56,000. This is because researchers need to make more assumptions when it comes to estimating the number of infections in children,\n\n\u201cFor example, the ranges around the estimates of adult HIV prevalence are smaller than those around the estimates of HIV incidence among children, which require additional data on prevalence among pregnant women and the probability of mother-to-child HIV transmission, each of which have their own additional uncertainty,\u201d the method document states.\n\nThough the data is for children younger than 15 and not just babies, Ekanmian said UNAids believed other modes of infection \u201ccause a small fraction of the overall number of children acquiring HIV\u201d.\n\nBut more accurate data may soon be available.\n\nurrently, Nigeria is conducting one of the biggest surveys globally, known as the Nigeria HIV/Aids impact and indicator survey, which is expected to have a preliminary data early 2019,\u201d Ekanmian said.\n\nFrank Lule, the regional adviser on HIV/Aids at the\n\nsaid the survey would probably show that mother-to-child transmission was lower than the rates reported before. This was because in the past, census data was used to estimate the number of children born to HIV-positive women and this tended to increase the number of children thought to have contracted HIV from their mothers.\n\nDr Awoyemi Abayomi, a senior lecturer in the department of biological sciences at the\n\n, said lack of awareness was one reason for Nigeria\u2019s high mother-to-child transmission rate.\n\n\u201cNigerian women infected with HIV are not aware of the necessary precautionary measures to take before, during and after pregnancy. To correct the statistic, there is the need to tackle this issue.\u201d\n\nfound that in 2007 only\n\nof Nigerian women had been tested for HIV and knew their status. This figure fell to 11%\n\nConclusion: In 2016 Nigeria had the highest number of newly infected HIV-positive children out of 23 countries\n\nReporting on the launch of a new project to prevent HIV from being passed from mothers to their babies, Sun newspaper said Nigeria was \u201cthe highest producer of babies infected with HIV\u201d.\n\nUNAids data shows that in 2016, Nigeria had the\n\nhighest share (26.9%) of new mother-to-child HIV infections out of 23 priority countries. It estimated that 37,000 children younger than 15 were newly infected with the virus.\n\nBut because data on HIV in children is uncertain, this number could be as low as 22,000 or as high as 56,000.\n\nNigeria is currently conducting one of the world\u2019s biggest HIV/Aids impact studies. This may provide a better picture of HIV infection in the country\u2019s children.", "lang": "en"}
