No, that's not true: It is one of a series of fake reports based on a 2013 press release by discredited \"birther conspiracy\" advocate Orly Taitz, a California lawyer and dentist. The original allegation concerned Obama's attendance at New York's Columbia University.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on March 15, 2019 titled \"Whistleblower: Obama Was Indonesian Citizen & Given Financial Aid As Foreign Student At Occidental College - DC Dirty Laundry\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe change from Columbia University to Occidental brings with it an obvious flaw in this hoax. The purported whistleblower was supposedly on the staff at New York State's Higher Educaction Services Corporation, a real agency that for decades has assisted students in lining up college financial aid. But only New York State students are eligible for the help, not those from Hawaii -- where Obama graduated from high school -- or in California.

As a citizen of Indonesia he is not eligible to be the U.S. President,\" Taitz wrote. Lead Stories could find no references to such a person making such allegations beyond the Taitz claim.\n\nTaitz explained that while Hathaway promised to follow up with the documents, she mysteriously disappeared while under government surveillance. \"Intimidation and harassment of the whistle blower Laurie Hathaway by Holder Department of Justice and Mueller/Comey FBI is akin to the intimidation of citizens by the Hitler NAZI Gestapo or SS troops,\" Taitz wrote.\n\nTaitz did file a lawsuit in Orange County, California, in 2012, in an attempt to force Occidental to release Obama's student records, but it was rejected by the court. The school's student newspaper, The Occidental Weekly, reported at the time that Superior Court Judge Charles Margines told Taitz when tossing her suit \"You should know that evidence is not stuff printed from the Internet.\"\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes dcdirtylaundry.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
