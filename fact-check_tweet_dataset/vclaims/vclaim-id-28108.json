I think that\u2019s just about fairness. It\u2019s not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters before leaving for a NATO Summit in London, Trump said Zelensky\u2019s comments \u201cshould end everything\u201d with the impeachment probe.\n\nZelensky\u2019s comments were not as definitive as Trump proclaimed.\n\nWe reached out to the White House to ask which of Zelensky\u2019s statements Trump was referring to, but we got no response. Here, however, is Zelensky\u2019s response to the question about U.S. security aid to Ukraine and a quid pro quo:\n\nReporter: When did you first sense that there was a connection between Trump\u2019s decision to block military aid to Ukraine this summer and the two investigations that Trump and his allies were asking for? Can you clarify this issue of the quid pro quo? Zelensky: Look, I never talked to the president from the position of a quid pro quo. That\u2019s not my thing. \u2026 I don\u2019t want us to look like beggars. But you have to understand. We\u2019re at war. If you\u2019re our strategic partner, then you can\u2019t go blocking anything for us. I think that\u2019s just about fairness. It\u2019s not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.\n\nZelensky also chided Trump for calling Ukraine a corrupt country, a characterization that he said sends a \u201csignal\u201d to the international financial community, \u201cBe careful, don\u2019t invest.\u201d Zelensky allowed that, \u201cAll branches of government were corrupted over many years, and we are working to clean that up.\u201d\n\nThose comments from Zelensky came in response to questions about how he views the role of the U.S. in the peace process between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nReporter: How do you see the U.S. role in the peace process? How has it changed in the last few months, and how do you see it going forward? Zelensky: First off, I would never want Ukraine to be a piece on the map, on the chess board of big global players, so that someone could toss us around, use us as cover, as part of some bargain\u2026 As for the United States, I would really want \u2013 and we feel this, it\u2019s true \u2013 for them to help us, to understand us, to see that we are a player in our own right, that they cannot make deals about us with anyone behind our backs. Of course they help us, and I\u2019m not just talking about technical help, military aid, financial aid. These are important things, very important things, especially right now, when we are in such a difficult position. The United States of America is a signal, for the world, for everyone. When America says, for instance, that Ukraine is a corrupt country, that is the hardest of signals. It might seem like an easy thing to say, that combination of words: Ukraine is a corrupt country. Just to say it and that\u2019s it. But it doesn\u2019t end there. Everyone hears that signal. Investments, banks, stakeholders, companies, American, European, companies that have international capital in Ukraine, it\u2019s a signal to them that says, \u2018Be careful, don\u2019t invest.\u2019 Or, \u2018Get out of there.\u2019 This is a hard signal. For me it\u2019s very important for the United States, with all they can do for us, for them really to understand that we are a different country, that we are different people. It\u2019s not that those things don\u2019t exist. They do. All branches of government were corrupted over many years, and we are working to clean that up. But that signal from them is very important. Reporter: Yet last week President Trump said on live television that Ukrainians are corrupt, and they steal money. Do you have a plan for changing his mind? Zelensky: I don\u2019t need to change his mind. During my meeting with him, I said that I don\u2019t want our country to have this image. For that, all he has to do is come and have a look at what\u2019s happening, how we live, what kinds of people we are. I had the sense that he heard me. I had that sense. At least during the meeting, he said, \u2018Yes, I see, you\u2019re young, you\u2019re new, and so on.\u2019\n\nBack in early October, Zelensky told reporters, \u201cThere was no pressure or blackmail from the U.S. I had no idea the military aid was held up [at the time of his July 25 call with Trump]. When I did find out, I raised it with [Vice President] Pence at a meeting in Warsaw\u201d on Sept. 1. (On the July call, Trump asked Zelensky to open up a corruption investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden, and to look into CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm hired by the Democratic National Committee to determine who hacked into its servers during the 2016 election.)\n\nBut at no point in this more recent conversation did Zelensky say, \u201cPresident Trump did absolutely nothing wrong.\u201d That may be Trump\u2019s interpretation of Zelensky\u2019s words, but it is not what the Ukrainian president said.", "lang": "en"}
