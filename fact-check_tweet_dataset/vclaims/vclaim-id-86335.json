He certainly was on the record as having supported an auto bailout when it was not tied to Wall Street. Sanders, meanwhile, has gone too far to suggest he cast a vote for the auto industry that actually would have made a difference; that particular legislation went nowhere.\n\n\u201cI learned I can\u2019t take the word of a president when, in fact, they assured me they would not use force. Remember the context. The context was the United Nations Security Council is going to vote to insist we allow inspectors in to determine whether or not they were producing nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction. They were not. What\u2019s the first thing that happened when we got elected? President Obama turned to me and said, get those troops out of there. I was responsible for getting 150,000 troops out of Iraq.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason for my saying not two steps now is it strengthens his hand, in my view, to say to all the members of the Security Council: \u2018I just want you to know, if you do not give me something strong, I am already authorized, if you fail to do that, to use force against this fellow,\u2019 \u201d Biden argued on the Senate floor.\n\nBush, in his book \u201cDecision Points,\u201d wrote: \u201cSome members of Congress would later claim they were not voting to authorize war but only to continue diplomacy. They must not have read the resolution. Its language was unmistakable: \u2018The President is authorized to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.\u2019 \u201d", "lang": "en"}
