General: Russian Military Jets Not Involved in Decisive Assaults on Aleppo", "subtitle": "One of Russia\u2019s top military officials said on December 9, 2016, that Russian military jets, which had been conducting military assaults on rebel forces in Syria on behalf of the regime, had not bombed the Aleppo area since October 18. Independent monitors say they have tallies showing otherwise.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "December 21, 2016", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-16879", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-bombing-aleppo-syria-rudskoy/28187450.html", "vclaim": "At a news briefing on December 9, 2016, Russian Lt. General Sergei Rudskoy told reporters that \u201cRussian aviation in the Aleppo area has not been used since October 18.\u201d\n\nRudskoy also said that gains in pushing Syrian rebels from Aleppo have been \"achieved by the Syrian ground troops.\u201d\n\nThat date is significant because on October 18, Russia and the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad instituted a humanitarian pause to allow for evacuations.\n\nBut independent groups monitoring air strikes on Aleppo and its surroundings dispute Rudskoy's statements and say the aerial pause by Syrian and Russian aircraft was short-lived.\n\nIn a December 15, 2016 e-mail to Polygraph.info, Chris Woods, the director of a London-based, not-for-profit, monitoring group Airwars said: \u201cClaims that Russia and the Assad regime have conducted no airstrikes on Aleppo city since October 18 are untrue.\n\n\u201cWhile we did see a steep temporary fall in Aleppo strikes, the first reports of attacks resumed on October 22,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA total of 299 alleged Russian civilian casualty events in Syria were tracked by Airwars\u2019 researchers between October 18th and December 12th 2016. Some 61 per cent of these (183 events) were reported for Aleppo city and the wider governorate. In total, between 659 and 883 deaths are alleged from these Aleppo strikes.\u201d\n\nAnalyst Jonathan Mautner at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington described in a December 15, 2016 e-mail to Polygraph.info how Russia's resumption of bombings in November were directed at rebel strongholds.\n\n\u201cRussia resumed its air operations against opposition-held districts of Aleppo City on November 15,\" he said. \"Russia ultimately used its air power in order to facilitate the advance of pro-regime forces into opposition-held Aleppo City beginning on November 26, conducting targeted airstrikes against the northeastern quarter of the city.\u201d\n\nAirwars' Woods told Polygraph.info that its daily airstrike logs are collected, in part, from ground observers, aid groups and others in Aleppo, along with social media postings.\n\nWoods said the website Syria News Desk, which has reporters across Syria, reported that on November 29 that \u201c28 civilians were killed and more than 40 others were wounded this morning, due to Russian warplanes targeting with parachute bombs the neighborhood of Bab al-Nairab under the control of the opposition in Aleppo.\u201d\n\nThe final weeks\u2019 waves of Russian airstrikes, according to Mautner, focused on Aleppo\u2019s residential areas.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, Russia also intensified its air operations against schools, markets, and other civilian infrastructure in opposition suburbs in Aleppo, punishing the opposition for its continued resistance in Aleppo City and precipitating its surrender on December 13,\u201d he said.\n\n\"In sum, ISW assesses that Russia has been conducting airstrikes against Aleppo City since November 15, notwithstanding activist or Russian claims to the contrary,\u201d Mautner said.\n\nA check by Polygraph.info of news reports in language found that while there have been occasional stories in Syrian state-run media of Syrian air attacks on the Aleppo region, Russian officials and Kremlin-backed media have not acknowledged Syrian or Russian air participation since mid-October.", "lang": "en"}
