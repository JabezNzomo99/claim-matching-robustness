Another 30% went to grammar schools while 19% went to comprehensives. Looking at the same group of people the Trust also found that 54% went to Oxford or Cambridge University.\n\nThe Sutton Trust didn\u2019t study all journalists in the UK though. It looked at who it considered were the top 100. It said this selection was \u201cbased upon deliberation by experts with professional experience.\u201d The journalists were also selected based on \u201ctheir perceived influence on the public debate, so are weighted towards the \u2018commentariat\u2019 in national newspapers, as well as newspaper editors.\u201d\n\nAcross England 7% of school pupils went to an independent school in January 2017, this proportion has been the same for at least the last 15 years.\n\nThis proportion isn\u2019t the same across the UK, for example in Wales it is much lower. 2% of pupils there went to independent schools in Jan 2016 (the latest figures available). In Scotland it was 4% in September 2016.\n\nWe\u2019ve written more about education types in other professions here.", "lang": "en"}
