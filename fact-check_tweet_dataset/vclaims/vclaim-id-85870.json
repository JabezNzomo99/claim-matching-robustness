Indeed, no one is alleging that Burger King deal is illegal, and so it\u2019s important to recall Judge Learned Hand\u2019s famous quote in 1934: \u201cAny one may so arrange his affairs that his taxes shall be as low as possible; he is not bound to choose that pattern which will best pay the Treasury; there is not even a patriotic duty to increase one\u2019s taxes.\u201d\n\nCritics say Weiss does not have the right background for the position. He built his career on international transactions, for one. They say appointing a Wall Street executive to the position would undermine efforts to regulate the financial industry. After all, his firm has been involved in corporate tax inversion deals that the Treasury Department, IRS and Obama want to stop.\n\nSupporters, including the White House, believe Weiss has the extensive knowledge in financial markets that is required for the job and allow him to interact with domestic and international investors. They point to a Center for American Progress report co-authored by Weiss, \u201cReforming Our Tax System and Reducing Our Deficit,\u201d to show his views on tax policies align with the administration\u2019s. But as opponents have pointed out, Weiss was one of 11 authors on the report, and there have been no other public indications of Weiss\u2019 political or policy leanings.\n\nWhile cross-border mergers for tax purposes are legal, the Obama administration has taken steps to reduce incentives for U.S. companies to invert. The Treasury Department and the IRS have asked Congress to pass anti-inversion legislation. But when it became clear Congress was not going to pass such legislation anytime soon, the Treasury Department announced plans to take away economic benefits for companies that invert for tax purposes.\n\nIt is correct that Lazard has advised on inversion deals. The firm has been an adviser on some of the largest corporate inversion deals in the past year. But such deals are a small portion of the company\u2019s total number of deals \u2014 5 percent of Lazard\u2019s \u201cannounced volume\u201d for the year ending in the third quarter of 2014, according to chief executive Kenneth Jacobs. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty comfortable that the driver of those transactions are strategic and have not significantly involved the tax consequences of the transactions,\u201d he added.\n\nIn August 2014, Burger King announced its $11 billion cross-border merger with the Canadian company Tim Hortons, known for its coffee and breakfast food. Weiss was one of the key advisers for the deal, which allowed Burger King to relocate its headquarters to Canada, where corporate tax rates are significantly lower. This deal became highly publicized and was criticized by many as yet another attempt by an American company to reincorporate overseas for tax benefits.\n\nIn 2013, Burger King\u2019s total revenue was $1.1 billion. How much would Burger King potentially save on corporate taxes? No one really knows, which is why the estimates vary widely, from under $10 million a year to significantly higher than that. (One estimate also adds in shareholder savings from capital-gains taxes to end up with a truly impressive figure, but concedes the potential range of outcomes in capital gains savings could be as little as $10 million.)\n\nAs our colleagues at the Wonkblog explained when the deal was announced, there were business benefits other than lower tax rates that Burger King stood to gain as a result of buying Tim Hortons. For example, Burger King had been looking for opportunities to grow its breakfast sales. Tim Hortons also had been looking to expand internationally. Burger King did not respond to The Fact Checker\u2019s requests for comment, but the company has said that any tax savings is not the key reason for the deal.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Weiss? The Burger King deal is the only Lazard-advised inversion that has been publicly linked to Weiss. He is reported to have set the deal in motion. There is no public record that he was involved in any other inversion deals advised by Lazard.\n\nWeiss\u2019 supporters have said he was not involved in the tax portion of the deal, and an examination of an insider report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission confirms this point: \u201cLazard did not express any view or opinion as to such tax elements or tax attributes. Lazard did not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might result from the transactions, nor did Lazard\u2019s opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which Lazard understood that Burger King Worldwide had obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
