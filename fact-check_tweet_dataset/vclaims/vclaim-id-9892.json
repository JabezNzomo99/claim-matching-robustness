Nope, that's not true, totally false and not even real. The old hoax was reposted by Facebook page U OK Hun today:\n\nThe linked story was an article published on August 7, 2017 from satire website Southend News Network titled \"ANGER as online shop opens selling HORSE BURKAS\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nMembers of the public have reacted with anger after an online store opened selling HORSE BURKAS and a number of other items of religious clothing aimed at farm animals. Al-Dobin Farmwear has been trading officially since July 1st 2017, and its founder Owzat Duya told Southend News Network that he was responding to 'huge demand' for the clothing. He said: 'I have been running a market stall for a number of years selling religious clothing, and since the start of 2017 I have had a number of requests for custom-made items of religious clothing for animals.' 'The horse burka is my most popular item, but we are very much a multi-faith enterprise.'\n\nBut Snopes already debunked this hoax in 2017:\n\nThe horses in the picture are merely wearing fly sheets and protective masks to avoid irritation from dust or insects. While you can indeed buy these kinds of items online they do not have a religious significance:\n\nThe \"U OK Hun?\" Facebook page is associated with the (now no longer active) website uokhun.uk which has been using the same Adsense account (\"ca-pub-7034506530409822\") as the Southend News Network. So it looks like the owners are trying to build up an audience and traffic on the page by reposting some of their old stories there.\n\nThe Southend News Network is a satirical site pretending to be a news organisation by the English coast in Southend. They have a disclaimer on their about page that reads (in part):\n\nSouthend News Network was originally started in October 2015 with no real aims or objectives in mind other than to add a satirical/spoof-like touch to issues that people are passionate about in Southend On Sea. Above all else, SNN is all about having the occasional 'dig' at the powers that be, as well a slightly bigger and more frequent 'dig' at certain elements of local media!\n\nSeveral of their stories have been mistaken for real news in the past and the site was recognized by the local authorities as an \"official news outlet\".\n\nWe wrote about southendnewsnetwork.net before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Southend News Network To Close After Losing European Subsidies Due To Brexit\n\u2022 Fake News: Government Did NOT Announces Every UK Home Must Have Gender-Neutral Toilet by 2021\n\u2022 Fake News: Corbyn NOT in New Anti-Semitism Row After Asking Man At Bus Stop: \"What time's the bus Jew?\"\n\u2022 Fake News: Government Did NOT Confirm All UK schoolchildren Must Learn Arabic Numerals (Only Now...)\n\u2022 Fake News: Chinese Restaurant Owner NOT Arrested Over Cat in Window Doing Nazi Salute", "lang": "en"}
