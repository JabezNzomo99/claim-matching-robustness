It combines footage of Trump touring a facility with audio of a podcaster impersonating Trump.\n\nThe video shows Trump wearing a mask in what appears to be a medical laboratory. In a banner at the bottom of the video, it says \u201cTrump off the record,\u201d along with the link to the conservative watchdog group Project Veritas website.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say \u2018health reasons,\u2019 these people don\u2019t care about their health,\u201d Trump is allegedly caught on hot mic saying. \u201cSo you have to say \u2018patriotism,\u2019 so I say \u2018patriotism,\u2019 and hopefully some of them wear the mask. I don\u2019t really care as long as they\u2019re here to vote. So I have to say \u2018be a patriot.\u2019 That\u2019s motivating these animals, OK? The people I call \u2018the hills have eyes\u2019 people.\u201d\n\nSocial media users widely shared the video as if it was genuine, despite it not appearing on Project Veritas\u2019 website. It was actually created by a parody Twitter account, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Twitter account Parodia News Network, which notes it is satirical in its bio, paired video of Trump touring on July 27 the FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies Innovation Center in Morrisville, North Carolina, with audio that belongs to comedian J.L. Calvin, according to CBS affiliate WUSA. Parodia News Network tweeted the edited video on July 29.\n\nCalvin confirmed to The Associated Press that the audio comes from an episode of his podcast \u201cMaking Podcasts Great Again.\u201d In the episode \u201c3 Champions of Rights,\u201d Calvin can be heard making the crude remarks in an impersonation of Trump at the roughly 22-minute, 46-seconds mark.\n\nThe footage appears to come from either CBS affiliate WNCN-TV or Fox Business. In those videos, Trump does not appear to speak much as he tours the FUJIFILM facility.
