And does he now face execution for this \"crime\"? No, that's not true: the story was made up by a satirical website that invents fake stories all the time.\n\nWorld News Daily Report published an article on April 11, 2018 titled \"China: Man faces execution after rubbing his penis on Mao Zedong's corpse\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nBeijing | A Chinese man faces execution after he took several pictures of himself and his genitals next to the embalmed corpse of Chairman Mao Zedong, reports the Beijing Express.\n\nJiang Chunhua, an employee of the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong, had been working at the facility for the past sixteen years before his arrest this week. Camera footage allegedly showed the former janitor desecrating the embalmed body of Mao Zedong, according to authorities. Chunhua admittedly took pictures of his genitals next to the leader \"as a joke\" and to \"impress his friends\" an official of the mausoleum told the press.\n\nWe were unable to locate a newspaper named Beijing Express so at least that part of the story can't be true. In addition the man pictured in the image that accompanied the article is actually Zhang Weiqiang, a Chinese scientist who got sentenced to prison over the theft of GMO rice recently:\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories.

All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al.
