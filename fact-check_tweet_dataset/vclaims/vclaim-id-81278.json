At each of these events, I talked to veterans about the incompetence and deplorable conditions that led to the death of at least 40 veterans in Phoenix, Arizona and suggest a systemic problem nationwide. Like all of you, I am outraged at these reports.\u201d\n\nThe report was highly critical of the VA, noting that \u201cas a result of using inappropriate scheduling practices, reported wait times were unreliable, and OIG could not obtain reasonable assurance that all veterans seeking care received the care they needed.\u201d But the most explosive allegation about the VA \u2014 that veterans had died because they could not get an appointment \u2014 was not proven.\n\nThat, in turn, was based on a letter to the OIG by a retired VA doctor, Sam Foote, that said that investigators knew of 22 veterans who died while on an electronic waiting list for appointments and that 18 more died while on waiting lists for consultations with specialists. CNN reported allegations by another whistleblower that records were changed to hide the fact that veterans died while waiting for care.\n\nBut there is a difference between allegations and facts. Certainly, when claims of this nature are made, it is worthy of congressional investigation and questioning. Many mainstream news organizations (such as The Washington Post) reported the figure as an allegation. As far as we can tell, Miller and many members of the House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs were careful to keep the caveats in place.\n\nBut it turns out that some lawmakers, as shown in the quotes above, went too far. The OIG investigators did find, after reviewing the records of 3,409 patients from a variety of sources, 44 patients who died while on the electronic waiting list. But just because someone is on a waiting list when they died does not mean they died because they were on a waiting list.\n\nSo, within the universe of more than 3,400 patients, only six patients died while experiencing significant delays in scheduling. But \u201cwhile the case reviews in this report document poor quality of care, we are unable to conclusively assert that the absence of timely quality care caused the deaths of these veterans,\u201d the OIG said.\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep these numbers in context. We have embedded below a briefing provided to congressional staff about the investigation, which offers more detail on the numbers than the report itself. Of the 3,409 unique cases examined, there were 293 deaths. A substantial percentage of those deaths \u2014 25 percent \u2014 were suicides. The six suspect deaths possibly related to scheduling amount to less than 2/10th of 1 percent of the deaths examined. All deaths related to substandard care amount to 6/10th of 1 percent.\n\nPerhaps you have not had a chance to read the report because what I read is a report that found that the majority of the veterans reviewed were on official or unofficial wait lists and experienced delays accessing primary care. The report confirms that PVAHCS senior administrative and clinical leadership were aware of unofficial wait lists and that access delays existed. Do I regret standing up for Phoenix veterans and their families? Absolutely not. If the media does not accurately portray the condemning nature of that report, and allows Phoenix VA leadership to walk out on their responsibility to serve the American people, I\u2019m deeply disappointed. The fact of the matter is that families, like yours and mine, deserve better than the poor quality of service they have and are receiving from the VA. The VA Office of the Inspector General is not the FBI or a local law enforcement agency so they cannot make a definite legal determination that the VA killed 40 people. That being said, they listed detailed circumstances behind 45 veteran deaths which reflect unacceptable and troubling lapses in follow-up, coordination, quality, and continuity of care. To begin to restore the faith of Arizona families in our system, the leadership at the Phoenix VA was rightfully replaced.", "lang": "en"}
