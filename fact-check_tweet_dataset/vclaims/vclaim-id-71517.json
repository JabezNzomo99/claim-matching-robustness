Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nNo, Ocasio-Cortez is not coming for motorcyclists. The story, and quotes within, are made up.\n\nThe post, which has nearly 700 comments and over 6,200 shares, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe website that posted the story, Taters Gonna Tate, describes itself as a subsidiary of America\u2019s Last Line of Defense network of satire sites.\n\nOn its About Me page, the website says:\n\n\"Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site\u2019s pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical.\"\n\nStill, the Facebook post garnered comments that thought it was real: \"Just think. She\u2019s going to have a Great Pension for the rest of her life & Medical. For being STUPID.\" Also: \"Back off!!! A good majority of motorcyclists are retired veterans. She is NOT going to be able to do it.\"\n\nThis satirical article is just that \u2014 satire. We rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
