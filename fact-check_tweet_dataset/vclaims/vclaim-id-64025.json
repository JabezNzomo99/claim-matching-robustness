So the 12% rate does apply to a \u201cfamily making 75000,\u201d as the Facebook post suggests.\n\nBut Biden\u2019s plan does not call for a tax hike on those earners.\n\nAs we\u2019ve explained before, Biden\u2019s tax plan includes provisions such as imposing a payroll tax on earnings over $400,000; increasing the top corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%; and restoring a top income tax rate of 39.6% for income above $400,000. It says nothing about raising the 12% bracket for individual taxpayers.\n\nThat said, independent analyses do indicate Biden\u2019s policies could effectively result in small tax raises on middle-income earners, assuming that employers pass a portion of the increased tax burden onto workers. But those estimates are nowhere near the magnitude alleged in the Facebook post.\n\nKent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, confirmed to us in an email that the Facebook post is wrong.\n\nSmetters is the faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, whose analysis of Biden\u2019s plan estimated that households reporting $75,000 income would see an after-tax income reduction of 0.4% in 2021 \u2014 again, not as the result of a direct tax increase, but because of the increased corporate tax rate.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center also estimated that households making $75,000 would see an average after-tax income reduction of 0.4% due to the corporate tax increase; the estimate assumes that 20% of the corporate tax increase would fall on workers.\n\n\u201cIn 2021, the proposals would increase taxes on average on all income groups, but the highest-income households would see substantially larger increases, both in dollar amounts and as a share of their incomes,\u201d the center noted. \u201c[Biden\u2019s] plan would raise taxes on households in the top 1 percent of the income distribution (those with income more than $837,000) by an average of about $299,000, or 17.0 percent of after-tax income. By contrast, taxpayers in the middle-income quintile (those with income between about $52,000 and $93,000) would experience an average tax increase of just $260, or 0.4 percent of after-tax income. Taxpayers in the bottom quintile (those with income less than $26,000) would see an average tax increase of only $30, or 0.2 percent of after-tax income.\u201d\n\nThe center added that, \u201c[i]n total, almost 93 percent of the tax increases would be borne by taxpayers in the top quintile of the income distribution.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
