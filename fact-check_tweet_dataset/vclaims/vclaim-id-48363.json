The UK spent just over \u00a315 billion a year on foreign aid in 2019. Spending on foreign aid is linked to the size of the economy. The UK spends 0.7% of its Gross National Income on foreign aid, in line with the United Nations\u2019 target for foreign aid spending.\n\nThe fundraising for the NHS refers to the efforts of Captain Tom Moore, who has, at the time of writing, raised more than \u00a328 million for NHS Charities Together, a membership organisation representing NHS charities, which also raises money on behalf of NHS charities in England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nThe charity \u201cis funding grants to help NHS charities support NHS staff, volunteers and patients in ways above and beyond what NHS funding can ordinarily provide, including wellbeing packs, rest and recuperation rooms, electronic tablets for isolated patients to communicate to loved ones. The funds will also resource vital care partnerships and longer term mental health recovery of staff and families.\u201d\n\nNHS Charities Together says it raised \u00a3457 million last year and spent over \u00a31 million a day. By comparison the budget for the Department of Health in England alone is \u00a3140 billion for 2019/20.\n\nWhether the NHS is \u201crelying\u201d on charitable contributions is a matter of opinion and not something we can fact check.", "lang": "en"}
