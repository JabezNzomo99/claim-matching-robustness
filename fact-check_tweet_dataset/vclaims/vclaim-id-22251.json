During the majority of her remarks, Ms. Pelosi read testimonies and letters from Dreamers who had written to their representatives about their lives. But amid her nearly 75,000 words that are now part of the Congressional Record, Ms. Pelosi also cited some facts and figures about immigration policy and history. Below is an assessment of the veracity of those claims. Ms. Pelosi claimed that \u201c84 percent of Americans support a path to citizenship or permanent status for Dreamers; 88 percent of independents back the path of citizenship or permanent status; and 70 percent of Republicans back either citizenship or permanent status.\u201d Her numbers are slightly off. When reached by The Times, a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi cited a December poll from Quinnipiac University in which 77 percent of all respondents, 57 percent of Republicans and 81 percent of independents supported giving Dreamers a pathway to citizenship.\n\nThe poll also found that 7 percent of all respondents, 13 percent of Republicans and 7 percent of independents said Dreamers should be allowed to remain in the United States, but should not be allowed to apply for citizenship. That\u2019s not quite the same thing as supporting \u201cpermanent status.\u201d A Republican bill in the House, for example, would give Dreamers a three-year renewable legal status rather than permanent legal residency. The claim accurately reflects that in polls, the majority of respondents across the political spectrum have said they support legal status for Dreamers. Support for giving Dreamers legal status consistently ranges from 60 percent to percentages in the mid-80s, and 50 percent to 70 percent for Republicans, across many different polls. Ms. Pelosi used a commonly misstated etymology of an Italian slur.\n\nToward the beginning of her speech, Ms. Pelosi told a story of her ancestors\u2019 migration and assimilation into United States society. She related the struggles of the current population of undocumented immigrants to the experience of her Italian grandparents, who heard the ethnic slur \u201cwop\u201d hurtled at them as shorthand for \u201cbeing without papers.\u201d A spokesman for Ms. Pelosi attributed the etymological lesson to family lore, but scholars say otherwise.\n\nIn their book \u201cOrigins of the Specious: Myths and Misconceptions of the English Language,\u201d the linguists Patricia T. O\u2019Conner and Stewart Kellerman explain that widespread misconception of the origin of the phrase and argue that it \u201chas nothing to do with immigration documents, which weren\u2019t even required of newcomers until 1918.\u201d Large waves of Italian immigrants began coming to the United States in the late 19th century, and the slur can be found in newspapers and magazines dating back that far. For instance, on March 13, 1915, The Times reported a story with the headline: \u201cCALLED \u2018WOP,\u2019 SHOOTS TWO: Young Man, Avenging \u2018Insult,\u2019 Wounds Policeman Accidentally.\u201d The derivation of the word is not completely known, but there are some clues in etymological writings. H.L. Mencken discussed the origin of the word in his landmark 1945 book \u201cAmerican Language Supplement One.\u201d Between entries for \u201cguappo\u201d and \u201cdago,\u201d Mencken explained how \u201cwop\u201d had \u201cappeared often in the English newspapers, usually in a derogative significance\u201d and might be used to \u201cdesignate any European of dark complexion.\u201d She was largely accurate about Dreamers\u2019 inability to \u2018have a Social Security card, a passport, a driver\u2019s license,\u2019 but there are exceptions. Undocumented immigrants cannot apply for a Social Security number; a United States passport; and, in most states, a driver\u2019s license, but there are exceptions. Twelve states, including California, Ms. Pelosi\u2019s home state, issue driver\u2019s licenses to people who cannot prove their lawful presence in the United States, but can offer proof of identity or meet certain conditions, such as a foreign birth certificate, passport, or consular card and evidence of current residency in the state. Under current immigration law, those without legal work authorization cannot receive a Social Security number. But undocumented immigrants can obtain an \u201cindividual taxpayer identification number\u201d to pay taxes (though they do not receive Social Security benefits).", "lang": "en"}
