The graphic had Trump\u2019s photo on the left side and a screenshot of a social media post from GMA News on the right.\n\nThe facts: Both the Malaca\u00f1ang and the White House, through the US embassy in the Philippines, said the late-night phone conversation between Trump and Duterte was about bilateral collaboration vs COVID-19. In an email to Rappler, the embassy also denied that Trump called Duterte because he needed help in handling his constituents.\n\nIn a virtual press conference on April 20, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said both parties \"agreed to continue working together as long-time allies to defeat the pandemic, save lives, and restore global economic strength.\" He refused to divulge more information, citing Duterte's orders, but said that the phone call lasted 18 minutes.\n\nOn April 21, the embassy released White House's official statement that confirmed what Roque said and added that Trump offered additional assistance to the Philippines. This is on top of the nearly P203.9 million ($4 million) in health assistance it previously donated on April 1.\n\nGMA News\u2019 social media post included in the graphic exists and is still available on its official Facebook account as of writing, but it did not say that Trump sought Duterte\u2019s help because he couldn't handle his people. The news article they published just said that the two presidents talked about collaboration efforts.\n\nRappler also reached out to the Facebook page that posted the claim to ask for its source but we received no response. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
