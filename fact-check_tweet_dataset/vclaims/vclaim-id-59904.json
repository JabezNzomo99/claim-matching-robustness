After hearing Facebook is saying that posting the Lord\u2019s Prayer goes against their policies, I\u2019m asking all Christians please post the Lord\u2019s Prayer:\n\n Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be Thy name, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil, for Thine is the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory forever.\u201d\n\nOther instances of the claim appear on Facebook here, here, here, here, here and here.\n\nThe claim, however, is false.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson said posting the Lord\u2019s Prayer does not violate the site\u2019s policies.\n\n\u201cOur Community Standards are in place to keep people safe and to ensure they feel empowered to express themselves freely on Facebook and outline what is and is not allowed on Facebook. Posting the Lord\u2019s Prayer does not violate our policies,\u201d the spokesperson told AFP in an email on July 23, 2020.\n\nFacebook\u2019s Community Standards make no reference to the Lord\u2019s Prayer or detail any restrictions on religious expression.\n\nThe false claim was also debunked by fact-checking organisations Snopes and Full Fact.", "lang": "en"}
