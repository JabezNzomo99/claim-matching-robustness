Along with containing a number of claims which Polygraph.info has debunked, the embassy\u2019s answer also contained an interesting new detail.\n\nThe embassy claimed that on March 4, the day the Skripals were found poisoned, they drove \u201cin the direction of Porton Down laboratory,\u201d a restricted military research facility. Citing British media, the Russian independent news site Meduza reported that the Skripals\u2019 car had been sighted on the London Road, which is, indeed, located between Salisbury and Porton Down. However, Meduza also noted that the Russian Embassy\u2019s statement left out the fact that London Road also leads to the cemetery where Sergei Skripal\u2019s wife and son are buried. Shortly after the Skripals\u2019 poisoning, law enforcement officials established that Sergei and Yulia Skripal had visited the cemetery and laid flowers at the graves of their relatives the same day they were poisoned.\n\nA BBC timeline of what law enforcement said showed the Skripal car was spotted on London road around 9 a.m. on March 4.The suspected Russian agents arrived about 15 minutes before noon and were captured on CCTV on a road steps from Skripal\u2019s home shortly after 1 p.m., shortly before the agents are believed to have sprayed the former spy\u2019s doorknob with the deadly nerve agent Novichok. Skripal\u2019s car was seen closer to his home about 1:30 p.m. Later, he and his daughter were seen in the shopping district, where they visited a pub and a restaurant.\n\nInvestigators found traces of Novichok at both locations \u2013 the pub and the restaurant -- and an even stronger signature at the Skripals\u2019 home -- but not at the cemetery, where law enforcement said the Skripals visited before the Russians\u2019 arrival in Salisbury.\n\nWhile there is no public timeline of all the Skripals\u2019 movements in Salisbury on March 4, traces of the poison were found only at places the Skripals visited in the afternoon, after the Russians had appeared in Skripal's neighborhood and the father's car was seen in the area. There is no evidence available indicating Sergei and Yulia Skripal visited the restricted military facility.", "lang": "en"}
