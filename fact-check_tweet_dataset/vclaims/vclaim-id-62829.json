The message also comes with a link according to which users can 'instantly claim' the amount following a few steps in it.\n\nBelow is the entire message: The Government has finally approved and have started giving out free Rs.2,000 Relief Funds to each citizen\ud83d\ude0d Below is how to claim and get yours credit Instantly as I have just did now Note: You can only claim and get credited once and it's also limited so get your now Instantly. The message has been extensively shared on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nA government website promises to provide a Rs 2,000 relief fund to each citizen. When the link provided in the message: https://bit.ly/free\u2014funds is opened, it directs to another website: https://india-relief-funds.blogspot.com/ Below is a screenshot of the website, once it opens:\n\nAccording to the norm, all government websites have the designated ministry's title written under the national emblem. This website, however, has neither logo nor name. As seen in the Ministry of Home Affairs logo here:\n\nOn choosing any of the available options (2000, 5000 and 10000) the website asks, \"What will you use your free Rs 2,000 for?\" The options provided for this question are Food, Internet or Clothing. On choosing any of the three options, one is redirected to a page which asks to share the message with 10 other WhatsApp Group. To give it a more authentic touch a comment section resembling the Facebook layout is also displayed at the bottom of the page. No matter how many times one visits the website, the name of the 'beneficiaries' and timestamp in the comments always reads 'just now' for all and '2 mins ago' for one comment. This remains constant. Further, the number of likes and comments remain constant at '204,208 and '173,330' respectively.\n\nFurther, on checking the URL through 'Domain Tools' it was found that it was recently updated on June 29. So, we can conclude that it is a dubious website and there is no scheme from the govt to provide Rs 2000 to each citizen.
