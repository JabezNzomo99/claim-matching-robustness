Calling it \"fake\", the author has requested Twitter to take action against the people who are circulating it.\n\nThe archived version of the posts are saved here and here.\n\nReacting to a user on Twitter, who has posted this viral message attributing it to the author, Rushdie appealed to the social networking site to take action and take down the tweet, calling it \"fake\".\n\nWith the help of TinEye reverse image search, we found that this viral message falsely attributing to Rushdie is circulating on the internet since 2014.\n\nIn 2015, Salman Rushdie while replying to a Twitter handle @LucyGoesHard, thanked her because as per the author, she seemed to have found the original source of this \"fake quote\". Rushdie wrote, \"Thank you for finding the source of this fake quote that people can't seem to stop quoting to justify their own bigotry.\"\n\nWe could not find any credible source that justifies or has in the past reported that the author has ever made a statement like this against the Muslims.\n\nHence, the viral message with the anti-Muslim quote attributing it to Salman Rushdie is false and misleading.", "lang": "en"}
