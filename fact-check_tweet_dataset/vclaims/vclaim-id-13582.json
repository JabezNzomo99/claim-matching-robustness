An individual user on Facebook has shared with the caption, \u201c\u0938\u093e\u092e\u0928\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0915\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u093e \u091d\u0902\u0921\u093e \u0932\u0939\u0930\u093e\u092f\u093e \u091c\u093e \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u0914\u0930 \u092e\u0902\u091a \u092a\u0930 \u0917\u0939\u0932\u094b\u0924 \u0939\u0930\u093e \u091d\u0902\u0921\u093e \u095e\u0939\u0930\u093e \u0930\u0939\u0947\u0902 \u0939\u0948\u0902 (Pakistan\u2019s flag is waved in the front and Gehlot is waving a green flag on the stage -translated). This post has been shared more than 1600 times and viewed in excess of 17000 times already.\n\nMahesh Vikram Hegde, the founder of fake news website Postcard News also tweeted the same video.\n\nSeveral social media users have shared this video with the identical narrative. Another post by one Anil Sharma claims that Pakistan\u2019s national flag can be seen on the dais where Gehlot is present. It is based on a screengrab of Ashok Gehlot with a highlighted green flag in the background. This Facebook post has been shared close to 2900 times.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\n\n\nIf you look closely, both the claims are based on the flag which is NOT the Pakistani national flag. In the images, the green flag with a crescent moon is a generic flag. It is used as a religious symbol by the Muslim community in the subcontinent. In the comparison given below, Pakistan\u2019s national flag with a white patch on the left side can be seen.\n\nThe pictures depicted in the above Facebook posts are representative of this religious banner and NOT Pakistan\u2019s national flag.\n\nDrramgopal Varshney, a Facebook user also posted a claim that the Pakistani flag was waved at a Congress rally. It has been shared more than 1400 times.\n\nIn the past as well, this green coloured flag has been falsely represented as Pakistan\u2019s national flag on social media to further a political agenda.", "lang": "en"}
