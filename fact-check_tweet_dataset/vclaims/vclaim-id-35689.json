In the fourth image, Modi can be seen plogging on the Mamallapuram beach.\n\nThe three images are being shared to claim that the prime minister\u2019s team had strategically placed waste, scanned the area and an entire crew of camera was ready to film the cleaning drive.\n\nClick here to view an archive of the post.\n\nThe collage of images was also posted by Karti Chidambaram, a Congress MP.\n\nNarendra Modi and Chinese president Xi Jinping were in the coastal town of Mamallapuram earlier this week to kickstart Jinping\u2019s two-day India visit. PM Modi shared a three-minute long video of him picking up litter from the Mamallapuram beach during his morning jogging session on Friday. Plogging, which combines jogging with picking up litter, originated in Sweden.\n\nThe collage of images is viral on multiple Facebook pages and Twitter handles with the same narrative.\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search and found that two out of the three images are old and unrelated.\n\nThe first image, where an entire filming crew can be seen, is originally from West Sands Beach, St Andrews, Scotland. It is part of the Fife Tayside region, which is a popular shooting location of Holywood films.\n\nThe second image of a bomb squad scanning a beach for landmines is originally from Kozhikode, Kerala. The photo was taken in April this year, during Narendra Modi\u2019s election campaign in the area. The image was used in the Hindu\u2019s report titled \u201cBJP gears up for a show of strength ahead of Modi visit.\n\nBOOM could not independently verify the third image.", "lang": "en"}
