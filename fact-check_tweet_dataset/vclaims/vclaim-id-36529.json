It is being claimed that beef flavoured maggi is being sold to Indians. \u201cFriends, now Maggi is selling products with our (mother) cow\u2019s beef in it. A few days back Maggi wallahs were mixing lead with Maggi noodles and selling it to us (Indian). We have to teach these foreign companies a lesson. This Holi lets embrace Indian made products and boycott the foreign ones,\u201d reads the message posted along with the images.\n\nA similar claim is viral on Facebook and Twitter, which says, \u201c\u092e\u0948\u0917\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0917\u094b\u092e\u093e\u0902\u0938 \u0915\u093e \u092b\u094d\u0932\u0947\u0935\u0930 \u0921\u093e\u0932\u0928\u093e \u0936\u0941\u0930\u0942 \u0915\u0930 \u0926\u093f\u092f\u093e \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 \u092e\u0948\u0902 \u0906\u091c \u0938\u0947 \u092e\u0948\u0917\u0940 \u0915\u093e \u092c\u0939\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0942\u0901, \u0915\u0943\u092a\u092f\u093e \u0906\u092a \u092d\u0940 \u091c\u094b \u0917\u093e\u092f \u0915\u094b \u092e\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0915\u093e \u0926\u0930\u094d\u091c\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0924\u0947\u0902 \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u092e\u0948\u0917\u0940 \u0915\u093e \u092c\u0939\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0930\u0947\u0902 (They have started processing beef flavour in Maggi. I boycott Maggi from today. You too, please boycott Maggi if you consider cow to be our holy mother.)\u201d\n\nNestle India took to Twitter and informed that maggi noodles sold and manufactured in India \u201cdoes not contain beef or any form of flavour beef\u201d.\n\nWhile a search on Nestle India\u2019s website with keywords (\u201cMaggi\u201d and \u201cbeef\u201d) bore no results, the same gave results for beef flavoured maggi on Nestle\u2019s website for Maggi products in New Zealand, USA, Australia and UK. We found the same product listed on Amazon USA\u2019s website.\n\nFurthermore, it was found that the maggi India website includes chicken noodles\n\nThus, the claim that beef flavoured maggi is being sold by Nestle in the Indian market is false.", "lang": "en"}
