They originate from a website which falsely impersonates BBC News.\n\nKobe Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna died in a helicopter crash on 26 January. Since then, false articles claiming that his wife Vanessa died by suicide, and recorded herself doing it, have spread online.\n\nVanessa is still alive. On February 24, she attended a public, televised memorial service for Mr Bryant at the Staples Centre in Los Angeles, and gave a widely reported speech paying tribute to her late husband. She has also been regularly updating her Instagram page.\n\nAlthough the articles claiming Vanessa died purport to be from BBC News, they are just impersonating the BBC by using its logo. The \u201csuicide videos\u201d are posted on black backgrounds, which is not in the BBC\u2019s style, and have URLs which are clearly not related to the BBC.\n\nOne \u201csuicide video\u201d of Vanessa is not a video at all and forwards to another false story purporting to be about Bryant\u2019s eldest daughter Natalia\u2019s death; this contains a video which when clicked on says it is unavailable.\n\nNone of the videos or links show any evidence that Vanessa has died, and it has not been reported by any news outlet.\n\nWe have also fact-checked the claim that Natalia died by suicide. This is also false.", "lang": "en"}
