Noting he had been there 26 years, Obama suggested his Republican rival resisted solutions.\n\n\"Today, we import triple the amount of oil than we had on the day Senator McCain took office,\" Obama told the Democratic National Convention in his featured speech Aug. 28, 2008, in Denver.\n\nFirst, Obama refers to a 26-year period that began after McCain won a U.S. House seat in 1982, taking office in 1983. (McCain joined the Senate in 1987.)\n\nUsing that 1983 starting point, imports tripled by several measures, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nBetween 1983 and 2007, imports of crude oil \u2014 refined to produce products like gasoline \u2014 went from 3.3-million barrels a day to 10-million, the EIA reports.\n\nDuring the same time, net imports of all petroleum went from 4.3-million barrels a day to 12-million, the EIA reports. That's a bit below tripling, but pretty close.", "lang": "en"}
