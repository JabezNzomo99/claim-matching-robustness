No, that's not true: his obituary was published by a new liberal satire website run by Christopher Blair on which he is planning to fake kill many more people in the near future.

He runs several other websites, including wearethellod.com and bebest.website. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\".
