Half a million is a better estimate, although that\u2019s from 2016 research.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-11564", "url": "https://fullfact.org/health/vegans-uk/", "vclaim": "Are there 3.5 million vegans in the UK?\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time this claim has been made, a number of headlines and articles reported the figures earlier in the year. It\u2019s based on a survey of UK adults commissioned by the price comparison website Compare the Market.\n\nPrevious estimates we\u2019ve covered suggest that there are around half a million vegan adults in Great Britain, so we were interested to investigate this new figure.\n\nThe survey from Compare the Market didn\u2019t actually ask people whether they were currently vegan, but whether they had ever become vegan for environmental reasons, without confirming whether they still were.\n\nThis issue, along with other problems in the survey\u2019s design, means that it\u2019s almost certainly overestimated the vegan population.\n\nThe Vegan Society\u2019s 2016 figure that there are 540,000 vegan adults in Great Britain is the best available estimate we know of (though the true figure could well have changed over the past two years). It asked people questions about their (present) diet rather than whether they identified as vegan or vegetarian.\n\nThe survey didn\u2019t ask people if they were vegan or vegetarian\n\nCompare the Market reported that 7% of the UK population is vegan, and 14% is vegetarian, based on a survey they commissioned. It\u2019s not made clear from the release, but the underlying data shows that only adults were surveyed, so that 7% figure would equate to around 3.5 million adults in the UK who are vegan, based on the latest population estimates. Those 3.5 million adults equate to around 5% of the total UK population (including adults and children)\u2014which is the percentage mentioned in the Guardian.\n\nCompare the Market told us that two thousand adults were surveyed and the data was weighted to be representative of the UK adult population, so we can be reasonably confident that the survey\u2019s findings are applicable to the UK adult population generally.\n\nBut the survey didn\u2019t actually ask if people were vegan. The question asked was: \u201cWhich of the following have you done or are considering doing to help reduce your impact on the planet?\u201d This was followed by a list of options, which included \u201cbecoming vegetarian\u201d and \u201cbecoming vegan\u201d.\n\n7% of respondents selected \u201cI have done this\u201d for the becoming vegan option, and 14% selected \u201cI have done this\u201d for the becoming vegetarian option. But this doesn\u2019t actually tell us how many respondents are vegan or vegetarian right now.\n\nThe main reason is because someone could have become vegan for a period of time but no longer be so. For instance, if you became vegan for a month as part of \u201cVeganuary\u201d (which around 170,000 people signed up for this year) but then stopped at the end of the month, you could reasonably answer that you had become vegan, even though you are no longer doing so.\n\nResearch also suggests that many survey respondents say that they are vegan or vegetarian even when their diet is not. Many surveys on veganism and vegetarianism therefore prefer to ask questions about people\u2019s diet, rather than how they identify themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, some vegans may not have been captured by the Compare the Market survey because of the way the question is phrased: specifically asking whether people have gone vegan or vegetarian to reduce their impact on the planet.\n\nWhat if you follow such a diet for religious or animal welfare reasons? Do you answer \u201cI have done this\u201d even though you did it for non-environmental reasons, or \u201cnot applicable\u201d because you did it for other reasons? We have explained the perils of these so-called double-barrelled questions (when asking two questions at once can lead to confusing results) in more detail before.\n\nWe\u2019ve previously looked into other surveys which measure the vegan population of Britain or the UK to be around 1% of adults (about half a million people), and the vegetarian population to be around 2-3%.\n\nThese surveys all asked about diet rather than whether people identified as vegan or vegetarian.\n\nAs the most recent data we looked at was from 2016, it\u2019s possible that the number of vegans has increased from half a million people aged 15 or over in Britain since then\u2014but we don\u2019t have any more recent, reliable data on this.", "lang": "en"}
