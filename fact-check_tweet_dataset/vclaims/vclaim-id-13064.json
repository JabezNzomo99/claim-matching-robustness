The posts are misleading: the video is from an unrelated Islamic event in Germany available online since 2007 and they contain no other evidence to show a ceremony of 350 people accepting Islam in New Zealand after the attacks.\n\nThe video was viewed more than one million times in 48 hours after being uploaded here on March 18, 2019, to the Facebook page of Sajid Hashmat. He identifies himself on Facebook as a \u201csenior leader\u201d with a regional political party in India that represents Muslims.\n\nThe post was published after 50 worshippers in two mosques were shot dead in the southern New Zealand city of Christchurch on March 15. An Australian man has been charged over the murders. Here is an AFP report from March 20 on the killings.\n\nThe caption alongside the video in the misleading Facebook post states in English: \"50 Muslims were killed on Friday in New Zealand & 350 people accepted #Islam today in #NewZealand.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nAFP found dozens of other posts with the same video and caption on Facebook and Youtube, some of which had been viewed tens of thousands of times, such as as here and here.\n\nAFP established the video appeared online as early as November 24, 2007, through an investigation using video analysis tool InVid and multiple keyword searches.\n\nHere is that video on Youtube, which has a caption in German: \u201cFunf Menschen nehmen den Islam\u201d.\n\nHere is a screenshot comparison of the video shared in the misleading Facebook post (left) and the video from 2007 that AFP located on YouTube (right):\n\nAt the start of the YouTube video, a message appears which reads in German: \u201cOberhausen 23.06.2007, Funf Menschen nehmen den Islam an\u201d.\n\nThis translates to English as: \u201cOberhausen 23.06.2007, five people adopt Islam.\u201d\n\nBy conducting a search on Youtube for Muslim conversion ceremonies in Oberhausen, AFP discovered videos of the same Caucasian man wearing an Islamic skullcap.\n\nThe videos were found here, here, and here.\n\nThrough further searches for Caucasian Muslim leaders in Oberhausen, Germany, AFP established the man in the videos was Pierre Vogel, who describes himself as a Muslim and \u201cthe most famous preacher in Germany\u201d on his official Facebook page.\n\nBelow is an AFP screenshot comparison of the video from the misleading Facebook posts (left) next to this video uploaded to Youtube in October 2007 (right) showing Vogel.\n\n\n\n AFP contacted Sajid Hashmat to ask him whether the video he shared was a recent one, and if it showed that 350 people had accepted Islam in New Zealand after the Christchurch mosque shootings.\n\nHe told an AFP reporter in Delhi by telephone on March 20: \u201cNo, I believe that video is old. However, it is a symbolic gesture\u201d.\n\nWhen asked why he had made the claim about 350 people accepting Islam on his page alongside the video, he said: \u201cThat video is symbolic, a reference. There is a news link below that video from where I got the information\u201d.\n\nOn his Facebook page, the link below the post with the video was for this blog post. It was posted two minutes before the video was shared on his page.\n\nThe blog post has a headline that states: \u201c50 Muslims were killed on Friday in New Zealand & 350 people accepted Islam today in New Zealand\u201d.\n\nThe blog post has no video and gives no details or evidence to support its headline. The blog post also states that Facebook had deleted its old page and urged people to like a new one called: \u201cI Love You Allah\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
