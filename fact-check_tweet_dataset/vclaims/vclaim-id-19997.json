The Committee on Climate Change has said that household bills in 2016 were lower than they were in 2008, because of reductions in energy use.\n\nLabour isn\u2019t saying that annual energy bills have increased by \u00a3900 since 2010. It\u2019s a cumulative total\u2014adding up the increase in prices in each of the six years from 2010 to 2016 (adjusting for inflation).\n\nThe figure doesn\u2019t distinguish between bills for different tariff types or payment methods. It's also based on households using the same amount of energy over the period, but energy efficiency has reduced average household energy consumption in recent years.\n\nWe all use all different amounts of energy. What we pay will depend on how much we use, what tariff we are on, and how we pay our bills.\n\nLabour told us the figure is based on the government\u2019s estimated average household energy bills, using a set amount of gas (15,000 kWh a year) and electricity (3,800 kWh) consumption a year. So these estimates don't account for changing household consumption.\n\nAdding up the total additional money paid on average for the same amount of gas and electricity between 2010 and 2016 produces an increase of \u00a3883 over the period, taking inflation into account. This tells you how much extra, in total, the average consumer might have paid for electricity since 2010, compared to what they would have paid if prices hadn\u2019t risen above inflation.\n\nEnergy prices rose and then fell over this period.\n\nThe government itself doesn\u2019t calculate a combined figure for these bills. This is because the figure for the electricity bill covers the UK, which includes Northern Ireland, while the gas bill figure covers Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales only). So it\u2019s probably better to look at them separately.\n\nDoes this mean that we\u2019ve all paid \u00a3883 extra?\n\nThere are significant variations in what customers pay for the same energy usage.\n\nIf your energy consumption did match the one used for the calculation, you\u2019re on a standard variable tariff and you don\u2019t pay by direct debit, the figure is likely to be higher.\n\nIf you always shop around, and make sure you get the best deal every time your contract ends, and pay by direct debit, the figure is likely to be lower.\n\nEnergy regulator Ofgem found that in 2016 the difference between the cheapest tariffs and standard variable tariffs was \u00a3300 a year and that 66% of customers were on these more expensive standard variable schemes. It has also estimated that 45% of people don\u2019t ever remember switching supplier and that if they did they could save on average \u00a3200 a year.\n\nAs an example, the latest Ofcom figures for April 2017 show that customers on a standard variable tariff with the \u2018big six\u2019 energy suppliers were paying \u00a31,086 on average. However the cheapest available tariff for the same usage from the big six it was \u00a3937 and for all suppliers it was \u00a3834. These figures are based on a lower energy usage than used for the government\u2019s estimates and are for dual fuel customers paying by direct debit.\n\nDomestic customers on standard variable tariffs have been paying about \u00a31.4 billion a year more than they would in a properly competitive market according to a 2016 Competition and Markets Authority investigation. It proposed a database of customers who haven\u2019t changed suppliers for three years, so that other suppliers can contact them with their offers.\n\nDoes this mean that companies made \u00a3833 extra per customer?\n\nThe head of Ofgem\u2019s view is that costs are the main driver of energy prices. He told MPs there had been a 15% rise in energy supplier costs at the end of 2016 compared to 2015. Of that, 12.5% was due to the rise in wholesale prices and 2.8% was due to government costs. However these figures don\u2019t reflect all the costs to suppliers, such as the smart meter roll-out.\n\nThe latest Ofgem figures of the components for a dual fuel bill are:\n\u2022 Wholesale energy prices, which is the cost of buying energy to suppliers: 43%\n\u2022 Network costs, which cover the costs of maintaining, upgrading and operating the energy grids: 24%", "lang": "en"}
