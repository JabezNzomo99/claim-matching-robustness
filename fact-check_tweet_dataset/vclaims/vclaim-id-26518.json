Is this not more than war. Dismantle this evil Forest now \u2013 goes viral Facebook post\n\nA Facebook post by the \u201chardcore Biafrans\u2019\u2019 has alleged that herdsmen stormed Big Joe transport company in Kogi state killing all passengers aboard the bus. The post says;\n\n\u201cIn Kogi state herdsmen walked into the terminal of Big Joe transport and short [sic] all passengers boarding to travel to Edo state. Is this not more than war. Dismantle this evil Forest now\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe herdsmen in recent times have been on the front burner of all things relating to public nuisance. This is due to several atrocities perpetrated by them or wrongly attributed to them. Confirmation to the veracity of these incidences has mostly been gotten from security personnel across the state.\n\nThis post was first shared on the 12th of August 2019 and in the last 24 hours, has enjoyed about 275 shares, leaving the total estimated share to 324.\n\nAlthough removed, this post was also present on Nairaland.\n\nA call was put through to the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in Kogi state, DSP William Ovye Aya, to authenticate the veracity of the post and he confirmed that there was nothing like that and that the incident never occurred in Kogi state. He further remarked that \u201c\u2026 a press statement has been released in that regard\u2019\u2019.\n\nVarious credible news platforms have also released reports to refute the claim referencing either the state PPRO or the Kogi state Government.\n\nFurther remarks on the incident ensued \u2013 It is the handiwork of \u201crumor peddlers who are on a mission to create panic and tension in the state,\u201d exclaimed the Director General of Media and Publicity to Kogi Governor, Kingsley Fanwo whilst speaking with Punch newspaper.\n\n\u2018\u2018We wish to allay the fears of commuters and residents of the state that nothing like that ever happened as all motor parks in the state are safe and peaceful\u2019\u2019, he added.\n\nHe assured indigenes that their Governor still has their best interest at heart. And further concluded with a stern warning and appraisal to perpetrators and indigenes respectively.\n\nThis post is FALSE. Readers and Nigerians at large are therefore advised to disregard such information.\n\nAttached to this post originally was a picture that cannot be published with this fact-check because of its horrid nature. However, when a Google reverse image was conducted, Dubawa discovered that the same picture appeared on Nairaland with the headline \u201cmany dies in a motor accident in Kogi 10:41 am on August 11\u2019\u2019. Again on a blog site with the name Countripeople with the headline \u2018\u2018Terrible Accident In Kogi, Many Dead, Others Injured (Graphic Photos)\u2019\u2019.\n\nAlthough, where or why the picture was taken is not known; what is glaring is that it wasn\u2019t an attack on Big Joe terminal by the herdsmen.", "lang": "en"}
