When 2018 began, the president had made 1,989 false and misleading claims, according to The Fact Checker\u2019s database, which tracks every suspect statement uttered by the president. By the end of the year, Trump had accumulated more than 7,600 untruths during his presidency \u2014 averaging more than 15 erroneous claims a day during 2018, almost triple the rate from the year before.\n\nBeschloss noted that the U.S. Constitution set very few guidelines in this regard because the expectation was that the first president would be George Washington and he would set the tone for the office. \u201cWhat is it that schoolchildren are taught about George Washington? That he never told a lie,\u201d the historian said. \u201cThat is a bedrock expectation of a president by Americans.\u201d\n\nTrump began 2018 on a similar pace as last year. Through May, he generally averaged about 200 to 250 false claims a month. But his rate suddenly exploded in June, when he topped 500 falsehoods, as he appeared to shift to campaign mode. He uttered almost 500 more in both July and August, almost 600 in September, more than 1,200 in October and almost 900 in November. In December, Trump drifted back to the mid-200s.\n\nTrump is among the more loquacious of recent presidents, according to Martha Kumar, professor emerita at Towson University, who has kept track of every presidential interaction with the media, dating to Ronald Reagan. Through Dec. 20, Trump held 323 short question-and-answer sessions with reporters, second only to Bill Clinton through the first 23 months, and granted 196 interviews, second to Barack Obama.\n\nMore than a quarter of Trump\u2019s claims were made during campaign rallies. On Nov. 5, the day before the midterm elections, for instance, Trump held three rallies, yielding a total of 139 false or misleading claims. A review of every statement made by Trump at two of his earlier 2018 rallies found that he exaggerated or made up at least 70 percent of his assertions.\n\nThe president often makes statements that are disconnected from his policies. He said his administration did not have a family separation policy on the border, when it did. Then he said the policy was required because of existing laws, when it was not.\n\nThe president also simply invents faux facts. He repeatedly said U.S. Steel is building six to eight new steel plants, but that\u2019s not true. He said that as president, Obama gave citizenship to 2,500 Iranians during the nuclear-deal negotiations, but that\u2019s false. Over and over, Trump claimed that the Uzbekistan-born man who in 2017 was accused of killing eight people with a pickup truck in New York brought two dozen relatives to the United States through \u201cchain migration.\u201d The real number is zero.\n\nWhen leaders attending the U.N. General Assembly burst into laughter when Trump uttered a favorite false claim \u2014 that his administration had accomplished more in less than two years than \u201calmost any administration in the history of our country\u201d \u2014 the president was visibly startled and remarked that he \u201cdidn\u2019t expect that reaction.\u201d But then he later falsely insisted to reporters that the boast \u201cwas meant to get some laughter.\u201d\n\nIn an October interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump emphatically denied he had imposed many tariffs. \u201cI mean, other than some tariffs on steel \u2014 which is actually small, what do we have? . . . Where do we have tariffs? We don\u2019t have tariffs anywhere,\u201d he insisted. The newspaper responded by printing a list of $305 billion worth of tariffs on many types of U.S. imports.\n\nHe routinely touts a job-growth number that dates from his election, not when he took office, thus inflating it by 600,000 jobs. And although there\u2019s no question Trump can draw supporters to his rallies by the thousands, he often claims pumped-up numbers that have no basis in fact. At a Tampa rally, he declared that \u201cthousands of people\u201d who could not get in were watching outside on a \u201ctremendous movie screen.\u201d Neither a crowd of that size nor the movie screen existed.\n\nOn Oct. 18, in Missoula, Mont., Trump falsely said that no one challenges his description of the Democrats as the party of crime. \u201cDemocrats have become the party of crime. It\u2019s true. Who would believe you could say that and nobody even challenges it. Nobody\u2019s ever challenged it,\u201d he said.\n\nBut then he had an unusual moment of doubt. \u201cMaybe they have. Who knows? I have to always say that, because then they\u2019ll say they did actually challenge it, and they\u2019ll put like \u2014 then they\u2019ll say he gets a Pinocchio.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
