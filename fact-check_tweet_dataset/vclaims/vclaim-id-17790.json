They feel that they are untouchable and entitled to hurt others. Ang balita sa akin, at tsinek ko ito sa PNP, ay scalawag pala itong tatay, eh. Saka 'tinapon 'ata sa Mindanao for being a scalawag, and I am looking into his background kung bakit scalawag itong lokong ito. Because the PNP should not tolerate that. If this guy is a scalawag, they should file cases against him and kick him out of the force.\n\n\"Maybe this family is into drugs. That is why it should be looked into. There should be a formal investigation because if this bullying does not stop, these guys will be tomorrow's crime stories,\" Alunan further said.\n\nThe Facts: Queries into databases listing PNP personnel \u2013 including their Personnel Accounting System, Records Management Division, and the Directorate for Personnel Records Management \u2013 show that there is no PNP member bearing the reported name of the father of the alleged bully.* Philippine National Police (PNP) spokesman Chief Superintendent Benigno Durana Jr told Rappler this in a phone interview.\n\nThe listings checked included former and current personnel, and even those tagged as absent without leave (AWOL), according to Durana. \u201cWith due respect to former Secretary Alunan, our database is more reliable than his sources.\u201d\n\nAn unsuspecting family found themselves in the middle of the mess when a number of posts circulated their home address as the supposed address of the alleged bully. Thousands of pesos worth of fastfood and shopping sites deliveries wrongly ended up at their home.", "lang": "en"}
