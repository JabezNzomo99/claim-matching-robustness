This time it\u2019s a Democratic ad claiming GOP Rep. Joe Heck of Nevada voted \u201c23 times\u201d against banning terrorists from buying guns.\n\nThe fact is, there has not been a single up-or-down vote on such a ban in the House.\n\nThe ad is sponsored by the Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC that is spending millions to elect Democratic Senate candidates. Heck, a three-term congressman, is the Republican nominee to succeed Sen. Harry Reid, who is retiring. Heck is locked in a tight race against Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto, the state\u2019s former attorney general.\n\nNone of the 23 votes cited by the ad would have banned anything, according to the PAC\u2019s own detailed backup statement. All were procedural votes, of which 21 (in the PAC\u2019s words) would have denied \u201can opportunity\u201d to vote on a measure Democrats wanted to get to the floor if given the chance. That \u201cno-fly, no-buy\u201d legislation was aimed at preventing gun sales to anyone the government had placed on a list of suspected terrorists barred from commercial flights.\n\nThe PAC says other votes would have \u201cblocked\u201d similar proposals that Democrats attempted to offer as riders to other legislation.\n\nAs an example, one of the \u201cblocked\u201d measures was a motion to send back to committee a bill dealing with property rights along the Red River in Texas and Oklahoma. The motion would have instructed the committee to attach to the bill additional language that would have authorized the U.S. attorney general to block gun sales to anyone \u201cappropriately suspected\u201d of being a terrorist.\n\nWhen the Democratic motion was ruled out of order, the sponsor appealed, a Republican moved to table (kill) the appeal, and the vote was 246 to 182 against the appeal. Like all the other votes cited, it was nearly a straight party-line vote. In this case, two Democrats sided with 244 Republicans.\n\nPolls show that the \u201cno fly, no buy\u201d legislation is politically popular, which of course is why the Senate Majority PAC is eager to advertise that Heck is opposed to it.\n\nBut the idea raises civil-rights concerns. The House measure favored by Democrats would allow the U.S. attorney general to block the sale of a firearm to anyone \u201cappropriately suspected\u201d of being a terrorist, without having to state the basis of that suspicion or present any evidence to a court. The measure does not define what \u201cappropriately\u201d is supposed to mean.\n\nAnyone denied a weapon would have 60 days to appeal to the courts, but even then the government could provide \u201csummaries or redacted versions of documents\u201d to support its case if the attorney general determines that a full recital of evidence would \u201clikely compromise national security.\u201d\n\nThe liberal American Civil Liberties Union opposes banning a sale based on mere official suspicion. The ACLU has called the no-fly list \u201cerror-prone and unreliable because it uses vague and overbroad criteria and secret evidence to place individuals on blacklists without a meaningful process to correct government error and clear their names.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan has made clear that he won\u2019t allow the measure on the floor for a vote while the Republicans control the House.\n\nAnd it\u2019s fair to say Heck would probably oppose such a measure if it ever did reach the floor; a spokesman told us Heck considers the measure \u201cflawed.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Majority PAC ad would be correct to say that Heck is part of a GOP majority that consistently backed its leadership\u2019s refusal to consider the proposal Democrats favor. But it\u2019s nonsense to claim that he voted 23 times against a proposed ban that never came up for a vote at all.", "lang": "en"}
