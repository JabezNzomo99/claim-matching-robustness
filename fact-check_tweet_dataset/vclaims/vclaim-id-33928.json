MANGALURU POLICE DETAINS KERALA JOURNALISTS FOR LACK OF \"ACCREDITATION\"\n\nAt around 9 am on Friday, the Mangaluru police started questioning reporters present outside Wenlock hospital. The reporters, many of them from Kasargod in Kerala were covering the post-mortem of the two people who died on Thursday following police firing on protestors in the region. Dr PS Harsha, Police Commissioner was caught on camera questioning a Media One reporter who was broadcasting live from the hospital.\n\nWe were able to access the same video which shows Harsha asking the journalist for \"accreditation\" to prove that he is a \"genuine mediaperson\". The video further shows the reporter displaying his PRESS card hung around his neck, which Harsha rejects as \"not issued by any government authority.\"\n\nThe video further shows, policemen asking the cameraman of the channel to stop broadcasting and taking the journalists away from the scene. One of the policemen can be heard shouting, \"Out\" to the journalist from Media One.\n\nNews18 Kerala also reported a telephonic byte from their cameraperson Sumesh Morazha, minutes after he was detained and put into a police van by the Mangaluru police.\n\n\n\nMorazha speaking to the channel says, \"Right now I'm in police van. All our mobile phones are confiscated. I had two phones and one of them is with the police.\" He further explains that they were at hospital mortuary premises shooting a news report for half an hour, following which the police and asked them to shoot from outside the hospital gate.\n\n\"We went out and started rolling. The Commissioner (referred to as SP by the reporter) came and asked me to show him an identity card so I showed him my PRESS card. But he started asking for accreditation card since we were from a Kerala mediahouse.\"\n\nBOOM also spoke to a few local reporters who on the condition of anonymity confirmed the incident and said, \"the police suddenly started demanding government accreditation from the journalists. Especially from those who were not reporting in Kannada or Tulu language\". The reporter further said that journalists from Kerala were detained from two places - \"From near the State Bank area where they were reporting the protests and from outside Wenlock hospital\".\n\n\n\nThe reporters added, \"How can they ask for government accreditation when reporters in Mangalore itself don't have it? Accreditation is given so ease access to state Assemblies, Parliament and to government functions. This was not a government event, it was a protest? Also, how will a accreditation issued by the Kerala government work in Karnataka?\"\n\nBOOM spoke to a reporter from Mathrubhumi, who managed to quickly leave from the place when the police were rounding up other mediapersons. On the condition of anonymity, he said 'police asked for government accreditation while the reporters started shooting in Wenlock hospital premises We were there for reporting the protest and accreditation is not mandatory as it is not a restricted area or a place which is under protocol. \" He added, \"The detained journalists are in custody and will only be released by evening. We have been unable to contact any of them\".\n\nIn response to an email about the incident, Network18 Kerala issued a statement saying, \"As part of our continuing coverage of the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, News18 Kerala deployed a reporting crew in Mangaluru. One of our video journalists, Sumesh VC, was detained by the police this morning along with other journalists from Kerala. He was carrying identification as an employee of News18 Kerala while carrying out a reporting assignment. He has no connection with illegal activity of any kind. After verifying his identity, the police released Sumesh and the other journalists.\"", "lang": "en"}
