Technology moves very fast than ever in history,\" reads the caption of the post.\n\nAt the time of writing the post, the video was shared over 8,000 times.\n\n The logo on the carpet seen in the video reads,'ETIMAD'.\n\nA keyword search based on this led to the same video on YouTube. The video was uploaded on February 24, 2019 and the title reads, \"8-ft Titan robot greets visitors at UAE defence show Idex in Abu Dhabi.\"\n\nReportedly, a robot named Titan was also a part of the event. Another report on the event can be accessed here. The robot had been in the public eye earlier also. The 60 kg robot, Titan, is the world's first commercial entertainment robot artist developed by the British company Cyberstein, and was also present at the Burj Khalifa in November 2018. Back in March 2018, Titan was at the International Exhibition of National Security and Resilience Conference in Abu Dhabi. Further, the man in the video does not resemble Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, King of Bahrain.
