{"title": "No, You Don\u2019t Have to Shave Your Beard to Fend Off COVID-19", "subtitle": "", "author": "dubawa.org", "date": "2020-02-29T20:05:24+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-38181", "url": "https://dubawa.org/no-you-dont-have-to-shave-your-beards-to-fend-off-covid-19/", "vclaim": "A Twitter page claimed shaving of facial hair ensures safety from COVID-19, further attributing the message to the CDC.\n\nResults from our research show that the message from Today .ng\u2019s article is a misappropriation of a 2017 NOISH publication; a notification directed at workers using respirators in carrying out their tasks. It has nothing to do with preventing the spread of coronavirus.\n\nOn February 28, following the announcement by the Nigerian health authorities, the massive civil unrest was palpable. On this day, Nigeria became the third African country to detect coronavirus after Algeria and Egypt. Reports have it that, the virus\u2019 point of entry was an Italian on a business trip on February 25.\n\nAmid the uproar, Twitter received a claim by Nigeria Newsdesk, attributed to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. It says, \u201cTo be safe from coronavirus, shave your beard.\u201d\n\nWhen we checked the link attached to the post, it led us here, an article from Today.ng. The publication demystifying the headline revealed that the United States\u2019 CDC has warned that facial hair can interfere with facemasks and respirators; as they are widely used to prevent the global spread of COVID-19.\n\nFurther, an infographic attached to the article bears a CDC logo, showing different types of beards style. The image indicates which beard style is suitable for the mask/respirator with a green tick; the unsuitable one gets a red cancel sign.\n\nThis claim is undoubtedly a headscratcher, awakening all your sceptic bones. The question, what is the correlation between coronavirus and facial hair (beards)? Besides this, the article did not indicate when or where the CDC made the announcement. More soo, the article still refers to the virus as 2019-nCoV and not COVID-19, its official name.\n\nFirstly, our verification commenced at the scene of the crime, the would-be infographic from the CDC. Our search initially panned fruitless as we could not find anything helpful on the health institute\u2019s website. Next, we searched CDC Twitter posts from when coronavirus broke till present but found nothing still. Could it be that the site manufactured the image itself?\n\nNothing to do with COVID-19\n\nDubawa\u2019s reverse image search on TinEye provided only five results from which we found this \u2013 a CDC NIOSH publication from November 2, 2017. We found that NIOSH -National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health \u2013 is a division of CDC, set up to research and make recommendations for the prevention of work-related injury and illness.", "lang": "en"}
