Gavin Newsom, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Rep. Adam Schiff, former Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and billionaire investor George Soros. All of them are inaccurate.\n\nNewsom and Pelosi do have distant ties through marriage. The House speaker\u2019s brother-in-law, Ron, was at one point married to Newsom\u2019s aunt, Barbara, according to a commentary piece from CalMatters. But Newsom is not Pelosi\u2019s nephew, despite what the post claims.\n\nThe post then claims that Clinton and Schiff are connected to Soros \u2014 Schiff through his sister marrying Soros\u2019s son and Clinton through her daughter marrying Soros\u2019s nephew. (RELATED: Does Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Daughter Sit On The Board Of The Kennedy Center?)\n\nCheck Your Fact has previously debunked these two claims. Clinton\u2019s daughter, Chelsea, is married to Marc Mezvinsky, who is not one of Soros\u2019s two nephews. Schiff does not have a sister, his congressional office confirmed in 2019.\n\nThe final claim being made suggests Kerry\u2019s daughter \u201cis married to a mullah\u2019s son in Iran,\u201d a connection that could have proven problematic if true considering Kerry\u2019s role in helping negotiate the Iran nuclear deal while secretary of state. But, like the other claims in the post, it is bogus.\n\nKerry\u2019s daughter, Vanessa, married an American neurosurgeon named Brian Nahed in October 2009, according to The New York Times. The couple refuted the claim that Nahed\u2019s father is a mullah, a term that refers to a Muslim religious leader, in an interview with FactCheck.org.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
