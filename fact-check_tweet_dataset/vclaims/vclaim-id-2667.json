His claim may be in the right ballpark considering all food banks, but we don\u2019t know for sure.\n\nFigures from the Trussell Trust, which manages a network of food banks across the UK, did show 1.1 million parcels given out in 2015/16. 400,000 went to children.\n\nThat isn\u2019t 1.1 million different people. The Trust reports that, on average, people need two food bank vouchers in a year. So the number of people using the Trust\u2019s foodbanks could be around half the total figure.\n\nBut this is only part of the picture anyway. The Trussell Trust doesn\u2019t run all food banks across the UK: it\u2019s previously been estimated that it accounts for about half of all food banks.\n\nThat means that these figures will underestimate the number of parcels given out nationwide. So Mr Loach\u2019s figure for people could be close to the reality.\n\nResearch published this week also shed light on why people are using foodbanks\u2014and the benefits system takes centre stage.\n\nThere is a \u201cstrong, dynamic relationship\u201d between people having their Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance stopped and increased use of food banks, according to analysis by the University of Oxford. That\u2019s based on referrals to food banks between 2012 and 2016.\n\nThis research isn\u2019t the final word on this issue. It doesn\u2019t include sanctions for Universal Credit, for example, which is replacing income-based JSA and now accounts for half as many claimants as JSA, according to estimates.", "lang": "en"}
