(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nSpoiler alert: There\u2019s no evidence that Churchill ever said that.\n\nWe consulted the National Churchill Museum at Westminster College in Fulton, Mo., for any record of the quote.\n\nTimothy Riley, chief curator of the museum, told PolitiFact he found no evidence to suggest that Churchill made the statement.\n\n\"There is no record in the vast written record to attribute this to Winston Churchill,\" Riley wrote.\n\nA search for the quote on the International Churchill Society website also yielded no results.\n\nRichard Langworth, senior fellow at the Hillsdale College Churchill Project, included the quote in his running list of \"All the \u2018Quotes\u2019 Winston Churchill Never Said.\"\n\nSnopes reported that the quote doesn\u2019t seem to have appeared anywhere prior to 2015 \u2014 \"making it extremely unlikely they originated with a man who passed away in 1965.\"\n\nWe rate this false Churchill quote Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
