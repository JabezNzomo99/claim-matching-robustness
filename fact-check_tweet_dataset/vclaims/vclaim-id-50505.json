No, an Iranian news website selectively quoted as fact what was only speculation from the former CIA agent helping run a site associated with Russian disinformation campaigns.\n\nThe claim originated in an article published by Tehran-based Press TV on March 6, 2020, titled \"Coronavirus was produced in a laboratory: Former CIA intel officer\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this:\n\nThe Tehran-based Press TV pulled the out-of-context quote from former officer Philip Giraldi, in a highly speculative article, which read:\n\nUnder the headline \"Who Made Coronavirus? Was It the U.S., Israel or China Itself?\" Giraldi went on to present a wildly speculative possibility of coronavirus originating as a bio-warfare agent in a lab based on no facts. His piece was published by the Strategic Culture Foundation, which claims it works \"to spread reliable information, critical thought and progressive ideas.\"\n\nHowever, an EU-linked group has said the Strategic Culture Foundation's website is based in Russia and feeds Moscow's disinformation campaign.\n\nAccording to an article published by EUvsDisinfo, which was formed in 2015 by the European Union to fight Russian disinformation:\n\nGiraldi, the former CIA agent, has long been a controversial figure, claiming Israel had a role in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and claiming \"the imposed holocaust [sic] narrative is full of holes.\"\n\nAs for the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, it remains an unknown. However, the World Health Organization has said evidence indicates the pandemic began with bats in China. The WHO said in February that it was imperative to identify the exact animal source to:\n\nhelp to ensure that there will be no further future similar outbreaks with the same virus and will also help understanding the initial spread of the disease in the Wuhan area. It would also increase our understanding of the virus and help us understand how these viruses jump from animals to humans. Thus, providing critical knowledge on how to protect us from future similar events. In this regard, strengthening food control and market hygiene activities in live food market will be essential to protect people from similar and other zoonotic diseases.\n\nThe Scientific American published a profile on March 11, 2020, about Chinese virologist Shi Zhengli and headlined: \"How China's \"Bat Woman\" Hunted Down Viruses from SARS to the New Coronavirus.\" In it, Zhengli said:\n\nAs of this reporting, the WHO has reported 125,000 novel coronavirus cases worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.\n\nPress TV is a site based in Tehran and affiliated with Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting.
