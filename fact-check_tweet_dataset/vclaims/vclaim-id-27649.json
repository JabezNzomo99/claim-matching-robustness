It claims that she mocked ISRO saying, \u201cDon\u2019t undertake work that you cannot do.\u201d\n\nThe URL of the blog in question reads \u2013 \u201chttps://indiatodaydailynews.blogspot.com\u201d and also carries a logo of India Today.\n\nThe blog post claimed that Banerjee made \u2018anti-India\u2019 comments at a time when the entire country is mourning that the ISRO lost communication with Vikram Lander. \u201cShe has been making anti-India remarks on everything. From the martyrdom of the Indian army in Pulwama to the sending of Chandrayaan to ISRO,\u201d alleges the article.\n\nThe blog post has been shared on many pages and by individual users on Facebook.\n\nAt the time of writing, it had a Facebook engagement count (likes, comments and shares) of 17,000.\n\nIndia Today has an existing website with the URL \u2018indiatoday.in\u2019, and the blog in question has a \u2018blogpost.com\u2019 domain.\n\nGiven below are all the organisations under the conglomerate India Today Group and the blog does feature on the list.\n\nThe statement ascribed to Banerjee mocking ISRO was not found in any media reports. A similar sentiment was, however, expressed by Pakistani Federal Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Hussein. He tweeted on September 7, \u201cDon\u2019t undertake work that you cannot do (translated).\u201d\n\nOn the contrary, Banerjee had congratulated ISRO for Chandrayaa-2 mission.\n\nA blog impersonating as media outlet India Today attempted to portray Mamata Banerjee as unsupportive of ISRO and its scientific accomplishments. The West Bengal Chief Minister is one of the favourite targets of the misinformation ecosystem on social media.", "lang": "en"}
