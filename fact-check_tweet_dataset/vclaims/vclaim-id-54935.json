[sic],\u201d is not true. No news report about the incident made such claim and neither did a U.S. Department of Justice press release say the supplies were unsafe.\n\nThe video also features the same elements visible in an April 2 report by American Broadcasting Network of the raid, including shots of the medical supplies, the truck boxes were loaded onto, the federal officers, and the location.\n\nThe earliest traceable copy of the video online is an upload that day of YouTube channel CHInewsable, titled, \u201cFBI Bust For Hoarding and Price Gauging Medical Equipment In Boro Park Video 3.\u201d The FB version had three emojis superimposed on the bottom portion of the clip.\n\nThe inaccurate FB post has been viewed more than 1.5 million times, shared by over 75,000 people and received over 6,000 interactions.\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
