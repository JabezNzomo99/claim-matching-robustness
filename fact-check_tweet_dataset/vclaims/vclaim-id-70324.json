Outgoing Mayor Rahm Emanuel has sometimes done the same.\n\nBut what the Daley ad fails to make clear is that he is only promising to freeze a portion of the various property tax levies that make up a typical bill, not the whole thing.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s important to understand how property tax bills break down.\n\nIn Chicago, there are levies that fund city government and separate levies that fund schools, parks, Cook County government, the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District and a handful of other public agencies.\n\nLast year, only about 25 percent of a typical Chicago property tax bill covered city government, according to the Cook County Clerk\u2019s office. So holding the line on the city\u2019s levy, as Daley proposes in his ad, might slow the growth of tax bills for property owners in the city but it wouldn\u2019t contain them.\n\nBy contrast, school taxes comprised more than half of Chicago tax bills in 2017. If elected mayor, Bill Daley would gain the power to appoint the Board of Education and top schools officials and effectively control the city\u2019s education apparatus. The same goes for the Chicago Park District, whose levy made up about 5 percent of the typical bill in 2017.\n\nWe asked Daley spokesman Peter Cunningham whether the candidate\u2019s freeze pledge extended to those sister city agencies under a mayor\u2019s thumb. Cunningham, in an email, said it did not, though he stressed Daley \"will very aggressively push other taxing bodies to be efficient and to look for alternatives including new state funding \u2014 especially for schools.\"\n\nCunningham served as a spokesman for the Chicago Public Schools when Daley\u2019s brother, Richard M. Daley, was mayor. Property tax levies at CPS have annually risen even when city government holds the line.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say it would be politically or fiscally prudent to freeze the schools\u2019 portion of the property tax. The district faces chronic financial woes, and often finds it hard to make ends meet even after raising its annual property tax levy to the amount allowed under state law.\n\nIt does suggest, however, that Daley\u2019s ad skates around critical nuance of how property tax bills in Chicago are calculated.\n\nProposals like Daley\u2019s also leave out the other big question raised by the possibility of a property tax freeze: how else to come up with revenue to cover spiraling projected costs, particularly for pensions.\n\nPast mayors have managed to keep property taxes flat by employing a number of fiscal sleights of hand, including underfunding pensions.\n\nWhat was once a much smaller problem for the city\u2019s bottom line has \"snowballed\" over the years, said Amanda Kass, associate director of the Government Finance Research Center at the University of Illinois-Chicago, forcing the city to make much more significant increases in order to catch up.\n\nKass said this practice has also led Chicago residents to expect the current level of services the city provides without an increase in property taxes.\n\n\"Residents weren\u2019t feeling the full cost of services because the pensions were being underfunded,\" she said.\n\nRichard M. Daley also staved off property tax increases by spending proceeds from a controversial $1 billion long-term lease of the city\u2019s parking meters to private investors.\n\nThe tradeoff in signing away decades of meter revenue was said to be the ability to invest and grow the lease proceeds for future city needs. By late 2010, his last full year in office, Richard Daley had spent almost all of the proceeds.\n\nBill Daley\u2019s TV ad promises he would, as mayor, \"put a moratorium on tax hikes to keep families in their homes.\"\n\nThat claim is misleading. A spokesman for his campaign told us his freeze would apply only to taxes that directly fund city government. The promise does not extend to property taxes levied for schools, parks and other sister city agencies the mayor effectively controls though they comprise well over half of a typical bill.\n\nSo Daley is promising to freeze the city\u2019s direct property tax levy \u2014 but not all of the city-level property taxes Chicago homeowners pay.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
