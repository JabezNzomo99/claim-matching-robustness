That article describes how the trees were cut down in Baron Descampslaan, a neighborhood in the Belgian city of Leuven, because they needed to be replaced. Belgian politician Carl Devlies said they needed to be replaced because \u201csome trees were sick, others were crooked, and still others were showing signs of aging,\u201d according to a translation of the article.\n\nHannelore Smitz, the author of the article, told Reuters that he obtained the photo from a resident who was concerned about why the trees had been cut down. The local government has since replaced the trees, according to Reuters.
