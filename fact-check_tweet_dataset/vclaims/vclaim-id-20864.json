Pinatubo.\n\nJune 16 is a holiday only for Molave in Zamboanga del Sur and Bogo City in Cebu in celebration of the former's founding and the latter's chartering.\n\nJune 18 is the founding anniversary as well of Ifugao province and Carmen in Davao del Norte, making it a special nonworking holiday in those areas.\n\nFinally, it will only be in Rosario in Agusan del Sur where work and classes will be suspended on June 21 as the town celebrates the Yagi-Yagi Festival of Native Cultural Heritage.\n\nSucceeding suspensions in relation to bad weather will depend on the forecasts of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) or the decision of local government units. PAGASA said on June 8 the rainy season has officially begun.\n\nThe misleading story could have reached more than 1.6 million people, its biggest traffic generators from social media being Viral Facts, Philippine Trending News - PhilNews and UniqueVideos.\n\nPhilnews.ph has been publishing stories since December 2010.\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
