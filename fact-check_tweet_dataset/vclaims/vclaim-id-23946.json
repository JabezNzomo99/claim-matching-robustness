The video begins with Trump delivering a speech, followed by a voice which says \u2018Allah Hu Akbar\u2019. After this, commotion ensues as Trump is swiftly given cover by security personnel who rush to the stage.\n\nThe claim has been prevalent on social media over the last few months, shared widely by individual Facebook users on their timelines. It has also been posted on a page Main Bhi Ravish. July 2019 has seen a surge in share count.\n\nAlt News found that the video has also been shared on Twitter by some users.\n\nThe video clip is doctored, with the \u2018Allah Hu Akbar\u2019 chant added to it. Alt News reverse-searched one of the key frames of the video clip, and found several articles related to the incident. According to reports, the incident had occurred in May 2016 at Dayton, Ohio in the USA, when a protester had attempted to breach the security cordon, prompting secret service agents to rush to Trump\u2019s defense. NBC News stated,\n\n\u201cA campaign spokeswoman said that a man at the Dayton, Ohio, event \u201cattempted to breach the secure buffer and was removed rapidly and professionally.\u201d The suspect was identified as Thomas Dimassimo, 32, and was charged with disorderly conduct and inducing panic \u2014 both misdemeanors, Chief Mike Etter of the Dayton Airport Police Department told NBC News. Dimassimo jumped the bike racks and tried to climb onto the stage, but was stopped by Secret Service stationed there, Etter said.\u201d\n\nIt may be noted that in March 2016, Donald Trump was a presidential candidate of the Republican party.\n\nA video report related to the incident was published by CNN in March 2016.\n\nPosted below is a video of the same incident, shot from a different angle.\n\nAlt News found that none of the videos of the incident featured the \u2018Allah Hu Akbar\u2019 chant which is heard in the viral video. Moreover, none of the news reports of the incident make any reference to any \u2018Allah Hu Akbar\u2019 chant. The video clip, shared on social media, is clearly edited.\n\nThe same video had been used earlier to falsely claim that Donald Trump was taken aback by Mexican music which suddenly started to play when he was delivering his speech.", "lang": "en"}
