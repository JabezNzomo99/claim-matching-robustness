The claim is false; Indian police say the photo shows a statue of the minister that was vandalised in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe photo was published here on Facebook on February 27, 2020. It has been shared more than 500 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post's Hindi-language caption translates to English as: \u201cThose who shout the slogans of \u2018Jai Bhim and Jai Meem\u2019 to show unity between Muslims and lower caste Hindus, they have broken the statue of Dr Ambedkar in violence in Delhi\u2019s Seelampur locality.\u201d\n\n\u201cJai Bhim and Jai Meem\u201d is a slogan often used by Islamic political parties in India to express unity between the lower caste Hindus and Muslims, as stated in this report by the Indian newspaper Deccan Chronicle.\n\nDr. Bhimrao Ambedkar was the primary author of the Indian constitution and India\u2019s first Minister of Law and Justice. Born a Dalit, the lowest social classification in the Hindu caste system, he was also a revered civil rights leader.\n\nDelhi has experienced its worst sectarian violence in decades, triggered by a new citizenship law which critics say discriminates against Muslims. More than 42 people have been killed and hundreds injured in the violence after it broke out on February 23, 2020. Here is an AFP report on the clashes.\n\nThe photo was also shared alongside a similar claim here, here and here on Facebook; and here and here on Twitter.\n\nMahesh Pal, a local police officer, told AFP that the photo in the misleading post was taken in the Karaundi Kala area of Uttar Pradesh.\n\n\u201cThe statue is in a park in Karaundi Kala and was damaged on February 25, 2020,\" he said during a phone interview on March 3, 2020. \"We have not made any arrests and our investigation is on, though we suspect some children while playing cricket in the park have broken it.\u201d\n\nThe photo was also published on Twitter here on February 25, 2020. The tweet, which includes another photo of the broken statue taken from a different angle, also states that the incident occurred in Karaundi Kala.\n\nLocal police responded to the tweet here, stating police action was taken following the incident.\n\nThe tweet from Sultanpur police translates to English as: \u201cIn the above mentioned case, the inspector in Karaundi Kala was informed and a police case is being registered in this regard.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
