Most probably to break his Ramadan fast.\u201d Twitter user @BurpingI posted the viral video along with the text. Since then it has been viewed over 10,000 times. Due to the violent and disturbing nature of the clip, Alt News isn\u2019t embedding it in the article. Readers can watch the video here (archive link).\n\nAlt News performed a keyword search on Google and found several related results. The same video was published by TV9 Gujarati\u2019s YouTube channel on April 7.\n\nAccording to the report, the incident took place in Limbayat area of Surat. During the broadcast, reporter Parul informed that the man who is slapping the other person is Salman. Another video report by ABP Gujarati confirms the same.\n\nThe incident was also reported by Dainik Bhaskar and Divya Bhaskar on April 8. As per the reports, the man behaved violently because he didn\u2019t want the victim to testify against a person named Ramzan. In fact, Salman can be heard instructing the same to the victim in the video. This can be heard onward the 38th-second mark. While repeatedly slapping the victim, Salman says in Hindi, \u201cWill you now confess Ramzan\u2019s name? Should I give [you] to the DCP? Will you confess Ramzan\u2019s name? C\u2019mon strip naked. Should I strip you naked and parade you publicly?\u201d It is possible that the name \u2018Ramzan\u2019 might have led to the rumour that the incident has something to do with the festival of Ramzan. \n\n\n\nAs per the Divya Bhaskar report, the car seen in the video belonged to Surat Municipal Corporation\u2019s garden department. One can spot \u2018SMC\u2019 written on the car. Divya Bhaskar\u2019s report also added that Limbayat police inspector VM Makwana said that a complaint would be lodged against the accused. Alt News spoke with Makwana who confirmed that a complaint has been filed. \u201cBoth the men in the video are from the Muslim community. Therefore the social media claim is wrong.\u201d\n\nThat a Muslim man was beaten and forced to lick the spittle of a Hindu man is not true. Both the perpetrator and the victim hailed from the same community.", "lang": "en"}
