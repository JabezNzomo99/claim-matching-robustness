Illustrated below is a comparison between the images of the Google CEO and the man in the viral video.\n\nNext, we broke the video into several keyframes using the InVid Google Chrome extension and followed it up with a reverse image search. This helped us access a longer version of the video on YouTube. This version carried a name band in the beginning which identified the person in the video as educationist Ganesh Kohli.\n\nGanesh Kohli is the founder of the IC3 Movement which will be impacting around 175000 high schools in next 15 years. The Movement also supports free education for school teachers so that they become trained career and school counsellors. We also found a tweet by Kohli where he had himself called out the misleading claim with which the video is being circulated.\n\nA 3 year old @ic3movement video of me meeting my teacher began to go viral last month. Over time, in many circles, the video was attributed to @sundarpichai or @satyanadella While the message of the video is most important, how do you address this #misinformation @KarthikOnTheGo \u2014 Ganesh Kohli (@GaneshKohli) August 14, 2020", "lang": "en"}
