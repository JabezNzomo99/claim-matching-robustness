Tony Evers called the Republican-controlled legislature into a special session days before the April 7, 2020 election in an effort to convert it to mail only. Local leaders, including Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and Green Bay Mayor Eric Genrich echoed that request.\n\nAs we know, it never happened, and in-person voting occurred despite public health concerns. But Wisconsin will hold two more statewide elections this year, plus a special election for the 7th Congressional District seat on May 12.\n\nCould we do it then?\n\nState Sen. Chris Kapenga, R-Delafield, broached the subject in an April 6, 2020, email to a constituent who wanted lawmakers to postpone the election and move it to mail. The constituent shared the email exchange with PolitiFact Wisconsin, wondering if it was true.\n\n\"Some have advocated for moving to an absentee only election or mailing every registered voter in the state a ballot,\" Kapenga wrote. \"Currently, this is illegal.\"\n\nIs it? Let\u2019s see how Kapenga\u2019s claim rates.\n\nWhen asked for evidence to support Kapenga\u2019s claim, the senator\u2019s office provided an analysis of state statute from the Wisconsin Legislative Council.\n\nWhat does the law say?\n\nWisconsin currently requires elections to be held at polling places \u2014 generally a public building \u2014 which means those sites need to be open for voting to some extent. Any voter can choose instead to request an absentee ballot and vote by mail, an option more than 1 million voters took advantage of on April 7.\n\nA vote-by-mail election would also be at odds with Wisconsin\u2019s longstanding policy of allowing same-day voter registration at the polls.\n\nBut conducting an election entirely by mail would require a change to state statute. Even states like Washington that are billed as vote by mail still operate voting centers for people to cast ballots before and on Election Day.\n\n\"Some people with disabilities need to use accessible voting equipment,\" noted Reid Magney, spokesman for the Wisconsin Elections Commission.\n\nState law also says that local clerks must receive a written application from a voter to issue an absentee ballot, so they can\u2019t simply send them to everyone. They can, however, legally mail ballot applications to voters.\n\nThe City of Milwaukee took advantage of that allowance and is establishing a program for the fall elections that will mail applications and postage-paid return envelopes to voters, in an effort to prevent lines at polling places.\n\nSo, the law is clear: Wisconsin can\u2019t hold an election entirely by mail or send ballots to registered voters.\n\nBut whether that remains true for August and November remains to be seen. Democrats have introduced legislation that would move them primarily to mail, though some polling locations would be open for voters who have a disability or struggle to read, write or understand English.\n\nKapenga told a constituent that it\u2019s currently illegal to hold an absentee-only election or mail ballots to every registered voter.\n\nState statute does prohibit both measures as currently written. Lawmakers could change that, but it\u2019s unclear if or when that will happen.", "lang": "en"}
