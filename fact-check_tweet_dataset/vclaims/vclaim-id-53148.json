The purported remedies include a daily dose of vitamins; exposure to sunlight; and a diet of alkaline foods. The claims are false; as of June 29, 2020, experts say there is no known cure for COVID-19; AFP has previously debunked hoax claims about the purported coronavirus symptoms and remedies.\n\nThe photo was published on Facebook here on June 22, 2020. It has been shared more than 200 times.\n\nThe photo purports to show COVID-19 treatments being used on \u201cpatients recovering from hospital\u201d and other relevant information about the disease.\n\nThe photo was shared on Facebook here, here and here, and on Twitter here.\n\nIt has also been shared hundreds of times by US-based social media users on Facebook here, and on Instagram here.\n\nHealth experts, however, say the claims are false.\n\nPart of the text in the misleading photo reads: \u201cGOODBYE CORONA VIRUS / INFORMATION FROM PATIENTS RECOVERING FROM HOSPITAL \u2026 / DAILY / 1. TAKE VIT C-1000 / 2. VITAMIN E / 3. 10:00 - 11:00 SUNLIGHT FOR 15-20 MINUTES. / 4. EGG ONE ITEM / 5. TAKE A REST / GET 7-8 HOUR MIN / 6. DRINK 1.5 L OF WATER DAILY AND EVERY MEAL SHOULD BE WARM (NOT COLD). / THAT\u2019S WHAT WE DO AT THE HOSPITAL.\u201d\n\nThis supposed treatment for COVID-19 is \u201coutrightly wrong,\u201d said Dr. Jason Alacapa, the chief executive officer of the Philippine nonprofit Innovations for Community Health.\n\n\u201cThese are generic recommendations to help improve overall health,\u201d Alacapa told AFP in a Facebook message on June 27, 2020. Their benefits are \u201cnon-specific to coronavirus infection,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone could do them.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) also refuted the claims.\n\n\u201cConsuming eggs, exposure to sunlight, warm meals and vitamins do not kill the coronavirus,\u201d a WHO Philippines representative told AFP in an email on June 28, 2020. \u201cThe best way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is to keep at least 1 meter away from others and to wash your hands frequently and thoroughly.\u201d\n\nAs of June 29, 2020, international health authorities say that no treatment has yet been proven to effectively treat COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWhile some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of mild COVID-19, there are no medicines that have been shown to prevent or cure the disease,\u201d the WHO states here. \u201cWHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19.\u201d\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also notes here that \u201cthere are no drugs or other therapeutics\u201d that have been approved for treating COVID-19.\n\n\u201cCurrent clinical management includes infection prevention and control measures and supportive care, including supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilatory support when indicated,\u201d the agency adds.\n\nThe text in the photo also states: \u201cTHE PH FOR THE CORONARY VIRUS (sic) VARIES FROM 5.5 TO 8.5 / WHAT WE NEED TO DO, TO DEFEAT THE CORONARY VIRUS, IS TO CONSUME MORE ALKALINE FOODS ABOVE THE VIRUS\u2019S PH LEVEL.\u201d\n\nThis too is false. Health experts say there is no evidence that eating alkaline foods can prevent or cure COVID-19, as reported by AFP here.\n\nThe latter part of the post states: \u201cHOW DID YOU KNOW YOU HAD A CORONAVIRUS? / 1. ITCHING IN THE THROAT / 2. DRY THROAT / 3. DRY COUGH / 4. HIGH TEMPERATURE / 5. SHORTNESS OF BREATH / 6. LOSS OF SMELL AND TASTE\u201d.\n\nThis claim is misleading; COVID-19 symptoms vary widely and some patients never develop symptoms, experts say.\n\n\u201cSeveral studies have documented SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) and in patients not yet symptomatic (pre-symptomatic),\u201d the CDC states here. SARS-CoV-2 is the name of the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nAs of June 28, 2020, the Philippine health department says there were at least 898 asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 in the country.", "lang": "en"}
