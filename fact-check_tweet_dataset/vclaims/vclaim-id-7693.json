It was originally published on the Medium.com-hosted Extra Newsfeed, but was picked up and reposted elsewhere, including by a website called POTUS Press, which did not expressly identify it as satire.\n\n\u201cThanx FOX\u2026.Roseanne is a comedian\u2026sometimes she says funny things, sometimes out of line but she did apologize\u2026.unlike other Hollywoods \u2018stars\u2019 acting like politicians,\u201d one Facebook user wrote with a link to the original story.\n\nAnother commenter posted: \u201cFox picked her up \u2013 Money to be made\u2026. ABC\u2019s loss\u2026 oh well\u2026.Time to make America great again Sorry I love her show\u2026.\u201d\n\nWhile the headline of the story \u2014 \u201cFOX Network Picks Up \u2018Roseanne,\u2019 Saying It Has No Problem With Occasional Racism\u201d \u2014 might betray its satirical intent to some, the torrent of headlines around Barr and her TV sitcom might have helped generate confusion.\n\nNewsweek, for example, published a story about fans\u2019 hopes for Fox to continue the show. An entertainment critic at Yahoo, examining Fox News\u2019 coverage of the issue, wrote a piece titled \u201cFox News is now leading the resurrect-\u2018Roseanne\u2019 campaign.\u201d\n\nAnd other satirical stories about the show going to Fox or other networks also circulated. (One story\u2019s headline read: \u201cBREAKING: Roseanne Finds A New Home At Fox.\u201d)\n\nThe controversy began May 29 after Barr tweeted about Valerie Jarrett, who was a senior White House adviser to former President Barack Obama. The tweet, which has since been deleted, said, \u201cmuslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj.\u201d Jarrett, who was born in Iran, is African American.\n\nAs an outcry over the remark grew, ABC announced it would end the show. The series, which originally aired from 1988 to 1997, had returned to that network in March and was a ratings success.\n\nThe story is far from the first satirical piece to have deceived readers. Many of the stories we\u2019ve debunked were conceived as that brand of humor, but republished by other sites that didn\u2019t label them as such.\n\nIshac, the writer of the \u201cRoseanne\u201d moving to Fox story, told us in a May 31 email that \u201cthe piece went viral\u2014it\u2019s done 450K views today alone.\u201d\n\nHe added that he has been writing political satire, largely aimed at President Donald Trump, since October 2016 and that he posts everyday on Medium.com.\n\n\u201cAs you know, satire is an effective, time-honored form of political protest that predates \u2018fake news\u2019 by at least 300 years,\u201d Ishac said. \u201cI\u2019m doing nothing that hasn\u2019t been done by many writers, most of them better than I, for centuries.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\nBradley, Laura. \u201cYes, Roseanne Is Now the No. 1 Show on TV.\u201d Vanity Fair. 18 Apr 2018.\n\nIshac, Allan. \u201cFOX Network Picks Up \u2018Roseanne,\u2019 Saying It Has No Problem With Occasional Racism.\u201d Extra Newsfeed. 30 May 2018.\n\nIshac, Allan.
