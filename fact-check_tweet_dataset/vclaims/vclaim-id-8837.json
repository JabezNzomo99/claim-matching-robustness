According to one definition, most Southern trains ran on time last month. According to the other, most did not.\n\nThe debate comes off the back of a protest by commuters at Victoria station on Monday over Southern rail delays and the train operator\u2019s decision to temporarily cut 341 trains a day.\n\nGovia Thameslink Railway, which owns Southern, introduced a reduced timetable at the beginning of this week in order to make services 'better and more consistent' as it deals with industrial action.\n\nWithin five minutes is 'on time' for some services\n\n'On time' doesn't refer to trains arriving on the dot, it's used for trains which arrive within a certain number of minutes of the scheduled arrival time.\n\n\"A train is defined as on time if it arrives at the destination within five minutes (4 minutes 59 seconds or less) of the planned arrival time for London and South East or regional services, or 10 minutes (9 minutes 59 seconds or less) for long distance services.\"\n\nThese definitions are based on the Public Performance Measure (PPM), which is an industry standard for punctuality.\n\nSo, in Southern's case, trains that arrive up to five minutes later than scheduled are counted as 'on time'.\n\nThe latest figures on punctuality cover the period from the 29 May to 25 June 2016. During this period, when industrial action intensified, 55.8% of trains arrived within five minutes of their arrival time\u2014leaving 44.2% which did not. That's the figure the BBC features in its reports.\n\nThese results are the second lowest of any train operator nationally: only the Gatwick Express, at 54.9%, had fewer trains arriving within five minutes of stated arrival time.\n\nAnother measure used in the industry is \u2018right time performance\u2019 (RTP), which is trains arriving within a minute of their arrival time. Only 31.4% of Southern trains arrived on time between 29 until 25 June according to RTP. Gatwick express is again the only operator with a lower rate: 30.2%.\n\nThis particular measure isn't considered to be a reliable measure of performance: the figures aren't completely accurate and, Network Rail argues, don't reflect levels of passenger satisfaction.\n\nSo, two definitions of on time. According to one, most trains have Southern trains ran on time last month. According to the other, most did not.\n\nSouthern says that since it introduced the temporary reduced timetable, the service has become less overstretched and \u2018more robust\u2019. But newspapers have reported delays and overcrowding.\n\nOn Monday, the train operator said 92% of all services that had run by 8.30 am that day had been on time. It updated this later in the day, at 4.30 pm, when it said 82% of all trains that day had run on time.\n\nWe have since spoken to Southern and confirmed that it is using the Public Performance Measure\u2014so this is the percentage of trains that have arrived within five minutes of their stated arrival time.\n\nSouthern added its staff had not reported any incidents of overcrowding on platforms or trains. We\u2019ve asked if reported overcrowding refers to unsafe levels of passengers on trains or platforms\u2014or if it includes safe but busy numbers of passengers as well. Some passengers have reported otherwise.\n\nSouthern has said passengers can report overcrowding to customer services.\n\nSouthern has today published summary figures on punctuality. About 63% of trains arrived at their destination within five minutes of the stated time last week (before the timetable was reduced), compared to 80% for Monday to Thursday this week. 89% is the average across the rail network, it says.\n\nWe're pleased to see the operator's latest press release explains the definition\u2014in this case\u2014of 'on time'.", "lang": "en"}
