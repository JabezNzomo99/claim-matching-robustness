It didn\u2019t start with Trump\u2019s bungled messaging downplaying the crisis even as it\u2019s worsened, nor with his mid-March insistence that social distancing measures could be lifted by Easter (he later backpedaled). It began in April 2018 \u2014 more than a year and a half before the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, sickened enough people in China that authorities realized they were dealing with a new disease. The Trump administration, with John Bolton newly at the helm of the White House National Security Council, began dismantling the team in charge of pandemic response, firing its leadership and disbanding the team in spring 2018. The cuts, coupled with the administration\u2019s repeated calls to cut the budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other public health agencies, made it clear that the Trump administration wasn\u2019t prioritizing the federal government\u2019s ability to respond to disease outbreaks. That lack of attention to preparedness, experts say, helps explain why the Trump administration has consistently botched its response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn response to such criticisms, U.S. President Donald Trump sought to affix blame on other people and entities, including his predecessor in the White House, Barack Obama:\n\nTrump\u2019s critics countered his excuses by, among other means, producing a video clip said to date from 2014 (a full five years before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic) and seemingly showing Obama strongly urging that the U.S. invest in creating an infrastructure for dealing with an \u201cairborne disease that is deadly\u201d that would \u201callow us to see it quickly, isolate it quickly, respond to it quickly\u201d:\n\n\n\n This is indeed a correctly identified video clip which captured Obama\u2019s remarks when he paid a Dec. 2, 2014, visit to campus of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, to call for more funding for Ebola research:\n\nPresident Barack Obama visited the NIH campus on Dec. 2 to see firsthand the progress that biomedical research is making against Ebola virus disease. The President toured the NIH Vaccine Research Center and met with scientists who are working hard to develop ways to combat this deadly virus that continues to devastate West Africa. And, in a speech before a packed auditorium at the NIH Clinical Center, the President praised the contributions of NIH staff. He also emphasized the need for emergency Congressional authorization of resources to ensure that the nation\u2019s research and public health efforts against Ebola will lead as quickly as possible to an end to this devastating outbreak. Obama stressed the importance of investing in research for the long term. \u201cIf and when a new strain of flu, like the Spanish flu, crops up five years from now or a decade from now, we\u2019ve made the investment and we\u2019re further along to be able to catch it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a smart investment for us to make. It\u2019s not just insurance; it is knowing that down the road we\u2019re going to continue to have problems like this \u2014 particularly in a globalized world where you move from one side of the world to the other in a day.\u201d\n\nA full transcript of Obama\u2019s address at the NIH can be viewed here, while the portion excerpted in the video clip seen above read as follows:\n\nWe can\u2019t say we\u2019re lucky with Ebola because obviously it\u2019s having a devastating effect in West Africa, but it is not airborne in its transmission. There may and likely will come a time in which we have both an airborne disease that is deadly. And in order for us to deal with that effectively, we have to put in place an infrastructure \u2014 not just here at home, but globally \u2014 that allows us to see it quickly, isolate it quickly, respond to it quickly. And it also requires us to continue the same path of basic research that is being done here at NIH that [Dr.] Nancy [Sullivan] is a great example of. So that if and when a new strain of flu, like the Spanish flu, crops up five years from now or a decade from now, we\u2019ve made the investment and we\u2019re further along to be able to catch it. It is a smart investment for us to make. It\u2019s not just insurance; it is knowing that down the road we\u2019re going to continue to have problems like this \u2014 particularly in a globalized world where you move from one side of the world to the other in a day. So this is important now \u2026", "lang": "en"}
