Senator [Mitch] McConnell would tell anyone who listened that the Senate had the right to advise and consent. And that was every bit as important as the president\u2019s right to nominate. Millions of people are just months away from determining the Senators who should vote to confirm or reject the president\u2019s nominee. And their voices deserve to be heard now, as Leader McConnell thought they should deserved to be heard then. Anything but that would be the absolute height of hypocrisy. People from all across America should realize that their rights and opportunities are threatened. Americans should make their voices heard loudly, clearly and consistently. Americans should make it clear that they will not tolerate a nominee chosen from President Trump\u2019s pre-ordained list, selected by powerful special interests, who will reverse the progress we\u2019ve made over the decades.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the rub: the Republican position, whether you disagreed with it or not, clearly was based on the fact that it was a presidential election year.\n\n\u201cCan our Supreme Court nomination and confirmation processes, so racked by discord and bitterness, be repaired in a Presidential election year? History teaches us that this is extremely unlikely. Some of our Nation\u2019s most bitter and heated confirmation fights have come in Presidential election years. The bruising confirmation fight over Roger Taney\u2019s nomination in 1836; the Senate\u2019s refusal to confirm four nominations by President Tyler in 1844; the single vote rejections of nominees Badger and Black by lameduck Presidents Fillmore and Buchanan, in the mid-19th century; and the narrow approvals of Justices Lamar and Fuller in 1888 are just some examples of these fights in the 19th century.\u201d\n\nBiden, of course, later rejected the idea that he was opposed to going forward with all Supreme Court nominations; he insisted he was only opposed to an \u201cextreme candidate\u201d without proper consultation with the Senate. \u201cI made it absolutely clear that I would go forward with the confirmation process, as chairman \u2014 even a few months before a presidential election \u2014 if the nominee were chosen with the advice, and not merely the consent, of the Senate \u2014 just as the Constitution requires,\u201d he said in 2016. \u201cThere is no Biden rule. It doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, there was supposedly a \u201cThurmond rule,\u201d named after the late Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), that work should halt on judicial nominations at some point during a presidential election year. But after Biden made his speech, Thurmond rejected the idea of not considering a Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year. So even Thurmond apparently did not believe in the Thurmond rule.\n\nSchumer, in mid-2007, even suggested that because Democrats were \u201choodwinked\u201d by the confirmation testimony of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, no more nominees should be confirmed for the balance of George W. Bush\u2019s term, even though he had 18 months left. The point was that it was the end of a presidency:\n\n\u201cFor the rest of this President\u2019s term and if there is another Republican elected with the same selection criteria let me say this: We should reverse the presumption of confirmation. The Supreme Court is dangerously out of balance. We cannot afford to see Justice Stevens replaced by another Roberts; or Justice Ginsburg by another Alito. Given the track record of this President and the experience of obfuscation at the hearings, with respect to the Supreme Court, at least: I will recommend to my colleagues that we should not confirm a Supreme Court nominee EXCEPT in extraordinary circumstances.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
