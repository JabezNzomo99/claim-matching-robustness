Naturally, the woman then donned her bulletproof vest, busted out her personal AK-47 assault rifle and saved the officers by firing off 160 rounds at the gang members.\n\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe article originally appeared online in 2015 on World News Daily Report, a website with a disclaimer page saying, \"All characters appearing in the articles in this website \u2013 even those based on real people \u2013 are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.\"\n\n \n\n Since then, numerous fake news websites have copy-pasted the story, presenting it as a true act of heroism.\n\nIn addition to the text being fabricated, the photo caption of the officers who were supposedly saved misidentifies the officers in the photo. That picture originates from a 2010 blog about Melrose Village \u2014 a different neighborhood than the one where the incident supposedly took place.\n\nWe rate this story \u2014 written as a joke nearly three years ago \u2014 Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
