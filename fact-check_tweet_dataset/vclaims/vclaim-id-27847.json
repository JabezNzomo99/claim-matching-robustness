However, at the very same time police who were deputed to watch over the protests intervened and carried out their national duty by thrashing the party workers, the post claims.\n\nBOOM broke up the video into key frames and did reverse image search. The search showed that the video was from a police crackdown of a protest by Congress workers in Chhattisgarh on September 18, 2018.\n\n52 party workers were arrested while seven suffered injuries according to a Press Trust of India report.\n\nCongress President Rahul Gandhi had also tweeted the video criticising then Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh.\n\nWe also found several news reports including those by The Indian Express, The Hindu ,India Today and Press Trust of India.\n\nNone of the news reports have any mention of Congress workers shouting 'Pakistan zindabad' as the reason for the crackdown.\n\nAccording to news reports Congress workers were protesting against the remarks of industries minister Amar Agrawal where he allegedly referred to the party as \"kachra\" or garbage.\n\n\n\nIt is not clear what specifically triggered the crackdown by police. Indian Express citing a senior police official said Congress workers had broken through the barricades and scuffled with policemen.\n\nMeanwhile PTI reported the following.\n\n\"Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Neeraj Chandrakar claimed that Congress workers threw garbage inside the minister's house and also manhandled a policewoman and some male constables, following which a case was registered against them.\n\nThe protesters then went to the district Congressoffice and staged a sit-in, the police officer said.\n\nWhen police tried to arrest them, Congress workers again got into scuffles with police, so \"mild force\" was used to arrest the workers against whom the case had been lodged, Chandrakar said.\"", "lang": "en"}
