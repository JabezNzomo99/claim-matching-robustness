When you look at all adults across England, Scotland and Wales, according to the survey it\u2019s still the case that more people are dissatisfied with the government\u2019s Chequers deal than satisfied, but to a lesser extent.\n\nLeave voters are about as dissatisfied with the government\u2019s general negotiating approach as the general population.\n\nWhat does the data say?\n\nThe data comes from a YouGov/Times survey of a representative group of British adults on the ongoing Brexit negotiations\u2014specifically the so-called \u201cChequers deal\u201d.\n\nIt found that more people are not in favour of the deal than in favour of the deal. It also found that 40% of adults in Great Britain thought the deal was too soft, 12% thought it was too hard, 13% thought the balance was right, and the remaining 35% answered \u201cnone of these\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d.\n\nThe data in the claim which showed a majority opposing the deal looked only at the results of the people surveyed who voted Leave in the 2016 referendum. The post referred to Theresa May \u201cpissing off most of the nation\u201d.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that leave voters were \u201cmost\u201d of the people who voted in the 2016 referendum, Leave voters are not \u201cmost of the nation\u201d. In mid-2016 there were an estimated 52 million adults in the UK, of whom 17 million (34%) voted leave. So it\u2019s inaccurate to use figures for Leave voters only to describe \u201cmost of the nation\u201d.\n\nLeave voters are more negative about the deal than the population as a whole, and according to this survey, a majority of them (54%) would be unhappy if the Chequers deal went ahead. They\u2019re also less likely to think the deal hit the right balance between \u201csoft\u201d and \u201chard\u201d Brexit.\n\nNevertheless across the population far more people appear to be unhappy with the Chequers deal than are happy with it (no matter which way the voted in the referendum). And a large majority of those surveyed (75%) think that the government is handling Brexit negotiations either \u201cfairly badly\u201d or \u201cvery badly\u201d.\n\nAs with all surveys, there is a margin of error with the data. YouGov designed the survey, to ensure the views of the people it surveyed represent the views of the public, through sampling and weighting. However there are some factors that it\u2019s still worth bearing in mind.\n\nThis survey only covers adults in Great Britain. So the people of Northern Ireland are not represented. Northern Ireland as a whole voted for Remain (unlike Great Britain) and issues around the Irish border may mean that Northern Irish people view the Chequers deal and ongoing negotiations in a different way from the rest of the UK. Therefore excluding their views on the deal and negotiations may skew the results of the data overall.\n\nAlso, there are fewer non-voters included in the survey than in the general population, it counts around 1,420 voters out of the total sample of 1,730\u2014 a turnout of 82% among all adults in Great Britain. The turnout among registered voters on the day of the EU referendum was only 72% among registered voters.\n\nNon-voters surveyed were more likely to answer \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d to the survey questions. So under-representing their views may also have skewed the results away from the \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d responses.\n\nYouGov told us it deliberately doesn\u2019t include as many non-voters as were observed in the referendum for two reasons.\n\nFirstly, it expects that some of the 1,420 people saying in the survey they voted Remain or Leave, did not in fact vote.\n\nSecondly it questioned the 72% turnout figure saying incompleteness, inaccuracy and double-registration in the register mean that the turnout could have in fact been higher than 72%. Though it did say this could have improved following the move from household electoral registration to individual electoral registration in 2014.\n\nThe Electoral Commission said that individual registration has improved the situation, there is the potential for further improvements to remedy these issues.\n\nThirdly, it said that polls struggle to contact the most politically disengaged people, and so weighting up the share of non-voters could also skew the figures by overemphasising the views of \u201cengaged non-voters\u201d. \u201cUnengaged non-voters\u201d may have different views that haven\u2019t been captured.", "lang": "en"}
