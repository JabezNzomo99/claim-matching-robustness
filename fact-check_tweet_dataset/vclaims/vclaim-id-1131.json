Users claim the image is a hidden photograph of \u201cthe real Aunt Jemima\u201d, referring to Nancy Green, the original model of the famous pancake mix brand. The photograph in the claim is actually a self-portrait of white artist Sally Stockhold, which was staged to make her resemble Aunt Jemima.\n\nExamples of the claim are visible here , here , here , here , here .\n\nThe photograph ( bit.ly/3eAzeJC ) titled \u201cAunt Jemima: I laughed because they paid me\u201d is part of a self-portrait collection by Stockhold.\n\nAccording to a statement here , Stockhold\u2019s intention was to acknowledge \u201caccomplished women from history and fiction\u201d who have not been fairly remembered through time. Gertrude Stein, Alice B.Toklas and Frida Kahlo are among other women featured in Stockhold\u2019s collection.\n\nThe artist told Reuters via email that she was deeply moved by Green\u2019s history and therefore wanted to include her in this collection. \u201cIt saddens me that the irony of her laughing while being chained to the tabled filled with the pancakes that she has labored over may have been misinterpreted.\u201d\n\nThe Aunt Jemima brand has been criticized for romanticizing the Antebellum South ( bit.ly/3eCQ2zF see page 60) and perpetuating imagery of the \u201cmammy\u201d, a racial caricature of African American women (here).\n\nAccording to the Jim Crow Museum (an institution that displays objects of intolerance to promote social justice), the mammy caricature was used during slavery and the Jim Crow era as proof that black women \u201cwere contented, even happy, as slaves\u201d, suggesting \u201cThe slavery-era mammy did not want to be free.\u201d ( here )\n\nIn the book \u201cMammy: A Century of Race, Gender and Southern Memory\u201d, Kimberly Wallace-Sanders, associate professor at Emory University, attributes Aunt Jemima\u2019s success to the \u201chappy slave mythology\u201d ( bit.ly/3eCQ2zF ).\u201cAn African American woman, pretending to be a slave, was pivotal to the trademark\u2019s commercial achievement in 1893. Its success revolved around the fantasy of returning a black woman to a sanitized version of slavery\u201d, writes Wallace-Sanders (page 61).\n\nIn an op-ed for NBC News, writer Michael Twitty discussed his concern over the mixed reactions at the brand\u2019s recent retirement: \u201cAs pleasant and formative an experience as the memory of this particular brand mascot might be for some white people, it\u2019s also the root of the problem.\u201d He describes Aunt Jemima\u2019s character \u201can invitation to white people to indulge in a fantasy of enslaved people \u2014 and by extension, all of Black America \u2014 as submissive, self-effacing, loyal, pacified and pacifying. It positions Black people as boxed in, prepackaged and ready to satisfy; it\u2019s the problem of all consumption, only laced with racial overtones.\u201d ( here ).\n\nAccording to Maurice M. Manring, Aunt Jemima adverts sold the idea of \u201cthe lifestyle once created for plantation mistresses\u201d made easy by the efforts of female slaves. Manring adds, \u201cWhite housewives did not aspire to be Aunt Jemima; they aspired to have her. They were buying the idea of a slave, in a box.\u201d ( bit.ly/2NxcZbJ ).\n\nThe Aunt Jemima brand was developed in 1889, named after the song \u201cOld Aunt Jemima\u201d, which was featured in 19th-century minstrel shows ( here ). In 1893, Nancy Green, a former slave from Kentucky, became the first woman to portray Aunt Jemima at the World\u2019s Fair in Chicago ( www.auntjemima.com/our-history ), where \u201cshe sang songs, cooked pancakes and told stories about the Old South [\u2026] that presented it as a happy place for blacks and whites alike.\u201d ( here ) A compilation of the brand\u2019s evolution and advertising campaigns is visible here .\n\nOn the hundredth anniversary of the brand in 1989, the Quaker Oats Company removed the brand\u2019s image headband and gave her pearl earrings ( here ) allegedly to move Aunt Jemima\u2019s image away from the original slave figure. However, these changes seemed to be \u201csubtle rather than substantive\u201d, according to Brian D. Behnken and Gregory D. Smithers, the authors of \u201cRacism in American Popular Media\u201d ( bit.ly/3eAd8qP , see page 30).\n\nStockhold\u2019s photo has recently gained attention amid a national debate over racial inequality in the U.S. during which PepsiCo Inc announced it will change the name and brand image of Aunt Jemima\u2019s pancake mix and syrup, after recognizing the origins of the brand \u201care based on a racial stereotype\u201d. ( here )\n\nRegarding to this decision, Marcus Hayes, great-great-great-nephew of Nancy Green, told WBEZ here ) that while understanding the sensitivity of the name and the brand, \u201cI don\u2019t want Nancy Green\u2019s legacy and what she did under that name to be lost.\u201d\n\nFalse. The photograph in the social media posts is not a real image of Nancy Green, who was the face of the brand Aunt Jemima, but rather a self-portrait photograph staged and taken in 2008 by an artist.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
