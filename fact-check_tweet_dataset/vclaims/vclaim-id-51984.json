Data on the topic is limited.\n\nAn estimate from 2013 put the number of ICU beds in 76 public hospitals at 1,178. It\u2019s possible that this figure has changed since then. The department of health did not respond to numerous requests for clarity.\n\nAn analysis from 2018 estimated that there were 2,140 ICU beds in 204 private hospitals.
