I want to say once again:there has never been and I hope there will never be any state system to support doping. On the contrary, there will only be the fight against doping,\" Putin said.\n\nPutin has steadfastly denied the existence of a state-sponsored sports doping program, a message echoed by other Russian officials.\n\n\u201cRussia has never created [a doping program]. It is simply impossible and we will do everything to prove that this never happened, the state doping system or support of performance-enhancing drugs,\u201d Putin said at his annual year-end press conference in December 2016.\n\nRussian officials began to circle the wagons after the McLaren report (part one) (part two) found widespread, state-sanctioned doping in Russian sport.\n\nThe report by independent Canadian expert Richard McLaren led to Russia's track-and-field athletes being banned from the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janerio.\n\nThe entire Russian team was also banned from taking part in the Paralympic Games.\n\nAnd Russian athletes still remain banned from international competition.\n\nRussia's wall of denial did appear to crack at the end of 2016.\n\nRussia\u2019s anti-doping chief admitted to systematic doping of athletes in an interview with The New York Times.\n\n\u201cIt was an institutional conspiracy,\u201d Anna Antseliovich, the acting director general of Russia\u2019s national antidoping agency, RUSADA, told the U.S. daily in the report published on December 27.\n\nThe New York Times report summarized the scope of the doping scheme:\n\nA lab director tampered with urine samples at the Olympics and provided cocktails of performance-enhancing drugs, corrupting some of the world\u2019s most prestigious competitions. Members of the Federal Security Service, a successor to the K.G.B., broke into sample bottles holding urine. And a deputy sports minister for years ordered cover-ups of top athletes\u2019 use of banned substances.\n\nHowever, Antseliovich rejected charges the doping campaign was \u201cstate-sponsored,\u201d and denied that any top government officials, including Putin, were involved.\n\nAlong with RUSADA, the Kremlin quickly slammed the New York Times report, claiming Rebecca Ruiz, the reporter who spoke to Antseliovich over several days, had \u201cdistorted and taken out of context\u201d her comments on the McLaren report.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov added that RUSADA had no authority to make such remarks because the matter is being dealt with by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation.\n\nNew York Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades defended the accuracy of the report.\n\n\"We are confident in the accuracy of our story, which quotes Ms. Antseliovich fairly, accurately and extensively,\" she told CNN.\n\nIn his comments in Krasnoyarsk on March 1, Putin did admit Russia's anti-doping efforts had \"not worked.\"\n\n\"This is our fault, and it is necessary to say this directly and admit it,\" Putin said.\n\nHe said he was counting on federal investigators to \"identify all who are guilty in this situation,\" according to a transcript posted on the Kremlin's website.\n\nThe first McLaren report, released in July 2016, accused Russia's Sports Ministry and Federal Security Service of being part of an elaborate scheme to manipulate drug tests during the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi.\n\nIn the second report, released in early December 2016, McLaren noted that more than 1,000 Russian athletes across 30 disciplines had taken part in a campaign devised by Sports Ministry officials to use banned substances during the 2014 Winter Olympics, as well as at the 2012 London Olympics and a host of other events.\n\n\"It was a cover-up that evolved over the years from uncontrolled chaos to an institutionalized and disciplined medal-winning strategy and conspiracy; a cover-up that operated on an unprecedented scale,\" McLaren told a news conference to release the second report.\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which commissioned the McLaren report, has urged Russia admit to state-sponsored doping in a bid to regain the trust of the sporting world.\n\n\"It would be better if they were maybe a little bit more contrite,\" WADA President Craig Reedie said in November 2016.", "lang": "en"}
