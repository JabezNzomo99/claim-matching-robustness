At the start of 2014, the Midwest, East Coast and parts of Canada experienced brutally cold temperatures, some of them record-breaking. We\u2019ve seen pitiable tweets from and tales of people in the name of cold-weather science. But what really caught our eye was the number of people comparing the climates of Earth and Mars.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of about different cities being colder than Mars: Minneapolis, Toronto, Chicago, you name it. Outlets like and also spread the information around with more nuanced reports.\n\nPolitiFact is owned by the Tampa Bay Times, which is based in sunny St. Petersburg, Fla., so not everyone on staff is a cold-weather expert. So we touched base with scientists to see whether the United States and Canada really have been colder than Mars.\n\nThe answer is not cut and dried.\n\n\"While technically true, it\u2019s a goofy comparison,\" said Ben Longmier, an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Michigan. \"The temperatures on Mars fluctuate like they do on Earth.\"\n\nWe know that stepping outside in Chicago doesn\u2019t feel the same as in Rio de Janeiro or Stockholm. Mars is no different.\n\nThe assertion that Earth is colder than Mars is based on temperatures from NASA\u2019s robotic rover, Curiosity, which of minus 33 degrees Fahrenheit at the time we wrote this story.\n\nThat\u2019s roughly on par with one of the coldest U.S. cities. Minneapolis saw minus 23 F, with a wind chill that made it feel like minus 48 F. Winnipeg, Canada, the reference point for Yahoo\u2019s , which other news sources and tweets referenced, experienced similar temperatures. So the \"real feel\" is colder in those cities than on Mars -- at least in one sense.\n\nBut not so fast. The air on Mars is much colder than its surface .\n\nCuriosity reports that the air temperature from its location is between minus 193 and minus 76. And again, that\u2019s just at one location on the planet. Samuel Kounaves, a chemistry professor at Tufts University who specializes in planetary sciences, said the average air temperature on Mars is about minus 50.\n\nSo the coldest places in the United States and Canada can edge out the warmest places on Mars, especially if we look at Mars ground temperature, not air temperature. But on average, there\u2019s no question that Mars is colder. After all, Mars is tens of millions of miles further from the sun than Earth is.\n\nThat said, let\u2019s not get too carried away in technicalities and lose sight of what really matters here.\n\n\"Either way, it's darn cold in Michigan right now!\" Longmier said.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen a lot of tweets about how it\u2019s colder in the United States and Canada than it is on Mars, due to the frigid weather system known as the polar vortex. But that\u2019s only correct if we cherry-pick the highest Mars temperatures. On average, our hypothetical Martian brethren are still way colder. We rate this claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
