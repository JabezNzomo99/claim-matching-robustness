An estimated 820,000 are illegally in the U.S., and about 690,000 of those were convicted of serious crimes.\n\u2022 Trump used a questionable figure for the costs of illegal immigration, claiming it was \u201c$113 billion a year.\u201d That\u2019s from a conservative group, includes a sizable public education cost for U.S.-born children, and doesn\u2019t factor in tax receipts. Other estimates show a modest state and local cost and a net positive impact on the federal budget.\n\u2022 He accurately cited a report that found \u201c62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants\u201d receive public welfare benefits, but he falsely claimed that this violates federal law. In fact, the benefits are primarily for U.S.-born children living in those households, the report said.\n\u2022 He claimed that immigrants living in the country illegally \u201cin many cases\u201d are \u201ctreated better than our vets.\u201d That\u2019s a matter of opinion, but government programs and benefits are largely off-limits to those here illegally.\n\u2022 Trump said that 13,000 \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d were released from federal custody \u201con Hillary Clinton\u2019s watch\u201d as secretary of state. But their release was forced by a 2001 Supreme Court decision, and carried out by another federal agency, not the State Department.\n\u2022 He said that \u201cwe\u2019ve admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan\u201d in the last five years. The U.S. admitted more than 108,000. But more than one-fifth of those obtaining legal permanent resident status were Iraqi and Afghan employees of the U.S. government.\n\u2022 Trump oversimplified nuanced policy positions when he said President Obama and Hillary Clinton \u201csupport sanctuary cities.\u201d Obama has tried to work with local law enforcement to deport undocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes. Clinton has said she supports sanctuary policies for minor offenses.\n\u2022 Trump falsely claimed that Clinton has a \u201cplan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time.\u201d Clinton last year proposed accepting 65,000 Syrian refugees in fiscal 2016, which ends Sept. 30. She has not said how many she would accept in fiscal 2017 or beyond.\n\u2022 He claimed the government has \u201cno idea\u201d how many immigrants are in the country illegally, and that it could be anywhere from 3 million to 30 million. Not so. The government estimated there were 11.4 million immigrants in the country illegally in 2012, and it\u2019s a figure that tracks estimates from independent immigration groups.\n\nTrump gave his speech in Phoenix on Aug. 31 after a short trip to Mexico earlier that day to meet with President Enrique Pena Nieto. Over the past week, Trump has sought to clarify his position on what to do with the estimated 11 million immigrants who are living in the United States illegally. And we found he had stretched the facts in doing so. His speech in Arizona was no different in that regard.\n\nEarly in his speech, Trump explained that he would \u201cdeliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today, illegal immigration.\u201d So some in his audience can be forgiven if they were left with the false impression that 2 million people have been convicted of a crime while living illegally in the U.S.\n\nA fiscal year 2013 Department of Homeland Security report says: \u201cICE estimates that 1.9 million removable criminal aliens are in the United States today.\u201d\n\nHowever, the term \u201ccriminal alien\u201d refers to any noncitizen \u2014 whether in the U.S. legally or illegally \u2014 who has ever been convicted of a crime in the United States, as explained in a 2012 report by the Congressional Research Service.\n\nICE does not say how many of the 1.9 million were living in the U.S. illegally, but the Migration Policy Institute estimates in a July 2015 report that most of them are here legally. It says 820,000 of the 1.9 million are living in the U.S. illegally. Furthermore, about 690,000 of the 820,000 would be considered priorities for removal under policies adopted in 2014 \u2014 that is, the 690,000 have been convicted of a felony or serious misdemeanor. (See summary on page 25 of the report.)\n\nTrump claimed that \u201cillegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year.\u201d That\u2019s a conservative group\u2019s estimate that includes the cost of public education and health care for U.S.-born children of immigrants who came to the country illegally.\n\nOther studies have estimated a net positive impact on the federal budget, and a modest one on state and local budgets.\n\nTrump\u2019s number comes from a 2010 study (updated in 2011) by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which \u201cseeks to reduce overall immigration to a level that is more manageable.\u201d The report actually said that the net cost of illegal immigration, taking into account federal and local tax collections from these immigrants, was $99 billion. The $113 billion was for costs only, not monetary benefits to government coffers.\n\nFAIR, which bases its estimates on an undocumented population of 13 million, figures $29 billion in federal costs and $84 billion for states and localities. Most of the state and local costs \u2014 59 percent \u2014 come from education, including the public school education costs for U.S.-born children, and therefore U.S. citizens, of those living in the country illegally. Costs for Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program for those U.S. citizens are also included. But tax income from such children once they become adults isn\u2019t factored in. FAIR uses an estimate of 4.7 million for the minor children of immigrants here illegally, with 72 percent of those children being born in the United States.\n\nThe figure also includes costs for immigration enforcement and prosecution, such as the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s $2.5 billion budget for its Office of Detention and Removal.\n\nAs for other estimates, a 2007 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office concluded that while it is \u201cdifficult to obtain precise estimates,\u201d the net impact on state and local budgets was \u201cmost likely modest.\u201d A 1997 report by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences found most immigrants \u2014 both legal and illegal \u2014 would have a net positive effect on government budgets over the immigrants\u2019 lifetimes, due to a \u201cstrongly positive\u201d fiscal impact at the federal level. The state and local costs, however, would be \u201cconcentrated in the few states that receive most of the immigrants.\u201d\n\nThe impact on federal budgets includes payroll taxes paid by immigrants in the country illegally, including Social Security taxes they can\u2019t collect unless they obtain legal status. The chief actuary of the Social Security Administration said that for 2010, those working in the country illegally contributed a net $12 billion to Social Security.\n\nAs part of his argument that people living illegally in the U.S. are a drain on taxpayers, Trump cited a Center for Immigration Studies report on the use of welfare programs by immigrants who live in the U.S. both legally and illegally.\n\nWe cannot vouch for the accuracy of the CIS report, but Trump did cite it accurately. The group, which advocates for \u201clow immigration,\u201d issued a September 2015 report that said, \u201cAmong households headed by an illegal immigrant, we estimate that 62 percent use one or more welfare programs.\u201d\n\nBut Trump gets it wrong when he says, \u201cThis directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the United States Treasury.\u201d As the report noted, U.S.-born citizens and adult green card holders living in \u201chouseholds headed by illegal immigrants\u201d are legally entitled to food stamps, Medicaid and other welfare programs.\n\nThe report says that \u201cillegal immigrant households primarily benefit from food programs and Medicaid through their U.S.-born children.\u201d It also says that \u201cpregnant women illegally in the country can sometimes be enrolled\u201d legally in Medicaid, and \u201cthere is the Emergency Medicaid program that covers predominately illegal immigrants.\u201d\n\n\u201cA large share of the welfare used by immigrant households is received on behalf of their U.S.-born children,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis is especially true of households headed by illegal immigrants. Illegal immigrant-headed households without children make much more modest use of welfare programs.\u201d\n\nTrump claimed that immigrants living in the country illegally \u201cin many cases\u201d are \u201ctreated better than our vets.\u201d We realize how well one group is treated compared with another is a matter of opinion, but immigrants in the U.S. illegally are largely barred from receiving benefits or participating in government programs, with few exceptions.\n\nThey can\u2019t get Social Security, or enroll in government health care programs such as Medicaid or Medicare. They don\u2019t qualify for food stamps, government housing or unemployment benefits, and they can\u2019t vote.\n\nAs the U.S. Code says, an immigrant in the country without legal authorization \u201cis not eligible for any State or local public benefit,\u201d with a few exceptions: They can get emergency medical care; \u201cshort-term, non-cash\u201d disaster relief; limited immunizations and treatment of communicable diseases; in-kind community assistance such as soup kitchens, crisis counseling or short-term shelter that \u201care necessary for the protection of life or safety.\u201d\n\nAnd, of course, they can be deported, as more than 400,000 immigrants in the country illegally were in fiscal 2014.\n\nSome noncitizen veterans, however, have been deported too, after committing a crime or because they were in the U.S. illegally.\n\nTrump blamed Clinton for the release of 13,000 \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d from federal custody back into the U.S. But their release wasn\u2019t up to Clinton when she was secretary of state. It was mandated by a Supreme Court decision, and carried out by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the Boston Globe reported that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u201cfreed 12,941 criminals nationwide from 2008 to early 2014.\u201d But Clinton served as secretary of the State Department \u2014 not the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE \u2014 from January 2009 to February 2013. So, not all of those criminal immigrants were released \u201con her watch,\u201d as Trump said, and none was released by her department.\n\nPlus, the release of those nearly 13,000 individuals was not discretionary. Instead, their release was mandated by a 2001 Supreme Court ruling, according to the Globe article.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in 2001 that, if another country refuses to accept them, the U.S. cannot hold convicted criminals (who have served their sentences) in detention without justification for longer than six months if their removal from the U.S. is not \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d\n\nTrump may have been alluding to a point made by others, that the State Department could do more, by not issuing visas, to pressure recalcitrant nations to take back their citizens convicted of crimes in the U.S. As Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley wrote in a letter in June, the U.S. has not imposed such sanctions, which are to be made after consultation between the secretaries of homeland security and state, on any nation since Guyana in 2001.\n\nTrump said that the U.S. has admitted about 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan over the last five years. But about a quarter of those obtaining legal permanent resident status were Iraqis and Afghans working abroad for the U.S. government.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2014, the U.S. granted green cards, or legal permanent resident status, to more than 108,000 people from Iraq (90,117) and Afghanistan (18,005), according to the most recent data from the Office of Immigration Statistics. But about one-fifth of those individuals came to the U.S. on special immigrant visas given mainly to employees of the U.S. government and their dependents.\n\nFrom fiscal year 2010 to fiscal 2014, the U.S. awarded 22,595 special immigrant visas to Iraqis and Afghans who worked for the U.S. government. Of those, 8,859 visas were for the principal applicant and 13,736 visas were for their spouses and children.\n\nOver that same time period, the U.S. awarded 697 additional visas to Iraqi and Afghan translators and interpreters. Those were split between 226 principal applicants and 471 dependents.\n\nIn all, according to a February 2016 report from the Congressional Research Service, from fiscal 2007 through the end of fiscal 2015, more than 37,000 individuals were granted special immigration status through the government\u2019s programs for Iraqi and Afghan nationals.\n\nTrump claimed that \u201cPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton support sanctuary cities.\u201d While it\u2019s true that there has been no blanket crackdown on \u201csanctuary cities\u201d by the Obama administration, there have been some efforts made to get cities to cooperate with federal authorities seeking deportation of undocumented immigrants who have committed serious crimes.\n\nAs for Clinton, she has expressed support for sanctuary cities, including those that overlook federal requests for detainers when immigrants in the U.S. illegally have committed minor offenses. But she said she has \u201cno support\u201d for communities that ignore federal requests to deport violent undocumented immigrants, such as the man who killed Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco.\n\nSanctuary cities are those that do not automatically turn over immigrants without legal status to federal immigration authorities. Although these policies \u2014 which vary by city \u2014 have been a contentious political issue for years, the sanctuary city issue took on new prominence in July 2015 after the murder of Steinle, who prosecutors allege was shot and killed in San Francisco by a Mexican national with a felony criminal record who had been deported several times.\n\nThe White House has publicly opposed Republican bills that sought to deny federal funding to so-called sanctuary cities. In part, the administration argued that such blanket policies would lead to mistrust between communities and local law enforcement.\n\nFaye Hipsman, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, told us it is fair to say \u201cthere hasn\u2019t been a crackdown\u201d on sanctuary cities by the Obama administration.\n\nBut last year, she noted, the administration rolled out the Priority Enforcement Program, which seeks to get jurisdictions to voluntarily cooperate with federal immigration officials, with the understanding that federal officials would only target for deportation those immigrants who have been convicted of certain felonies, domestic or sexual abuse, drug dealing and drunk driving, as well as those involved in a gang or suspected terrorists. That would exclude undocumented immigrants who were jailed on routine driving offenses or other minor criminal offenses.\n\nIn opposing the Republican bills targeting sanctuary cities, the administration has argued that \u201cCongress should give PEP a chance to work\u201d because it \u201cprioritizes the worst offenders.\u201d\n\nJessica M. Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that describes itself as an advocate for \u201clow immigration,\u201d told us PEP itself is an indication of support for sanctuary cities because it \u201cexplicitly tolerates sanctuary policies and required ICE Field Offices to accommodate them.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Justice \u2014 at the urging of Republicans in the House appropriations subcommittee \u2014 warned earlier this year that some sanctuary policies violated federal law and jeopardized certain grant funding.\n\nRepublican Rep. John Culberson, who has been pushing the issue, cited a recent report from the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Inspector General as evidence that some jurisdictions are not complying with the federal law. According to Culberson, under the new DOJ guidelines, jurisdictions that fail to cooperate with federal immigration officials \u201cwill now have to choose between receiving law enforcement grant money or protecting criminal illegal aliens. They can no longer do both.\u201d\n\nHipsman, of the Migration Policy Institute, said that the policy shift may be an indication that the Obama administration is moving toward a harder line with regard to some sanctuary policies. But both she and Vaughan said they were not aware that any grant money has been denied to any jurisdiction yet.\n\nAs for Clinton, she made her position clear in the aftermath of Steinle\u2019s murder. She said in a CNN interview on July 7, 2015, that San Francisco \u201cmade a mistake not to deport someone that the federal government strongly felt should be deported\u201d and that she has \u201cabsolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on.\u201d But she also expressed support for sanctuary policies as they relate to minor crimes.\n\nAfter that interview, the Clinton campaign released a statement clarifying Clinton\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton believes that sanctuary cities can help further public safety, and she has defended those policies going back years,\u201d said Xochitl Hinojosa, a campaign spokeswoman, in a July 2015 statement. \u201cAs she made clear, this particular individual should not have been on the streets. \u2026 She believes that we need a system where people like this don\u2019t fall through the cracks and that is why she continues to fight for comprehensive immigration reform.\u201d\n\nTrump falsely claimed that Clinton has a \u201cplan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time.\u201d Clinton last year proposed accepting 65,000 Syrian refugees in fiscal 2016, which ends Sept. 30. She has not said how many she would accept in fiscal 2017 or beyond.\n\nFirst of all, Trump got his own misleading talking point wrong. As we have written, the 620,000 figure refers to a flawed Senate Republican staff report that assumed Clinton in her first term would accept 155,000 refugees each year from all regions \u2014 not just \u201cfrom Syria and that region,\u201d as Trump said.\n\nHow did the Republican staff arrive at that number? Clinton last year said that she would have accepted up to 65,000 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2016, which will end Sept. 30, instead of the 10,000 set by Obama. The GOP report assumes Clinton would accept 65,000 Syrian refugees and an additional 100,000 refugees from other countries for a total of 155,000 each year.\n\nThere\u2019s one problem with that: Clinton has not said how many refugees she would seek to admit over four years.\n\nThe Clinton campaign told us that she still remains committed to accepting more than 10,000 Syrian refugees \u2014 provided that they can be properly screened. But she has not said how many more she would accept in the future or how many refugees in total she would admit.\n\nTrump also said the Syrian refugees seeking admission to the U.S. have \u201cno documentation\u201d and \u201cno paperwork.\u201d That\u2019s false. As we have written, Barbara Strack, chief of the refugee affairs division of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, told Congress last year that \u201cwe\u2019ve found with Syrian refugees \u2026 in general they have many, many documents.\u201d She also said documents are only one part of the vetting process that includes interviews by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and security checks by the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense.\n\nFinally, Trump said that \u201cwe are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from Syria.\u201d That may be so in the future, but it is not the case right now.\n\nThe number of Syrian refugees admitted to the U.S. under Obama, from Jan. 20, 2009, through Aug. 31, totaled 12,670, according to the State Department\u2019s Refugee Processing Center. That includes 10,066 this year, meeting the goal set by the administration for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. Obama has set a goal of accepting another 10,000 in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, although he leaves office in January.\n\nTrump claimed the government has \u201cno idea\u201d how many immigrants are in the country illegally, and that the number could be anywhere from 3 million to 30 million. Actually, the government has a pretty good estimate: 11.4 million. It\u2019s a figure that nearly mirrors estimates from independent immigration groups.\n\nWe looked into this when Trump offered the same speculation in an interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN on Aug. 25. As we wrote then, the most recent estimate from the Department of Homeland Security is that there were 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. in 2012. DHS used U.S. Census Bureau data on the foreign-born population, and then subtracted legal residents such as naturalized citizens, asylees and refugees. It then added in the estimated number of foreign-born individuals missed by the Census Bureau\u2019s population survey.\n\nAlthough that\u2019s a four-year-old figure, it jibes with more recent estimates from independent immigration groups.\n\nThe Center for Migration Studies, a think tank that studies international migration, estimated that the illegal population was about 10.9 million as of 2014. Similarly, the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, based on preliminary figures, estimated that there were 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. that year.\n\nImmigration experts allowed that there is some uncertainty in the estimates, but they told us it is likely only to be off by a million or so. Uniformly, experts told us it is not possible that there could be as many as 30 million illegal immigrants in the U.S., as Trump suggested. Nor, they said, could the number be as low as 3 million.\n\nSteven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors fewer legal immigration admissions to the U.S., estimated the population of illegal immigrants to be 11.5 million in 2015 and 11.7 million in 2016. That\u2019s in the range of 10 million to 12 million that \u201cmost people believe,\u201d Camarota told us in an interview.", "lang": "en"}
