Does that mean they were able to vote in this year\u2019s midterms?\n\n\"Breaking report,\" reads a headline from a Nov. 13 story in the Gateway Pundit. \"Broward County deputy says civil rights attorneys were handing out absentee ballots to inmates AFTER ELECTION?\"\n\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story has been shared more than 20,000 times on Facebook.\n\nThe author of the blog, which has as its tagline \"we report the truth \u2014 leave the Russia-collusion fairy tale to the conspiracy media,\" told PolitiFact \"it\u2019s in the article\" in response to an email asking for more information about the statement.\n\nThe story starts: \"Annie Marie Delgado, President of TrumpTeam Florida 2020, conference called Ann Vandersteel with a a current DOJ employee and was a former high ranking Broward County law enforcement officer. He stated at 7:00 AM that same morning he received a call from a deputy in the Broward County jail. The Deputy said there was \u2018corruption going on inside the jail and that he had never seen anything like it.\u2019\"\n\nIt goes on to say that attorneys arrived \"and demanded to see the inmates. They were not the inmates personal attorneys of record. \u2026 the civil rights attorneys provided the inmates with the narrative that they never received their absentee ballot. The liberal attorneys said the prisoners were denied the right to vote and they were to file a grievance with the deputies at the jail.\"\n\nBut a spokesperson for the Broward County sheriff\u2019s office denied the report.\n\n\"That is false,\" Keyla Concepci\u00f3n told PolitiFact in an email.\n\nIt is true, though, that eligible inmates can vote from jail. Inmates can register and vote before their trials assuming they don\u2019t have prior convictions or any other legal disqualifications. That constitutionally protected right received national attention after the father of a Parkland shooting victim tweeted that Democrats allowed inmates, including Parkland shooting suspect Nicholas Cruz, to register to vote from jail. (Cruz is registered Republican.)\n\nSaid Concepci\u00f3n, \"Absentee ballots are mailed directly to them in the jail and then returned to the Supervisor of Elections office once they have voted.\" The sheriff\u2019s office serves as a \"mail courier\" between the inmates and the elections office, she added.\n\nOne thing that is illegal, though?\n\n\"Taking away the voting rights of an eligible person awaiting trial,\" Concepci\u00f3n said.\n\nA story posted online and shared on Facebook thousands of times stated that a \"Broward County deputy says civil rights attorneys were handing out absentee ballots to inmates AFTER ELECTION?\"", "lang": "en"}
