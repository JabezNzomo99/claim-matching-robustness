When you do the light will turn blue otherwise facebook will activate billing.\n\nSome of these messages were just hoaxes; others pointed users to protest page that was a trap for the unwary: clicking on certain elements of it initiated a script that hijacked users\u2019 computers. Some of those who did venture a click had their computers taken over by a series of highly objectionable images while malware simultaneously attempted to install itself onto their computers.\n\nThe claim that Facebook would be initiating user charges was but the bait to lure people to the protest page and its hidden malicious payload; there are no plans afoot to require payment from those who use the site. Regarding the issue of whether Facebook would ever charge users for its social networking services, that company\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said in an April 2009 Business Week interview that: \u201cThe answer is no, we are not planning on charging a basic fee for our basic services. Once again, that question stems from people thinking we\u2019re growing so quickly, we\u2019re running out of money. We\u2019re growing really quickly, but we can finance that growth. We\u2019re not going to charge for our basic services.\u201d\n\nIn their Help Center section, the social network says in answer to the query \u201cWill Facebook ever charge for service?\u201d quite plainly \u201cNo. We will always keep Facebook a free service for everyone.\u201d\n\nIn early July 2011, the spread of yet another \u201cFacebook is about to start charging its users\u201d canard (driven by a fictional Weekly World News article) was fueled by the promise contained in that version of the hoax that users who posted the rumor as their status would be spared the levy. Those who attempted to exempt themselves from the charge thereby spread the lie even further, thus doing the leg work of the hoaxsters. (The logical disconnect of the practical joke seemed to evade many: If Facebook were bent upon extracting fees from its users, why would it choose to exempt any of them?)\n\nIn late September 2011, the \u201cpost as your status to get out of being charged and make the icon turn blue\u201d hoax ran rampant yet again, this time accompanied by claims that Facebook would be implementing a tiered membership system. The same hoax reappeared in May 2012 and again in July 2013.\n\nIn September 2014 the fake news site National Report piled on to this tired hoax meme by publishing a fictitious article positing that Facebook would begin charging users $2.99 per month starting 1 November 2014:\n\nAs of September 2017 the hoax remained in broad circulation via Facebook. A version attributed to \u201cMark, the Director of Facebook\u201d suggested that it \u201cseems that all the warnings are real\u201d and \u201cFacebook use will cost money\u201d:\n\nI\u2019m Mark, the Director of Facebook. Hello everyone, it seems that all the warnings are real. Facebook use will cost money. If you send this string to 18 different from your list, your icon will be blue and it will be free for you. If you do not believe me, tomorrow at 6 pm Facebook will be closed and to open it you will have to pay. This is all by law.

Is it true that Facebook is going to charge to use the site?\u201d in this way:\n\nIn April 2018 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during congressional testimony that \u201cthere will always be a version of Facebook that is free,\u201d a comment which suggested that the social media company has at least considered a paid (possibly ad-free) version of their platform, but no such version has been announced or demonstrated.", "lang": "en"}
