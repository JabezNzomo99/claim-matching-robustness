President Donald Trump on Wednesday, 17 July, misrepresented words from US Representative Ilhan Omar to make her sound like an Al-Qaida sympathizer and also exaggerated the performance of the economy under his watch. A look at claims from his rally in North Carolina: \u201cYou don\u2019t say \u2018America\u2019 with this intensity. You say \u2018al-Qaida,\u2019 it makes you proud. Al-Qaida makes you proud. You don\u2019t speak that way about America.\u201d This is not at all what the Minnesota Democrat said. She did not voice pride in the terrorist group. Trump is referring to an interview Omar gave in 2013. In it, she talked about studying terrorism history or theory under a professor who dramatically pronounced the names of terrorist groups, as if to emphasize their evil nature.

Her point was that the professor was subtly rousing suspicions of Muslims with his theatrical presentation, while pronouncing \u201cAmerica\u201d without the intensity he afforded the names of terrorist groups. At no point did she say \u2018al-Qaida\u2019 should be uttered with intensity or pride and that \u2018America\u2019 shouldn't. Trump is continuing to assail Omar and three other liberal Democratic women of colour, challenging their loyalty to the US. The House rebuked him on Tuesday for his \u201cracist comments\u201d. \u201cWe are offering plans up to 60 percent cheaper than Obamacare.\u201d The bargain health insurance plans Trump talks about are cheaper because they skimp on benefits such as maternity or prescription drug coverage and do not guarantee coverage of pre-existing conditions. The short-term plans the Trump administration began offering last year on the federal insurance marketplace provide up to 12 months of coverage and can be renewed for up to 36 months. Premiums for the plans are about one-third the cost of fuller insurance coverage. The health plan offerings are intended for people who want an individual health insurance policy but make too much money to qualify for subsides under the Affordable Care Act. A Look at Where the Investigations Related to Donald Trump Stand\n\nThe Trump administration introduced the short-term plans, which undermine how Obamacare is supposed to work, after failing to repeal much of President Barack Obama's health care law. \u201cPatients with pre-existing conditions are protected by Republicans much more so than protected by Democrats, who will never be able to pull it off.\u201d Democrats did pull it off. Obama's health care law, the Affordable Care Act, requires insurers to take all applicants, regardless of medical history, and charge the same standard premiums to healthy people and those who had medical problems before or when they signed up.\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration is pressing in court for full repeal of Obamacare.\n\n\n\nTrump and other Republicans say they'll have a plan to preserve protections for people with pre-existing conditions, but the White House has provided no details. \u201cWe have the strongest economy in history.\u201d The economy is not the strongest in the country's history. It expanded at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in the first quarter of this year. That growth was the highest in just four years for the first quarter.\n\nIn the late 1990s, growth topped 4 percent for four straight years, a level it has not yet reached on an annual basis under Trump. Growth even reached 7.2 percent in 1984. In fact, there are some signs that growth is slowing, partly because of Trump\u2019s trade fights with China and Europe. Factory activity has decelerated for three straight months as global growth has slowed and companies are reining in their spending on large equipment. Most economists forecast the economy will expand at just a 2 percent annual rate in the April-June period. Trump is pushing the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, to cut short-term interest rates to shore up the economy. That isn't something a president would do during the strongest economy in history. Economists mostly expect the Fed will cut rates, either at its next meeting in July or in September. Lower rates make it easier for people to borrow and buy new homes and cars. The economy is now in its 121st month of growth, making it the longest expansion in history. Most of that took place under Obama. The economy grew 2.9 percent in 2018, the same pace it reached in 2015 under Obama, and simply hasn't hit historically high growth rates.\n\nThe 3.7 percent unemployment rate in the latest report is not the best in history. It's near the lowest level in 50 years, when it was 3.5 percent . The US also had lower rates than now in the early 1950s. And during three years of World War II, the annual rate was under 2 percent. \u201cThe best unemployment in our history. And likewise, women, 74 years. I\u2019m sorry, women, I let you down, it\u2019s not in our history but we\u2019re going to be there very soon.\u201d No, the jobless rate for women of 3.1 percent in April was the lowest in 66 years, not 74, and it has since increased to 3.3 percent in June. The data only goes back 71 years, so 74 years isn't a possibility.
