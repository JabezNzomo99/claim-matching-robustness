This is false; he has suggested that rate as an option for income over $10 million.\n\n\"Bernie's Logic: 'Nobody can live on $7 an hour. We must raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Also we must raise the tax rate to 52%,'\" according to the post, shared here and here.\n\n\"$15 an hour x .52% = $7.80,\" it says. \"$15 an hour - $7.80 = $7.20.\"\n\nA screenshot of a Facebook post taken on February 27, 2020\n\nAnother version of the claim has been made on Twitter here.\n\nA screenshot of a tweet taken on February 27, 2020\n\nSanders has repeatedly called for the minimum wage to be increased to $15 an hour from its current federal rate of $7.25.\n\nHe has also proposed a tax rate of 52 percent -- but not for people making $15 an hour.\n\nA section of his website explaining how he would pay for his various plans lists \"raising the top marginal income tax rate to 52% on income over $10 million\" as an option.\n\nSanders also suggested the same marginal tax rate on income above $10 million during his 2016 run for president, according to an archived version of his website.\n\nEven if the rate for Americans making $15 an hour was 52 percent, not all of their earnings would be taxed at that level, as the false claims state.\n\nThere is a standard deduction of $12,400 for individual filers in 2020, which means at least that amount of income would not be subject to taxes.\n\nSanders has emerged as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nHe is advocating using revenue from various tax increases on well-off Americans to pay for plans aimed at helping those with lower incomes.", "lang": "en"}
