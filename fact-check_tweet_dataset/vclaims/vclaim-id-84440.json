Reportedly, the attack took place at around 12.25pm between the Burkapal-Chintagufa area in south Bastar. From Kashmir to Bastar, there\u2019s an uptick in separatist attacks and Naxal attacks despite PM Modi assuring us that demonetization had neutralised Pak-based terrorism, Separatism in Kashmir and Naxalism in the Maoist-affected areas. Shouldn\u2019t this be considered a failure of Home Minister (HM) Kanhaiya Kumar and National Security Advisor (NSA) Umar Khalid? Shouldn\u2019t they resign because people now claim that PM Modi\u2019s claims vis-a-vis demonetisation were nothing but attempts to bluff the Indian populace? Please watch the following clip where Times Now peels the skin of Mr Kumar\u2019s and Mr Khalid\u2019s back for their complete failure as HM and NSA.\n\nTimes Now has never shied away from questioning the Govt. They are the only channel which has consistently questioned the powerful. In April 2014, when an attacked happened in the same region, Times Now had boldly questioned UPA Home Ministers P Chidambaram, Shivraj Patil and Sushil Kumar Shinde.\n\nFor such bold journalism, people flocked to Times Now\u2019s Twitter timeline and showered them with praises. We have captured some of the wonderful comments left by admirers of Times Now.\n\nEven Rajdeep Sardesai, a consulting editor with India Today, was over-joyed with Times Now\u2019s journalism and appreciated their effort. India Today\u2019s Gaurav Sawant must not be happy that a Senior Editor from his channel is appreciating a competing channel\u2019s journalism style which is usually his forte.\n\nEnthused by the unprecedented love showered by Times Now enthusiasts, Times Now has pledged to carry their bold journalism forever and ever. They will not rest till Home Minister Kanhaiya Kumar and National Security Advisor Umar Khalid tender their resignation. Bravo!", "lang": "en"}
