No, it is a deepfake made for an art project that seeks to tests Facebook's policies on false news when it comes to faked videos.\n\nThe video in question can be seen here in an Instagram post published on June 7, 2019 by @bill_posters_uk captioned: \"Mark Zuckerberg reveals the truth about Facebook and who really owns the future... see more @sheffdocfest VDR technology by @cannyai #spectreknows #privacy #democracy #surveillancecapitalism #dataism #deepfake\"\" (archived here). In it Zuckerberg appears to say the following words (even though the voice imitation is not that good):\n\nThis is the Instagram post in question (with an archived copy of the video here):\n\nThe video is part of an art project you can read more about here (archived here):\n\nThe video only seems to have attracted about 2,200 views on Instagram in the four days it was up, but this Vice article and tweet seem to have propelled it into virality:\n\nSince Lead Stories is part of Facebook's Third-Party Fact-Checking Partnership we can say exactly what is going to happen next. In accordance with our Satire Policy we will flag the original video as \"Satire\" because it is making a social or political point through an obviously fake but somewhat funny video (I mean, that voice...). This will not harm the video's distribution but adds warning labels to it on Facebook so people who see it on the platform will be informed that it is not real.\n\n(Future) copies of the video that are presented as if they are real (i.e. not part of an art project or not as part of posts talking about the art project) will be flagged as \"False\" by Lead Stories whenever we encounter them. This will also add the warning but in addition reduces the reach of these copies and Facebook will send out notifications to the people who shared them that there is more information available.\n\nThis is part of Facebook's \"Remove, Reduce, Inform\" strategy for managing problematic content:\n\nIn our own experience this approach works quite well: it avoids the endless re-uploading of different copies of the same material you would get if the originals were simply deleted but it also informs people who saw the content that there is more to the story. And in the end people are still free to make up their own minds but at least they will now do so with access to all information.\n\nAnd with that this fact check is now oficially part of an art project...", "lang": "en"}
