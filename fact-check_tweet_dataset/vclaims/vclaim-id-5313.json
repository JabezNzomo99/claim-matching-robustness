No, that's not true: the part about Benalla was made up by a satire website from Belgium. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Nordpresse on July 20, 2018 titled \"Exclu: Alexandre Benalla \u00e9tait le voisin de l'enfant sauv\u00e9 par Mamoudou Gassama\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nAlexandre Benalla was fired after video footage emerged of him beating up a protester while wearing a police helmet, even though he wasn't even a police officer.\n\nMacron aide to be dismissed over assault A senior French presidential aide is to be dismissed from his job, officials say, after footage emerged of protesters in Paris being attacked by a man wearing a police visor. The action against Alexandre Benalla was taken after \"new facts\" emerged in the case, French President Emmanuel Macron's office said on Friday.\n\nBut he has nothing at all to do with Mamoudou Gassama or his tale of heroism.\n\nLe Journal Du Nord (nordpresse.be) is a satirical website that was set up to mock the (real) sudpresse.be (since renamed sudinfo.be), a Belgian media group. They were involved in a lawsuit with each other in 2017 which was eventually won by NordPresse.\n\nThey have sort of a disclaimer in their header that reads:\n\nTranslated: \"all information verified by our monkey analysts\".\n\nWe wrote about nordpresse.be before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: NO 12 (Or 89 Or 123 Or 135) Dead, NO 870 Wounded, NO 13000 Cars Burned In French Riots Post World Cup Victory\n\u2022 Fake News: French Ex-President Sarkozy Did NOT Claim He Didn't Know Gaddafi Was A Dictator, Only Took 50 Million \"To Help\"", "lang": "en"}
