But the EU is also represented, in one way or another, at many of them.\n\nIts role varies. At the World Trade Organisation, the European Commission \u201cspeaks for all EU member States at almost all WTO meetings\u201d, meaning the UK doesn\u2019t represent itself independently.\n\nThe EU \u201cparticipates as an equal\u201d at the G8, according to the American Council on Foreign Relations think tank. That\u2019s not the case at the OECD, where it doesn\u2019t have voting rights, but the OECD says that \u201cthe European Commission\u2019s participation goes well beyond that of an observer\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
