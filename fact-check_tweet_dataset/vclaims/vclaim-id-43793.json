Hurt by the wounds suffered by India in whom he took pride, a heart-broken BJP activist committed suicide.\"\n\nWe searched on Facebook with the Malayalam caption and found that the video is viral with the same misleading caption.\n\nAlso Read: Is This A Video Of BJP MPs Requesting Rajnath Singh To Revoke CAA-NRC?\n\nWe broke the video into key frames and ran a reverse image search. We found articles in Tamil that indicated that this incident had taken place in Madurai, Tamil Nadu.\n\nOne can spot a screen grab in the below article that matches the viral video, the same man can be spotted standing near the transformer.\n\nWe searched with the keywords, 'Madurai army man suicide' on Google and found a Times Of India article dated January 8, 2020, with the headline, \"Army man under inquiry attempts suicide\"\n\nThe article states that an army jawan, P Muthu, 25, who was posted in Rajasthan, attempted suicide by holding a high-tension terminal of a transformer on the premises of the Madurai district collectorate in Tamil Nadu on January 7, 2020.\n\nMuthu had appeared before the revenue divisional officer (RDO), after his wife committed suicide. Muthu had married Thenisha from Nilakottai in Dindigul district three-and-a-half months ago and there was reportedly a dispute in the family over dowry.\n\nA case was registered in this regard with the Nilakottai police and an inquiry was carried out, additionally an RDO inquiry was also in progress. Muthu had come out of the RDO office and went straight to the transformer and climbed on to it, reported TOI.\n\nMuthu was rushed to the Government Rajaji Hospital after the incident, where he is being treated. The same video was previously fact-checked by NewsMeter on January 10, 2020, when it was viral with another false claim that a farmer electrocuted himself after the police filed false cases on him during a farmer agitation in Amaravati, Andra Pradesh.", "lang": "en"}
