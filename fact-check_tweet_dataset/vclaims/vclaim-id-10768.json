Solodovnikov, with a $670,000 annual salary.\n\nUnder the \u201cforeign principal\u201d section in FARA T&R Production chose, out of three options -- government of foreign country; foreign political party; foreign or domestic organization -- the third option, naming ANO TV-Novosti as its foreign principal and describing it as an \u201cNGO registered under Russian Federation law.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s profile in Russia\u2019s Federal Taxation Service database says ANO TV-Novosti registered in April 2005 as an Autonomous Nonprofit Organization, with the same address in Moscow as listed on RT\u2019s FARA form: 111020 Borovaya St. 3.\n\nTwo people are named as fully authorized to act on behalf of ANO TV-Novosti. One is a man unknown to the public named Alexey Lvovich Nikolov \u2013 the CEO and a deputy chief editor. His name was added to the registration on April 14, 2017. The second name is familiar to many: RT\u2019s chief editor Margarita Simonovna Simonyan, who, according to the document, is chief editor of RT\u2019s \u201cforeign principal\u201d ANO TV-Novosti as well.\n\nAccording to Russia\u2019s Federal Taxation Service, ANO TV-Novosti\u2019s registrant and founder is the Federal state unitary enterprise/Russian international information agency \u201cRIA Novosti\u201d \u2013 a media corporation listed in the database of Russia\u2019s Federal Agency for State Property Management as \u201cproperty of the Government of the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\nRIA Novosti itself was registered by two government agencies \u2013 the Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications and the Federal Agency for State Property Management \u2013 each of which also owns 50 percent of the company. Under the leadership of the well-known TV host Dmitry Kiselyov, RIA Novosti is in a process of transformation into a new media conglomerate, \u201cMIA Rossia Segodnya,\u201d which includes Russia\u2019s other international broadcaster, Sputnik.\n\nAccording to the open database of Russian federal government contracts, from the time it was registered in April 2005, ANO TV-Novosti had at least eight government contracts, totaling 216,439,922 rubles (approximately $7.79 million according to April 2005 exchange rates). These included a contract with the Federal state budgetary educational institution of higher learning \u201cThe Diplomatic Academy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\nThe nature of the contracts was described as the \u201cprovision of informational services covering the activities of government entities.\u201d\n\nRussian news agencies are expected to reflect a positive image of the Russian government. In April 2017, the Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications presented its 2016 annual report to President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe report says that the Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications \u201cexercised the functions of a state client in financing, controlling and supervising the subordinate entities\u201d in accordance with the president\u2019s address to the Russian Federation Council, in which Putin underlined \u201cmain directions of the information policy.\u201d\n\nThese \u201cdirections\u201d included \u201cpropagating and promoting the formulation of Russia\u2019s positive image globally.\u201d\n\nOn page 12, the report provides details from the budget of the Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications dedicated to government-owned media in 2016.\n\nIt reads: \u201cANO TV-Novosti\u201d \u2013 17,517,636.300 rubles\u201d(around $293,577). With additional mention of an unspecified increase of its \u201cfederal budget\u201d in 2017 due to a creation of a French language channel under Russian Federation government decree #1385 of December 12, 2016.\n\nMedia reports indicate a more significant direct financial funding of RT from the Russian Government over the course of 12 years since RT's establishment in 2005.\n\nIn 2005, ANO \"TV-Novosti\" invested $30 million in start-up costs to establish RT, with a budget of $30 million for its first year of operation.\n\nIn December 2008, the Russian Government included ANO \"TV-Novosti\" on the list of core organizations of strategic importance.\n\nincreased from approximately $80 million in 2007 to $380 million in 2011, but was reduced to $300 million in 2012.\n\nIn October 2012, when the Russian Finance Ministry attempted to reduce funding for Russia Today once again, President Vladimir Putin responded with an executive order forbidding the budget reduction.\n\nIn 2014 RT received 11.87 billion rubles ($310 million) in government funding and 15.38 billion rubles ($400 million) in 2015.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice had given RT until Monday, November 14 to register as a foreign agent or face legal action. RT opposed the requirement and the Committee to Protect Journalists called it \u201ca bad idea\u2026a shift in how the law has been applied in recent decades.\n\nThe Russian Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, Tuesday, November 15 unanimously approved legislation allowing the government to force foreign media organizations operating in Russia to register as \u201cforeign agents.\u201d\n\nThe Russian Justice Ministry followed up with letters to nine media outlets, warning they might be forced to register. Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, as well as the program Current Time and Polygraph\u2019s partner fact check Factograph also were warned.\n\n\u201cThe Voice of America is an independent news source required by law to be accurate, objective and comprehensive,\u201d said VOA Director Amanda Bennett. We remain committed to our mission to provide independent and reliable programming to our global audiences.\u201d\n\nVOA is a government owned and run news organization. The journalists work behind a \u201cfirewall,\u201d established following a 1994 federal broadcasting act and a charter established in 1976 law.\n\n\u201cThe 1994 law prevents government policymakers from interfering in coverage. And the legislation authorized the Broadcasting Board of Governors ensure that VOA journalists comply with the highest standards of broadcast journalism, including accurate and objective news reporting,\u201d said Bennett.", "lang": "en"}
