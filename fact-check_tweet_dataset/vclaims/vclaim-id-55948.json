Let\u2019s fact-check the posted photos and videos.\n\nClaim: Photos and videos related to the recent India-China border fight at the Galwan valley in Ladakh. Fact: The posted photos and videos are old and not related to the recent India-China border clash at the Galwan valley in Ladakh. Some photos are not even related to India. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nAll the photos in the post are old. Some photos are almost a decade old. They are not related to the recent India-China border clash. The old news articles with the same photos can be seen here, here, here, and here.\n\nOne of the photos in the post has already been debunked in Post 1. The other three photos were also found to be old. While two photos are related to two separate incidents in 2015 and the other one is related to the Pulwama attack in 2019. All the articles related to the photos can be found here, here, and here.\n\nThe same video was found to exist on the internet at least since December 2019. A user has posted the video on YouTube with the title \u2013 \u2018Heavy Shelling Along Line of Control between Pakistan and India\u2019. While FACTLY could not independently verify the context of the video, it can be concluded that the video is not related to the recent situation along the Line of Actual Control.\n\nThere are many other posts [Post 4 (archived), Post 5 (archived)] with videos already debunked by FACTLY. The fact-check articles can be read here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, old and unrelated photos and videos are being shared by Pakistani and Bangladeshi users in the context of recent India-China border clash.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
