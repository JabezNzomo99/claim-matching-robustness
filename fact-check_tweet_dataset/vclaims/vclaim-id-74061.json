The claim is false; experts explain that the imprints are not expiry dates but future inspection dates that indicate when a cylinder should undergo testing to ensure it is safe for further use.\n\n\n\n\"Do you know that the gas cylinder you live with in the kitchen is a time bomb, ready to explode any time,\" reads a Facebook post from Nigeria, shared more than 180 times. The post was also shared in Kenya.\n\nIt claims that every gas cylinder has an expiry date and those that have \"expired\" are unsafe to keep in the house. \"The expiring date is coded on the side of the LPG Cylinder in alphabetical order, A,B,C,D in quarters (sic),\" the post explains further.\n\nEach quarter is said to represent a three-month period (March, June, September and December) followed by a number to indicate the year of expiry.\n\n\n\nHowever, this numbering system is actually used to indicate a future date for routine inspection.\n\nAlso Read: Did Bill Gates Plan To Depopulate Africa Through Vaccines?

It does not mean the cylinder automatically expires, nor does it make the gas bottle a \"time bomb\".\n\n\"Cylinders marked A 2017 means that they are due for testing in the first quarter (between January and March) of the year 2017. Similarly, B 2017 means that they are due for testing in the second quarter (between April and June) of the year 2017. Similarly C (between July and September) is for the third quarter and D (between October and December) for the fourth quarter,\" reads the press release.\n\nNonetheless, Tyler cautioned that consumers need to be careful when handling LPG cylinders at home and to ensure the regulator has been fitted correctly to the valve and that it, as well as the hose and appliance, are in good condition.\n\n\"Consumers should also make sure there are no leaks by checking all joints with soapy water and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 ensure there is adequate ventilation for complete combustion,\" said Tyler.", "lang": "en"}
