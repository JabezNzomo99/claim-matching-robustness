He was quoted by the Examiner as saying Biden\u2019s comment was a \u201cbig mistake,\u201d noting that he is a big band singer in the tradition of \u201cFrank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, and Tony Bennett\u201d and that his performance style is nothing like Jackson or Prince, both pop singers.\n\nThe Examiner story contains the original, unedited video.\n\nWashington Post political reporter Dave Weigel pointed out the misleading image on Twitter and also posted a screenshot from the original, unedited video in which Powell\u2019s face can be seen:\n\nBecause the video was altered to make the false claim that Biden participated in a blackface incident at a fundraiser dinner in 1985, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
