This claim is false.\n\nRecent posts of the screenshot are visible here , here , and here .\n\nThe screenshot of the tweet, dated July 19, 2019, reads: \u201cJust so We are clear; We now have concrete proof, found guilty on all counts in the court of law, that there as a Hollywood sex cult that owned 11 daycares worldwide, found guilty of human sex trafficking. And the media have been silent about it\u2026 If this isn\u2019t news, what is?\u201d\n\nTo allege \u201cthe media have been silent about it\u201d is false. Multiple media outlets reported widely on the NXVIM case. Reuters coverage is visible reut.rs/2DEuUvu ; articles by The New York Times are visible nyti.ms/30y4LY7 and the Washington Post wapo.st/3fAyWC6 .\n\nOn the date of the tweet in this claim (July 19, 2019), NXVIM leader Keith Raniere was found guilty of a racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, possession of child pornography and other crimes ( here ). Raniere\u2019s trial also received widespread coverage from the media (some examples here , here and here ).\n\nSome of the public figures involved in Raniere\u2019s scheme include former \u201cSmallville\u201d star Allison Mack ( here ) and Seagram liquor heiress Clare Bronfman ( here ).\n\nThe claim also mentions 11 daycare centers worldwide linked to NXVIM. This is a reference to the Rainbow Cultural Garden, an educational program founded by Raniere in 2006, described as a \u201crevolutionary child development program promoting children's cultural, linguistic, emotional, physical and problem-solving potential\u201d ( bit.ly/3kmdbtp ).\n\nBy April 27, 2018, the program listed 8 existing facilities in total, including locations in the U.S., Mexico, Guatemala, Spain and the UK, according to the latest version of the archived site Reuters was able to access (April 27, 2018, bit.ly/3i79Nkm earlier versions list an additional facility in Albany, see bit.ly/3fxofQT ).\n\nAccording to the British tabloid The Sun, the program was inspected in 2017 by the UK\u2019s Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills, after critics raised concerns over \u201cthe school\u2019s teaching methods and links with the controversial Raniere.\u201d( here )\n\nMexican journalist Carmen Aristegui\u2019s website published an in-depth report about the program in Mexico in 2019 ( here ). The article found that Raniere\u2019s system was characterized by teachers without pedagogical certifications and children who developed learning difficulties. The piece also mentioned the involvement of Mexican public figures, including Emiliano and Cecilia Salinas Occeli, the son and daughter of former Mexican president Carlos Salinas de Gortari.\n\nOther reports on the subject are visible here and here .\n\nThe tweet featured in this claim was published by a now suspended account @RodSneaky ( twitter.com/RodSneaky ).

This stems from a fake online report that a Washington D.C. pizza restaurant was cover for a child sex trafficking ring here . The New York Times explains the conspiracy theory in depth here . Some social media users are reviving these theories in the run up to the November election.\n\nSome recent Reuters Fact Checks on similar conspiracy claims are visible here , here and here .\n\nFalse.
