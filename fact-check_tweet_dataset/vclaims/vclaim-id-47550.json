The words \u201c3000 series N95\u201d are clearly visible printed on boxes at one point. Health care workers widely use N95 medical face masks to protect themselves from the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\n\nMultiple Facebook users have shared the video, claiming it depicts FBI agents seizing coronavirus-infected face masks sent from China. That is not what the video shows, however.\n\nThe footage actually shows the FBI seizing medical equipment in late March from a New York City man who prosecutors say hoarded the supplies to sell above market value, according to AFP Fact Check. The equipment seized included approximately 192,000 N95 masks, 130,000 surgical masks, bottles of hand sanitizer and disinfectant spray, per the Department of Justice (DOJ) press release.\n\nThe man also allegedly coughed in the direction of the FBI agents and told them he had coronavirus. In a statement to ABC News, the man\u2019s attorney said the man \u201ccategorically denies\u201d the allegations by the DOJ.

The need for personal protective equipment is acute in New York, as it has become an epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S., with more than 304,000 confirmed cases in the state as of press time.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said it would pay \u201cfair market value\u201d to the man, according to The New York Times.", "lang": "en"}
