Kamala Harris said President Trump\u2019s executive actions \"have hit our immigrant and religious communities like a cold front, striking a chilling fear in the hearts of millions of good hardworking people.\"\n\nThe California Democrat went on to say that rather than making communities safe, Trump\u2019s immigration raids and policies will make immigrants less likely to report crimes for fear they\u2019ll be deported.\n\n\"For this reason,\" Harris said in her Feb. 16, 2017 speech, \"studies have shown Latinos are more than 40 percent less likely to call 911 when they have been a victim of a crime.\"\n\nHarris makes her claim at about the 7:40 minute mark in the video above.\n\nWith so much focus in California on Trump\u2019s immigration orders, we decided to fact-check Harris\u2019s claim.\n\nAs evidence, a spokesman for Harris pointed to a 2013 study by a professor at the University of Chicago, Illinois, called \"Insecure Communities: Latino Perceptions of Police Involvement in Immigration Enforcement.\"\n\nThe study relied on a survey of 2,000 Hispanics, both documented and undocumented, in late 2012 in Phoenix, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston.\n\nOne of the survey questions asked respondents to agree or disagree with the following statement: \"I am less likely to contact police officers if I have been the victim of a crime for fear that they will ask me or people I know about our immigration status.\"\n\nOverall, 44 percent of respondents agreed with the statement.\n\nThat\u2019s just about what Harris said in her claim.\n\n\"Basically on target,\" Nik Theodore, who authored the study and is a professor at the University of Chicago\u2019s Department of Urban Planning and Policy, told PolitiFact California.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the share less likely to contact police by county and state surveyed:\n\nDigging deeper, the study found overall 70 percent of undocumented Latinos and 28 percent of U.S.-born Latinos were hesitant to contact the police when they had been the victim of a crime. It also found that more than 40 percent of respondents were less likely to contact police about a crime they knew had taken place.\n\nThe study did not report on the share of overall Americans hesitant to call police because it only surveyed Latino residents.\n\nWhile technically Harris says \"studies\" in her claim, indicating there are multiple reports that back this up, her spokesman said he could only find the single report from 2013 as evidence.\n\nTheodore told us there hasn\u2019t been much research on Latino attitudes about police.\n\nWe did find a 2009 study by the Pew Research Center that\u2019s somewhat similar.\n\nIt found 78 percent of Hispanics surveyed in 2008 said they would definitely contact police if they were the victim of a violent crime. An even higher percentage, 84 percent, said they would contact police if they were the victim of a property crime.\n\nThat would indicate that, at least at that time, a smaller share than 40 percent of Latinos were hesitant to contact police when they were victims of a crime.\n\nAsked about this, Theodore said the two studies ask different questions and were completed four years apart. He added that his study \"was done after an increase in police involvement in immigration enforcement.\"\n\nImmigrant rights groups often cite Arizona\u2019s passage of a broad new immigration enforcement measure, SB 1070 in 2010, as eroding trust between Hispanics and law enforcement in that state. The law, which faced numerous legal challenges, required Arizona state law enforcement officers to attempt to determine a person\u2019s immigration status when there was reasonable suspicion that person was an illegal immigrant.\n\nWhen looking at the two studies, only the 2013 University of Chicago study asks whether respondents would be \"less likely\" to contact the police if they had been the victim of a crime \"for fear that they will ask me or people I know about our immigration status.\"\n\nThe Pew study does not include the second part of that question.\n\nThe Pew study did find that about 50 percent of respondents felt \"just some or very little confidence that police will treat Hispanics fairly.\"\n\nJohn Thiella is a consultant with the Sacramento-based Latino Policy Coalition, which advocates for immigrant rights.\n\nHe said Harris used \"a fair statistic\" in describing the percentage of Latinos hesitant to call police when they are victims of a crime.\n\nThiella said there\u2019s long been \"a climate of fear and uncertainty\" between Latinos and the police due to the lack of a clear path forward for undocumented residents.\n\nHe said Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration policies have deepened that fear.\n\nObama Administration also contributed to the uncertainty by deporting more than 2.5 million illegal immigrants, more than under any president in U.S. history.\n\nU.S. Sen. Kamala Harris said in a recent speech that \"studies have shown Latinos are more than 40 percent less likely to call 911 when they have been a victim of a crime.\"\n\nA 2013 study by a professor at the University of Chicago, Illinois, found 44 percent of respondents (all Hispanics) agreed with the following statement:\n\n\"I am less likely to contact police officers if I have been the victim of a crime for fear that they will ask me or people I know about our immigration status.\"\n\nHarris leaves the impression there are multiple reports to back up her claim when she uses the phrase \"studies have shown\" in her claim.\n\nBased on our research, and comments from her spokesman, there\u2019s only a single report that backs this up.\n\nIn 2009, the Pew Research Center produced a report that indicates a smaller share of Hispanics would be hesitant to contact police if they were victims of a crime.\n\nUnlike the 2013 report, the Pew study did not raise the issue of whether respondents would be concerned police would ask about their immigration status. It also took place before an increase in police involvement in immigration enforcement around the country.\n\nIn the end, Harris\u2019 statement needs a couple clarifications but is backed up by the 2013 report.\n\nWe rate it Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.", "lang": "en"}
