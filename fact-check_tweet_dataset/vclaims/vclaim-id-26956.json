No, but a photo of the two men that appeared on Facebook on Feb. 4 suggested as much.\n\n\"For the life of me, and I\u2019ll never know how to explain it, when I met that young man, I felt like I was the one shaking hands with the president,\" the post claims Reagan said about meeting Trump.\n\nIt was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
