While rumours of child abduction are rife over the past month, the same set of images are used to spread such rumours in state after state.\n\nThe above image which has been used in this latest post was found in an article published on May 20, 2018, where it had been reported by a Telugu publication that this is part of a set of photographs circulating on WhatsApp with the claim that these are child kidnappers. This is one of the photographs which recurrently appear in relation to the child-abduction claims floating on WhatsApp and social media platforms.\n\nChild kidnapping rumours are currently widespread across Gujarat. A series of such incidents has been reported from the state which too has fallen prey to this rumour frenzy witnessed in recent times. There is an urgent need to take effective steps to end this menace before more lives are endangered.", "lang": "en"}
