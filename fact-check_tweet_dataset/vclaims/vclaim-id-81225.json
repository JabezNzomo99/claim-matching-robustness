Regarding, the number of the graves on the right, we could count 63 graves in total. The April image showed two graves on the left side as compared to the one seen in 2011 image. LEFT HAS 44, RIGHT SIDE HAS 64 GRAVES AS OF AUGUST We found that the video aired by Aaj Tak was uploaded on Chinese website Bilibili on 24 August. In this visual, too, the last row on the left has two graves instead of one as seen in the 2011 image. Because of which, the total number of graves on the left comes out to be 44. Now regarding the graves on the right, we noticed that there was an additional grave as compared to the April picture, bringing the total to 64. The Chinese website Bilibili had uploaded a video in August in which 64 graves can be seen on the right side of the cemetery. Now, if we add the left number of graves and the right number, the total comes out to 44+64= 108. As per an article uploaded on the website of Chinese Defence Ministry in April 2020, the Kangxiwa cemetery has graves of 108 martyrs. \u201cAfter nearly a year of searching for relatives, among the 108 martyrs buried in the Kangxiwa Martyrs Cemetery, 59 relatives of the martyrs have been found,\u201d Yang Baomin said, reads the article.

A Chinese website zhihu.com (similar to Quora) had uploaded the image in December last year. The date, at the end of the article, is mentioned to be 15 December 2019. The website carried the image in December 2019. It is pertinent to note that there is another image which is doing the round and is claimed to be that of a grave of a PLA soldier who died in the Galwan clash in June. When translated the text using Google Translate, we found that it reads: \u201cSoldier of troop 69316, born in Pingnan, Fujian in 2001, and was sacrificed during the border defence struggle against India in June 2020.\" However, The Quint hasn\u2019t been able to independently verify the authenticity of the image. The grave reads that the soldier was martyred in June 2020. Evidently, news channels aired old visuals with some dating back to 2011, while others could be traced back to 2019, claiming to show the graves of Chinese PLA soldiers who were killed in the Galwan Valley on 15 June.
