In a statement on Twitter, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Iran \"deeply regrets this disastrous mistake.\"\n\nThe crash of Ukrainian International Airlines flight PS752 killed 176 passengers and crew on Jan. 8, shortly after Iran launched a ballistic missile attack against U.S. bases in Iraq. The head of Iran\u2019s Civil Aviation Organization (CAO.IRI), Ali Abedzadeh, said it was \u201cscientifically impossible\u201d that the plane had been taken down by Iranian air defense systems deployed after the missile attack.\n\nThe crash occurred minutes after takeoff at the Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport. On Jan. 9, the Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti quoted Abedzadeh as saying: \u201cThe version that the plane was shot down by a rocket cannot be true under any circumstances \u2026 it is impossible from the scientific point of view.\u201d\n\nThe rationale behind the Iranian official\u2019s claim is unclear from the RIA Novosti article. However, variations of Abedzadeh\u2019s statement were reported by Iranian news agencies and provide more insight.\n\nThe Tehran Times has the fullest version of the statement: \u201cFrom a scientific viewpoint, it is impossible that a missile hit the Ukrainian plane.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can say that the airplane, considering the kind of the crash and the pilot\u2019s efforts to return it to Imam Khomeini airport, didn\u2019t explode in the air. So, the allegation that it was hit by missiles is totally ruled out.\u201d\n\nSo, Iran\u2019s explanation relies on the fact that the plane did not blow up and that the pilot retained enough control to turn back toward the airport.\n\n\u201cThe Iranian claim is nonsense,\u201d Riki Ellison, a defense expert and founder of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, told Polygraph.info. Ellison is among multiple officials or experts who have flagged Iran air defenses as the likely cause.\n\nIn this case, the alleged surface-to-air rocket launcher was quickly identified as the Russian-made Tor-M1, a mobile unit Iran has purchased from Russia.\n\nThe Tor-M1, which NATO calls the SA-15 Gauntlet, is a short-range \u201cpoint defense\u201d system that integrates the missile launcher and radar in a single tracked vehicle, according to Reuters. The Tor is designed to be lethal against targets at altitudes up to 6,000 meters (20,000 feet) and at ranges of 12 kilometers (7.5 miles). The Ukrainian airliner had ascended to 2,416 meters (7,925 feet) before it went down.\n\nEllison said the argument that the pilot was able to turn the plane around was deceptive. \u201cWhat does that have to do with being hit by a missile?\u201d He said there is \u201cevidence that the plane was hit by two rockets, and the pilot must have seen what was coming onto him. And so, he may have tried to turn away from the missiles.\u201d\n\nAn extensive analysis of cellphone video by the investigative website bellingcat shows what appears to be a rocket arcing through the night sky and exploding near the airliner as it climbs.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other officials have said intelligence reports strongly suggest Iran\u2019s air defense system mistakenly shot down the plane. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made the same assertion, citing intelligence from the U.S., Canada and other sources, as did British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council.\n\nAs reported by Al Jazeera, Danilov said Ukrainian investigators intend \u201cto look for the debris of a Russian Tor air defense missile.\"\n\nAbedzadeh\u2019s argument that the plane did not explode and, therefore, could not have been struck by a missile doesn\u2019t apply because of how the Tor missile works, Ellison said.\n\n\u201cThe SA-15 air defense weapon that has been used has fragmentation devices, so it gets close to the target, then releases small objects, like shrapnel. That doesn\u2019t destroy the whole plane, but takes part of the plane out. So, the second claim is not true, the plane does not explode in the air,\u201d Ellison explained.\n\nThe Iranian claims also clash with past incidents in which pilots whose aircraft were attacked by rockets have been able to safely land or bail out.\n\nIn 2003, pilots were able to land an Airbus owned by the courier DHL after it was hit by a Russian-made SAM-7 surface-to-air missile at Baghdad airport. The rocket set fire to the plane\u2019s left wing. No one was injured.\n\nIn August 2010, an Iranian Air Force F-4 Phantom fighter mistakenly entered a 20-kilometer no-fly zone around the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant, which was being guarded by the Iranian armed forces on high alert.\n\nReportedly due to miscommunication, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 Tor-M1 units misinterpreted the friendly jet as hostile. The Iranian pilots managed to eject and survive.", "lang": "en"}
