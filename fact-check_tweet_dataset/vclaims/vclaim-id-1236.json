The posts allege that the incident was not reported by national media. The claim regarding the timing is false: the incident did happen, but it took place eight years ago and Woodfork was arrested the next day. While much of the coverage was in local news outlets, the case was also reported by Fox News.\n\nThe claims were posted in the context of a tense debate on race relations in the United States following the death of George Floyd on May 25 in Minneapolis ( here ). The killing of Floyd, a Black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, ignited protests across the country and around the world.\n\nThe text of the posts says, in part: \u201cI supposed that if Mr. Strait had shot Tyrone, the whole country would know about the story. As it is, only Mrs. Strait died, so it's not of interest to Brian Williams and the rest of the main stream media.\u201d Examples of the claim are visible here and here .\n\nOn March 14, 2012 CBS-affiliate Channel 6 News reported that the Tulsa Police Department was searching for suspects in the beating of Bob Strait, 90, and Nancy Strait, 85, two North Tulsa residents ( here ). Nancy Strait died in a Tulsa hospital from wounds sustained during the assault. Bob Strait, who had also suffered critical injuries, died less than two months later ( here ).\n\nFox News reported on Bob Strait\u2019s death and the charges against Woodfork here .\n\nOn May 24, 2014, Tyrone Woodfork was convicted for the rape and murder of Nancy Strait ( here ). He was given multiple life-sentences, a decision upheld by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals in January 2016, according to other local reports ( here , here ).\n\nPartly false. The assault on an elderly couple in Tulsa, Oklahoma occurred in 2012.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
