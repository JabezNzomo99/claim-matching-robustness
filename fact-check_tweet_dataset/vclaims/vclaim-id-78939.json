The news is filled with stories of small businesses and colleges cutting back worker's hours or putting a freeze on hiring.\"\n\nHe responded, \"I think that's highly misleading. Since the Affordable Care Act passed, 90 percent of job growth has been in full-time positions.\" (The Affordable Care Act is the more formal name of Obama\u2019s health care law.)\n\nIn the other item, we checked a made by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, that \"this year, the overwhelming majority of new jobs are part-time.\"\n\nThese two comments paint sharply different pictures, so we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nFor Krueger, we checked the change in full-time and part-time employment between March 2010 and July 2013, then determined which of the two types of employment accounted for a larger share of the increase in overall employment. Here\u2019s the summary:\n\nSo Krueger is right -- 87 percent of the increase in employment over this period came from full-time jobs.\n\nStill, we will note that if you use a shorter time horizon, such as calendar year 2013, a large percentage of jobs created were part-time positions.\n\nIn other words, by choosing the time frame carefully, you can find support for either side of this argument.\n\nKrueger said that \"since the Affordable Care Act passed, 90 percent of job growth has been in full-time positions.\" The statistics show that 87 percent of the increase in jobs between March 2010 and July 2013 consisted of full-time jobs. A shorter time frame would show the opposite pattern, but on the numbers, Krueger is right. We rate the claim True.", "lang": "en"}
