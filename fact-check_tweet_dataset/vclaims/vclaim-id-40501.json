No, that's not true: A satire website published a humorous article including that quote, but other websites republished the satire as true news. It is not. Trump never said it.\n\nThis is an old claim that originated in 2015 as it was copied from a satire site and republished in both spanish and english, including an article (archived here) published under the title \"I will revoke the U.S. citizenship of all Puerto Ricans,\" says Donald Trump?\". It opened:\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nLike many old fake stories, this one keeps on living on social media. Sharing was revived in June 2019, prompting Lead Stories to address it.\n\nThe quote started its life in a satirical article published on September 3, 2015 by Adobo Chronicles titled \"PUERTO RICANS, CHAMORROS, OTHERS WILL LOSE CITIZENSHIP UNDER TRUMP PRESIDENCY\". It first poked fun at Rev. Al Sharpton, quoting the civil rights leader saying \"people that were from Puerto Rico all would have to go back if their parents were undocumented\" if Trump was elected president. The joke was that Sharpton believed that Puerto Ricans are not U.S. citizens. Then, it turned to a fictional Trump quote:\n\nSoon enough, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, while speaking to a group of investment bankers and hedge fund owners in New York City, allegedly declared that if elected, he will revoke the U.S. citizenship of all Puerto Ricans because they are \"not part of the American race.\"\n\n\n\nWhile Trump mentioned only Puerto Rico, his campaign told reporters that he meant to say all citizens from the territories of the U.S., including Guam, American Samoa, U.S. Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands.\n\n\n\n\"We don't really need these non-Americans and I don't need their votes to win the presidency,\" Trump said.\n\nAdobo Chronicles is an acknowledged satire site and describes itself as \"your source of up-to-date, unbelievable news. Everything you read on this site is based on fact, except for the lies.\" It even helps readers distinguish fact from funny but false:\n\nThe Trump quote was not in italics. It is not real.", "lang": "en"}
