The complaint has been filed under IPC Section 124A (sedition). #IABM files Criminal Case of Sedition against @ReallySwara for Inciting hatred towards Indian Army.

At least 100 similar cases must be filed against her across the country.. @ippatel pic.twitter.com/oH11yMhZP9 \u2014 Vibhor Anand (@vibhor_anand) August 11, 2018 The actress\u2019 tweet was also picked up by Postcard News, HMP News and Satya Vijayi, who wrote articles saying that the actress abused the Indian Army.\n\nWhat Was Swara Bhasker\u2019s Tweet Really About? After self-styled Godman Sadhguru\u2019s comment that \u201cliberals are fanatics\u201d, Swara Bhasker sent out a series of tweets using the hashtags #ButLiberalsAreFanatics #SadhguruSays. She made out multiple tweets related to atrocities that took place across the country in recent times. Her tweet on \u201cassholes tied men to jeep\u201d was not related to Major Gogoi or the Indian Army but the 2016 Una flogging where seven members of a Dalit family were tied to a jeep and beaten with iron rods for skinning a dead cow. The actress clarified the same on Twitter after her post was completely misinterpreted. This is what assholes with \u00e2\u0080\u0098big caste pride\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tying men to a jeep and flogging them looks like... #Una #Gujarat #NotTheIndianArmyClearly #HateCrime #ButLiberalsAreFanatics pic.twitter.com/yCrH9inlR8 \u2014 Swara Bhasker (@ReallySwara) August 11, 2018 Obviously \u00e2\u0080\u0098big caste pride\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is referring to the #Una case in Gujarat.. sigh! Read the newspapers, use your brains.. or don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t - whatever! https://t.co/PKPTQphCc3 \u2014 Swara Bhasker (@ReallySwara) August 10, 2018 Swara Bhasker has often found herself in the crosshairs of the right-wing who target her for her vocal views on certain issues. She has also been a repeated victim of misinformation with morphed tweets and fake quotes circulated in her name.", "lang": "en"}
