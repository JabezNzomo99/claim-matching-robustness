It was superimposed onto an image of him wearing a \u201cShowtime\u201d t-shirt.\n\nThe Missouri-based Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers 31-20 to claim their first Super Bowl title in 50 years earlier this month.\n\nPresident Donald Trump quickly took to Twitter Feb. 2 to congratulate the Chiefs for the win and for representing the \u201cGreat State of Kansas and, in fact, the entire USA,\u201d though he later deleted it and tweeted a corrected version. This viral image pokes fun at Trump\u2019s tweet.\n\nThough the t-shirt poking fun at Trump\u2019s erroneous tweet does exist, Mahomes didn\u2019t wear it. The original photo, posted on Twitter by Mahomes\u2019 marketing agent, Jacqueline Dahl, shows the outline of Missouri and the phrase \u201cThe Great State of Kansas\u201d were superimposed onto his shirt. Per the photo, his shirt actually had the word \u201cShowtime\u201d printed on it.\n\n\u201cLet the victory tour begin!\u201d Dahl tweeted. \u201cFirst Stop: Disney World.\u201d (RELATED: Did An Ohio State Football Player Wear An Ankle Monitor During The Fiesta Bowl?)\n\nMahomes could also be seen wearing the same \u201cShowtime\u201d shirt in a picture of him and his girlfriend, Brittany Matthews, at Disney World on Matthews\u2019 Instagram.\n\nSome websites, like the Political Tribune and Yardbarker, published articles erroneously reporting that he wore the \u201cGreat State of Kansas\u201d shirt. Former Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill also tweeted the doctored image without disclaiming that it was photoshopped.", "lang": "en"}
