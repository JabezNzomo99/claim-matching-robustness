The viral video is not from India. It is a five-year-old video from Lahore in Pakistan.\n\nFacebook user Chakrawarti Vikramaditya uploaded the post on July 7 and it has already been shared more than 600 times. In the comment section of the video, some users pointed out that the video does not appear to be from India and could be from Pakistan or Bangladesh.\n\nWith the help of InVID tool, we segregated the video into multiple keyframes and upon reverse searching one of them, we found another version of the video on Twitter as well as on YouTube.\n\nThe video has put out some information regarding the incident through sub-titles.\n\nUsing keywords from these sub-titles, we found the viral video in several Pakistani news videos related to the incident called Model Town massacre or Lahore massacre.\n\nThe incident happened in Lahore due to a violent clash between Pakistan's Punjab Police and Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT) on June 17, 2014.\n\nAs per a report published in tribune.com, eight people were killed and 97 injured in the clash.\n\nThe clash began when PAT activists tried to stop the police from removing barriers outside their leader's house in Lahore's Model Town, according to Express News.\n\nHence, the facts clearly establish that the viral video has no connection with India.", "lang": "en"}
