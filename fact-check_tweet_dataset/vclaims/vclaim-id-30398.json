Its rescue was not related to the recent wildfires.\n\nWildfires have swept across Australia since September, killing 26 people and destroying 2,000 homes (at the time of publication), according to The Associated Press. The World Wildlife Fund in Australia estimates that as many as 1.25 billion animals have been killed directly or indirectly by the fires, according to USA Today.\n\nA viral post alleges that the image shows a baby koala rescued from the Australian wildfires by a golden retriever.

The koala\u2019s rescue, McKinnon told The Associated Press, was not related to the wildfires.\n\n\u201cI think the baby koala fell out of his mum\u2019s pouch and didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d McKinnon told News.com.au. \u201cHe would have just wandered over to our back porch and seen the dogs in their beds, then decided to snuggle in Asha\u2019s fur because it\u2019s nice and warm.\u201d\n\nThe temperature in Strathdownie fell to around 41 degrees Fahrenheit the morning that McKinnon found the koala cuddling her dog, Asha, for warmth, according to CBS News. McKinnon told News.com.au that the koala \u201cnever would have made it through the night\u201d if it hadn\u2019t found her dog.\n\nShe gave the koala to a special caretaker until it could be released back into the wild, according to Insider.", "lang": "en"}
