Reporting on the development, several TV news channels broadcast a picture, claimed to be the first visual of the site of the encounter.\n\nThe above image is a screenshot of a broadcast by Zee News, which flashed the picture with a watermark, \u2018FIRST ON ZEE NEWS\u2019, accompanied by the anchor stating, \u201cWatch these pictures, first broadcast on Zee News. After shooting the perpetrators, Zee News brings you these visuals of police action (translated from Hindi).\u201d The video is posted below.\n\nAnother prominent news channel which broadcast the image as an \u2018exclusive\u2019 visual was the Gujarati news channel TV9Gujarati.\n\nOther news organizations which broadcast this image as a photograph of the encounter include the Telugu news channel ABN Telugu and TV9BharatVarsh.\n\nThe image has also been shared by social media users as a photograph of the recent encounter.\n\nAlt News found the image in question does not represent the recent encounter in Hyderabad. It was published in 2015.\n\nUpon reverse-searching the image, Alt News found a news article published by The Hindu published in April 2015, titled \u201820 woodcutters from TN gunned by A.P. police\u2018. According to the report, these men were shot dead in an alleged encounter in the Seshachalam forest at the foot of the Tirumala hills where they were found felling red sandalwood.\n\nThe image in question dates back to 2015. This however did not prevent several TV news channels from broadcasting it as \u2018exclusive\u2019 and \u2018first\u2019 visual of the Hyderabad encounter. The story was earlier fact-checked by Boom.", "lang": "en"}
