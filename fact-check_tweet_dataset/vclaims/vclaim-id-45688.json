The photograph, a collage of both the leaders, shows President Trump posing with the Bible for a photo-op outside St John's Church after a press conference at the White House on June 1; Hitler can be seen holding what appears to be a hardbound black book in a similar pose, as he addresses a crowd mainly comprising of children.\n\nHitler's photograph has been edited to include the black book in his hand as a comparison with Trump.\n\nMeanwhile the American president has been widely criticised for posing with a Bible for a photo-op after speaking about the importance of \"law and order\". On Monday, the American federal authorities applied tear gas to clear the Lafayette Square, an area within the President's Park, so that the president could pose for the photo-op. Demonstrators were staging protests against the brutal death of an Afro-American George Floyd, who was killed in custody by policemen in Minneapolis on May 25. This has triggered a massive outrage across the United States with thousands coming out to protest against racism in the country.\n\nNetizens have slammed Trump and compared him with the Nazi leader after the photo-op.\n\nOne such tweet reads, \"The Hitler I wonder whose bright idea was this to take this photo op? This had to be some cockamamie brainchild of the chief Moron himself, Trump. Nobody......and I mean NOBODY could be THAT STUPID\" (sic.) \n\n\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search and found multiple stock image sources which shows Hitler being photographed without any object in his hand. In the stock image, he can be seen greeting children and acknowledging their salutes, as several, primarily children, surround him. The image can be seen here on Gettyimages, Alamy and Shutterstocks.", "lang": "en"}
