Marco Rubio (Fla.), for his efforts in 2013 to foster a compromise on an immigration overhaul \u2014 while also playing on fears about the rise of the Islamic State militant group, which has captured significant territory in Iraq and Syria and is also known as ISIS.\n\nThe immigration bill, known as S.744, was forged by a bipartisan group known as the \u201cGang of Eight\u201dand passed the Senate but was never taken up in the House. Rubio now distances himself from the effort. (In the ad, Cruz claims he \u201cfought so hard to defeat\u201d the bill, apparently forgetting that it actually passed the Senate.)\n\nCruz\u2019s basic talking point, as expressed speaking to reporters in Kennesaw, Ga., on Nov. 19, is that the immigration bill \u201cgave President Obama blanket authority to admit Syrian refugees, tens of thousands of them, without mandating any meaningful background checks whatsoever. In the wake of Paris and San Bernardino, we\u2019ve seen just how foolhardy that is, particularly given that the FBI has told us they cannot vet those refugees to determine whether or not they\u2019re ISIS terrorists.\u201d\n\nAs evidence for his claim on the immigration bill, Cruz\u2019s campaign has pointed to an article on a conservative website, the Conservative Review, which has touted a straw poll favoring Cruz. That article claimed that relatively obscure provisions in the bill would have \u201copened the floodgates to Islamic refugees.\u201d\n\n\u201cHad the bill passed in 2013, it would have given the Obama administration power to define who is considered stateless,\u201d wrote senior editor Daniel Horowitz. \u201cMost of those likely to be designated as stateless are from Islamic hell holes and would include the Syrians, Somalis, Palestinians, and the Muslim Rohingya in Burma.\u201d He reiterated that claim in an email: \u201cThis Rubio bill would have rolled back 35 years\u2019 worth of legislative gains and granted Obama authority to carte blanche bestow categorical refugee status on groups of Muslims involved in civil wars all over the most volatile parts of the Middle East.\u201d\n\nIn particular, Horowitz referred to Section 3405, which says: \u201cThis section would allow the small number of individuals in the United States, who have no nationality through no fault of their own, to apply for lawful status if they are not inadmissible under criminal or security grounds.\u201d\n\nBut immigration experts have said that his interpretation of Section 3405 is simply wrong. Indeed, the bill\u2019s committee report makes it clear that this provision applies to people who are already in the United States: \u201cThis section would allow the small number of individuals in the United States, who have no nationality through no fault of their own, to apply for lawful status if they are not inadmissible under criminal or security grounds.\u201d\n\nBut, again, this interpretation is at odds with reality. As the committee report states, this is simply a codification of something known as the Lautenberg amendment, which was enacted in 1990 as a rider in an appropriations bill and, thus, must be renewed each year. The provision eases the burden of proof for the applicant after the State Department has invited a particular group to apply for refugee status for reasons of \u201chumanitarian concern,\u201d such as religious persecution.\n\nThe Lautenberg amendment originally was aimed at refugees from the former Soviet Union and Southeast Asia but over time has been expanded to include religious minorities. Essentially, it streamlines the process but does not waive many background checks. Indeed, as the conference report stated: \u201cEach individual applicant would still need to qualify and pass the necessary security checks and be subject to the annual limit on refugees.\u201d Moreover, these applicants would still be subject to the ceiling on refugee admissions set each year by the president in consultation with Congress.\n\n\u201cThis is intended for groups like Yazidis from Sinjar [Iraq], so that Homeland Security would not have to waste time and resources establishing the obvious \u2014 that they are persecuted \u2014 and be able to spend DHS resources more wisely by focusing on admissibility and security issues and screenings,\u201d said Mark Hetfield, president of HIAS, a refugee settlement organization. \u201cSo, if anything, S. 744 would have allowed the President to do even more to identify and exclude terrorists more efficiently by not wasting government resources on investigating the obvious; i.e., that Yazidis from Sinjar are persecuted.\u201d\n\nActually, this statement is simply bizarre. With or without the Senate immigration bill, Obama had the authority to admit refugees, from any country, under the Refugee Act of 1980, as long as they are refugees and are admissible. Every president since the passage of the law \u2014 Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama \u2014 has exercised that right repeatedly for hundreds of thousands of refugees.", "lang": "en"}
