In the video clip, Rahul Gandhi can be heard saying \u2018I will provide you fields on the moon and in the future, you will grow potatoes there. I will put a machine there and we will bring the potatoes back to Gujarat\u2019. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nFact: The statements of Rahul Gandhi about providing farming lands on the moon and bringing back potatoes to Gujarat were taken out of context from his election speech in Gujarat in 2017.

You are not able to make money from farming here.. Look! there is the moon there.. I will provide you farm lands on it.. and in the future you will grow potatoes there.. I will put a machine there.. and we will bring those potatoes back to Gujarat\u2019.\n\nTo sum it up, statements of Rahul Gandhi about providing farming lands on moon and bringing potatoes back to Gujarat were taken out of context.
