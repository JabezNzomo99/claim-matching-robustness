Panoorin.\u201d (Arrest of Loiterers in the Streets of the Police as Ordered by Pres. Duterte has Reduced the Nation\u2019s Crime Incidence! Watch Now!)\n\nAs of June 29, the post has been shared in 10 Facebook pages and groups with a combined total of 992,141 followers and 1,213 interactions.\n\nThe facts: As of this posting, no recent statistics show that the anti-tambay operations have reduced crime incidence nationwide. The blog posts sole content is an opinion video.\n\nThe most recent crime statistic released by the police on May 24 was the 30% decrease in crime rate in Metro Manila from May 14-20 as compared to the same period in 2017. This was before the \u201canti-tambay\u201d operations.\n\nThe embedded video, uploaded by \u201cDU30 News,\u201d is a reupload of politics professor Antonio Contreras\u2019 June 22 Facebook Live video. The topics were the \u201cculture of tambays and culture of support and criticism to Duterte.\u201d Contreras did not mention anything supporting the claim, but rather he stated that while not all tambays are criminals, it is backed by data that a significant amount of criminals are tambays.\n\nHowever, People\u2019s Television Network (PTV) reported on June 24 that Metro Manila experienced a 49% decrease in crime rate from July 2016 to May 2018 brought by the \u201cordinances and laws against tambays.\u201d But National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) Chief Superintendent Guillermo Eleazar on June 15 attributed the decrease to the anti-drug operations.\n\nThe blog\u2019s disclaimer, contact details, its Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and contribution page all lead to a defunct page.
