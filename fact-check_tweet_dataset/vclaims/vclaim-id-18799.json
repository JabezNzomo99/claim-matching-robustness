Local news coverage shows that Obama\u2019s portrait did not fall off the wall.\n\nThe Colorado State Capitol Building has portraits of nearly 40 U.S. presidents hanging on the third-floor rotunda. On Aug. 1, state officials and members of the public gathered for the unveiling of Trump\u2019s portrait.\n\nThis Facebook video, originally posted to Twitter, allegedly captures Obama\u2019s portrait falling off the wall as officials remove the curtain from Trump\u2019s painting. The sound of glass breaking follows shortly afterwards.\n\nHowever, the footage of the unveiling has been manipulated. A video posted by the local CBS affiliate shows that Obama\u2019s portrait remained fixed to the wall during the event. Thomas Peipert, a reporter for The Associated Press who attended the unveiling, also confirmed to the AP that it did not fall.\n\nContributing even more to its dubiousness, none of the people attending the event seem to react to the painting falling off the wall in the Facebook video.

She is the same artist who created the portrait of Obama that hangs in the State Capitol.", "lang": "en"}
