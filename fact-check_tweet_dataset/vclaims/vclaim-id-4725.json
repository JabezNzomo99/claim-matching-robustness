Setting aside that it is far too early to claim credit for broad economic trends, Trump\u2019s choice of supporting evidence \u2014 the labor participation rate and number of food stamp recipients \u2014 is odd. These rates are influenced by changing demographics and long-term trends, not just the administration\u2019s policies or short-term economic gains.\n\nThere are two ways that \u201cpeople who have been out of the workforce\u201d can \u201ccome back off the sidelines.\u201d One is to join the labor force. The other is to gain employment. These are not the same.\n\nGary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, argues that workforce participation of adults between 25 and 54 is a more accurate representation of the labor force because they are most likely to be employed, having finished their education but having not yet retired. He noted: \u201cThis trend has been well underway. We had a very, very long recovery from an extremely deep recession. It wasn\u2019t spectacularly fast, but it has been spectacularly long.\u201d\n\nDoes this mean that large populations are coming back off the sidelines, as Trump says? Not necessarily. It has a lot to do with demographics trends of the specific age group she highlighted. (For some perspective, labor participation among this group has declined by 1.3 percent between 2007 and 2017. The same measure jumped by 4.8 percentage points between 1980 and 1990 as children born to the baby-boom generation entered the workforce.)\n\nBurtless pointed to the increase in the employment-to-population ratio among adults 25 to 54, which measures how much of the adult population is employed. It is 0.8 percent higher than a year ago. Like the labor force participation rate, it\u2019s not a hugely fast increase. But it\u2019s improving faster because there is a decline in unemployment.\n\nTo start with, 65 percent of people receiving food stamps or benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are children, elderly adults or non-elderly adults with disabilities \u2014 groups that are not part of the labor force. In fiscal year 2016, which spanned the Trump and Obama administrations, only 8.8 percent of SNAP participants were non-disabled adults between the ages of 18 and 49 in households where children were not present. In other words, the vast majority of the people on food stamps aren\u2019t working.\n\nSo, are 2 million people coming off food stamps because the economy has improved? The exact reason for this decline is still unclear, but Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow in the Income and Benefits Policy Center at the Urban Institute, pointed to several possible forces for the decline.\n\nFor one, the economy could be helping \u2014 the recipient or someone in their household could have become employed or they could be earning more. It\u2019s also possible that nothing in their economic situation changed. Instead, they no longer qualify for SNAP because several states have rolled back recession-era waivers that allowed some adults to keep benefits for longer periods of time without employment. Reports have also suggested that immigrant families with citizen children have dropped out of the program for fear of the administration\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nTrump is straddling the line. Labor force participation among prime-age workers has been increasing, but not by \u201clarge\u201d amounts, as she claims. It has been steadily, slowly climbing since well before Trump took office. Plus, experts argue that labor force participation has more to do with demographic trends than an individual administration\u2019s policy \u2014 especially one that hasn\u2019t even reached the halfway mark of its first term.\n\nFurthermore, a stronger job market is probably one factor in the people coming off food stamps, but it is certainly not a metric to prove that adults are reentering the economy. The majority of SNAP recipients are children, elderly or disabled. Of the adults who do not have a disability, recent policy changes mean they may no longer qualify for food stamps, which doesn\u2019t equate to reentering the workforce.", "lang": "en"}
