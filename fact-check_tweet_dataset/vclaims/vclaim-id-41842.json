NHS North Central London CCG (Clinical Commissioning Group), whose logo is on the letter, confirmed that it was real.\n\nThe Paediatric Intensive Care Society (PICS) also confirmed that NHS England had sent out an alert over the weekend of 25 April, saying the same thing.\n\nIn response to the reaction to the letter, medical experts have generally stated that these symptoms seem to be incredibly rare, and, as SARS-CoV-2 is new, we don\u2019t yet know all the ways it can present.\n\nOn BBC Breakfast on Tuesday morning, GP Dr William Bird said the numbers were incredibly small, and that children were still generally exhibiting mild reactions to the coronavirus.\n\nIn a statement, PICS reiterated this, adding that while many of these children had tested positive for Covid-19, some had not.\n\nThe letter also says the cases in question had some overlapping features with atypical Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome. The cause of Kawasaki disease is not entirely understood, but its effects include swelling of the blood vessels of the heart. Toxic shock syndrome is a severe bacterial infection. Both require hospitalisation.\n\nIt\u2019s very rare for people under 15 to die from Covid-19\u2014data from the Office for National Statistics shows two deaths of under-15s involving Covid-19 were registered up to 17 April 2020 in England and Wales.\n\nHowever, children should be taken to hospital if parents are worried about any symptom they may be displaying. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has produced a chart of symptoms parents should generally look out for in children, coronavirus-related or not.", "lang": "en"}
