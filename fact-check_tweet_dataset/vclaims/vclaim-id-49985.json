The claim is false; the recording does not match Akufo-Addo\u2019s voice while his information minister dismissed it as \u201cobviously false\u201d.\n\nA WhatsApp message forwarded to AFP Fact Check reads: \u201cUnbelievable but true. Ghanaian President came across this secret documents (sic) about COVID-19 and decides to release it to his people out of patriotism. Please carefully listen to it and share widely to expose this evil. Forwarded as received.\u201d\n\nIt is accompanied by a 14-minute voice note featuring a man\u2019s voice claiming to be quoting a Rockefeller Foundation article, which is said to detail how the novel coronavirus was biologically manufactured in a laboratory then released into the world.\n\n\u201cDear fellow Ghanaians, please listen to this extract from the Rockefeller Foundation article. It is actually from the website, a PDF document. Hypothesize a simulated global outbreak, required steps, various phases, overall timeline and expected outcomes - Rockefeller, Lock Step, 2010. Create a very contagious but super low mortality rate virus to fit the needed plan,\u201d the man in the audio recording says.\n\nOn June 25, 2020, American author Dr Christiane Northrup shared the same claim on her public Facebook page, which has more than 450,000 followers.\n\n\u201cLet's hear it for the President of Ghana!\u201d she wrote alongside a YouTube link of the voice recording.\n\nA search of the keywords \u201cGhana President\u201d, \u201cRockefeller\u201d and \u201cCOVID 19\u201d revealed several more YouTube videos (here, here and here) claiming that the audio clip was voiced by Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo.\n\nSimilar claims appear in Facebook posts here and here.\n\nWhile the accent of the man in the voice recording is west African, it is distinctly not that of Akufo-Addo when compared to some of his public appearances, like here and here.\n\nGhana\u2019s Information Minister Kojo Oppong Nkrumah also confirmed to AFP that the audio recording was not made by the president, dismissing the claim that it was, as \u201cobviously false\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe expect a lot of these fabrications at this time that we are entering electioneering season. It's not even his voice,\u201d Nkrumah told AFP via WhatsApp.\n\nAn online search reveals a Facebook post published on May 19, 2020, that features the same text read aloud in the audio clip. This post, which predates those with the audio recording, does not make any mention of the Ghanaian leader.\n\nThe recording details how COVID-19 was supposedly created in a laboratory then released systematically in various countries, thereby forcing people to conform to the \u201cNew World Order\u201d.\n\nHowever, the World Health Organization (WHO) has maintained that there is no evidence that the virus was manufactured in a laboratory, describing the assertions as \u201cspeculative\u201d. Other scientists have also dismissed this claim.\n\nThe voice in the audio clip enumerates a long list of actions taken to supposedly create and release the virus, none of which are featured in any document on the Rockefeller Institute\u2019s website. The \u201cLock Step\u201d scenario that it references is one of the speculative scenarios in the Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s \u201cScenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development\u201d report. This publication from 2010 imagined how technology and development could evolve in the future, using several fictional scenarios.\n\nThough the document does not appear on the Foundation's website, Ashley Chang, the foundation's head of media relations, confirmed to AFP in an email that the \u201creport was done by a grantee of the Foundation\u201d.\n\nThe Lock Step scenario imagined \u201ca world of tighter top-down government control and more authoritarian leadership, with limited innovation and growing citizen pushback\u201d in which a new influenza virus hit in 2012 and spread worldwide.\n\nIn his list of action items, the voice in the message also says: \u201cSimulate the Lock Step hypothesis just prior to the planned research strain release using a real-world exercise as a final war game to determine expected response/timelines/outcomes.\u201d This the voice attributes to \u201cGates Event 201, October 2019\u201d.\n\nEvent 201 was a tabletop pandemic exercise organised by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation held on October 18, 2019.\n\nThe event, which examined where public-private partnerships would be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic, has led to conspiracy theories that COVID-19 was manmade and was planned during the exercise.\n\nHowever, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security released a statement noting that no predictions were made during the high-level meeting.\n\n\u201cRecently, the Center for Health Security has received questions about whether the pandemic exercise predicted the current novel coronavirus outbreak in China. To be clear, the Center for Health Security and partners did not make a prediction during our tabletop exercise. For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction. Instead, the exercise served to highlight preparedness and response challenges that would likely arise in a very severe pandemic,\u201d reads the statement.\n\u2022 A quote by Ghana's information minister in the opening paragraph describing the voice note as \u201cabsolutely false\u201d was updated to \u201cobviously false\u201d as reflected elsewhere in the copy", "lang": "en"}
