The Daily Caller News Foundation found no record of it in his writings.\n\n\u201cWe cannot find a Napoleon quotation like this, nor does it seem evenly (sic) remotely credible,\u201d said Peter Hicks of the Napoleon Foundation in an email to the DCNF. \u201cNapoleon does not even seem to have made a remark concerning the French wars of religion 1562-98.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, two other experts \u2013 Florida State University professor Rafe Blaufarb and Oxford University professor Michael Broers \u2013 also noted in emails to the DCNF that the language of the quotation did not match that of the time period.\n\nThe origin of the expression is unknown, but it has been circulating since at least 1999.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
