A viral video on social media claims so.\n\nIndia Today\u2019s Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The video in question is an old one of students being taken from Bihar\u2019s Purnea and Kishanganj to Pune for studies in a madrasa there.\n\nOn May 31, a Facebook page named Kurnool city Page\u2019 posted a video showing some children carrying bags on their shoulders and walking in a line into a spacious location resembling a railway station complex.\n\nThe video is accompanied by a text in Hindi, which translates into: Some 63 students were arrested from Rajabazar area in Kolkata and police say they were being moved for terror training.\n\nThe post went on to claim that media won\u2019t flash the news following orders from higher authorities. The Facebook page urges readers to urgently forward the post so that people get to know about it. At the time of filing this story, the post received nearly 6,000 views and more than 200 shares.\n\nHere is the archived version of the post.\n\nMany other Facebook users such as Mangalam Saqib and Asad P also shared the video with the same claim.\n\nWe found that the video has been doing the rounds on social media with false claims for the last few years.\n\nAFWA has found that it is an old video from 2015. Facebook user Merailaka.com posted the same video on August 8, 2015, debunking the claim.\n\nWe also found several newspaper articles, which had reported back in 2015 that 63 children, aged between 6 and 17 years, had been intercepted by the Government Railway Police (GRP) on August 2 while they were boarding a train from Sealdah station without any ID cards and documents.\n\nThe Indian Express reported that the children had come from Bihar\u2019s Purnea-Kishangunj belt and were heading to Pune for studies at a madrasa. Quoting Ashokendu Sengupta, chairman of the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, The Indian Express wrote, The children were sent back to Purnea with police escort and the CWC there had been asked to verify their addresses and claims that they were being taken to Maharashtra for higher studies. We could not take any risk.\n\nOther links of the incident can be checked here and here.", "lang": "en"}
