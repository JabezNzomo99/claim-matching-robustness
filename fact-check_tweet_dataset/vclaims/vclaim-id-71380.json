He told me that his treatment of Prince Charles through Ayurveda and Homeopathy has been successful. This is just one example of how the system can work,\" Naik said.\n\n\"Wow. Prince Charles cured of #COVID19 by Ayurvedic methods in Bangalore.\n\nThis is big. Hopefully, the international media will stop mocking Ayurveda now!,\" a Twitter user wrote.\n\n\"Per #Bengaluru doctor, he cured #PrinceCharles of #CoronaVirus by using Ayurveda and Homeopathy medicines ...\n\n\n\nPerhaps @MoHFW_INDIA @moayush can speak to this doctor and share the magic-medicines with rest of India?\" wrote another.\n\nElla Lynch, a spokesperson for Prince Charles has denied the claim and called it incorrect information.\n\n\"This information is incorrect. The Prince of Wales followed the medical advice of the NHS (National Health Service) in the UK and nothing more,\" The Indian Express quoted Ella Lynch, a spokesperson for the Prince of Wales as saying.\n\nDr Isaac Mathai has said that Prince Charles is \"a patient of his\" and he would not comment on the issue.\n\n\"I have so many patients and I cannot speak about their health condition because it's a matter of confidentiality,\" The News Minute quoted Dr Mathai as saying.\n\nIn a video statement, on April 2, the Prince of Wales thanked UK's National Health Service for its efforts in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"Having recently gone through the process of contracting this coronavirus - luckily with relatively mild symptoms - I now find myself on the other side of the illness, but still in no less a state of social distance and general isolation,\" the prince said.\n\n\"And at a time when doctors, nurses and all the vital ancillary staff that form the backbone of our remarkable NHS are increasingly under such enormous strain, and risk, as they battle heroically to save lives in intensive care centres...\" the heir to the British throne added.\n\n\n\nTherefore, Ayurveda did not cure Prince Charles.\n\nThe type of information is fatal during an outbreak as severe as COVID-19 because citizens might underestimate the gravity of the situation and get complacent about protecting themselves on hearing a minister suggest that an Ayurvedic cure exists for COVID-19.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343\n\nAlso Read: Fact Check: No, Muslim Men Are Not Sneezing In Unison To Spread Novel Coronavirus In Viral Video", "lang": "en"}
