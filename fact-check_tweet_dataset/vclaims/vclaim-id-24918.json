The claim is false; the two mammals were found on the UK\u2019s east coast; a scientific study published later found the reasons for their deaths was complex, but there was \u201cno evidence of man-made trauma\u201d.\n\nThe photo was shared more than 7,300 times after being posted here on Facebook on April 19, 2019. The image shows two whales lying side-by-side on a beach. They are surrounded by a makeshift fence and a group of people.\n\nThe caption alongside the post states: \u201cTwo dead sperm whales in Germany with stomachs full of plastic & car parts...\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe same photo was shared with a similar claim here and here on Facebook, and here and here on Twitter.\n\nThe claim is false. A reverse image search on Google found the same photo published in this January 2016 Daily Express article about five dead sperm whales which washed up on the British coast. The caption states: \"Two of the three huge sperm whales have washed up on a beach in Lincolnshire.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of a photo from the misleading Facebook post (L) and the Daily Express photo (R), credited to KNS News Agency:\n\nThe article states in part: \u201cFIVE dead sperm whales the size of a bus have washed up on a British beach while one of them EXPLODED during an autopsy.\n\n\u201cThe most recent washed up whale was discovered five miles from Skegness, where three more bodies were found yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother whale was found on Saturday across The Wash from Hunstanton in Norfolk.\u201d\n\nThis article published by The Guardian contains a video it states shows the two dead whales on a beach in the town of Skegness in Lincolnshire, England. Below is a screenshot comparison of the video (L) and the photo from the misleading posts (R). The main corresponding features are circled in red.\n\nAn AFP report about the dead whales was published here on January 25, 2016, along with a photo of the two animals.\n\nAn expert is quoted in the story saying the whales probably swam south looking for food but got disorientated.\n\nIn August 2018, Utrecht University in the Netherlands published this study on the 2016 whale deaths, analysing the strandings of 30 sperm whales across the southern North Sea -- including those near Skegness.\n\n\u201cWe found no evidence of manmade trauma,\u201d wrote lead author Lonneke IJsseldijk, adding the deaths occurred because of \u201ca combination of several complex environmental factors\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn nine examined whales, marine debris (plastic) were also found, but had not caused obstructions of the gastrointestinal tract or starvation and were deemed of secondary importance.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
