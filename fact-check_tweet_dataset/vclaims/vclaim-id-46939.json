It\u2019s our English jurisprudential culture, our European culture.\u201d\n\nThe video was deceptively edited to suggest Biden made racist remarks. His actual comment was about how he thinks violence against women dates back to English common law.\n\nBiden made a campaign stop in Derry, New Hampshire, Dec. 30, where he discussed topics ranging from health care to gun control to violence against women.\n\nHere\u2019s the full video of his campaign stop:\n\nOn Jan. 2, a Facebook user shared a short clip from Biden\u2019s speech, with the headline and caption suggesting Biden made a racist remark. (RELATED: How Many Times Has Joe Biden Run For President?)\n\n\u201cOur culture is not imported from some African nation or some Asian nation,\u201d Biden says in the clip. \u201cIt\u2019s our English jurisprudential culture, our European culture.\u201d\n\nSimilar videos have been circulating on Twitter: @mooncult, who originally posted it, said Biden \u201cproclaims the \u2018European\u2019 identity of America,\u201d while @BethLynch2020 noted \u201cit\u2019s almost like Joe Biden is Racist.\u201d But the 18-second Facebook clip\u2019s claim \u2013 that Biden made a racist remark \u2013 doesn\u2019t hold up.\n\nThe Daily Caller reviewed the entirety of Biden\u2019s nearly 80-minute talk and found that the viral clip has been deceptively edited to remove key context surrounding his comment. It actually comes from Biden\u2019s roughly 13-minute answer to an audience member asking about his \u201cwork with women and sexual assault, domestic violence\u201d and his \u201cvision for that in our country.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president spoke about how, in his view, the U.S. has a \u201ccultural problem\u201d with violence against women stemming from English common law, known as the \u201crule of thumb,\u201d that he says permitted men to beat their wives to death in the 1300s. This supposed origin of \u201crule of thumb\u201d phrase has been debunked by numerous researchers.\n\nWhile discussing the difficulty victims face reporting sexual assault on college campuses, Biden circled back to English common law:\n\n\u201cFolks, this is about changing the culture, our culture, our culture. It\u2019s not imported from some African nation or some Asian nation,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s our English jurisprudential culture, our European culture, that says it\u2019s all right.\u201d\n\nThe 18-second clip excludes Biden\u2019s sentence about changing culture and cuts off before the ending clause, in which \u201cit\u201d refers to violence against women. The clip deceptively makes it look like Biden made a racist comment that aligns with white nationalist views, when, in actuality, he was talking about how he thinks violence against women dates back to English common law.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign confirmed to The Associated Press that the representation in the edited video was inaccurate.", "lang": "en"}
