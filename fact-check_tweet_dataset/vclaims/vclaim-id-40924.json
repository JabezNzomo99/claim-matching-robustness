Sarah Elago where she advised the public to sneeze with their eyes wide open to see if they might be infecting other people.\n\nOn March 23, a netizen uploaded on Facebook a counterfeit version of a graphic published on the party-list\u2019s official FB page on March 16. The original quote card featured Elago\u2019s response to a statement by then-Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo saying \u201cnobody dies of hunger,\u201d as concerns were raised about food security during the Luzon lockdown:\n\n\u201cIt's not only insensitive and callous, but also, dangerous, since it downplays the urgency and necessity of immediate relief and food assistance to those whose jobs and livelihood are now heavily affected.\u201d\n\nThe counterfeit FB post placed a blue rectangle over the original text, and superimposed this fabricated statement over it: \u201ckatulad nga ng sinabi ni VP Leni na kung uubo kayo ay pahigop, ang payo ko naman ay kapag hahatsing ka dapat nakadilat para makita kung may tatamaan (Just as VP Leni said that you should suck in your cough, my advice is that if you sneeze, keep your eyes open to see if you are sneezing on somebody).\u201d\n\nA phrase on the upper right corner of the quote card also shows the text, \u201cOn Spox Panelo\u2019s denial of hunger crisis in PH,\u201d which was present in the Kabataan Partylist\u2019s original graphic.\n\nThe partylist representative refuted the fake quote card in an April 6 FB post, where she warned against the \u201ccontinued proliferation of fake news and disinformation\u201d about her and her organization.\n\nAlso, the \u201cstatement\u201d of Vice President Leni Robredo mentioned in the fake statement -- where she allegedly told people to suck in their cough -- is not true. VERA Files Fact Check debunked two versions of this claim last month.\n\nThe fake post on Elago surfaced around the same time she expressed concern in a series of FB posts over a measure seeking to grant Pres. Rodrigo Duterte special powers to address the COVID-19 emergency. The law was eventually signed on March 24.\n\nThe netizen\u2019s fake quote card continues to be shared three weeks after publication. It has received over 1,400 reactions from social media users, most of which are Laugh reacts. The comments and shares, with a combined total of over 4,200, are mixed. Some netizens call the material \u201cfake,\u201d others believe it, while some question its veracity.", "lang": "en"}
