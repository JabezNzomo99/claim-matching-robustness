If successful, India would have carried out the fourth successful soft-landing on the moon by any country.\n\nContact was lost with ISRO when the lander was 2 kilometers from the lunar surface. \n\n\n\nDespite the setback. ISRO received praise for their work from across the country,\n\nThe affair was a big event, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi attending the event with more than 70 school children. The event was held at the ISRO, Benagaluru.\n\nThe mission began with its launch on July 22.\n\nBOOM tells you all you need to know about the mission.\n\nWhat is the aim of the mission?\n\nChandrayaan 2 is a lunar mission that aims to explore the south polar mission of the moon. This feat is significant, since no country has gone to this region of the moon before.\n\nIt is a mission that spanned 48 days till landing. The earth bound spanned the first 23 days. The next 7 days (until the 30th day) saw it go into a lunar bound phase. The lunar bound phase lasted until the 45th day. Landing sequences are expected to end on September 7, the 48th day.\n\nThe trajectory of the mission can been seen below.\n\u2022 Chandrayaan 2 will be launched with ISRO's most powerful launcher yet\n\u2022 The components of the mission includes a wholly indigenous developed rover and software developed within the country\n\u2022 The mission is estimated to have cost \u20b9948 crores, out of which \u20b9608 crores were spent for the orbiter, lander, rover navigation and support and the remaining \u20b9375 crore for the launch vehicle.\n\nIn US dollar terms, the mission is estimated to cost $124 million, which is less than half the budget of the film 'Avengers: Endgame' at $356 million.\n\nThe three main components of the mission that will be launched are:\n\u2022 The Orbiter: It will be capable of communicating with India Deep Space Network (IDSN), near Bangalore. The orbiter will have the ability to be in a 100 x 100 kilometer lunar orbit for one year\n\u2022 The 'Vikram' Lander: It has been named after Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, father of India's space program. It is designed to function for one lunar day - or 14 earth day and to make the soft landing on moon. Vikram can communicate with the orbiter and the IDSN.\n\u2022 The Pragyan Rover: Named after 'pragyan' or 'wisdom' in Sanskrit, this rover can leverage solar energy to travel half a kilometer at a speed of 1 centimeter per second. It can communicate with the lander.\n\nAn example of a few things the payload of the orbiter, lander and rover will do\n\nPayloads in the orbiter will:\n\u2022 Derive the elemental composure of the moon\n\u2022 Work towards confirming the presence of water on the moon\n\nPayloads in the lander will:\n\nPayloads in the rover will:\n\u2022 Determine the elemental composition near the landing site\n\u2022 Scout elements in the vicinity of the landing site.\n\nHow is it different from Chandrayaan 1?\n\nChandrayaan 1 was a spacecraft that made around 3,400 orbits around the moon, spanning 312 days until April 2009. Its watershed moment was when it discovered traces of water on the moon, and water ice in the north polar region of the moon. It also discovered traces of aluminum, magnesium and silicon on the lunar surface.\n\nChandrayaan 2 attempts to widen the scope of Chandrayaan 1 by launching a rover to the south polar region of the moon. Moreover, the lift-off mass of the launch vehicle is heavier than that of Chandrayaan 1 - 1380 kilos versus 3850 kilos.\n\nWhat have been some other soft landing attempts by other countries?\n\nISRO states that a total of 38 soft landing attempts have been made, with a success rate of 52%. In the last year alone, China and Israel have launched their own space missions.\n\nNASA data shows that while Israel's Baresheet mission unsuccessfully attempted to land the first mission by a private company in April 2019, China's Chang'e 4 and Yutu 2 successfully pulled off the first far side landing in July 2018.\n\nSince 2010, the United States has launched 4 moon missions, China has launched 6 and Israel and India have launched 1 mission each.", "lang": "en"}
