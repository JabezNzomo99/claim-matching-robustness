The posts claim the news article relates to a Pakistani court\u2019s decision to grant travel permission to Nawaz Sharif, the country's ailing former Prime Minister, who was imprisoned for corruption. The claim is false; the image does not show a genuine newspaper.\n\nThe image was published here in a Facebook post on November 17, 2019. It has been shared 897 times.\n\nThe purported newspaper front page bears the headline \u201cAre Pakistani courts bitches of the riches?\u201d and features a photo of Nawaz Sharif.\n\n\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: #American #newspaper from #Virginia raised a very valid question through its headline which is self-explanatory. To this question, I say a big 'Yes' that #Pakistani #Courts are #BitchesoftheRiches and sadly its the people of #Pakistan who will pay for his #corruption.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nSharif, who was ousted from his third premiership in 2017 and later imprisoned on corruption charges, travelled to London to receive medical treatment on November 19, AFP reported here. Travel was granted by the judiciary and was ultimately allowed after the current government waived steep bail conditions.\n\nThe same misleading image was also posted on Facebook here and here. Another Facebook post here showed a screenshot of a tweet that included the photo and a caption that reads: \"This is what the World thinks of our top Courts - SHAMEFUL.\"\n\nThe claim is false; the image does not show a genuine US newspaper article.\n\nA review of the Washington-based Newseum\u2019s website, which archives the daily front pages of US newspapers, found that there was no newspaper in Virginia with a name starting with \u201cNews,\u201d as the image in the misleading posts appeared to show.\n\nA reverse image search on Google for the photo of Sharif used in the misleading post found the image was taken from this 2018 report by The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), a US-based non-profit journalism network.\n\nThe ICIJ article carries the same photo and the same overlay text, which can be seen in the misleading Facebook post. Below is a screenshot comparison of the ICIJ report (L) and the misleading image (R) with the text noted in a red box:\n\nThe photo of Sharif was cropped from an AFP photo taken in London on July 6, 2018, the same day that a court in Islamabad sentenced him in absentia on graft charges. Below is a screenshot of the photo, which can be seen on the AFP Forum here.\n\nThe photo caption states: \"Pakistan's former prime minister Nawaz Sharif arrives at his office in central London on July 6, 2018. Pakistan's former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was sentenced in absentia to 10 years in prison by a corruption court in Islamabad on July 6, 2018, lawyers said, dealing a serious blow to his party's troubled campaign ahead of July 25 elections.
