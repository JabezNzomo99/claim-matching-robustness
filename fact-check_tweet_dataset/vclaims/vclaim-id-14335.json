We had inquired about whether the withdrawal would affect the election of Judge Raul Pangalangan.\n\n\u201cOnce elected and sworn in, the judges shall hold office for a term of nine years in accordance with the Statute and the principle of judicial independence,\u201d the ICC said.\n\nPanelo said the Philippines need not pull out Pangalangan. \"We don\u2019t have to pull out anybody. If the position is we never were under the jurisdiction of the court, then it behooves whoever is there to do something for himself,\" Panelo said.\n\nSantiago was elected judge of the ICC in 2011, making her the first Filipino and first Asian from a developing country to be elected ICC judge.\n\nSantiago was forced to step down in 2014 due to illness. She died in 2016, months after the presidential elections, where she came in last in the 5-way-race that elected Rodrigo Duterte president. \u2013 Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
