We prayed for Australia and Amazon, how can we be so ignorant about of own devabhoomi?\u201d tweeted one Bhumika Dogra on May 26.\n\nFacebook pages United Against Pseudosecular and Dehradun Wale posted this collage with the same claim.\n\nIndian National Congress\u2019s national convenor Hasiba Amin posted the same on May 27, 2020. The official handle of National Students Union of India (NSUI), the student\u2019s wing Congress, too tweeted the same image. A tweet by Telugu actor Sai Dharam Tej which carried this collage garnered more than 400 retweets so far.\n\nWith the help of reverse image search on Google and Russian search engine Yandex, Alt News was able to trace back some of the images. We found that at least three out of seven images were old. In the course of this article, we will fact-check each image separately in no particular order.\n\nWhile this image is claimed to be a recent image from Uttarakhand\u2019s Chamoli district, it was traced back to Getty Images which credited the shot to photographer Anoop Negi. The caption of the image stated that the content in unverified. However, it is certain the image is at least eight years old as per the date of creation mentioned on Getty Images. \u201cShimla Hills are Burning \u2013 More Forest Fires.\u201d reads its title.\n\nThis image was traced back to an article on Hindustan Times which in turn credited it to news agency Press Trust of India (PTI). The article was published on May 3, 2016. \u201cA major fire in the forests at Ahirikot in Srinagar, Uttarakhand on Monday,\u201d reads the description of the image. Thus, it is more than four years old.\n\nWe were able to trace this image back to a blog post by photographer Anoop Negi. The blog post is dated June 4, 2012. \u201cMore Fires in the Himalayas \u2013 Solan Rajgarh HIlls,\u201d reads the title of the same image posted by Negi on the photo-sharing platform Flickr. According to the platform, the image was clicked on May 30, 2012.\n\nSeveral other old images are circulating on social media with the claim that they depict the recent forest fires in Uttarakhand. Chief conservator of forests at Uttarakhand forest department Parag Madhukar Dhakate said, \u201cUttarakhand Forest Department is using satellite information to douse the fire wherever reported. No massive and serious incident has been reported yet.\u201d\n\nWhile comparing last year\u2019s forest fires in Uttarakhand with recent incidents, the state\u2019s principal chief conservator of forest, Jai Raj, said, \u201cLast year many forest fire incidents took place. Hence last year till this time, around 1600 hectares [of land] was burnt. In comparison to that, now it\u2019s 81 hectares. According to this [data], the situation is in much better control.\u201d\n\nHe further added, \u201cThe important thing to understand is that here the forest fire moves on the ground. They move on the surface. Some grass burns, some bushes burn, that is the kind of damage. Here, fire incidents where full trees get burnt, which we call a crown fire, such incident are close to none. Such forest fires take place in the United States, Canada and Australia.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Dhakate tweeted a map of the state showing active forest fire points as of May 26, 2020, at 4:30 PM.\n\nWhile we are unable to trace back the origin of four images in the collage, it is certain that three of the images were old and unrelated to the recent forest fires in Uttarakhand.", "lang": "en"}
