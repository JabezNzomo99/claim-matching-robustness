California is not registering noncitizens to vote, save for one city allowing certain illegal immigrants to vote only in school board elections.\n\nThe Sept. 10 photo was shared more than 22,000 times on Facebook, and the original tweet was retweeted nearly 17,000 times.\n\nSome websites posted a story this summer with the misleading headline that San Francisco was giving \u201cillegal aliens the right to vote in elections\u201d \u2014 when in fact the measure only affords certain noncitizens the right to vote in school board elections, as we wrote in July.\n\nThe measure, which voters approved in 2016, gives all immigrants living in the city who are of legal voting age and who are parents, guardians or caregivers of a child under the age of 19 permission to vote in school board elections. The local policy doesn\u2019t permit noncitizens to vote in any other elections, including federal contests \u2014 which is the subject of the Facebook photo.\n\nEarlier this year, we debunked a similar false assertion about California\u2019s New Motor Voter Program. That program is an effort to increase voter turnout by automatically registering people to vote when they renew or obtain a new license, unless they opt out.\n\nCritics claimed California would therefore register illegal immigrants to vote because the state also has a measure in place that allows noncitizens to obtain special driver\u2019s licenses.\n\nBut California officials maintain that only eligible voters would be automatically registered. A spokeswoman for the state\u2019s DMV told us in March that \u201cundocumented Californians are not eligible to register to vote and [the] DMV has programming measures to prevent that from occurring.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne example is the technician is unable to enter information that would allow the undocumented customer to register. It is automatically greyed out and cannot be bypassed,\u201d Jessica Gonzalez told us in an email.\n\nWe could also find no record of the \u201cFederal Election Integrity Program\u201d mentioned in the text of the image. That is likely a reference to the short-lived Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity.\n\nThe federal commission, created in 2017 to examine \u201cfraudulent voting\u201d and other issues, faced opposition in obtaining voter data from California and other states, some citing concerns over voters\u2019 privacy. The panel was dissolved in January, about eight months after it was created.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nUpdate, Aug. 28, 2019: In late 2018, the California Secretary of State\u2019s office said roughly 1,500 people \u2014 including noncitizens \u2014 were erroneously registered to vote through the state\u2019s motor-voter program. The office has said those registrations have since been cancelled, but this month it announced that six people who were erroneously registered \u201cdue to DMV errors\u201d actually voted in the 2018 elections. Paula Valle, a spokeswoman for the office, told us none of the individuals wrongly registered were licensees under the AB-60 program, which allows immigrants in the country illegally to obtain a license.\n\n\u201cExecutive Order on the Termination of Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity.\u201d WhiteHouse.gov. 3 Jan 2018.\n\nHale Spencer, Saranac. \u201cNoncitizens Get Narrow Access to Polls in San Francisco.\u201d FactCheck.org. 26 Jul 2018.\n\n\u201cResponses to the \u2018Voter Fraud\u2019 Commission\u2019s Voter File Data Request.\u201d Brennan Center for Justice. 5 Oct 2017.\n\n\u201cSecretary of State Alex Padilla Responds to Presidential Election Commission Request for Personal Data of California Voters.\u201d Press release, California Secretary of State\u2019s Office. 29 Jun 2017.", "lang": "en"}
