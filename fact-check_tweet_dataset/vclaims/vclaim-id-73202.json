The photo is doctored; a mirror effect has been used to make it appear as though the animal has two heads.\n\nThe doctored image can be seen here on Facebook, where it has been shared more than 29,000 times since it was posted on December 1, 2018.\n\nThe Urdu language caption says: \u201cGlory your nature\u201d.\n\nComments below the post indicated that some Facebook users believed the image showed an actual cow.\n\nFor example, one posted in Russian: \u201cI would say-trouble not glory, deviation from the norm, violated ecology, the earth is poisoned by chemicals. In the Ark of Noah, the animals were considered by the heads. 1 Head (1 Animal)\u201d.\n\nAnother posted in Arabic: \u201cHallelujah. He's capable of everything.\u201d\n\nAnother asked in French which country the image was from.\n\nBelow are screenshots of some of those comments:\n\nThe misleading image was created using editing software to create a mirror effect, a technique that is explained in this blog post on a photography website.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the doctored image. AFP has circled the some of sections of the image which are identical on both sides of the picture, clearly showing that a mirror effect was used to create it:", "lang": "en"}
