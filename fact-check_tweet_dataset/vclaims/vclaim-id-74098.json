Then we studied the recent guideline for easing the lockdown by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and that of Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).\n\nFollowing the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the World Health Organisation recommended the use of face masks.\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC) also recommended wearing face masks in public.\n\nAccording to the NCDC, the primary aim of this measure is to prevent infected persons and asymptomatic carriers of the virus from spreading the disease. The centre explained that this measure adds another layer to extant measures such as physical distancing, hand washing as well as respiratory hygiene.\n\nWith the continuous rise in the number of cases globally, some countries have made the use of face masks in public compulsory, but not all countries have attached sanctions like fine and imprisonment to violations.\n\nAlthough the wearing of face masks in public in Nigeria was announced as compulsory by the Presidential Task Force [PTF] on COVID-19, no stated sanction was announced. But there were indications in April that hints that the PTF might move in that direction muted when the Task Force claimed it was working on a policy for the mandatory use of face masks. So far nothing to that effect has been released.\n\nBelow is a recent guideline by the PTF for the second phase of easing the COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nThe claim that there is a fine of N20,000 or six-month imprisonment for not wearing a face mask is false.\n\nWhile the Nigerian Government had made wearing of face masks compulsory, there was no stated sanction such as a fine or imprisonment for defaulters. The only thing mentioned in the PTF guideline is the \u201cno mask, no entry\u201d and \u201cno mask, no service\u201d policy.", "lang": "en"}
