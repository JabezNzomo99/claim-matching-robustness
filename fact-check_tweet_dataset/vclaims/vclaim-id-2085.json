There, Trump shared details about an Islamic State threat involving laptops on airplanes, according to media reports.\n\nThis information is so sensitive, according to media reports, that the United States hasn\u2019t shared it with its allies, much less an adversary like Russia. Trump\u2019s disclosures could jeopardize the United States\u2019 relations with the unidentified Middle Eastern country that procured the intelligence, and it could also put critical intelligence sources in danger. (The New York Times says Israel is the information source.)\n\nWhile this was a private meeting between Trump and the two Russian diplomats, closed to the American press, a Russian state news photographer was present.\n\nThe Washington Post broke the story May 15, and BuzzFeed and the New York Times soon followed suit. We should note that these reporters based their stories on anonymous sources, which we don\u2019t use at PolitiFact, so we are unable to independently confirm them.\n\nHow has the White House responded?\n\nThe White House\u2019s response has shifted since the story broke Monday afternoon, though officials speaking on the record have consistently tried to discredit the reporting.\n\nThe administration initially denied that sources, methods or military operations, were disclosed to the Russian delegation. Later, the administration acknowledged that specific threats were discussed. Speaking to reporters that afternoon, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster called the Washington Post story \"false.\"\n\nThe White House also said that firsthand accounts of those present in the meeting should outweigh those of the anonymous sources on whom the reporters based their stories.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that McMaster and other White House officials haven\u2019t denied that Trump shared classified information with the diplomats, the gravamen of the Washington Post report.\n\nMcMaster, in a press briefing May 16, again sidestepped questions about what Trump disclosed and whether it was classified. He described the disclosure as \"wholly appropriate.\"\n\nWashington Post reporter Greg Miller, who co-wrote the story, told CNN that the White House is \"playing word games.\"\n\nYou can read more about that here.\n\nDoes Trump, as president, have the authority to reveal classified information?\n\nIt\u2019s illegal to improperly disseminate classified information, but presidents are exempt from those laws.\n\nSteven Aftergood, director of the Federation of American Scientists Project on Government Secrecy, told us that that's because the president has the authority to declassify any information, and the idea that a president would be prosecuted for this is \"unthinkable\":\n\n\"The president is not explicitly excluded from the relevant statutes concerning disclosure of classified information, but as a practical matter he is exempt from them. There are at least two reasons that is so.\n\n\"First, the president controls the national security classification system and has full authority to declassify information at will. Second, enforcement of existing statutes would require the attorney general to indict and prosecute the president, which is all but unthinkable.\n\n\"Instead, reckless disclosures by the president of classified information that damaged the national security, if they occurred, might be grounds for impeachment.\"\n\nTrump appeared to use this reasoning while defending himself on Twitter on May 16, the morning after this story broke.\n\n\"As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety. Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism,\" Trump wrote in two tweets.\n\nMcMaster, at the May 16 press briefing, said Trump decided to share information with the Russians as the sides were meeting. He said Trump was not aware of the source of the information.\n\nHow does this tie into the Russia-Trump storyline?\n\nThere\u2019s no obvious connection between this incident and the ongoing investigations, which are focused on Trump associates\u2019 Russia connections in the context of the election.\n\nBut it certainly adds to the mounting pile of Russia-related controversies dogging the Trump administration. And it provides fodder for Trump\u2019s critics who say he is too friendly with Russia.\n\nKislyak, the Russian ambassador present at the May 10 Oval Office meeting, has been at the center of several episodes in the Trump-Russia saga. Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was ousted after lying about the nature of his conversations with Kislyak, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions has faced criticism for failing to disclose meetings he had with the ambassador in 2016.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what motivated Trump to share this information with the Russians. The Washington Post said Trump went off-script and was \"boasting about his inside knowledge of the looming threat.\"\n\nIt\u2019s important, however, to consider the possibility that Trump made a strategic national security decision to reveal this information to the Russian diplomats, as several national security experts at the blog Lawfare noted.\n\nHow do Trump\u2019s actions compare to what he has said in the past about classified information?\n\nTrump excoriated Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail for the private email server she used as secretary of state \u2014 saying her mishandling of classified information disqualified her from the presidency. Pundits have said that Trump\u2019s criticism of Clinton now rings hollow.\n\n\"This is not just extreme carelessness with classified material, which is still totally disqualifying,\" Trump said at July 2016 campaign rally. \"This is calculated, deliberate, premeditated misconduct.\"\n\n\"Clinton\u2019s home email server that she lied to the American people about was a profound national security risk ... Hillary Clinton has bad judgment and is unfit to serve as President,\" he wrote on Facebook in August.\n\nTrump has also lamented the many \"illegal\" leaks to the media coming out of his administration, particularly those containing classified information about investigations into Trump\u2019s Russia connections.\n\n\"The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by \u2018intelligence\u2019 like candy. Very un-American!\" he tweeted in February.\n\nYou can read more about that here.\n\nHow does this compare to Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server controversy?\n\nThe Trump and Clinton situations are vastly different, though both involve possible mishandling of classified information.\n\nOf the more than 45,000 emails on Clinton\u2019s email server \u2014 which wasn\u2019t equipped to handle classified information \u2014 FBI agents found 81 classified email chains. Eight of them were the highest level of classification, top secret; 37 were secret; and 36 were confidential, the lowest level of classification.\n\nWe do not know how sensitive the classified information was, though Comey said Clinton and others on her team \"should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.\" However, Comey also said there wasn\u2019t significant evidence that Clinton intentionally mishandled classified information or was disloyal to the United States.\n\nIn contrast, the news reports give the impression that Trump intentionally shared extremely sensitive information with an adversary, an action that some say could seriously damage U.S. interests.", "lang": "en"}
