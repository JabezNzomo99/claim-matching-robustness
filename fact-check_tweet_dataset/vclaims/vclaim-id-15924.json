And, as we\u2019ve noted before, most sitting presidents since Jimmy Carter have released their tax returns \u2014 even though presidents are automatically subject to an annual IRS audit.\n\nTrump has continued to resist calls to make his returns public. Last week, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee issued subpoenas to the heads of the Treasury Department and IRS to release Trump\u2019s returns for tax years 2013 through 2018. State lawmakers in New York also have advanced a bill that, if enacted, would allow for the release of Trump\u2019s state tax returns to certain congressional committees.\n\nDemocrats vying to become their party\u2019s nominee in the 2020 presidential election have also started to release their tax returns. A number of candidates \u2014 including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Tim Ryan, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Jay Inslee \u2014 have released tax returns. Former Vice President Joe Biden also previously released several years\u2019 worth of his tax returns; the Tax History Project has logged his tax returns from 1998 to 2015.\n\nThe viral meme is reminiscent of another misleading graphic that was spread on websites and in emails during the 2012 election. It claimed that Obama\u2019s school records and Selective Service registration were \u201csealed.\u201d We debunked many of the claims in that meme at the time, noting that Obama\u2019s Selective Service registration was indeed made public and that the Selective Service confirmed he registered on Sept. 4, 1980.\n\nObama\u2019s college records also weren\u2019t \u201csealed.\u201d It\u2019s true that he didn\u2019t release them, but that was consistent with other presidential candidates. Trump also has not released his college records.\n\nTrump\u2019s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, testified to Congress in February that he wrote \u201cletters \u2026 at Mr. Trump\u2019s direction that threatened his high school, colleges, and the College Board not to release his grades or SAT scores.\u201d\n\nA copy of Cohen\u2019s May 2015 letter to Fordham University\u2019s president said that releasing Trump\u2019s records without his consent could \u201clead to jail time,\u201d and requested confirmation that \u201cthe records have been permanently sealed.\u201d Trump attended Fordham before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania, where he finished his undergraduate degree at the Wharton School.\n\nA Fordham spokesman also confirmed that the university received a call from the Trump campaign about the issue and then a follow-up letter from an attorney for Trump.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
