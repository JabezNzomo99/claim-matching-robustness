According to AIS, Conway allegedly described a phone call that Trump had with Lithuanian President Dalya Grybauskaite during which she supposedly brought in her fellow Baltic leaders, Latvian President Raimonds Vejonis and Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid unexpectedly.\n\nConway was quoted as commenting that the impromptu phone call was an example of \"outrageous cases of ignorance in diplomacy, and also etiquette on the part of some states of little significance.\"\n\nAccording to AIS, Conway allegedly portrayed the Baltic leaders as interrupting each other to tell Trump about Russian aggression, which led to him telling them to \"shut up.\"\n\nNone of this story is true.\n\nPolygraph asked the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry if such a phone call had taken place, as no official statement had been made about it. Zivile Didzgalviene of the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry's Press Service told Polygraph, \"There was no such phone conversation.\"\n\nKellyanne Conway has given a number of interviews recently to CNN, and even one posted November 28, but it was with Tom LoBianco, not Christiane Amanpour, and concerned the prospect of Governor Mitt Romney's appointment as Secretary of State. There was no mention at all of the Baltics.\n\nPolygraph also contacted Christiane Amanpour of CNN. \"Thanks for checking. And yes this story is FAKE,\" Amanpour emphasized, adding, \"I have not interviewed Conway.\"", "lang": "en"}
