I want LAW & ORDER!\"\n\nThe \"defund\" movement calls on local governments to shift spending on law enforcement to programs that address economic and social issues for minorities. In Minneapolis, a veto-proof majority of city council members pledged to replace the city\u2019s police department with a community-based public safety model following protests over the death of George Floyd in police custody.\n\nBut Biden told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Norah O\u2019Donnell that he does not intend to defund the police in a clip the program aired on June 8.\n\n\"No, I don\u2019t support defunding the police,\" Biden said. \"I support conditioning federal aid to police based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness and, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community and everybody in the community.\"\n\nEarlier that day, Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates addressed Trump\u2019s claims by saying that Biden \"does not believe that police should be defunded.\"\n\nIn the statement, Bates said Biden supports \"the urgent need for reform\" and wants to spend more money on community policing programs, officer training, diversified police departments and body-worn cameras.\n\nSimilar policies are outlined under \"Joe\u2019s vision\" on Biden\u2019s campaign website, but there\u2019s no mention of defunding the police or anything that could reasonably be construed as such.\n\nBiden would invest $300 million for the federal Community Oriented Policing Services Program, his campaign website says. His plans also include expanding the Justice Department\u2019s authority to investigate unconstitutional policing, excessive force and systemic police misconduct.\n\nRELATED FACT-CHECK: Fact-checking Kamala Harris\u2019 claim about Donald Trump and investigations of police misconduct\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. In a June 8 statement, Trump spokesman Tim Murtaugh argued that because Biden himself had not addressed the \"defund the police\" idea, Americans had \"no way of knowing where he really stands.\"\n\nBut neither did Trump, who said Biden shared that position.\n\nIn a June 6 op-ed in the Los Angeles Times, Biden vowed to establish a national police oversight commission during his first 100 days in office. He called on Congress to \"outlaw chokeholds, stop the transfer of weapons of war to local police forces, improve oversight and accountability, and create a model use-of-force standard.\"\n\n\"We need to implement real community policing and ensure that every police department in the country undertakes a comprehensive review of their hiring, their training, and their de-escalation practices,\" Biden wrote.\n\nTrump said Biden wants to \"defund the police.\"\n\nBiden did not have this position when Trump made this claim, and his campaign\u2019s website does not list defunding the police as part of \"Joe\u2019s vision.\" Biden and his campaign have since said Biden does not support defunding police but does support reform.", "lang": "en"}
