They are the biggest threats to America.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeplorable and Damn proud of it,\u201d the caption reads. \u201cGod Bless the USA.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller found no record of Clinton ever making the statement. It seems to have originated on a satirical Facebook page.\n\nClinton has become a popular target for fake quotes online. In this case, the meme credits her with coining a negative statement about supporters of President Donald Trump, suggesting that she said it May 16 at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\u201cWe must guard the future from the idiocy and ignorance of the Trump deplorables,\u201d the Facebook post quotes Clinton as saying. \u201cThey are the biggest threats to America.\u201d (RELATED: Did Hillary Clinton Once Say That \u2018Democratic Voters Are Just Plan Stupid?\u2019)\n\nYet, while she did refer to some Trump supporters as a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d during a 2016 fundraiser, there are no credible sources linking Clinton to the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post. Searching the Berkeley News and Berkeley Events websites turned up no evidence that Clinton gave a speech at the university in May of this year or any other.\n\nThe quote, debunked by Snopes in 2018, appears to have originated with America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, a Facebook page known for creating and spreading satirical content. The page clearly disclaims that it is satirical in nature, noting, \u201cNothing on this page is real.\u201d\n\nNot only does the meme, posted Nov. 20, fail to make the same disclosure, it also deceptively portrays the quote as real.", "lang": "en"}
