BOOM found the claims to be false.\n\nRahul Gandhi had on May 16, 2020 met with a group of migrant workers who were walking from Harayana to their homes in Jhansi (Uttar Pradesh). After interacting with them for nearly an hour, Gandhi had arranged for vehicles to drop the migrants to their homes. Read more about it here.\n\nHowever, a set of two images from the meeting are being used to create a fake narrative around the incident.\n\nOne of the images in the post shows Gandhi listening to a migrant worker while a woman beside him looks on keenly. The second image shows the same woman sitting in a car. A Hindi caption with the post claims 'another scandal by Congress. Even the migrants who met 'Pappu' turned out to be actors. How much more will you fall, sycophants'.\n\nThe post can be viewed below and its archived version can be accessed here.\n\nThe same set of images have been shared from multiple Twitter handles and Facebook pages with similar claims.\n\nAlso read 2019 Pic Peddled As Buses Organised By Priyanka Gandhi Vadra For Migrants\n\n\n\nBOOM looked up Congress party's Twitter handle for the images. We found the same woman among other migrant workers in one of the images shared on May 16 from Congress' official Twitter handle.\n\nWe also found another set of four pictures tweeted by Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee chief Ajay Kumar Lallu.\n\nLallu, in his tweet, says 'Rahul Gandhi met migrant labourers walking from Delhi's Ashram area towards MP and UP. He shared their pains. All of them have been sent home'.\n\nIn three of the pictures tweeted by Lallu, one can see the same woman whose photo has been shared in the viral post. In one of the pictures she can be seen sitting in a car along with another migrant worker.\n\nThe incident had also been covered by several newspapers. As per media reports, Rahul Gandhi had met a group of migrant workers returning on foot from Harayana to UP and MP. After interacting with them for a while, Gandhi had asked members of the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee to arrange vehicles to drop the migrants home.\n\nWire agency ANI had also tweeted a set of four pictures of migrants sitting in cars waiting to be taken to their homes. The woman in the viral post can also be seen in the second picture tweeted by ANI.\n\nAlso read No, 'Pakistan Zindabad' Was Not Chanted In Mumbai\n\nSeveral video reports about the incident show the same woman getting inside a car arranged by Congress workers.
