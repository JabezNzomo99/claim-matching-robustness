No, that's not true: the colored squares or rectangles on toothpaste tubes are just a marking that is used by the machines used to fill toothpaste tubes, it has no relation to the composition or ingredients of the toothpaste.\n\nAn example of the \"secret code\" can be seen in from this video (archived here) where it was published by Jersey Demic on July 24, 2016 under the title \"Secret behind Toothpaste\". It claimed these colors corresponded with these ingredients:\n\nThere are other versions of the hoax making the rounds with codes in a different order:\n\nIt is never made exactly clear what \"natural\" and \"chemical\" mean in this context, and what kind of \"medicine\" is meant exactly.
