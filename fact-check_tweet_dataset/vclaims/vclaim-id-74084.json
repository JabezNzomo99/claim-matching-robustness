There was no such job posting.\n\nThe social media handles of WHO also didn\u2019t have any such job posting.\n\nWe further checked by clicking on the link which was mentioned as the application process.\n\nThe application process prompted to enter name and surname. It further displayed the message: \u201cShare this news with your friends so they can also get this job offer. You need to share with at least 14 WhatsApp friends or groups to get this job offer.\u201d\n\nWe checked the details of the website using Whois tool. We found that the website was created on February 19, 2019.\n\nWe contacted WHO and the spokesperson of organization stated: \u201cThis is a spam. WHO has not made any such advertisement.\u201d\n\nOn the Facebook page of WHO Uganda we found a message in which WHO has warned that the viral message is fake.\n\nWHO has also warned people on its official website to beware of criminals pretending to represent the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nVishvas News scanned the profile of the page which posted the fake message. We found that the page has 522 followers.\n\nConclusion: Fake job advert is viral in the name of World Health Organization.
