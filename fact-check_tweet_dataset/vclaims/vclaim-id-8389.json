We gave One Pinocchio to Trump in April 2017 when he said immigration was \u201c61 percent down now in terms of illegal people coming in,\u201d and we gave Two Pinocchios to then-Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in 2015 when he said \u201capprehensions at the southern border \u2026 are now at the lowest levels in years.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s signature campaign promise was an immigration crackdown. During his first year in office, he has pushed for tighter immigration laws and a massive new wall along the border with Mexico. As a result, \u201cthe border is in the best shape it\u2019s been in in decades, down 61 percent since the inauguration,\u201d Trump said in a speech on March 21, 2017.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security says Trump\u2019s policies and rhetoric have deterred would-be immigrants from trying to cross the border. Then-DHS spokesman David Lapan said in May that people in Central America \u201care waiting and watching what happens rather than taking the journey north,\u201d and then-Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly in March pointed to a \u201cdramatic drop in numbers\u201d since Trump\u2019s inauguration. Kelly is now the White House chief of staff.\n\nAccording to figures from Customs and Border Protection covering Trump\u2019s first 11 months in office, apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border are down 48 percent from the comparable 11-month period in 2016. Trump is on track to end his first year in office with fewer than 300,000 apprehensions at the southern border, a low not seen since fiscal year 1971.\n\nBut Trump takes perhaps too much credit for this decrease. Apprehensions at the southern border declined overall during both previous administrations and have been on a downward trend for the better part of two decades. The federal government has been investing in border upgrades for nearly 30 years, hardened border controls after 9/11 and imposed tough new penalties for some unauthorized migrants in 2005. Research suggests the 2007 economic downturn dissuaded people who otherwise would have tried to immigrate illegally.\n\nLastly, focusing on the apprehension figure Trump cites presents a sort of Catch-22. If the number of apprehensions goes down, does it mean that immigrants are staying away or that authorities are not catching them? One study points out that it would be logical to assume that tougher policies would lead to a higher number of apprehensions.", "lang": "en"}
