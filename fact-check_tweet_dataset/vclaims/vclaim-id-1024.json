I can\u2019t breathe!\u201d Some versions are partly muted, and include a repetition of this clip a few times over. Some posts state Trump is mocking George Floyd given Floyd was heard saying \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d in the moments leading up to his death under police arrest. The video actually shows Trump mocking former New York City Mayor and former Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg months prior to Floyd\u2019s death.\n\nExamples of the post can be seen here , here and here .\n\nThe clip comes from a Trump rally in Colorado Springs on February 20, 2020, where he mocked the debate performances of Democratic presidential hopefuls (here) .\n\nIn video of the rally, Trump can be heard accusing candidates Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bloomberg of choking. At one point he says: \u201cBloomberg made a fool out of himself last night, he choked. He\u2019s another one who\u2019s going, \u2018Ah, I can\u2019t breathe, I can\u2019t breathe! Don\u2019t ask me the question, please!\u2019\u201d (See here and 17:00 www.c-span.org/video/?469438-1)\n\nIt is unclear if President Trump considered the recognizability of the phrase \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and its strong association with racial justice movements since the case of Eric Garner, a black man who died after being placed in a chokehold by a white police officer in 2014 (here , here) .\n\nThe slogan has been heard again at protests across the U.S. over the death of Floyd, another black man who died in Minneapolis on May 25 after being pinned by the neck under a white police officer\u2019s knee (here).\n\nThe Democratic debate that took place in Las Vegas, Nevada on February 19 can be viewed here . A recap of the debate by NPR can be viewed here .\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Trump used the words \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d to ridicule a political rival. In 2016 during a Rome, New York rally he said: \u201cThe last election should have been won except [Mitt] Romney choked like a dog, he choked. He went [makes choking gesture], \u2018I can\u2019t breathe!\u2019\u201d (here).\n\nFalse. Trump used the words \u2018I can\u2019t breathe\u2019 to mock political rivals Mike Bloomberg in 2020 and Mitt Romney in 2016.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
