The population from the last census to the previous one increased by almost 20 per cent,\" he said.\n\n\n\nMr Howarth also claimed during the interview that there had been a decrease in the number of rough sleepers.\n\n\n\nHe said the number of people \"living in impoverished dwellings or people living on the street\" had fallen from 8,946 to 8,200 over a 15-year period to 2016.\n\nSo, how do we make sense of all these figures and claims? RMIT ABC Fact Check's recently published homelessness interactive provides the basis for a thorough analysis.\n\n\n\nOf his three claims, Fact Check found one to be correct, one to be incorrect, and one to be a case of cherrypicking.\n\nMr Howarth is correct in saying people experiencing homelessness make up only 0.5 per cent of the Australian population.\n\nThe figure translates to 1 in 200 people being homeless.\n\nMr Howarth's claim that the rate of increase in homelessness lagged population growth is incorrect.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2016, the Australian population grew by 8.8 per cent (not 20 per cent, as claimed by Mr Howarth), while the homeless population grew by 14 per cent.\n\nMr Howarth's claim that the number of people \"living in impoverished dwellings or people living on the street\" has fallen from 8,946 to 8,200 is cherrypicking.\n\nHis decision to cite figures for rough sleepers over 15 years, ignores a sharp rebound in rough sleeping numbers in the most recent five years to 2016.\n\nThe full rationale for Fact Check's decisions follows below.\n\nHomelessness is defined as a loss of a sense of security, stability, privacy or safety, or the ability to control your living space.\n\n\n\nThe ABS's Census of Population and Housing, last conducted in August 2016, provides the most comprehensive picture of homelessness in Australia.\n\n\n\nThe census categorises homelessness according to five living situations: rough sleeping, supported accommodation for the homeless, temporary accommodation with other households, boarding houses, other temporary lodgings, and severely overcrowded accommodation.\n\n\n\nWithout a Home is Fact Check's analysis of the state of homelessness in Australia.\n\n\n\nCompiled using homelessness data from the 2016 census, as well as Specialist Homeless Services (SHS) data collected by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Without a Home presents the facts on homelessness, pointing out key changes over time with a focus on the groups most affected.\n\n\n\nFact Check worked in conjunction with experts from RMIT University's Social and Global Studies to ensure the interactive represented the data accurately.\n\n\n\nFact Check has drawn on Without a Home to analyse Mr Howarth's claims.\n\n\n\nDoes homelessness only affect 0.5% of the population?\n\nAccording to the census, which put the total population at 23.4 million, 116,400 people were homeless in 2016.\n\n\n\nThat means Mr Howarth's claim that \"about half a per cent of the population don't have a permanent roof over their head\" is correct.\n\nIn other words, one in 200 Australians are experiencing homelessness\n\nAccording to the data, those in severely overcrowded dwellings made up the largest proportion of people without a home, at 44 per cent.\n\n\n\nOf the remainder, the proportion of people living in supported accommodation was 18 per cent, temporary accommodation with other households (15 per cent), boarding houses (15 per cent), rough sleeping (7 per cent) and other temporary lodgings (1 per cent).\n\n\n\nAlmost a third (32 per cent) of Australia's homeless population lived in NSW.\n\n\n\nOther states and territories accounted for 21 per cent (Victoria), 19 per cent (Queensland), 12 per cent (the Northern Territory), 8 per cent (Western Australia), 5 per cent (South Australia) and 1 per cent (both the ACT and Tasmania).\n\n\n\nDoes the increase in people experiencing homelessness simply reflect population growth?\n\nThe latest figures show an increase of 14 per cent in the number of homeless people since the previous census in 2011.\n\n\n\nBut the increase cannot be pinned on population growth alone.\n\n\n\nOver the same period, the population increased by 8.8 per cent \u2014 not 20 per cent, as claimed by Mr Howarth \u2014 from 21.5 million people in 2011 to 23.4 million in 2016.\n\n\n\nThe homelessness rate \u2014 that is, the number of people experiencing homelessness per 10,000 Australians \u2014 has also risen over the same period.\n\n\n\nIn 2011, 47.6 people per 10,000 Australians were experiencing homelessness. This rose to 49.8 in 2016, representing an increase in the homelessness rate of 4.6 per cent.\n\n\n\nSo, Mr Howarth's claim that the growth in homelessness is \"not ahead of population growth\" is incorrect.\n\nAccording to census data, there were 8,946 rough sleepers in Australia in 2001 \u2014 that is, people living in impoverished dwellings or tents, or who were sleeping out.\n\n\n\nBy 2016, that number had declined to 8,200. This is the 15-year period to which Mr Howarth referred.\n\nHowever, the figures disguise a sharp rebound in the number of rough sleepers over the most recent five-year period.\n\n\n\nThe 2011 census put the number of rough sleepers at 6,810 (a rate of 3.2 people per 10,000 of population).\n\n\n\nBy 2016, the figure had risen by 20 per cent to 8,200 (a rate of 3.5 per 10,000).", "lang": "en"}
