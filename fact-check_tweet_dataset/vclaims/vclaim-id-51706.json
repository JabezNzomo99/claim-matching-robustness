Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism spokesperson, Romeo Muyunda, said apart from the belief that the dung treats coronavirus, people also use elephant dung as traditional medicine and that this has resulted in a high demand.\u201d\n\nAnother online report, from 17 August 2020, deals with the same media statement by the environment ministry, but does not refer to COVID-19, merely referring to \u201cdifferent ailments\u201d:\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism has cautioned the public to refrain from collecting elephant dung from national parks as it is a punishable offence, with would-be offenders liable to a fine of N$1 200. This was shared by the ministry\u2019s spokesperson Romeo Muyunda in the wake of increased usage of elephant dung as a remedy for different ailments.\u201d\n\nThe article indicates that such claims were encountered on \u201csocial media\u201d.\n\nTo avoid misunderstanding, there is no medical or scientific evidence that inhaling or ingesting elephant dung prevents or cures COVID-19 infection.", "lang": "en"}
