But U.S. aid to Israel is much higher.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2019-05-08T07:00:58.749Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-24147", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/08/have-palestinians-received-more-aid-than-any-group-history/?utm_term=.1c18370b9f7e", "vclaim": "The Trump administration has been unbashfully pro-Israel in its approach to the long-running conflict, recognizing, for instance, Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, a diplomatic step that previous presidents had held in reserve as part of final status talks. The administration has also cut off aid to the Palestinians, including to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian territories Refugees (UNRWA). In response, Palestinian officials have all but ended talks with the administration.\n\nBut notice that Kushner framed it publicly as \u201cmore aid than any group of people in history\u201d and then narrows it down to just development and humanitarian aid in the past quarter-century when directly queried. That\u2019s because when it comes to all aid, Israel has received more aid than the Palestinians, even on a per-capita basis, according to U.S. government data.\n\nThe World Bank has a similar figure, derived from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) data for \u201cofficial development assistance,\u201d but the World Bank offers yearly figures going back to 1993. The World Bank shows that the per-capita number for the Palestinians fluctuates from a low of $79 per capita in 1993 to a high of $764 in 2009. It averages out to $398 over nearly a quarter-century.\n\nKushner also appears to be adding in contributions to UNRWA, which provides services to 5 million people who are refugees from the 1948 conflict or their descendants. Some, if not all, UNRWA funding appears to be counted already in the OECD calculations for the West Bank and Gaza. Since the White House refused to explain his math, we have to stick with the World Bank and USAID estimates.\n\nFurther complicating matters, these per-capita figures for the Palestinians may be too high because of possible double-counting. The OECD data set does not clarify whether the member states\u2019 contributions include only bilateral aid to the West Bank and Gaza, or if they also include member states\u2019 contributions to European Union institutions that are designated for aid to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsrael used to receive a lot of economic aid from the United States until Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut a deal in 2007 to convert it all to military aid. Using non-inflation-adjusted dollars, the Israelis received $34.2 billion in economic aid from the United States between 1946 and 2007, according to calculations by the Congressional Research Service. (Note: an earlier version of this article incorrectly described the CRS calculations as constant dollars.) A CRS spokesman said that in constant (inflation-adjusted) 2017 dollars, the figure would be $68.9 billion.\n\nThe Palestinians, meanwhile, have received about $37.2 billion in development aid (in constant dollars) between 1994 and 2017, according to the OECD. The U.S. share of that was about $8.2 billion, according to the OECD. (The State Department, under a broader definition of aid, records U.S. assistance to the West Bank and Gaza as totaling $9.1 billion since 1988.) Some Arab donations are included but the OECD database does not reflect, for instance, Qatar\u2019s contributions to Gaza, which totaled $1.1 billion between 2012 and 2018 with the approval of the Israeli government.\n\nTo be conservative, we will round up the total Palestinian aid to $40 billion. In other words, the Palestinians received less from the international community than what Israel received from the United States in terms of economic aid. (Some Palestinian experts also argue that much of the U.S. developmental aid for the West Bank and Gaza was focused on enhancing security for Israel rather than bolstering the economy of Palestinian areas.)\n\nIsrael has received nearly $95 billion in military aid and an additional $6 billion for missile defense from the United States, bringing its total aid (in non-inflation adjusted dollars) to nearly $135 billion, according to the CRS calculations. (These figures do not include loan guarantees, which have been extended at times to help Israel absorb economic shocks. Israel currently has nearly $4 billion it can borrow.)\n\nThe State Department\u2019s foreign aid database shows that U.S. aid to Israel totaled $228 billion in constant 2017 dollars between 1951 and 2017. U.S. assistance to Israel was especially significant in some years, topping $10 billion in 1974 and $13 billion in 1979. These figures were so unexpectedly high that we confirmed them with the State Department to make sure the calculations were correct.\n\nPut another way, Israel has been getting an average of $3.5 billion a year for 66 years \u2014 just from the United States \u2014 while the Palestinians have received about $1.7 billion a year from international donors. Even if the Palestinian figure is undercounted somewhat \u2014 such as some UNWRA funding not recorded in these statistics \u2014 there\u2019s little chance it can match the aid figure for Israel.\n\nIn his remarks, Kushner presented an unbalanced view of history. The Palestinians have certainly been the beneficiary of international largesse for many years. But to claim they have received more aid than any group in history ignores the fact that Israel has received far more, year after year, just from the United States.", "lang": "en"}
