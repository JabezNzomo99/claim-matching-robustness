Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar.\n\nBut it will not show that they co-sponsored a \u201cbill to recognize Muslim holidays as federal holidays.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s another falsehood about the two freshmen Democrats who this month became the first Muslim women in the U.S. Congress.\n\nA story spreading the erroneous claim about the holiday legislation was published Jan. 12 on sorightithurts.com, a website whose \u201cAbout Us\u201d page states that \u201cthis is parody and nothing but bullshit.\u201d\n\nThe story itself includes no such disclaimer, and its text correctly refers to two actual Muslim holidays. It was also republished on a self-described conservative website with no indication that the story was intended as satire.\n\nComments on social media show that many readers weren\u2019t aware the story wasn\u2019t real. A popular group on Facebook called \u201cFemales for Trump,\u201d posted the story with the caption: \u201cThis should be unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThousands of Facebook users reshared the link and posted anti-Muslim comments. Some repeated a false claim that a 1950s-era law prohibited Muslims from seeking office \u2014 which we\u2019ve previously debunked.\n\nA list of current federal holidays is published by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nParsons, Mary. \u201cTlaib and Omar Co-sponsor Bill to Recognize Muslim Holidays as Federal Holidays.\u201d SoRightItHurts.com. 12 Jan 2019.", "lang": "en"}
