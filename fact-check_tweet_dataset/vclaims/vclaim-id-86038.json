The article reported that David Neiland, the IG\u2019s lead investigator, \u201clater told Senate staffers that he felt pressure from his superiors in the office of Charles K. Edwards, who was then the acting inspector general, to withhold evidence \u2014 and that, in the heat of an election year, decisions were being made with political considerations in mind.\u201d\n\nThe often dense report does not paint a pretty picture of Edwards\u2019s tenure, saying \u201che failed to uphold the independence of the DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) \u2026 jeopardized the independence of the OIG \u2026 directed reports to be altered or delayed to accommodate senior DHS officials \u2026 [and] also did not recuse himself from audits and inspections that had a conflict of interest related to his wife\u2019s employment.\u201d He resigned his post before the committee could hold a hearing on its findings.\n\nIn an interview with the Subcommittee, the lead investigator of the OIG\u2019s USSS investigation stated he had been directed to delete derogatory information from the ROI. He stated that he received this direction from his supervisor but understood that the changes were being directed by Mr. Edwards. He also told the Subcommittee that he understood that these changes were being directed because the information was potentially damaging to the Administration. The agent also stated \u201cAlthough I followed direction to remove certain information from the ROI, I made sure to include whatever was removed as a memorandum in the appendix.\u201d\n\nNow, with a section highlighted in bold, you can see what the White House did here. It took an assertion made by Edwards \u2014 \u201cthe changes that were directed were part of the ordinary process of editing the report\u201d \u2014 and says that this was an actual finding of the report. But the panel itself did not reach such a specific conclusion. In fact, while the panel could not verify allegations concerning the Secret Service report, the overall report makes it clear that the panel does not believe Edwards is a very credible witness.\n\nStill, in the case of the Secret Service allegations, Edwards was backed up by the assistant inspector general. The Senate panel also notes a separate investigation concerning an alleged threat to Nieland for having made allegations of political meddling; footnote 60 indicates there is a third supervisor interviewed as part of that probe who said Nieland was not asked to remove information for political purposes. But notes of that internal investigation also quote Nieland as saying he was not alleging a cover-up \u2014 but he later told Senate investigators that \u201cthe DHS OIG was sitting on information that could influence an election.\u201d\n\nIn at least three instances, the Subcommittee report says it was unable to reach a conclusion with respect to an allegation because of a lack of evidence. Thus one could argue that \u201ccould not substantiate\u201d is a stronger negative verdict than \u201ccould not conclude.\u201d The Secret Service allegations against Edwards also did not warrant enough attention to be referenced in the executive summary of the report.\n\nWhite House reporters are often too swamped to fully check out every assertion made by the White House\u2019s press operation, and in this case officials seized on a phrase that is in the report. The report is rather complicated, and someone reading quickly might not catch the nuance that this was not actually a finding but merely a claim made by, among others, the very person whose credibility is questioned throughout the report.", "lang": "en"}
