(A tweet from entrepreneur Elon Musk may have helped this version spread.)\n\nBut according to both the Chinese captions on the video itself and other Chinese media reports, while it\u2019s accurate that the project was completed in that time (reportedly starting at 6:30 pm on Friday January 19 2018 and finishing by 3am the next morning) and involved that many workers, it wasn\u2019t building a whole new station.\n\nIt was an upgrade to an existing station, laying a section of track to connect three current rail lines with a new high-speed line running between Longyan and Nanping. The reports say that the new line is expected to open fully by the end of 2018.\n\nThis article in Slate and this from Global Construction Review give a bit more background on how the nine hour turnaround was achieved\u2014using pre-fabricated sections of line installed simultaneously by seven groups of workers operating in parallel.", "lang": "en"}
