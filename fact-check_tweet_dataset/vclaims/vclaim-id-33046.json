The video shows jets flying in a pattern and producing smoke trails of green, white and red.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video has nothing to do with India's Independence Day celebration and it is a clip of Italy's Republic Day ceremony in Rome.\n\nThe video went viral with netizens claiming that the video is of India's Independence Day celebrations in London.\n\nThe video with the misleading claim was also shared as India's Republic Day celebrations earlier this year.\n\nUpon reverse searching one of the frames of the video, we found an article of Xinhuanet according to which the visuals are from Italy's Republic Day ceremony in its capital Rome. With the help of keywords, we found several videos of Italy's Republic Day ceremony in which similar visuals of the viral video can be seen.\n\nThe Italian national flag can also be seen in the viral video.\n\nIncidentally, the Indian and Italian flags have nearly similar colours, due to which social media users can get misled easily.\n\nThe Italian flag has vertical pales of green, white and red, whereas the Indian flag has horizontal pales of saffron, white and green. So when such air shows are performed in the sky, viewers are prone to be misled.", "lang": "en"}
