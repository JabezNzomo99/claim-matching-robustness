The following is a report of an earlier death hoax.\n\nOn 5 December 2017, the web site Action News 3 published an article claiming that actor Kirk Douglas had passed away:\n\nNews reports have confirmed that actor Kirk Douglas died of natural causes late this afternoon, Los Angeles coroners office reported. This was just 4 days before he would have turned 101 years old. Family released a statement saying he \u201cwent comfortably and was in no pain\u201d and \u201clived a long and prosperous life that people only dream of.\u201d\n\nThere is no truth to this story.\n\nAlthough Action News 3 claimed that \u201cnews reports\u201d had confirmed the actor\u2019s death, we found no mention of Kirk Douglas\u2019s alleged demise in any credible publication.\n\nThe death of Kirk Douglas, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, a Lifetime Achievement Oscar, and is frequently included in lists naming the greatest actors, would be major news if it were true. Yet, in the two days since the publication of this death hoax, no obituaries, statements, or tributes to the centenarian have been published.\n\nReports of Douglas\u2019s death originated on a disreputable web site. Action News 3 doesn\u2019t carry a disclaimer labeling its content as fake news, but the web site has a long history of peddling misinformation. In fact, they seem to have a penchant for death hoaxes and have previously pushed fake news stories which prematurely labeled Morgan Freeman, Bob Barker, and George Zimmerman dead.", "lang": "en"}
