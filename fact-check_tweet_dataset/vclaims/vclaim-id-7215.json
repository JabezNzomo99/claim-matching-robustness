As described by the British Medical Journal (BMJ), Dr. Eisenberg \u201ctransformed child psychiatry by advocating research into developmental problems\u201d:\n\nEarly in his medical career, in the mid-1950s, Leon Eisenberg became fascinated with the childhood mind. Wanting to know more, he broke free from the shackles of the Freudian psychoanalytic dogma that dominated child psychiatry at the time to conduct groundbreaking biologically based research of childhood developmental problems. This research included the first randomised clinical drug trials in child psychiatry. \u201cI think what Leon brought to the field was a different way of thinking \u2014 thinking out of the box,\u201d said David DeMaso, chairman of psychiatry at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. \u201cHe was thinking in terms of biology, of evidence based treatment, way before anybody else. His was a bio-psycho-social model at a time when psychoanalytical thinking was the norm.\u201d Eisenberg\u2019s direct involvement as a child psychiatry researcher was over by 1967, when he moved to Harvard Medical School as chief of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital. But in a dozen years he had helped transform the discipline.\n\nAlthough describing Dr. Eisenberg as the \u201cinventor\u201d or \u201cfather\u201d of attention deficit disorder (ADD) and/or attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) might be challenged by some as a bit of an exaggeration, he unquestionably contributed a great deal to the body of knowledge on which modern diagnoses and treatment of those disorders is based. Given Dr. Eisenberg\u2019s recognized authority and expertise in this field, therefore, those who feel that ADD and ADHD are misused and over-employed diagnoses which serve to \u201cexcuse bullying and recklessness\u201d and \u201coffer a sense of alleviation of personal responsibility among those diagnosed\u201d would indeed find validation if Dr. Eisenberg had proclaimed \u201cADHD is a fictitious disease\u201d:\n\nExample: [Collected via e-mail, May 2013]\n\nThe claim that Dr. Eisenberg asserted \u201cADHD is a fictitious disease\u201d is reproduced on countless web sites as something he said \u201cseven months before his death in his last interview,\u201d which would place the date of his utterance around February 2009. When documentation for the putative quote is provided, it references an article (often described as a \u201ccover story\u201d) published in the German weekly Der Spiegel on 2 February 2012.\n\nWe found that the German-language version of Der Spiegel ran an article in 2012 that skeptically examined the large increase in diagnoses of mental disorders in recent years and quoted Dr. Eisenberg on that subject. A software-based translation of that article from German to English does describe Dr. Eisenberg as the \u201cfather of ADHD\u201d and report that during his \u201clast interview\u201d he said something similar to \u201cADHD is a prime example of a fictitious disease.\u201d However, when one allows for the vagaries of translation from German to English and reads the statement in context, it\u2019s clear that Dr. Eisenberg wasn\u2019t asserting that ADHD isn\u2019t a real disorder, but rather that he thought the influence of genetic predispositions for ADHD (rather than social/environmental risk factors) were vastly overestimated:\n\nOne out of every ten 10-year-old boys already takes an ADHD drug daily. But the scientific father of ADHD has followed the explosion of prescriptions with growing horror. Leon Eisenberg took over the management of psychiatry at the prestigious Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and became one of the most famous psychiatrists in the world. In his last interview, seven months before his death from prostate cancer at the age of 87, he distanced himself from his youthful indiscretion. A tall, thin man with glasses and suspenders opened the door to his apartment in Harvard Square in 2009, invited me to the kitchen table, and poured coffee. He said that he never would have thought his discovery would someday become so popular. \u201cADHD is a prime example of a fabricated disorder,\u201d Eisenberg said. \u201cThe genetic predisposition to ADHD is completely overrated.\u201d Instead, child psychiatrists should more thoroughly determine the psychosocial reasons that can lead to behavioral problems, Eisenberg said. Are there fights with parents, are there are problems in the family? Such questions are important, but they take a lot of time, Eisenberg said, adding with a sigh: \u201cPrescribe a pill for it very quickly.\u201d\n\nOn a related note, an August 2012 Der Spiegel English-language interview with (now retired) Harvard psychologist Dr. Jerome Kagan quoted Dr. Kagan as being critical of \u201cfuzzy diagnostic practices\u201d and the over-prescription of drugs such as Ritalin for behavioral problems in children, and as referring to ADHD as \u201can invention\u201d:\n\nSPIEGEL: In the 1960s, mental disorders were virtually unknown among children. Today, official sources claim that one child in eight in the United States is mentally ill. Kagan: That\u2019s true, but it is primarily due to fuzzy diagnostic practices. Let\u2019s go back 50 years. We have a 7-year-old child who is bored in school and disrupts classes. Back then, he was called lazy. Today, he is said to suffer from ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). That\u2019s why the numbers have soared. SPIEGEL: Experts speak of 5.4 million American children who display the symptoms typical of ADHD. Are you saying that this mental disorder is just an invention? Kagan: That\u2019s correct; it is an invention. Every child who\u2019s not doing well in school is sent to see a pediatrician, and the pediatrician says: \u201cIt\u2019s ADHD; here\u2019s Ritalin.\u201d In fact, 90 percent of these 5.4 million kids don\u2019t have an abnormal dopamine metabolism. The problem is, if a drug is available to doctors, they\u2019ll make the corresponding diagnosis.", "lang": "en"}
