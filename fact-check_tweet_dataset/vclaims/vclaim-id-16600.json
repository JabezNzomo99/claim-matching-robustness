Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the statements and also how true they are.\n\nClaim: Pervez Musharraf has said \u201cBiggest strength of Pakistan is Indian Muslims, not the nuclear bombs. They are converting India into an Islamic nation by population explosion. India can repeal article 370 from Kashmir, India can build Ram Temple, India can win war against Pakistan, but India cannot prevent itself from becoming an Islamic nation\u201d. Fact: Pervez Musharraf hasn\u2019t made any such comments. No credible source was found to authenticate the claim. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen googled to check if Musharraf has made such comments, no results were found. If he had really made such statements, owing to their sensitivity, they would have been reported by the major newspapers and channels in India. So, the statements posted on Facebook has no relevance to Musharraf.\n\nHence, it can be concluded that Pervez Musharraf hasn\u2019t made any statements about India becoming a Muslim state.\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
