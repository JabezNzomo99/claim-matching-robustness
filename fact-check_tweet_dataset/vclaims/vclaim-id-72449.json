Allen Peake, R-Macon, to allow cannabis oil for treatment of certain seizure disorders and other health problems.\n\nBut a second bill to allow vaporized, edible and smokeable marijuana for medical use has prompted new claims about safety problems and other unintended consequences.\n\nChuck Spahos, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys\u2019 Council of Georgia, told a joint legislative committee that no district attorney in the state will prosecute those caught with cannabis oil.\n\nBut he warned lawmakers about smokeable marijuana, saying that Colorado has seen the number of traffic fatalities go up among drivers who test positive for marijuana, at the same time that state\u2019s overall traffic fatality rate declined.\n\n\"Colorado has seen a decrease in traffic fatalities by 14.8 percent between 2007 and 2012,\" Spahos said. \"But it\u2019s up 100 percent for operators who tested positive for marijuana.\"\n\n\"We don\u2019t want to stand in the way of this oil being available,\" he said. \"This is how bad it\u2019s going to be if we let it go too far.\"\n\nSo did medical marijuana really lead to such a dramatic uptick in stoned drivers? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check it out.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s important to understand Colorado\u2019s history on the issue. Voters there approved medical marijuana in its smokeable form in 2000.\n\nBut commercialization of the drug did not really begin until 2009, when federal officials announced they would not seek prosecution of those complying with state medical marijuana laws. Voters approved recreational use of the drug last year.\n\nSo the statistics Spahos referenced covered just before the rapid growth of marijuana dispensaries but before recreational use was permitted.\n\nHe cited an August 2014 report from the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Traffic Area as his source.\n\nThe report is unequivocal. The exact figures cited by Spahos are found in the findings under the report\u2019s section for impaired driving. A chart breaks down the actual numbers:\n\nBased on this report, Spahos\u2019 claim appears accurate. However, there are several complications with the data.\n\nNo one from the RMHIDTA responded to requests for comment. The report cites the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration and its own research for its data.\n\nBut when contacted, a spokesman for the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration referred us back to the Colorado Department of Transportation for the figures, saying each state reports different information. No federal data could confirm the report\u2019s claim.\n\nMeanwhile, the statistics from Colorado\u2019s DOT don\u2019t match the RMHIDTA report. The DOT figures are:\n\nThe DOT figures confirm an overall decrease in traffic fatalities, but show about a 39 percent increase for drivers who tested positive for marijuana. That\u2019s still an increase, but hardly a 100 percent jump.\n\nMore importantly, Colorado DOT spokeswoman Amy Ford said the agency is cautious to use their own data to make any pronouncements.\n\nThat\u2019s because the data is incomplete. Not every driver in a fatal crash is tested for drugs. Colorado law long allowed a conviction based on just drunken driving \u2013 at .08 percent blood alcohol level \u2013 so some agencies never bothered with any additional testing.\n\nThe state only began tracking drugged driving \u2013 driving high \u2013 this year, so there is no historical data to compare, Ford said.\n\n\"We do not draw an incredible amount of conclusions from that data,\" she said.\n\nThe federal data for all states likewise focuses on drunken, not drugged, drivers.\n\nSeveral studies show that marijuana can slow reaction time and similarly impair drivers in much the way alcohol does.\n\nOne study found that dead drivers were three times more likely to test positive for cannabis in 2010 when compared to those who died in 1999.\n\nBut the marijuana will show up longer in blood work and does not appear to increase the chances of a fatal accident as much as booze, according to a 2013 study by researchers at Columbia University.\n\nSo if Georgia were to legalize smoking marijuana, does that mean there would not be a rash of high drivers risking their safety and that of others?\n\nColorado\u2019s research indicates specific drivers \u2013 essentially young men \u2013 are more likely to drive high when the drug is legal. The state has launched a public awareness campaign to the new law that allows police to cite those motorists for driving under the influence, Ford said.\n\nIn other words, there are clear dangers to driving under the influence of marijuana, much as there are for driving intoxicated.\n\nBut while a regional report claims that those risks have led to a 100 percent increase in fatal crashes where the driver tested positive for cannabis, official state figures directly contradict those figures.\n\nSpahos was citing that published report, but the report and figures surrounding the topic are flawed.
