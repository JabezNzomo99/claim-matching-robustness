And then he wrote, \"Ninoy Aquino is not a hero, he died for his ambition. This man has not done anything for the country except to talk, blame and destroy the reputation of President Marcos.\" He said this without attributing it to Salonga.\n\nThis was substantiated by Steve Salonga, who told Rappler through Facebook Messenger that \"[it is] not true for several reasons.\" He said, \"[He] never spoke like that about anyone, even his rivals. He was very fond of Ninoy who he called bunso (youngest sibling). He defended Ninoy in various legal cases throughout their careers. A quick search through newspaper archives (circa 1965-71) would reveal all these facts.\"\n\nWe also asked the Facebook users for the sources of their claim but they have not replied as of this writing. Some of them also deleted their posts after we messaged them.\n\nSalonga was among the respected Filipino politicians who resisted Marcos' Martial Law and was appointed chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government by Cory Aquino to go after the Marcos' ill-gotten wealth. He became Senate president from 1987 to 1991. (READ: Fast Facts: Jovito Salonga) \u2013 Glenda Marie Castro/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
