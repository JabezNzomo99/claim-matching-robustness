The videos have been uploaded and shared by Facebook users, and range from 12 to 18 seconds. One clip shows water splashing through the shoreline, as the people on the coast take pictures and videos. Another clip shows a person swept away by the furious tide. Yet another shows the gushing water dislodging cars on the road.\n\nThe videos have also been posted on Twitter.\n\nAlt News found that the video clips circulated on social media are recent, but do not pertain to Marine Lines, Mumbai. In fact, the video is not from India but from Oman.\n\nAlt News spotted a signboard in one of the video clips which said, \u2018Al Bahri Road\u2019.\n\nWe then Googled \u2018Al Bahri road\u2019. According to the search result, this road is in Muscat, Oman \u2013 a fancy promenade in the capital city, not unlike the Marine Drive of Mumbai.\n\nUsing the keywords \u2018Al Bahri road\u2019 on YouTube, Alt News found a five-minute-long video posted on October 30, 2019, titled, \u2018Latest Kyarr Cyclone II Mathra Corniche Cyclone 2019 II Muscat/Oman\u2019. This video contains the footage which has been shared on social media in the form of short clips. It is from a place on Al Bahri road called \u2018Mutrah Corniche\u2019, a seaward extension of the shore.\n\nIt may be recalled that cyclone Kyarr had formed over the Arabian sea region in October 2019, bringing a mild storm surge and rainfall to the coastal regions of Oman. The cyclone system had subsequently weakened and ceased to be a threat. Alt News also found these video clips posted on social media by West Asian news networks.\n\nVideo clips from Muscat, Oman depicting huge tidal waves lashing the coast, were shared on social media as marine lines in Mumbai.
