This is the highest proportion reporting difficulties to the survey in the past decade. When Lloyds conducted the survey in January the same figure was 31%.\n\nIn comparison, 26% of businesses reported difficulty in recruiting unskilled labour. Again this had increased from January when it was 14%.\n\nThat said, Lloyds also said in their report that \u201ccompanies were the most positive they have been about their overall business prospects since the EU referendum result.\u201d\n\nLloyds told us that businesses weren\u2019t asked why they were experiencing difficulties in hiring staff.\n\nWe haven\u2019t been able to check the methodology directly, as it isn\u2019t published.\n\nBDRC Continental, the company carrying out the survey on behalf of Lloyds, told us that the survey group was representative of the different regions, sectors and sizes of British businesses. Respondents didn\u2019t have to bank with Lloyds to take part. Lloyds told us the businesses were weighted to resemble the composition of all businesses in the UK.\n\nThere are other surveys which have been done that look at businesses recruitment intentions. One of these, by the British Chambers of Commerce, found that these intentions varied depending on the type of business surveyed.\n\nThe BCC found that 21% of around 5,700 businesses surveyed in the service sector expected to increase their workforce over Summer 2017. That\u2019s down from 28% last year.\n\nMeanwhile in the manufacturing sector 29% of 2,000 businesses expected to grow their workforce over the summer, up from 19% last year (based on 2,000 businesses).", "lang": "en"}
