Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: \u2018Snickers\u2019 chocolates are banned in 65 countries and are being destroyed in the video because they cause cancer. Fact: It is an old video. In 2016, \u2018Snickers\u2019 chocolates produced at a Dutch factory were recalled after a piece of plastic was found in one of its chocolates. Also, the video was taken in Gaza in 2016. So, the \u2018Snickers\u2019 chocolates were destroyed in the video because they might have had plastic, not because they cause cancer. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nIn the video posted, it can be seen that the news was reported by \u2018euro news\u2019. So, when searched for that video, it was found that the same video was uploaded by \u2018euro news\u2019 on YouTube in March 2016. The description below the video reads: \u201cAuthorities in Gaza say they have destroyed 15 tonnes of chocolate in response to last month\u2019s mass recall by the manufacturer\u201d. So, when searched for the news on \u2018Mass recall of Snickers\u2019, an article by \u2018Aljazeera\u2019 on this issue can be found. According to the article, \u2018Mars\u2019 and \u2018Snickers\u2019 bars were recalled by the \u2018Mars\u2019 chocolate company after they received a complaint that a piece of plastic was found in a \u2018Snickers\u2019 chocolate produced at its Dutch factory. Talking to AFP News, in 2016, Eline Bijveld (Mars Corporate Affairs Coordinator for the Netherlands) said: \u201cAs far as we know there are 55 countries involved\u2026 recall only involves the products that are made in the Netherlands\u201d.\n\nTo sum it up, \u2018Snickers\u2019 chocolates were destroyed because they might have had plastic, not because they cause cancer.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
