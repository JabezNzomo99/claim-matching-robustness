Ted Cruz criticized Democratic legislators for wanting to \"arrest\" churchgoers but not \"looters.\"\n\nIn early June 2020, social media users began sharing a quote attributed to U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, accusing \u201cauthoritarian Democratic leaders\u201d of failing to punish \u201clooters\u201d while wanting to arrest \u201claw abiding citizens at church,\u201d with some users asking whether he really made the remark:\n\nCruz did in fact make the comment. It is posted to his official Twitter account:\n\nCruz was referring to what he viewed as disproportionately harsh punishment for church parishioners who wanted to attend religious services in person despite stay-at-home measures enacted in April and May 2020 to slow the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. He compared the measures to what he called lenient approaches to violent protests that occurred in late May 2020 in response to the in-custody death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, an unarmed Black man.\n\nVideo of Floyd\u2019s May 25, 2020 death, in which former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck while Floyd pleaded that he couldn\u2019t breathe until he lost consciousness, sparked weeks of nationwide protests marked by widespread violence early on. Thousands of people were arrested nationwide amid resulting protests.", "lang": "en"}
