The attached image contained an abusive word which was highlighted by Gupta in his tweet.\n\nDelhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana also tweeted the same image taking a dig at the AAP chief by addressing him with the abusive word and asking if everyone knew what it meant.\n\nThis image, circulating at least since March 5, has now gone viral on Twitter. Few others on Facebook have also shared the image in a similar manner mocking the Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal for what appeared to be a spelling mistake in the poster.\n\nAlt News found that the photograph viral on social media is photoshopped. On March 5, an individual user quote-tweeted, a tweet by @squintneon, who had posted the original picture of the same poster, sarcastically saying, \u201cThey misspelled ***\u201d.\n\nIn the original poster, it was written, \u201c\u091d\u093e\u095c\u0942 (broom)\u201d. Broom is an election symbol of the Aam Aadmi Party. Comparing the two images in the collage below, the difference between the photoshopped poster and the original poster with the same background can be clearly seen.\n\nTwitter users also challenged Vijender Gupta with a zoomed in version of the image which made it clear that the image he\u2019d posted was a morphed one.\n\nWith elections around the corner, it is not unusual to see a spike in circulation of photoshopped images and doctored videos targeting political opponents. In this case, BJP leaders tweeted a photoshopped image with an abusive word added to an AAP campaign poster to ridicule Arvind Kejriwal.", "lang": "en"}
