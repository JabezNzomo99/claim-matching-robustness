Yesterday, we wrote about Rahul Kanwal\u2019s hypocritical stand wherein he describes Trump\u2019s bigotry as a \u2018dangerous landmine\u2019 but wants people to give Yogi Adityanath \u2018a chance\u2019 and \u2018judge him only for his work\u2019. Following in the footsteps of Rahul Kanwal, now Gaurav Sawant has tried to do his bit by propagandising as to how Yogi Adityanath should be judged only for his actions henceforth.\n\nGaurav Sawant is asking us to forget all of Yogi Adityanath\u2019s \u2018actions\u2019 in the past and only judge him for his \u2018actions\u2019 in the future. He is asking us to forget how Yogi Adityanath said things like \u201cIf \u2018they\u2019 kill one Hindu, we will kill 100 of \u2018theirs'\u201d. Forget how a co-speaker asked for Muslim women to be taken out of graves and raped while Yogi Adityanath was on the stage in a program organised by his organization Hindu Yuva Vahini. Forget how in yet another hate-filled speech, Adityanath said that \u201cIf one Hindu is killed, we will not file an FIR, but kill 10 of \u2018theirs\u2019\u201c. Following Sawant\u2019s effort to ask us to forget all the venom spewed by Yogi Adityanath, he quotes a random Twitter account.\n\nHe claims that whatever this random Twitter account is claiming are \u2018facts on ground\u2019. Moreover, all the real videos that are being posted by people are not \u2018facts on ground\u2019 but just a \u2018narrative\u2019, and apparently a misplaced one at that. Alright, probably we shouldn\u2019t judge when Yogi Adityanath says \u201cIf they take one Hindu girl, we will take 100 Muslim\u2026.\u201d. When Yogi Adityanath claims in a speech that Hindu and Muslim culture cannot co-exist and a religious war is inevitable, it is \u2018just a narrative\u2019 and not a \u2018fact on ground\u2019 about Yogi Adityanath\u2019s real beliefs. Following this a BJP member/supporter\u2019s views are passed off as the general view. Notice the prominent encircled lotus symbol on the person\u2019s shirt.\n\nSo, Gaurav Sawant wants us to believe that the account of one BJP member/supporter and one random Twitter account are \u2018real facts\u2019, all the hate spewed by Yogi Adityanath in speeches after speeches for 15 odd years is just a misconstrued narrative. While Gaurav Sawant and Rahul Kanwal were busy asking us to forget Yogi Adiyatnath\u2019s past, BJP\u2019s social media team in parallel was also trying to do their bit by running copy-paste Twitter trends and trying to project Adityanath as the next \u2018Vikas\u2019 guru in the lines of Narendra Modi. Mission Whitewash Yogi Adityanath is ON.", "lang": "en"}
