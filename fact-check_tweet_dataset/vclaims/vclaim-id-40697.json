It is being shared as \"Sameful delhi police, #IndiaAgainstNRC\". The video is being shared amid the nationwide protests against the Citizen Amendment Act. These protests have led to a reported 25 deaths due to alleged police brutality till December 26. Five of these were reported from Assam, two from Mangaluru and 18 from Uttar Pradesh\n\nBOOM found that the viral video is originally from 2013. An NDTV logo is seen in the top right corner of the video. Using this information and the stills from this video, we did a YouTube search using the terms 'ndtv+police+inspector+slapping+protestor' to find the original clipping.\n\nThe 2:27 video clipping was posted by NDTV on the channel's official Youtube page on April 19, 2013.\n\nAccording to news reports, the video shows a group of protestors gathered at the Swami Dayanand Hospital where a 5 year old rape survivor was admitted.\n\nAssistant Commissioner BS Ahlawat was suspended from duty for slapping the 17-year-old who was protesting along with other women after the victim's father revealed that he had been bribed by the police to hush up the case. The protester allegedly suffered an ear injury after she was assaulted.\n\nAccording to the Times of India, the Aam Aadmi Party had led these protests as they opposed the idea of taking the victim to Swami Dayananad Hospital which they felt was not well equipped to handle the case of the child. The protesters were at the hospital when the then Congress health minister AK Walia and MP Sandeep Dikshit were visiting the family of the the victim.\n\nThe five-year-old minor girl was abducted by her neighbour and subjected to continuous sexual assault. She was shifted from Dayanand Hospital to All India Institute of Medical Sciences on the same night of the protests at Dayanand Hospital.", "lang": "en"}
