In November 2016, Silence Is Consent published a version of the meme which likened \u201cliberals\u201d to \u201cMuslim terrorists.\u201d\n\nIn the spring of 2018, what appears to be a modified version of the meme circulated online, including on the right-wing web site CultureKill.com. In this iteration, the following text is added: \u201cOpenly calling for assassination. Guess what comes next\u2026war.\u201d\n\nIn reality, protesters did not carry a sign which urged \u201cAssassinate Republicans that defeat Democrats.\u201d Both of these inflammatory memes are derived from shoddy image editing of a real photograph from a real protest against Donald Trump that took place in Chicago in March 2016. (The Trump campaign, citing security reasons, cancelled a planned rally in the city on 11 March 2016, in light of a fervent and at times impassioned counterprotest by his opponents.)\n\nThe original photograph can be seen in this report by local Fox affiliate WFLD. The banner actually read \u201cTrump makes America hate, our students make America great.\u201d It bore the insignia of the progressive group MoveOn.org, and \u201cStop Trump Chicago.\u201d\n\nSeveral photographs taken at the counterprotest show the same individuals marching with the same banner:\n\nThe \u201cassassinate Republicans\u201d memes are just two examples of countless efforts during and since the 2016 presidential election to inflame anger and divisiveness using image manipulation, disinformation, and outright propaganda.", "lang": "en"}
