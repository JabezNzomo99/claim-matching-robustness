A rival insurer puts it at \u00a33,897, but the Royal London figure is the one reproduced by the Money Advice Service, which is where Mr Bryant\u2019s office sourced the figure.\n\nThe cost varies in different parts of the country, as well as depending on whether the family wants a burial or cremation and how elaborate the ceremony is.\n\nIt may also be lower in the case of a child. The Child Funeral Charity says that \u201cmany funeral directors, the clergy and most celebrants do not charge fees\u201d for a child\u2019s funeral. But \u201cthere are other funeral related expenses that bereaved parents struggle to find\u201d.\n\nThese might include the burial fees charged by councils. As Mr Bryant says, some don\u2019t charge for the burial of someone under 16. Others do, albeit that there is often a reduced fee in these circumstances.\n\nA government Social Fund Funeral Payments scheme can help to pay for these and other funeral costs. Mr Bryant is correct that it\u2019s means tested\u2014only people who get certain benefits are eligible.\n\nThe average payment under this scheme in 2015/16 was around \u00a31,400, according to the House of Commons Library, which says that \u201cthe adequacy of payments has long been a source of complaint\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
