Michele Bachmann, R-Minn.\n\nPrior to her retirement after the 2014 midterm elections, Bachmann, a social conservative, was known for making controversial statements. So it may not come as a surprise that, more than two years after her retirement, she\u2019s still being used by clickbait purveyors, banking on the anger of liberal social media users.\n\nThe article noted by Facebook users, from the site USPOLN.com, is headlined, \"Bachmann: \u2018White People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery.\u2019 \"\n\nOddly, the words that the headline attributes in quotation marks to Bachmann do not appear in the subsequent article. But the \"quotes\" provided discuss similar themes.\n\nThe article quotes Bachmann as saying, \"I don\u2019t think all of the suffering of African-Americans during the period of slavery can ever equate to what\u2019s been done to white conservative Americans in the past eight years of Obama\u2019s presidency. Because, let\u2019s face it, during that time, we\u2019ve had the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, we\u2019ve had countless terrorist attacks, we\u2019ve had many racial killings and crimes and we\u2019ve had several small-scale revolutions in some of America\u2019s major cities. Is that the legacy President Obama wants to be remembered by? Does he really want to go down in history as the man who created a gap between black people and white people? Judging by his actions during his presidency, I\u2019m guessing he does.\"\n\nBefore we go any further, it would be an opportune time to note that USPOLN.com is, as we have noted previously, contains a disclaimer in the \"about us\" tab that reads, \"USPOLN may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don\u2019t necessarily exist. These articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.\"\n\nIn other words, not a word of this \"story\" should be believed.\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t just fake news. It\u2019s old fake news. (Perhaps the focus on Obama should have been a clue to its timing -- he\u2019s been out of office for six months now.)\n\nWe found that an essentially identical article appeared as early as Aug. 23, 2016, on the website Newslo, which bills itself as a mix of true and fake news. With the click of a button, you can see what\u2019s real and what\u2019s fake.\n\nIf you click on the button, the part about Bachmann\u2019s comments on slavery falls into the \"fake\" category.\n\nMoral of the story: Liberal dislike of Bachmann has survived her retirement so strongly that it is able to carry multiple iterations of clickbait.\n\nThe website USPOLN.com said in a post that Bachmann had said, \"White People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery.\" Not only is USPOLN.com an acknowledged \"satirical\" site, but the post originated in August 2016 on another acknowledged purveyor of articles that it admits are partially fake. We rate the item Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
