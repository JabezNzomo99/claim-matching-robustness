The 2-minute-20-second video shows a man tied to a tree, while others are flogging and kicking him.\n\nSeveral Facebook users have shared the video and blamed the media for fuelling hatred during the coronavirus lockdown. The caption in Hindi along with the video translates to, \"The poison sown by the media is showing up. Hatred at the time of lockdown.\"\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral video is two years old and has nothing to do with the Covid-19 lockdown. This incident took place in March 2018 at Deoria in Uttar Pradesh due to personal enmity. There is no communal angle to the incident.\n\nThe viral video linking it to the Covid-19 lockdown began circulating on Facebook from April 13, 2020. Till the filing of this story, the post was shared more than 5,500 times. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nThis is not the first time this particular video has gone viral. Last year, AFWA had debunked another claim along with the video, saying a Hindu man was thrashed in West Bengal for hoisting a saffron flag.\n\nThe incident took place in Deoria, Uttar Pradesh, in March 2018, following a dispute over money. This was reported in \"The Indian Express\" on March 31, 2018.\n\nAccording to the report, the victim, Shamshad, had lent Rs 1,500 to one Nasir. The two had a quarrel over the money, following which Nasir, along with his friends, assaulted Shamshad. Police had arrested six accused in the case.\n\nNews agency \"ANI\" had also reported the incident.\n\nHence, a two-year-old incident from Uttar Pradesh has been falsely linked to the Covid-19 lockdown with a communal spin", "lang": "en"}
