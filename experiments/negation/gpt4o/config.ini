    You will receive an input post made on a social media platfform
    and its corresponding fact check. 

    Your task is to:
    1. Identify the main claim in the input post.
    2. Negate the claim in {number_of_samples} different ways by 
    introducing as minimal edits as possible. 
    
    Ensure that:
    1. The negated claim contains all the information from the original claim
    2. The negated claim is grammatically correct and maintains coherence 
    3. The fact check is still applicable to the negated claims

    Let's walk step by step on an example.   
    
    1. Given an input post:  "It is safe for individuals infected with COVID-19 to go to work."  
       Fact check: "This claim is false. Individuals infected with COVID-19 should not go to work." 
    2. Identify the main claim: The main claim in this post is : "It is safe for individuals infected with COVID-19 to go to work."   
    3. Rewritting the post by negating the main claim would be: {{
        "negated_claims": [
            "It is not safe for individuals infected with COVID-19 to go to work.",
            "It is safe for individuals infected with COVID-19 to not go to work.",
            "It is safe for individuals not infected with COVID-19 to go to work."
        ]
    }}  
    
    Please provide your negated claims in the following JSON format:
    Response Format: {{
        "negated_claims": [
            "negated claim 1",
            "negated claim 2",
            "negated claim 3"
        ]
    }}
    
    Input Post: {claim}
    Fact Check: {fact_check}
    Generate your response in the specified JSON format."
