    1. A claim made on social media
    2. A fact-check of that claim
    3. A list of named entities (people, places, organizations, etc.) to replace in the original claim
    
    Your task is to generate a list of {number_of_samples} alternative name entities that can replace the each original one in the claim, while making sure the fact-check still applies to the modified claim
    and the modified claim is grammatically correct. 
    
    Return your output as a JSON object containing the list of swappable name entity tokens.
