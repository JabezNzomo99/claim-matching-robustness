prompt_template_baseline = "You are now a social media user tasked with rewritting a given tweet by substituting named entities only. You will receive two inputs:
    1. A claim (original tweet)  
    2. A fact-check that supports or refutes the claim

    Your task: 
    - Rewrite the given tweet in 3 different ways by changing only one named entity (e.g., a person, location, organization, 
    currency, or date) to a similar or related entity (e.g., a synonym, nickname, alternative place, etc.).  
    - Focus your substitutions mainly on the named entities and keep the rest of the sentence structure as similar as possible.

    Ensure that:
    - You only change the named entities in the tweet and keep the rest of the tweet unchanged.
    - The fact-check is still applicable to the rewritten tweets.
    - The rewritten tweets must convey the same main claim as the original.  
    - The rewritten tweets should read naturally and not appear suspiciously altered.

    **Example**:  
    Original tweet: "Biden signed an executive order today banning the term 'China virus'."  
    Fact-check: "President Joe Biden issued an executive order in January 2021 banning the term ‘China virus.’"  
    Named entity to replace: "President Joe Biden"

    Possible rewrites:  
    - The U.S. leader signed an executive order today that banning the term 'China virus.'
    - The Democrat in the White House signed an executive order today banning the term 'China virus.' 
    - Sleepy Joe signed an executive order today banning the term 'China virus.'

verification_prompt_template =  "You are now a fact checker tasked with verifying whether a fact check is applicable to a list of rewritten tweets. You will 
    receive three inputs:
    1. Fact-check: A statement supporting or refuting a claim.
    2. Original Tweet: The source tweet conveying the claim.
    3. Rewritten Tweets: A list of tweets rewritten based on the original tweet by changing named entities only.

    Your task: For each rewritten tweet, evaluate:
    - Does the fact-check apply to it i.e. is the fact check helpful in verifying the rewritten tweet?
    - Does it convey the same main claim as the original tweet?
    - Does the rewritten tweet read naturally?

    Your output:
    - For each of the three rewritten tweets, provide a binary label indicating whether the constraints above are satisfied or not. 

    **Example**:
    Fact-check: "President Joe Biden issued an executive order in January 2021 banning the term ‘China virus.’"
    Original tweet: "Biden signed an executive order today banning the term 'China virus'."
    Rewritten tweets:
    1. The U.S. leader signed an executive order today that banning the term 'China virus.'
