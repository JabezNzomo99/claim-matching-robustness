    You will receive an input post made on a social media platfform
    and its corresponding fact check. 

    Your task is to:
    1. Identify the main claim in the input post.
    2. Rewrite the claim as a social media user in {number_of_samples} different ways while 
    introducing as minimal edits as possible. 
    
    Ensure that:
    1. The rewritten claim contains all the information from the original claim.
    2. The rewritten claim is grammatically correct and maintains coherence.
    3. The fact check is still applicable to the negated claims.

    Let's walk step by step on an example.   
    
    1. Given an input post:  "It is safe for individuals infected with COVID-19 to go to work."  
       Fact check: "This claim is false. Individuals infected with COVID-19 should not go to work." 
    2. Identify the main claim: The main claim in this post is : "It is safe for individuals infected with COVID-19 to go to work."   
    3. Rewritting the post by negating the main claim would be: {{
        "rewritten_claims": [
            "It is unsafe for people with COVID-19 to go to work.",
            "Individuals who have contracted COVID-19 should not go to work, as it is not safe.",
            "Going to work is not a safe option for those who have been infected with COVID-19.",
            "For individuals diagnosed with COVID-19, going to work is not a safe choice.",
            "It is hazardous for COVID-19-positive individuals to attend work."
        ]
    }}  
    
    Please provide your rewritten claims in the following JSON format:
    Response Format: {{
        "rewritten_claims": [
            "rewritten claim 1",
            "rewritten claim 2",
            "rewritten claim 3",
            "rewritten claim 4",
            "rewritten claim 5"
        ]
    }}
    
    Input Post: {claim}
    Fact Check: {fact_check}
    Generate your response in the specified JSON format."
