prompt_template = "You are now a social media user tasked with rewritting a given tweet in different ways. You will receive two inputs:
    1. A claim (original tweet)  
    2. A fact-check that supports or refutes the claim

    Your task: 
    - Rewrite the tweet in {number_of_samples} different ways while introducing as minimal edits as possible.

    Ensure that:
    - The fact-check is still applicable to the rewritten tweets.
    - The rewritten tweets must convey the same main claim as the original.  
    - The rewritten tweets should read naturally and not appear suspiciously altered.

    **Example**:  
    Original tweet: "Biden signed an executive order today banning the term 'China virus'."  
    Fact-check: "President Joe Biden issued an executive order in January 2021 banning the term ‘China virus.’"  
 
    Possible rewrites:  
    - "President Biden officially signed an executive order today prohibiting the use of the term 'China virus.'"
    - "Biden's executive order today included a ban on the term 'China virus."
    - "The term 'China virus' has been banned under a new executive order signed by Biden today."
    - "Today, Biden signed an executive order prohibiting the phrase 'China virus."
    - "Biden's executive order banning the term 'China virus' was signed today."
    
    Response Format:
    Rewritten Tweet 1: [Your first rewritten version]
    Rewritten Tweet 2: [Your second rewritten version]
    Rewritten Tweet 3: [Your third rewritten version]
    Rewritten Tweet 4: [Your fourth rewritten version]
    Rewritten Tweet 5: [Your fifth rewritten version]
    
    Inputs:
    Tweet: {claim}
    Fact Check: {fact_check}
    Generate your response in the specified string format."

verification_prompt_template =  "You are now a fact checker tasked with verifying whether a fact check is applicable to a list of rewritten tweets. You will 
    receive three inputs:
    1. Fact-check: A statement supporting or refuting a claim.
    2. Original Tweet: The source tweet conveying the claim.
    3. Rewritten Tweets: A list of tweets rewritten based on the original tweet.

    Your task: For each rewritten tweet, evaluate:
    - Does the fact-check apply to it i.e. is the fact check helpful in verifying the rewritten tweet?
    - Does it convey the same main claim as the original tweet?
    - Does the rewritten tweet read naturally?

    Your output:
    - For each of the three rewritten tweets, provide a binary label indicating whether the constraints above are satisfied or not. 

    **Example**:
    Fact-check: "President Joe Biden issued an executive order in January 2021 banning the term ‘China virus.’"
    Original tweet: "Biden signed an executive order today banning the term 'China virus'."  

    Rewritten tweets:  
    - "President Biden officially signed an executive order today prohibiting the use of the term 'China virus.'"
    - "Biden's executive order today included a ban on the term 'China virus."
    - "The term 'China virus' has been banned under a new executive order signed by Biden today."
    - "Today, Biden signed an executive order prohibiting the phrase 'China virus."
    - "Biden's executive order banning the term 'Bejing virus' was signed today."
