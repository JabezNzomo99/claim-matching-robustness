prompt_template = "You are now a social media user tasked with rewritting a given tweet in different English dialects. You will receive two inputs:
    1. A claim (original tweet)  
    2. A fact-check that supports or refutes the claim

    Your task: 
    - Rewrite the given tweet in as many different ways by using African American Vernacular English, 
    Nigerian Pidgin English, Singlish (Singapore English) and Jamaican Patois.

    Ensure that:
    - The fact-check is still applicable to the rewritten tweets.
    - The rewritten tweets must convey the same main claim as the original.  
    - The rewritten tweets should read naturally and not appear suspiciously altered.

    **Example**:  
    Original tweet: "Biden signed an executive order today banning the term 'China virus'."  
    Fact-check: "President Joe Biden issued an executive order in January 2021 banning the term ‘China virus.’"  

    Possible rewrites:  
    - Biden done signed an order today, no more sayin’ ‘China virus.’
    - Biden don sign executive order today, e no go dey call am ‘China virus’ again.
    - Wah, Biden just sign order today, cannot call ‘China virus’ liao.
    - Biden sign one order today, fi stop di use a ‘China virus.’
    
    Response Format:
    Rewritten Tweet 1: [Your first rewritten version]
    Rewritten Tweet 2: [Your second rewritten version]
    Rewritten Tweet 3: [Your third rewritten version]
    Rewritten Tweet 4: [Your fourth rewritten version]
    ... (and so on)
    
    Inputs:
    Tweet: {claim}
    Fact Check: {fact_check}
    Generate your response in the specified string format."
    
verification_prompt_template =  "You are now a fact checker tasked with verifying whether a fact check is applicable to a list of rewritten tweets. You will 
    receive three inputs:
    1. Fact-check: A statement supporting or refuting a claim.
    2. Original Tweet: The source tweet conveying the claim.
    3. Rewritten Tweets: A list of tweets rewritten based on the original tweet by rewriting it in different English dialects.

    Your task: For each rewritten tweet, evaluate:
    - Does the fact-check apply to it i.e. is the fact check helpful in verifying the rewritten tweet?
    - Does it convey the same main claim as the original tweet?
    - Does the rewritten tweet feel like something a typical social media user might write?

    Your output:
    - For each of the three rewritten tweets, provide a binary label indicating whether the constraints above are satisfied or not. 

    **Example**:
    Fact-check: "President Joe Biden issued an executive order in January 2021 banning the term ‘China virus.’"
    Original tweet: "Biden signed an executive order today banning the term 'China virus'."
    Rewritten tweets:
    - Biden done signed an order today, no more sayin’ ‘China virus.’
    - Biden don sign executive order today, e no go dey call am ‘China virus’ again.
    - Wah, Biden just sign order today, cannot call ‘China virus’ liao.
    - Biden sign one order today, fi stop di use a 'Bejing virus.’
