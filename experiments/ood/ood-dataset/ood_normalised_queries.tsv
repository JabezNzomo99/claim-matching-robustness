By 2020, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP government, a new Parliament House was constructed with an area of 65,000 square meters at a cost of ₹970 crore.

704,739	On June 16, 2013, a severe flood occurred in Kedarnath, Uttarakhand, causing significant destruction and casualties. Allegedly, 25,000 pilgrims died, and the Congress Government did not take immediate action to rescue the trapped pilgrims. It is claimed that the international community only became aware of the disaster after three days, prompting the Congress Government to announce assistance.

Tensions on the Anglo-Scottish border led to a military build-up by both sides in 1355. In September, a nine-month truce was agreed upon, and most of the English forces departed for northern France to participate in a campaign during the concurrent Hundred Years' War. Shortly after the truce was agreed, the Scots, encouraged and subsidised by the French, violated it by invading and devastating Northumberland. In late December, the Scots escalated their efforts by capturing the important English-held border town of Berwick-on-Tweed and laying siege to its castle. The English army redeployed from France to Newcastle in northern England.

*Know Christian Leaders of India*  
(Hidden under the guise of Hindu name) 

Arvind Kejriwal is not a Hindu but a Crypto Christian.  He got converted to Christianity while working with Mother Teresa. He was also allowed to go to that part of the Vatican, where only Christians can go. When Mother Teresa was being given the title of saint,  then the Vatican had invited only Arvind Kejriwal from among the Chief Ministers of the whole of India.

 The word 'crypto' in Greek means hidden or secret. ""Crypto Christian"" means Secret-Christian...!  The important aspects in this are:

 * Crypto-christian is not an abusive or negative word. Crypto-Christianity is an institutional practice of Christianity in a country in which Christians live under the basic principle of crypto-Christianity.  There they worship the God of that country as a show, follow the religion that country which is their camouflage.  But in reality they are Christians inside and continue to preach Christianity continuously.

 * The earliest examples of crypto Christians are found in the Roman Empire  when Christianity had set its feet in Rome in the early stages.  The great Roman emperor Trajan immediately saw Christianity as a threat to Roman culture as many Romans had become Christians. He  proposed to them, ""either leave Christianity or suffer the death penalty"".  Roman Christians pretended to leave Christianity to avoid the death penalty.  And after that they continued to worship Roman Gods and Goddesses superficially.  But they believed in Christianity from inside.  

*  This is similar to the Muslims when they are 5-10 percent.  Then follow the laws of that country.  But when they are 20-30 percent,  the demand for Shariat begins.  Riots happen.  Ethnic cleansing of non-Muslims starts as the population increases further.

 * But crypto Christians do not commit violence like Muslims.  When Crypto Christian is less than 1 percent, he keeps doing his work by adopting the God of that country.  As and when they become more in number, they start insulting the same deities.  Hollywood's famous film Agora (2009) every Hindu must see. It shows, how when crypto Christians became more in number in Rome, they started insulting Roman Gods and Goddesses. 

* At present, in India also crypto Christians have taken hold.  So, here also the work of abusing Hindu deities, Brahmins has started. Means, the work which happened 2000 years ago in Europe is happening today in India. 

* Recently  Professor Kedar Mandal called Goddess Durga as a prostitute. 

 * There are many such crypto -Christians in India.  They are amongst us, wearing the mask of secularism, leftism and Buddhism.  The Christian population in India is officially 20 million.  And it will not be surprising if 100 million Christians come out in India.  The estimated Christian population in Punjab alone is above 10 percent.  Many Christians of Punjab are under the camouflage of Sikhism, wear a turban.  They also wear beard, kirpan, kada, and follow Sikhism.  But they are all secret-Christians.

 * Many crypto-Christians have Hindu names to take reservation.  In these, the names of many are on Gods like Ram, Krishna, Shiva, Durga etc., whom even the people of the Sangh cannot understand as non-Hindu even in dreams. 
 
* Former President
 K R Narayanan was a crypto-christian, who was a Dalit throughout his life for receiving all the benefits of reservation.  And when he died, we saw the process of burial according to Christianity.  

* So understood that this is crypto-Christian.  There are many such crypto-Christians in the country.  Those who are only increasing the agenda of Vatican by attacking Hinduism in Hindu names. We see such crypto-Christians every day in everyday life.  But they can't be understood as they hide under the camouflage of Hindu names.  

 * Congress leader  Ambika Soni, who described Shri Ram as fictional, is a crypto Christian. Most of NDTV's staff are crypto-Christians.

* The Naxalites with Hindu names who ki--Message truncated--"

The petition argues that loudspeakers violate the fundamental right to privacy by encroaching on a person's ""right to be left alone and spatial control."" The petition also claims that loudspeakers are not intrinsic to any religion, as they have existed for less than 100 years, while religions are much older. It cites a Supreme Court verdict stating that no religion requires forcing the unwilling to listen to expressions of religious beliefs and relies on the Supreme Court's privacy judgment to support the argument that loudspeakers breach the right to privacy."

921,915	In the future, there will be no BJP, DMC, Congress, or Left Front in India. Islam is the second-largest religion in India. Professor Nasir bin Sulaiman ul Omar from Saudi Arabia states that India is in a deep sleep, with Islam growing rapidly and many Muslims infiltrating the police, army, and bureaucracy. About 65,000 babies are born every day in India, with approximately 40,000 being Muslim children and 25,000 being Hindu and children of other religions. This suggests that Muslims will become the majority in India by 2050. The message warns that India will become a Muslim country, leading to riots and the end of Hindus, and claims that government figures underestimate the Muslim population. It argues that secularism in India is a fraud and that Hindus are unaware of their impending minority status. The message also suggests that Muslim-majority areas in India and other countries have become Islamic states, leading to violence, and accuses Muslims of conspiring against non-Muslims.

I saw at least one tweet today wishing Firoz a good life ahead."

1,291,132	Yesterday, the Supreme Court established a committee to create an All India Organization of taxpayers, which will be the largest organization of its kind globally. Regardless of which government is in power, no free electricity, free water, free distributions, or loan waivers can be announced without the approval of this organization, as the funds come from taxpayers. Taxpayers should have the right to oversee the use of their money. Political parties often entice the public with freebies for votes, but the government should present blueprints of any proposed schemes and obtain consent from this organization. This should also apply to the salaries of MPs and MLAs and other benefits they receive. Is democracy limited to just voting? What rights do taxpayers have beyond that? Taxpayers should have the right to hold MPs and MLAs accountable and initiate disciplinary action against them for disrupting parliamentary proceedings, as they are 'servants' paid by taxpayers. The right to recall any such 'freebies' should also be implemented soon. If you agree, please share this message widely.

They have been hospitalized. Cyrus Mistry and Jahangir Binshah Pandole, who were in the rear seat without seat belts, died at the scene.

1,552,553	International news reports that the COVID-19 epidemic has become serious again in the United States, prompting experts to emphasize two key points. First, the Omicron variant does not confer immunity, meaning reinfection is possible. Second, the concept of coexisting with the virus is incorrect according to experts. People are advised to strengthen epidemic prevention measures, as the virus can unpredictably change within the human body. The virus has mutated, and the vaccine has not been updated, reducing its protective efficacy. Consequently, receiving three doses may not prevent diagnosis, severe illness, or death. It is important to protect oneself from infection to maintain health. There is a global need for caution. The new COVID-Omicron BA.4, an extension of the BA.5 variant, is reportedly more deadly and difficult to detect. Its symptoms include joint pain, headache, neck and upper back pain, pneumonia, and a general lack of appetite, without the typical cough or fever. This variant is said to be five times more virulent than Delta, with a higher mortality rate. It progresses rapidly to severe illness, often without obvious symptoms. Unlike previous strains, it does not settle in the nasopharynx but directly affects the lungs. Nasal swab tests frequently yield false negatives, allowing the virus to spread in the community and cause viral pneumonia and acute respiratory stress. To protect against this virulent strain, it is recommended to avoid crowded places, maintain a distance of 1.5 meters even outdoors, wear a double-layer mask, and wash hands frequently. This wave of COVID-Omicron is considered deadlier than the initial COVID-19 wave, necessitating strict preventive measures. Sharing this information with family and friends is encouraged.
1,623,846	In Singapore, everyone is advised to wear a mask because the new COVID-Omicron XBB variant is different, deadly, and not easily detected. The symptoms include joint pain, headache, neck pain, upper back pain, pneumonia, and loss of appetite, without typical symptoms like cough and fever. COVID-Omicron XBB is reportedly five times more toxic than the Delta variant and has a higher mortality rate. It affects the lungs directly and can lead to viral pneumonia and acute respiratory stress. Nasal swab tests may show false negatives. People are advised to avoid crowded places, maintain a distance of 1.5 meters even in open spaces, wear a double-layer mask, and wash hands frequently. This strain is considered deadlier than the first wave of COVID-19, so enhanced precautions are necessary. Share this information with friends and family.

1,780,320	After I was appointed Air Chief in 2008, I discovered that the Daulat Beg Air Base project had been stalled for 43 years. When we inquired about the situation, we were told that our leaders would not approve the airbase because they feared China. Despite an annual budget allocation, the Army did not receive the funds. I proceeded to build the air base without informing the government or then Defense Minister A.K. Antony. The Indian government only learned of its completion when China informed them. Subsequently, Finance Minister P. Chidambaram apologized to China, promising not to use the air base. I faced repercussions for leading and completing the project. Today, the air base is highly beneficial for India and is utilized by the current government. The Modi Government is now undertaking projects that previous administrations could not, such as building roads and bridges on the borders with China and Pakistan. Currently, China fears India due to the strength of India's military and other capabilities, all made possible by Prime Minister Modi's strong leadership and support.

Rajan highlights India's significant progress over the last 70 years, achieved by all Prime Ministers, resulting in India becoming a global power. He notes that many achievements, such as winning the war against Pakistan, establishing a strong constitution, building infrastructure like the Bhakra Nangal Canal, opening the Nuclear Research Centre, and starting institutions like AIIMS and IIT, occurred before Modi's time.

1,987,058	Dear Sir/Madam, I am Maher Ali Rusho from Bangladesh. I have some questions regarding the verified signatories of IFCN Fact-Checking Organizations. Could you please provide answers, as I am conducting investigations into the ethics and policies of fact-checking organizations? Many companies and individuals have asked me questions that I cannot answer without your reference. I believe you can provide insightful information to inform the public about the policies and ethics of your verified signatory organizations. I await your response. Question 1: Can a senior fact-checker and author of a fact-checking report in a verified signatory organization of your esteemed entity write and attach comments that are attacking, disrespectful, or verbally abusive towards individuals on social media profiles? Question 2: If numerous authorized peer-reviewed news reports state that John Doe completed his master's degree in physics from Harvard University and is pursuing a Ph.D. at MIT, but a reporter mistakenly says he is pursuing a Ph.D. at Harvard, will this be considered a rumor by a senior fact-checker, given the 'slip of tongue' and the report's lack of virality? Question 3: Can a fact-checking organization claim to be a verified signatory of your organization and be recognized by your organization on their Wikipedia page and website during the renewal process? Question 4: If a news channel named 'XYZ' publishes a 30-minute interview with a distinguished achiever, deletes it due to authentication issues, and republishes an edited 18-minute version, can a fact-checker claim it is still spreading rumors, even though the original video has been officially removed and replaced? I need to ensure the public is informed about the policies and ethics of your verified signatory organizations and the quality of fact-checking organizations.

1,994,899	Many pensioners do not file income tax returns, believing they can claim the senior citizenship rebate by signing Form 16 at the bank. However, by not filing a zero tax return, they miss out on a significant benefit. Important information indicates that filing income tax returns can greatly benefit the family of a pensioner in the event of the pensioner's accidental death. According to Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and a Supreme Court judgment (Civil Appeal No. 9858 of 2013), the family of a pensioner who dies in an accident is entitled to receive ten times the average income of the last three years, provided the pensioner had filed income tax returns for those years. For example, if a pensioner's monthly pension is 25,000 rupees, resulting in an annual income of 300,000 rupees, the family would receive 3,000,000 rupees. No proof other than income tax returns will be accepted by the court. Therefore, regularly filing income tax returns can provide substantial economic relief to the pensioner's family in the event of an accidental death. Failure to file due to a lack of awareness of this benefit can lead to a significant financial loss for the family.

2,202,287	"Dr. Srinivas, a Medical Director at a Pharmaceutical company, claims that EMRI results indicate a majority of heart attack victims are under 50 years old, and attributes this to the consumption of palm oil. He argues that palm oil is more dangerous than alcohol and smoking combined, and that India is the largest importer of palm oil. He warns that palm oil is prevalent in fast food, biscuits, and chocolates in India, unlike in Western countries where different oils are used. Dr. Srinivas suggests that palm oil consumption leads to inappropriate fat accumulation around the heart and early onset diabetes, contributing to heart disease. He states that the ""Palm Oil mafia"" promotes junk food consumption over fruits and vegetables, which are heart-protective. He urges consumers to check product labels for palm oil and avoid it, and mentions efforts to petition the Prime Minister and gather support from doctors across India to address this issue.

2,445,212	If Mr. Modi had not served three terms as the Chief Minister of Gujarat and two terms as the Prime Minister of India, would Adani be in his current position today? As a Chartered Accountant who has audited many large companies and scrutinised many significant contracts, I can answer this question: There are major companies like L&T, Reliance, Tatas, Birlas, etc., and the Adani Group is one among them, performing well against tough competition from these giants. Even the Comptroller and Auditor General did not find any fault in their successful bidding and awarding of large contracts. Their track record of completing contracts ahead of schedule with satisfactory quality is reasonably good. Please consider the following points: Are you aware that the Adani Group pays taxes of more than ₹50,000 crores annually to the country? Are you aware that the company pays salaries amounting to more than ₹20,000 crores every month, supporting the livelihoods of millions of families? Are you aware of how many subcontractors and intermediaries benefit through the Adani Group? Are you aware of the vast infrastructure developed by the Adani Group, not only in India but worldwide? They have been taking loans from banks for about 40 years, paying interest, repaying the full loan, and taking new loans for new business opportunities. All loans and finances taken from banks are backed by adequate guarantees and collateral for the banks' safety. How have political leaders like the Congress and communists, who are raising concerns about Adani, received interest-free loans from banks? Has anyone questioned the Congress leader's brother-in-law, Vadra, who started his business with a paid-up capital of ₹1 lakh 15 years ago, and now owns hotels and properties worth several crores, including land and real estate in London? Has anyone questioned how he acquired such wealth, reportedly making the family one of the richest in the world? As long as the Adani Group contributes to infrastructure development and welfare activities for the country, operates honestly, and provides employment opportunities, we should not be concerned even if there is any favoritism, as it is favoritism towards a competent person or company.

2,637,461	Bishwajit Bhattacharyya, former Additional Solicitor General and Senior Advocate, has commented on the 2024/25 Union Budget presented by the Finance Minister. The budgeted expenditure is Rs.47.65 trillion, with Rs.34.17 trillion allocated for non-development expenses such as interest payments, government establishment costs, defense, subsidies, grants for capital assets, and pensions. This leaves Rs.13.48 trillion for developmental expenditure, with Rs.11.11 trillion earmarked for infrastructure, resulting in only Rs.2.37 trillion for other developmental activities, which is just 0.72% of the projected GDP of Rs.327 trillion for 2024/25. The interest payment liability is Rs.11.90 trillion, exceeding the capital expenditure on infrastructure. The government’s interest liability has increased by 10.18% from the previous year. India's internal and external debt has risen by Rs.15 trillion, and interest liability on this debt is Rs.11.90 trillion. Bhattacharyya suggests the need to reduce government establishment expenditure, which is at a record Rs.7.68 trillion, and questions the inequity in tax revenue, where personal income tax is budgeted to increase by 28.5% to Rs.11.56 trillion, compared to a 13% increase in corporate tax to Rs.10.42 trillion. He highlights the budgeted debt-to-GDP ratio of 56% as concerning and calls for accountability in government spending.

It highlights India's diverse and democratic ethos, where over 700 million people vote, directing their ancient civilization into the future. Despite challenges from neighboring countries like Pakistan, China, and Burma, and issues such as development and terrorism, India remains a thriving nation. It is home to multiple religions and cultures, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, and the second-largest Muslim population. Christianity has existed there for 2000 years, and it hosts the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government in exile. The country has a rich history of welcoming diverse communities, including Jews, Zoroastrians, Armenians, and Syrians. The OECD noted its historical economic prominence. India has elected three Muslim Presidents, a Sikh Prime Minister, and a Catholic Italian woman as the head of the ruling party. Its booming economy lifts millions out of poverty annually, with a growing middle class expected to match the US population by 2025. India's optimism is reflected in its culture, economy, and politics, making it an inspiration to the world.

Similarly, a fee of ₹34 crore was paid to Abhishek Singhvi for the Kejriwal bail case, which the LG initially stopped, stating that public money cannot be used for personal crimes. However, the Supreme Court later directed the Delhi LG to release the lawyer's payment while ordering Kejriwal's bail. This is described as a scam involving taxpayer money by Kejriwal, his lawyer, and the judiciary. Questions are raised about the lack of checks on judicial crimes and the accountability of judges.

2,860,435	When Nalanda University was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday, it is important to remember its history under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during the UPA era. In 2007, the UPA government inaugurated Nalanda University in Bihar, appointing Amartya Sen as the first Chancellor. He was granted extensive autonomy, including financial independence without accountability to the government, drawing a salary of ₹ 5 lakh per month, and enjoying unlimited foreign travel allowances at the taxpayers' expense. During his tenure from 2007 to 2014, ₹ 2730 crore was spent on the university, which was not fully functional. Sen's appointments included individuals with personal connections to former PM Manmohan Singh, such as his daughter Dr. Upinder Singh and associates. Despite the high expenditure, the university had minimal infrastructure and faculty. When Narendra Modi became aware of these issues, he removed Amartya Sen from his position in 2015 and annulled his appointments. The lack of accountability was due to the regulations set by the UPA government, protecting Sen from legal repercussions despite allegations of misuse of funds.

Additionally, the CBI has arrested Jamaluddin Ansari, a journalist from Prabhat Khabar, in relation to the NEET-UG paper leak.

2,873,945	The family of Major Anuj Sood was denied benefits by the Maharashtra Government.
2,876,328	Major Anuj Sood, who had been living in Pune with his family since 2005, was martyred on May 2, 2020, during an operation against terrorists in Handwara, Kupwara district of Jammu and Kashmir. At the age of 30, he sacrificed his life for the country and was posthumously awarded the Shaurya Chakra for his bravery. However, the state government denied his wife the benefits and allowances typically given to the families of martyred soldiers, citing their original residence in another state despite living in Maharashtra for over 15 years. In response, Major Sood’s wife approached the Bombay High Court, which expressed dissatisfaction with the government's policy and urged it to consider the case as a special matter. Despite this, the Shinde government delayed action, citing policy decisions, prompting the court to instruct the Chief Minister to either make a decision or state his inability to do so in an affidavit. Eventually, under significant court pressure, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde approved the case as a special matter. The situation highlights the inconsistency in the government's actions, as it recently awarded 11 crore rupees to Team India's players without questioning their state of origin, while making the family of a martyred soldier fight for their rightful entitlements.
