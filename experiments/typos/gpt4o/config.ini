prompt_template = "You are now a social media user tasked with rewritting a given tweet by introducing common typos and social media abbreviations. You will receive two inputs:
    1. A claim (original tweet)  
    2. A fact-check that supports or refutes the claim

    Your task:
    - Rewrite the tweet by introducing common typos and social media abbreviations to the given tweet.

    Ensure that:
    - The fact-check is still applicable to the rewritten tweets.
    - The rewritten tweets must convey the same main claim as the original.  
    - The rewritten tweets should feel natural, not overly altered or fake.

    **Example**:  
    Original tweet: "Biden signed an executive order today banning the term 'China virus'."  
    Fact-check: "President Joe Biden issued an executive order in January 2021 banning the term ‘China virus.’" 
    Possible rewrites:  
    - Bden signz exe order 2day banning "China virus."
    - Biden sighned EO banning da term "China virus"!!
    - Prez Biden bans "China virus" in new order issued 2day.
    - Excutive order by Biden bans term "China virus" frm now on.
    - Biden just banned "China virus" frm being used!
    
    Response Format:
    Rewritten Tweet 1: [Your first rewritten version]
    Rewritten Tweet 2: [Your second rewritten version]
    Rewritten Tweet 3: [Your third rewritten version]
    Rewritten Tweet 4: [Your fourth rewritten version]
    Rewritten Tweet 5: [Your fifth rewritten version]
    
    Inputs:
    Tweet: {claim}
    Fact Check: {fact_check}
    Generate your response in the specified string format."

verification_prompt_template =  "You are now a fact checker tasked with verifying whether a fact check is applicable to a list of rewritten tweets. You will 
    receive three inputs:
    1. Fact-check: A statement supporting or refuting a claim.
    2. Original Tweet: The source tweet conveying the claim.
    3. Rewritten Tweets: A list of tweets rewritten based on the original tweet introducing typos and common social media abbreviations.

    Your task: For each rewritten tweet, evaluate:
    - Does the fact-check apply to it i.e. is the fact check helpful in verifying the rewritten tweet?
    - Does it convey the same main claim as the original tweet?
    - Does the rewritten tweet feel like something a typical social media user might write, even with typos or abbreviations?

    Your output:
    - For each of the three rewritten tweets, provide a binary label indicating whether the constraints above are satisfied or not. 

    **Example**:  
    Original tweet: "Biden signed an executive order today banning the term 'China virus'."  
    Fact-check: "President Joe Biden issued an executive order in January 2021 banning the term ‘China virus.’"  

    Possible rewrites:

    - Excutive order by Biden bans term "China virus" frm now on.
