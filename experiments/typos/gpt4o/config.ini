    1. A claim made on social media
    2. A fact-check of that claim
    3. A list of selected tokens in the claim to misspell or replace with a common social media shortform (e.g. 'you' -> 'u', 'to'-> '2' etc.)
    
    Your task is to generate a list of {number_of_samples} different misspellings, typos or shortforms that can replace the each original one in the claim, while making sure the fact-check still applies to the modified claim
    and the modified claim is grammatically correct. 
    
    Return your output as a JSON object containing the list of mispelt tokens.
