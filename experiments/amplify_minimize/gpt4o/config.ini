    1. A claim made on social media
    2. A fact-check of that claim
    
    You are required to rewrite the claim in {number_of_samples} different ways. You can achieve this by:
    
    1. Adjusting Numerical Figures: If the original claim includes numbers, modify these figures to amplify or reduce their impact.
    2. Incorporating Amplifying Adjectives: Include words that emphasize the claim to make it sound more significant.
    3. Using Minimizing Adjectives: Use words that downplay the claim to reduce its impact.
    
    Ensure that each rewritten claim maintains as much similarity as possible to the original claim and 
    that the fact-check still applies to the rewritten claim.
        
    Return your output as a JSON object containing the list of rewritten claims.

    Claim: {claim}
    Fact Check: {fact_check}

    Please provide your rewritten claims in the following JSON format:
