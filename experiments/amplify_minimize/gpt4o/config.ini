prompt_template = "You are now a social media user tasked with rewritting a given tweet in different ways. You will receive two inputs:
    1. A claim (original tweet)  
    2. A fact-check that supports or refutes the claim

    Your task: 
    Rewrite the tweet in {number_of_samples} different ways, ensuring the fact-check remains applicable and the core meaning of the claim is preserved. You can achieve this by introducing minimal edits, such as:
    1. Adjusting Numerical Figures:
        - Increase or decrease numbers to amplify or minimize the perceived impact.
        - Ensure the revised figures are consistent with the fact-check.
    2. Adding Amplifying Words, Phrases oe Expressive Markers to make the claim sound more sensational or impactful:
        - Use adjectives (e.g., shocking, unbelievable, incredible).
        - Include urgency phrases (e.g., "Breaking news: ..., "Experts warn that ..., "Did you know that ...").
        - Use expressive markers 
            - Repeated Characters: ("Sooo important!!!")
            - Excessive Punctuation: ("Can you believe this???!!!")
            - Hyperbolic Phrases: ("This will change EVERYTHING!")
            - Emoji Usage: ("Unbelievable! ðŸ˜±ðŸ”¥")
    3. Using Minimizing Words or Phrases to downplay the claim:
        - Include words or phrases like "reportedly, believed to be, might, could be."
        - Use neutral or understated language to reduce impact (e.g., "Some suggest that ..., "It is thought that ..., "In most cases, ...").


    Ensure that:
    - The fact-check is still applicable to the rewritten tweets.
    - The rewritten tweets must convey the same main claim as the original.  
    - The rewritten tweets should read naturally and not appear suspiciously altered.

    **Example**:  
    Original tweet: "The lifetime of SARS-CoV-2 is 12 hours."
    Fact-check: ""Scientists found that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can be detected in aerosols for up to three hours and on plastic and stain-
    less steel surfaces for up to three days."" 

    Possible rewrites:  
    - "The lifetime of SARS-CoV-2 is shockingly shortâ€”just 12 hours!"
    - "Did you know SARS-CoV-2 might last for just 2 hours?! ðŸ˜±"
    - "SARS-CoV-2 reportedly doesnâ€™t last very longâ€”about 12 hours."
    - "The virus SARS-CoV-2 has been described as lasting an entire day!"
    - "This just in: the virus SARS-CoV-2 reportedly lives no more than 12 hours"
    
    Response Format:
    Rewritten Tweet 1: [Your first rewritten version]
    Rewritten Tweet 2: [Your second rewritten version]
    Rewritten Tweet 3: [Your third rewritten version]
    Rewritten Tweet 4: [Your fourth rewritten version]
    Rewritten Tweet 5: [Your fifth rewritten version]
    
    Inputs:
    Tweet: {claim}
    Fact Check: {fact_check}
    Generate your response in the specified string format."

verification_prompt_template =  "You are now a fact checker tasked with verifying whether a fact check is applicable to a list of rewritten tweets. You will 
    receive three inputs:
    1. Fact-check: A statement supporting or refuting a claim.
    2. Original Tweet: The source tweet conveying the claim.
    3. Rewritten Tweets: A list of tweets rewritten based on the original tweet by amplifying or downplaying the claim.

    Your task: For each rewritten tweet, evaluate:
    - Does the fact-check apply to it i.e. is the fact check helpful in verifying the rewritten tweet?
    - Does it convey the same main claim as the original tweet?
    - Does the rewritten tweet feel like something a typical social media user might write?

    Your output:
    - For each of the three rewritten tweets, provide a binary label indicating whether the constraints above are satisfied or not. 

    **Example**:
    Fact-check: "Scientists found that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can be detected in aerosols for up to three hours and on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to three days."
    Original tweet: "The lifetime of SARS-CoV-2 is 12 hours."

    Rewritten tweets:  
    - "SARS-CoV-2 reportedly doesnâ€™t last very longâ€”about 12 hours."
    - "The virus flu has been described as lasting an entire day!"
    - "This just in: the virus SARS-CoV-2 reportedly lives no more than 12 hours"

    Output:
    {{
        "labels": [1, 0, 1]
    }}

    Inputs:
    Fact Check: {fact_check}
    Original Tweet: {claim}
    Rewritten Tweets: {rewrites}
    Generate your response in the specified JSON format."
